'Should school start at 10am? How I got MPs to debate it'," By Jon Kelly It was October 2018, late in the morning, deep into the school term, and Hannah Kidner sat in a classroom looking at her laptop. Hannah was 16, studying for her A-levels, and her politics teacher had just set an assignment - start an online petition on a subject you care about. As it happened, therewassomething that had been bothering her. She began typing: “School should start at 10am as teenagers are too tired.” Hannah certainly was. In fact, she was exhausted. That morning, in a farmhouse in a remote valley on Dartmoor, her alarm had started buzzing at 6.15am. It went off early so her mum could drive her to a nearby town in time to catch a 7.20am bus, which then trundled along Devon roads for an hour and a quarter before finally dropping her at school in Tiverton. Sometimes on her daily commute, as the Sun rose over the fields outside, she’d manage to shut her eyes for a while. But even when she did, and no matter how early she’d gone to bed the night before, she’d arrive for lessons feeling as though she’d barely had a couple of hours’ rest. Earlier that year, Hannah had written an essay for her biology class about the importance of sleep, and it had prompted her to start reading for herself. She discovered scientific studies had suggested that adolescents had a late-running biological rhythm, and that starting lessons at 10am could have enormous benefits for them. This all made sense to Hannah. It explained why she never felt alert, or able to properly focus, until the morning break. She read that schools in Surrey, in France and in the US state of Washington had experimented with pushing back the start of the school day. Surely this was a no-brainer? Now her politics teacher was explaining how e-petitions worked. There was a website, the teacher said, run by the House of Commons and the government, and a committee of backbench MPs overseeing it. If you started an e-petition that met all the rules, and it managed to attract 10,000 signatures, the committee would make sure the relevant ministry responded. If it reached 100,000, the committee would consider it for a debate in Parliament. Any UK citizen or resident could set one up, regardless of age, so long as they had a valid email account. “I thought: actually, you know what? I’m interested in this,” Hannah recalls. “Let’s see if anyone else will be.” She went to the e-petitions website and followed the instructions. She had to find five people to support it, but that wasn’t difficult in a classroom filled with pupils who’d also made long journeys through the countryside that morning. A few days later she had an email telling her that her petition had been approved. And that, so she thought, was the end of the matter. Nobody would care and nobody would sign it. Autumn turned to winter and her rides to and from school took place almost entirely in darkness. She didn’t think about her petition again. Then in January 2019, as she left school one day, she checked Instagram to find she had a message from a stranger: was she the same Hannah Kidner who started a petition about school start times? “Um, yeah,” she thought, wondering what on earth had prompted this. She went back to the e-petitions site for the first time in months. Hers was there on the front page, the most popular on the site, with 57,000 signatures. By the time she got home that evening, it had reached 65,000. It turned out that far more people cared about school start times than Hannah had ever imagined. She hadn’t been expecting this, and had no idea what would happen next. If you ever wish to stare deep inside the United Kingdom’s collective subconsciousness, and take a sample of the variety of the current hopes, fears, aspirations, worries, preoccupations, aversions and enthusiasms of the British populace, you could do far worse than browse the “open petitions” section of the e-petitions website: Price cap on flight tickets and holidays during school holidays(31,250 signatures at time of writing).Remove the ban on Tyler, The Creator, entering the UK(seven).Install microplastic filters on new washing machines as standard(16,182).Amend animal welfare law to make pet theft a specific offence(115,188).Ban the deliberate release of balloons and lanterns(3,035).Fund the art form of comic books to the same level that opera is supported(688).Revoke the BBC’s royal charter(4,135) Since the system was set up in 2015, e-petitions have become an indelible feature of the British political system, not to mention most people’s social media feeds. Unlike petition sites such as Change.org and 38 Degrees, the official House of Commons and UK government site offers citizens a direct route to raise their grievances with those in authority. And it’s proved popular. Following the 2017 general election, an average of 290 e-petitions each week have reached the five-signature threshold and made it on to the site. The highest number in a single seven-day period was 2,900; the lowest was 150. There’s a theory – though no-one has figures to back it up - that more are started on rainy days than sunny ones. Some are closely tied to the news agenda - most notably, one entitledRevoke Article 50 and remain in the EU, which has attracted more than six million signatures since it was launched in February 2019, and at one stage caused Parliament’s website to crash. (There have been many petitions on a range of Brexit permutations, urging MPs to “honour the referendum result” or hold a second plebiscite on EU membership or leave without a deal.) In 2017, more than 1.6 million people signed another petition calling for US President Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK to be cancelled. But there’s another category - those like Hannah’s - based around issues that might not otherwise have won much media or parliamentary attention, but which to a large number of people matter a great deal indeed. Gemma Weir knew her petition had to be worded carefully. Her cause felt urgent, but she had to keep her language calm and measured if she was to have any chance of success, and the stakes were too high to get anything wrong. Four years earlier, in 2013, the phone had rung at Gemma’s home in Portsmouth. It was the hospital, asking her to come in. Tests had shown her three-week-old daughter, Ivy, had cystic fibrosis, a genetic condition that causes fatal lung damage. Only half of those with the disorder live to see their 40thbirthday. The next few months were a mess of anxiety for Gemma. After spending all day caring for Ivy, she would stay up to all hours reading about CF. Infections could make Ivy sick, Gemma learned, and she became a germophobe on her daughter’s behalf. She realised she’d have to give up her job as a call centre manager to care for Ivy full-time. But there was one glimmer of hope. The nurse who’d broken the news of Ivy’s diagnosis told Gemma that a life-extending combination drug treatment was coming. It wasn’t a cure, he’d said, but it would allow people with Ivy’s gene mutation to live with it as though it were asthma or diabetes. “That’s what kept me sane,” says Gemma, now 35. “I had that to focus on – there are going to be drugs that will come along to save her.” Clinical trials showed the treatment, known as Orkambi, could improve lung function for people with CF. In 2015 it was licensed for use in the UK. But in 2016, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice) rejected it for patients in England on the grounds of cost-effectiveness. Vertex, Orkambi’s manufacturer, wanted over £100,000 per patient for a year’s treatment. A tussle ensued between the company and the NHS over the price, and the treatment remained unavailable for NHS England patients, except in rare cases on compassionate grounds. Like other parents of children with CF, Gemma was optimistic that the NHS and Vertex would come together to reach an agreement: “We were all being very British about it. Give them time, be respectful.” But no deal was forthcoming. Campaigners wrote to their MPs and tried to get the media interested, and still nothing changed. Gemma knew she couldn’t wait forever on Ivy’s behalf. Eventually, her patience ran out. Parents of children with CF cannot meet face-to-face because of the risk of cross-infection, so there was already a thriving online community. On one Facebook group, Gemma declared she was going to start an e-petition. “Nothing’s happening,” she remembers telling the other parents. “We’ve got to stand up. Our voices must be heard. Let’s get it in Parliament.” The petition, which Gemma started with her friend, Michelle Frank, urged the government to help find a solution. They knew they couldn’t be too strident or aggressive: they had to ask for a resolution of the problem, not demand it, Gemma says. On the day they put it live, the petition gained 10,000 signatures. By the end of the following evening, it had 25,000. “We spammed it everywhere,” she remembers. “I got banned from Facebook for three weeks. Tagging people, popping it into community posts, mum and baby pages, it just went like wildfire.” There was a response from the Department of Health. Ministers were “continuing to engage” with Vertex, Nice and NHS England, it said. Gemma wasn’t impressed. “That was a bit of a fob-off really,” she says. But she hadn’t really expected more. The aim was still 100,000 signatures, and a debate in Parliament, and if she could make MPs face up to the situation, then maybe there was hope for Ivy.  On Monday 5 November 2018, in a room in the Palace of Westminster, a tarpaulin-draped Big Ben looms outside the window. This is the base of a team of House of Commons employees whose job is to support and advise MPs on the Petitions Committee, and to check incoming e-petitions comply with the rules. This afternoon, the British public have pyrotechnics on their minds. The most popular e-petition on the UK government and Parliament’s website is titledBan the sale of fireworks to the public. Displays for licensed venues only, and so far it has been signed 103,000 times. “As of this time last week, this had maybe 1,000 signatures,” says David Slater, the committee’s clerk, leaning forward as he peers at the petition on his screen. Then over the weekend, as combustibles popped and whizzed through UK skies, the tally began increasing at a rate of 500 an hour. Now the signatures are coming in at more like 3,000 an hour. Slater says most people sign petitions after seeing them on Facebook - or occasionally another social network (for instance, Hannah’s petitions about school start times was widely shared on Instagram). A map on the committee website shows each UK constituency colour-coded by how many residents have signed the fireworks petition. South-west England, where it is proving most popular, glows red. Northern Ireland, where a licence is already required to buy, possess or use outdoor fireworks, is yellow, indicating that fewer are putting their names to it. Slater has only been in his job a few months, at this point, but he already knows there are certain subjects that tend to come up at the same time each year, and fireworks is one of them. Back in May and June, as GCSE season reached its climax, there were regular calls for students to be allowed to take open books into exams; now, as the festive season looms, it will soon be time for demands that Christmas advertising be banned until the first day of Advent. David Slater, Petitions Committee clerk David Slater, Petitions Committee clerk But petitions such as Hannah’s or Gemma’s, on subjects hitherto off the radar for the mass media or Parliament, often prove most successful. In 2016, after temp worker Nicola Thorp was sent home from her job as a receptionist for wearing flat shoes, she launched a petition calling for companies to be banned from instructing women to wear high heels at work. Signed by more than 150,000 people, it led not just to a debate in Parliament but to a joint report by the Petitions and Women and Equalities Committees, which found existing laws were not proving effective in preventing discrimination. A petition urging car insurance for young drivers to be capped at £1,250 a year attracted 185,000 signatures by the time it closed in 2017. It was started by 19-year-old Rhys Parker from Lowestoft in Suffolk, and MPs in the subsequent debate said they had been inundated with stories of young people living in rural areas - many of whom relied on their cars to carry out caring responsibilities - who felt unfairly penalised. Another petition, that demanded shops should be closed on Boxing Day to give retail workers a rest, was signed by nearly 150,000 people. One calling for greater action against tool theft from vans was signed by more than 40,000. “It gives you such amazing insight into what people care about,” says Kate Anderson, one of the moderators, who also works on engagement and communications for the committee. “It’s quite different from things you see reported.” Reaching 100,000 signatures guarantees that a petition will beconsideredfor a debate in Westminster Hall – where votes do not take place, unlike in the main Commons chamber - but not necessarily that onewilltake place. But equally, the committee has the discretion to schedule a debate in Westminster Hall even if a petition doesn’t reach 100,000 signatures. In March 2018, MPs debated a petition to make British Sign Language (BSL) part of the national curriculum, even though it had only been signed by 35,203 people. The committee said it recognised that the number of BSL users was relatively small, and that reaching the 100,000 target would be more difficult to achieve. Later that year, it scheduled another debate on public holidays for Hindu and Muslim festivals, following petitions that attracted 11,853 and 52,451 signatures respectively. The BSL petition was started by Wayne Barrow, aged 28. Although he grew up in Birmingham with the ability to hear, he learned BSL from his profoundly deaf parents and was signing before he could speak. “Deaf culture is a part of my culture because of my parents,” he says. “I see all the barriers they faced. You want everyone you love to get all the best access in life.” It had been his third attempt at starting a petition on the subject. His first had attracted a tiny number of signatures and the second had been put on hold when the 2017 general election was called. The decision to hold a debate despite not reaching the threshold felt like a vindication. “I was just so ecstatic that it was being recognised,” he says. For most petitioners, however, 100,000 is the target to reach, and getting there is no easy task. One January morning in 2016, Maria Lester sat on a commuter train rattling through south-west London as she anxiously refreshed the browser on her phone. Her petition calling for extra funding for brain tumour research had been open for nearly six months. There were just a few days left before it would be closed for signatures, and it was still - just - agonisingly short of 100,000. Maria started it as a tribute to her brother, Stephen Realf, who had died of brain cancer 18 months previously,  aged 26. He’d been just 19 and a trainee pilot with the RAF when he received his diagnosis. “In Stephen’s case, one of the absolute worst and cruellest things about it was that it robbed him of his flying career,” says Maria, now 39. “I think, for him, having to leave the RAF was as upsetting as being told he had this tumour.” As the first anniversary of his death approached, Maria, a journalist, had written an article for a magazine paying tribute to her brother. While researching it, she’d learned brain tumours were on the increase in the UK, but that they received only £7.7m per year, or 1.5% of the cash spent on cancer research. After checking her parents were on board, Maria decided to start an e-petition calling for that figure to be raised. Maria’s magazine article had given it an early boost, and the charity Brain Tumour Research had helped publicise it. Families of people with brain tumours contacted their local newspapers and radio stations to explain why they too were backing Maria. Pilot Officer Stephen Realf Pilot Officer Stephen Realf At first Maria’s goal had just been to get to 10,000 – a target that was reached in the first week. But she was deeply disappointed by the response she received from the Department of Health, much of which was taken up with running through the National Cancer Research Institute’s funding criteria. “It was so clinical,” she says. “I thought then I wanted to get to 100,000.” The Petitions Committee – whose chair, Helen Jones, was also underwhelmed with the government’s response - announced it would hold its first ever inquiry into brain tumour research funding. It was a significant vote of confidence. But three weeks out from the February deadline, the petition was still 46,000 signatures short of the figure needed to trigger a parliamentary debate. From his home in Rugby, Warwickshire, Maria’s dad, Peter Realf, a retired photographer, told her not to give up. “There’s three weeks left – I’m going to spend it on Twitter,” he said. He’d never used social media before the petition had been launched, but now he was determined to spread the word. “I’ll never forgive myself if I don’t give it my best shot,” he told his daughter.  Sue Farrington-Smith CEO, of Brain Tumour Research, with Peter Realf, Maria Lester and Liz Realf Sue Farrington-Smith CEO, of Brain Tumour Research, with Peter Realf, Maria Lester and Liz Realf Each morning Peter would wake up and check his smartphone to see how the petition was doing; his wife Liz would check her tablet. Peter would then dedicate the rest of the day to sharing Stephen’s story – targeting celebrities with large Twitter followings. After Piers Morgan had been persuaded to share the petition with his six million followers, Peter urged the presenter’s sometime rival Lord Sugar (five million followers) not to be outdone and to tweet about it too. Stephen had been a Tottenham fan, and Peter would go to Spurs Facebook groups, explain that his son used to sit in the West Stand at White Hart Lane and ask his fellow supporters to sign up. It seemed to be working. With a week to go they were 30,000 short. The Petitions Committee had been in touch to say they would consider scheduling a debate even if it fell short of 100,000, but Stephen’s family were determined to leave no room for doubt. One morning as the deadline approached, Liz and Peter lay in bed watching as the number of signatures inched towards 100,000. Maria clicked refresh on her phone for a final time, looked at the figure on her screen, and let out a cry of triumph that reverberated around the train carriage. Seconds later, her phone lit up with a message from her dad: “We’ve done it!” Petitions date back at least as far as ancient Egypt, when slaves building the pyramids used them to demand better working conditions. In the Middle Ages, England’s King Edward I urged his subjects to set out their grievances in petition format, and more than one million petitions were submitted to Westminster between 1780 and 1918. The House of Commons had a Public Petitions Committee that existed from the 19thCentury until it was abolished in 1974. When the Scottish Parliament was formed in 1999, it set up a committee with the same name, and this quickly proved popular. Under the Scottish system, petitions don’t have to attract a minimum number of signatures. “In Scotland, we’re lucky that we have the system we have because they do listen,” says Shaheen Blackie, 28, from Bellshill, Lanarkshire, who made an emotional appearance before MSPs at Holyrood about a petition she’d started. Her baby son, Zach, had died in her arms, of meningitis caused by a Group B Strep infection; 14,000 people backed her plea for expectant mothers to be offered automatic screening. Westminster’s current system can be traced to 2006, when Tony Blair’s government set up a Downing Street e-petitions website. This proved popular – a petition opposing government plans for road pricing was signed by 1.8 million people – but there was not, at that stage, a mechanism that might lead to Parliament debating the issues raised. The coalition government set up another e-petitions site in 2011, this time based in the Cabinet Office. But it wasn’t until 2015 that the House of Commons Petitions Committee was formed and the present collaborative system, run by government and Parliament together, came into effect (the Government Digital Service runs the technical side of the website). Helen Jones, the Labour MP for Warrington North who has chaired the committee from its inception, says there was initial resistance to the new system in some quarters, for instance when her committee rejected government responses that it deemed inadequate and demanded better ones. “One particular government minister said: ‘It was not envisaged that you would do that,’” she recalls. “I said, ‘Well, lots of things aren’t envisaged but they still happen.’” The committee insisted that petitioners were taken seriously, she says: “We wanted to give a voice to people on issues that aren’t always being heard.” Helen Jones, the Labour MP for Warrington North Helen Jones, the Labour MP for Warrington North In the Petitions Committee office, a whiteboard stands at one end of the room. On it is written a warning to the team: “Beware petitions fatigue.” The work can be emotionally taxing. Often petitions are started by people who have been bereaved or are in distress. The reports the committee commissioned into brain tumours and cystic fibrosis involved them listening to hundreds of upsetting stories. It used to be that all sensitive petitions were handled by Anne-Marie Griffiths, Slater’s predecessor as committee clerk. “She went away on holiday and I said, ‘There’s no way one person can be reading all these,’” recalls committee staff member Kate Anderson. “Itisdifficult, so we vary it now.” The task of moderating the hundreds of petitions started each week that meet the rules is a considerable one. The team aims to assess and publish each petition within seven days but it can take longer if it’s a complicated issue, or if they’re particularly busy - Slater says they are currently taking longer because they’re receiving a higher-than-average number of petitions. As of September 2018, a little over half were being rejected for not meeting the Petitions Committee’s standards - most commonly because they were judged to be unclear, not the government or Parliament’s responsibility, or a duplicate of an existing petition (big news events tend to generate a lot of these, according to Slater). Petitions also can’t call for anyone to be sacked. In the committee’s early days a petition calling for a vote of no confidence in then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt attracted 339,000 signatures, but the rules were changed shortly afterwards. The whiteboard carries another warning too: “Beware fake news.” While latitude is allowed for competing interpretations of facts, the rules don’t allow any petitions that start from a false premise or include statements that are demonstrably untrue, so fact-checking is part of the moderator’s job. But when changes are required before a petition can be accepted, the team say they try to be helpful. For example, Nicola Thorp’s high heels petition was initially rejected for being unclear, said Anderson: “It was: ‘Stop forcing women to wear high heels to work.’” This didn’t represent a clear action by the House of Commons or the government. The team suggested amending the wording so that it called for a change in the law: “She went away with our suggestion, came back and it did very well.” The moderators also say they’ll give additional support to people who have been recently bereaved or those who struggle with language. If the petitioner mentions their own employment or medical circumstances, moderators will email them to double-check they really are happy for this to be seen by thousands of people, or even millions. If they mention other people, the team will make sure these third parties don’t mind being mentioned - the rules state that individuals outside the public eye shouldn’t be named without their consent. “We want to help people start petitions,” says Kate Anderson. “We’re not looking for reasons to reject them. It’s about making sure they get the petition they want. “We do get people saying: ‘How can you possibly say this is unclear?’ But you also get people who take the suggestion and start the petition again. It’s a better petition.” Petitions will also be rejected if they are “nonsense or a joke”. Anderson says not many joke petitions make it through, and anyway most would struggle to attract five signatures, or would fall foul of the rule that says the issue must fall within Parliament’s area of responsibility. But sometimes just how serious an issue really is can be a matter of debate. Matt Parker, 38, says he had to convince the moderators that he was deadly serious when he began a petition to change the symbol used on UK road signs to indicate a football stadium “to a geometrically correct football”. Parker had been travelling south on the M6 when the idea first came to him. Just before junction 26, he noticed that a brown sign pointing towards Liverpool depicted a football made up entirely of white and dark hexagons. Parker, a qualified maths teacher and stand-up comedian, knew this was impossible - to form a sphere, the ball would need to include a number of pentagons, too. The sign annoyed Parker, not just because he knew it was wrong, but also because of the signal it sent that mathematical accuracy didn’t matter. It occurred to him that starting a petition would be a useful way to raise public engagement in the subject he loved. When he submitted it, however, he says the moderators didn’t believe he was serious. “I was like, ‘Hey, why has this been rejected?’ And they said that they thought I was probably joking.” After managing to convince them that he was 100% committed to the cause of geometric correctness, the petition went live and attracted 22,536 signatures. (In its official response, the Department for Transport rejected calls to amend the signs on grounds of cost and because the “level of attention needed to understand the geometry could distract a driver’s view away from the road”.) Rejected petitions are published, in the spirit of openness and visibility - unless they are judged to be libellous, likely to cause offence or breach someone’s privacy. One Twitter user (the team are keen to stress that it has nothing to do with the committee or the House of Commons) set up an automated feed, @rejectpetitions, that tweets details of every e-petition that fails to make it through moderation. Currently, it has just under 9,000 followers, a testament to the fascination with this aspect of the 21stCentury democratic process. As she walked through the corridors of Westminster, Nieva Restarick felt goosebumps standing up on her arms. It was July 2018, and around her, portraits and statues of statesmen and women loomed, and she thought about how much history had been made in this place. Nieva, who was born in the Philippines, turned to her English-born husband Richard and told him: “You must be very proud. Look! This is your heritage.” But it was her heritage, too. In 2010, when she’d applied for British citizenship, she’d had to sit a test called Life in the United Kingdom. She’d read up on the way laws were made in this building. Now, MPs were about to debate a petition she’d started, and Nieva had faith that they would see the justice of her cause. Nieva had lived in the UK since 2006, the year she’d married Richard, a mechanic. The couple had met online, and she’d thrown herself into life in his hometown of Thetford, Norfolk. She’d worked as a bookkeeper, made friends around the town, and with Richard had brought up a daughter. But it was hard being away from her family in Mandaluyong, the city she’d grown up in. They’d been a tight-knit unit. Her parents hadn’t had much money but had sacrificed everything so Nieva could go to university in Manila. She was especially close to her sister, Nerissa, who was 13 months her junior. When Nerissa had her heart broken by her first love, “I wasn’t there for her,” recalls Nieva, 37, and the guilt gnawed at her. Nieva and Richard would spend their holidays visiting her family in the Philippines, and at first it was straightforward enough to arrange visas for them to visit Norfolk. But in 2015 the rules were tightened and, soon after, Nerissa’s application was refused. She’d secured a visitors’ visa without any trouble four times previously, and never overstayed her welcome, claimed benefits or worked in the UK. She had a secure job back home as a teacher. But now Nerissa was told she didn’t have enough money in her account to qualify. Their mother, Nanita, 69, who’d recently been widowed, didn’t feel able to travel to the UK without her. Richard, 40, saw how tough the separation was on his wife. “I didn’t expect her to be isolated from her family,” he says. “It shouldn’t be a punishment for wanting to be with your husband in the UK."" Nieva, left, with her mother and sister Nieva, left, with her mother and sister Starting an e-petition felt like Nieva’s last hope. It called for automatic approval of visitor’s visas for family members of British citizens. In her preamble to it, Nieva wrote that she recognised they should not have access to public funds, not be allowed to work and that there should be checks to ensure they didn’t pose a threat to national security. But if their UK-based family could support them, they should be allowed in. “Not being a citizen doesn’t make our parent, siblings, children or grandchildren any less a part of our family,” the petition read. “The only requirement should be that a British relative sponsors them.” It was signed 71,178 times – not enough to be automatically considered for a debate, but the Petitions Committee voted to allow it to be debated anyway, alongside a similar petition on visiting rights for parents of British citizens. When the debate finally started in Westminster Hall, Nieva and Richard watched as MP after MP stood up to tell of stories like theirs – about constituents who were British citizens, but whose families couldn’t come to see them because of the new visa rules. Nieva knew the government had already responded, saying it had no plans to change the rules. But the Petitions Committee staff had been so helpful, and so many people had signed, and now, feeling awed by the grandeur of the building, she started to feel hope. But when a minister stood up, it was to say the government hadn’t changed its mind. Despite herself, Nieva was crestfallen. “I think it’s my own fault for expecting more,” she says. “I trusted you guys, the British. I thought you always came up with the best solution. I thought one of those intelligent heads would come out and say: ‘Let’s do it this way.’” Maria Lester’s brain tumour funding petition had a very different outcome. There was standing room only when it was debated in Westminster Hall in April 2016, and at the end a government minister stood up to announce a working group would be set up. The Petitions Committee had already published a report calling for extra support. Eventually, in May 2018, a government and charity sector package of £65m was announced in honour of the late Baroness Tessa Jowell, who had also campaigned on the issue. It wasn’t as much as the petition had called for – the £65m would be spent over five years, whereas the petition sought £30-35m per year – but she had a tangible achievement to show for all her family’s campaigning. It was also a testament to her late brother. “I think Stephen always wanted to make a difference and he thought it would be in the RAF,” Maria says. “But he’d be pleased that his story is out there.” There have been other notable successes. In 2019, another petition to give legal protection to police horses and dogs attacked on duty led to legislation known as Finn’s Law, after a German shepherd that was stabbed by an armed robber. But the effectiveness of a petition cannot always be measured by whether it results in a change of the law. In the future, Helen Jones would like the committee to have time allocated on the floor of the House of Commons so it can put down motions that MPs can vote on. “Most petitioners are pleased that they’ve been heard and that their point has been put - but there are some things where you would want to move to a vote.” Another thing she says she’d like to change is that petitions are most likely to be started “in places like London and Bristol”. To that effect, she’s made a point of visiting areas such as the West Midlands and Southampton, where fewer are initiated, to explain how the process works. In Gemma Weir’s case, the deadlock between Vertex and NHS England remains. But she says the petition wasn’t in vain – securing parliamentary time to discuss the treatment of cystic fibrosis was a huge step forward for her fellow campaigners. “The debate was about getting support, getting our stories heard, making the MPs aware of what was going on,” she says. Hannah Kidner was back in her politics classroom. Today’s lesson - the Department for Education’s response to her petition (in fact, its second response, as the Petitions Committee had sent back the first, demanding a better one). It had just been released, and Hannah and her fellow pupils read it together. The response made the point there weren’t actually any specific legal requirements about the length of the school day. Schools had the ability to set their own hours, and it was up to them, not the government, to make decisions about starting and finishing times. “We trust head teachers to decide how best to structure their school day to support their pupils’ education,” the statement continued. Actually, thought Hannah, that’s fair enough. “I thought it was a good response,” she says. “I mean, it didn't say that action would be taken. But it did say: ‘We acknowledge this.’ And that, for me, was what I really wanted.” Later that month, Hannah travelled to London with her parents to hear MPs debate the issue. In the oak-panelled surroundings of Westminster Hall, she listened as Daniel Zeichner (Labour, Cambridge) ran through the scientific research that had been published on teenagers’ sleep times, John Howell (Conservative, Henley) raised the issue of how childcare might be affected if different schools had different hours, and Martyn Day (SNP, Linlithgow) called for further study into whether it was more sleep that teenagers needed or better sleep. Hannah was impressed. “They’d taken an interest in it and taken it on board and looked into it,” she says. Before, having grown up in the countryside surrounded by animals, her ambition had been to become a vet. Now, having seen the system from the inside, she’s started thinking she should study politics at university. “It's made me realise that youcanmake a difference,” she says, “if you put your mind to it.” Author: Jon Kelly Photography: Getty Images, Emma Lynch/BBC, RAF,  Peter Realf, Nieva Restarick Production & design: Emma Lynch Editor: Stephen Mulvey"
US teenager wins $3m playing computer game Fortnite,"A US teenager has won a record-breaking $3m (Â£2.4m) to become world champion of the computer game Fortnite. It is the largest prize pool in the history of e-sports, with $30m shared amongst the winners. Kyle Giersdorf, 16, won the solo event of the competition in the Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York, which hosts the US Open tennis tournament. Jaden Ashman - a 15-year-old from Hornchurch, London - won almost Â£1m for coming second in the duos event. And another British teenager - 14-year-old Kyle ""Mongraal"" Jackson from Sidcup, Kent - also walked away with a major prize. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Giersdorf, known online as Bugha, stood laughing and shaking his head as the crowd erupted when his name was announced. He told the BBC he wants to save most of his prize. ""All I want is a new desk and maybe a desk for my trophy,"" he said. The final game was described by the commentators as a ""ridiculous victory lap"" as the winner played with a smile on his face whilst beating his rivals. The event is seen as a major moment in e-sports, which is estimated to be a billion-dollar industry in 2019. However, its record for the biggest prize pool is already set to be broken by another event called The International, taking place in August. The Fortnite finals saw 100 players battling on giant computer screens. Forty million players attempted to qualify over 10 weeks of online competition. There are an estimated 32.4 million gamers in the UK. More than 30 nations were represented with 70 players coming from the US, 14 from France and 11 from the UK. The game involves 100 players being dropped onto an island where they have to find weapons, build structures and eliminate each other until one player comes out on top. It has 200 million registered players worldwide and is free to download, but players can spend money on in-game purchases. Players can play alone, as part of a four-person squad or a 20-member team, either with friends or people they do not know. Last month its makers were quizzed by MPs on whether game developers Epic Games did enough to verify the age of players or encourage users to take breaks after long periods of gameplay. In April, the Duke of Sussex called for Fortnite to be banned, saying the game had been ""created to addict"". The firm's legal counsel Canon Pence told MPs that Epic Games staff had been ""quite taken aback"" by Prince Harry's comment.

The UK will legalise cannabis say MPs,"A group of cross-party MPs who've been on a fact-finding trip to Canada predict the UK will fully legalise cannabis use within five to ten years. Canada became the first G7 country to allow recreational use of the drug in 2018. Of the three politicians in the group one had a significant shift in his position. Labour's David Lammy now backs legalisation, against his party's official stance. Mr Lammy, alongside Conservative Jonathan Djanogly and Liberal Democrat Sir Norman Lamb were all filmed on their journey for a Radio 1 Newsbeat documentary called Legalising Weed: Canada's Story. This video can not be played Legalising Weed: Canada's Story Currently cannabis is designated as a Class B drug in the UK and anyone caught with it could face up to five years in prison. However, there has been a shift in approach towards medicinal cannabis products, which can now be legally prescribed to some patients. The decision to relax those rules followedan outcry over two boyswith severe epilepsy being denied access to cannabis oil. It's argued that where cannabis has been legalised for medical use, authorised recreational use often follows. Tottenham MP David Lammy visits a legally-grown cannabis crop in Canada ""I want the market legalised, regulated and taken away from crime gangs,"" said Tottenham MP David Lammy after returning from visiting Toronto. ""For young people not to be criminalised by use and properly educated. ""I want to see the strength of the stuff reduced, labelled and properly organised in this country."" The Liberal Democrat Party already officially backs legalising cannabis in the UK. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? MP for North Norfolk, Sir Norman Lamb led that policy decision. Whilst in Canada he wanted to legally sample cannabis oil to try to help him sleep. But he was very aware that such a product would be illegal in the UK. He may be the only serving British MP to ever openly take a cannabis product on camera. ""Taking this oil is purely for sleeping for relaxation, I will take it before bed and before my flight home."" It's different to the cannabis oils available legitimately in the UK because it containedTHC, the compound that gets users high. ""I was really anxious because I was chairing the technology and science select committee and I was travelling back over night, and I thought if I get back with no sleep it will be a challenge."" He said he did not feel high but it did help him fall asleep. ""I slept incredibly well. ""I took the drops and I slept very well on the plane home, I actually slept through breakfast."" The trip was organised by a UK-based campaign group, Volte Face, which wants the UK to legalise the drug. It's part sponsored by a big North American cannabis company called MPX. Newsbeat suggested that it was trying to use its money to influence British politicians. Scott Boyes says his company wants to make profit out of selling cannabis responsibly in the UK ""We're moving it away from organised crime to a legitimate commercial industry,"" Scott Boyes, MPX CEO, told us. ""We've had a lot of UK investors invest in our company and we're moving into six countries. ""A lot of the money we have raised has come out of the UK, so I don't consider it interfering with other people's politics and a lot of the expenses have been born by themselves."" Sir Norman Lamb and David Lammy decided to fund their own flights and accommodation. But the MPs also realise Canada's experience has not been without problems. In the documentary we hear from Piper Courtenay whose title is Cannabis Editor for a weekly newspaper. She describes how technically illegal, but often described as ""grey"", cannabis providers still thrive. The limits on fully licensed products mean there's still a market for things like edibles and other cannabis products. Around half of the cannabis bought in Canada still comes from illegal sources. ""It's certainly better than the legal product I have tried so far, because they genuinely care about growing good craft cannabis,"" she tells us. Products on sale at a legal shop in Canada All three MPs on the trip believed that the UK would follow Canada's lead and legalise cannabis for recreational use in the next decade. But Conservative MP for Huntingdon, Jonathan Djanogly, was perhaps unsurprisingly given his party name, the most conservative with his predictions. ""I think we have got a lot to learn before the legalisation of recreational cannabis, which I think will happen at some point,"" Jonathan Djanogly told us. ""I think we're on a 10 to 15 year cycle which would mirror what has happened in Canada."" The other MPs felt it would happen sooner and closer to five years. However, the government told Newsbeat it ""has no intention of changing the law"" when it comes to legalisation. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The legalisation of these substances would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery they can cause to families and society.""

HK police and protesters clash near China office,"This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake described the ""chaos"" on the streets as police fired tear gas Hong Kong has seen a second day of violent clashes between police and pro-democracy demonstrators who are also angry at alleged police brutality. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters trying to reach the Chinese government's office. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken over streets near Sai Wan and Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island. Hong Kong has seen eight consecutive weekends of anti-government and pro-democracy protests. It is ranked as one of the safest cities in the world - but recent protests have been followed by violent clashes between demonstrators, police and masked men wielding sticks suspected of being criminal gang members. The background you need on the protests Were triads involved in the attacks? Police fire tear gas at Yuen Long protest Sunday's protests saw activists wearing protective helmets and goggles erecting barricades at several different locations and chanting ""free Hong Kong"". The protests began as a police-authorised gathering in a park in the central business district before protesters defied the authorities and marched west towards the Chinese liaison office in Sai Wan and east towards the Causeway Bay shopping area. Hundreds of police blocked the protesters from reaching the Chinese liaison office. The building had been fortified with plastic barricades and a Chinese government emblem above the front door had been covered with a plastic shield, Reuters news agency reported. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets Last Sunday the office was targeted by protesters who wrote graffiti and threw paint on its walls. Chinese officials said this was a challenge to Beijing's authority that would not be tolerated. Some protesters chanted ""reclaim Hong Kong"" and ""revolution of our times"", or held up banners that read ""end the violence"". Meanwhile in the Causeway Bay shopping area, protesters with helmets and masks waited for police as tourists carrying shopping bags, including many from mainland China, continued to walk the streets.

Demonstrations began when the Hong Kong government introduced a controversial bill that would have enabled extraditions to mainland China. Protesters took over major roads in the financial and shopping districts There were clashes near China's liaison office in the territory It sparked huge protests as critics feared the bill would undermine Hong Kong's freedoms, and be used to target political activists. The row intensified as police were accused of using excessive force on anti-extradition bill protesters. Tensions increased further last Sunday, when suspected triad members descended on a subway station in Yuen Long, beating protesters, passersby and journalists with sticks. Demonstrators accused the police of colluding with the triads - claims angrily denied by the police. The authorities say they have arrested 12 people over the attack, including nine men with links to triads. This video can not be played A large group of masked men in white T-shirts stormed Yuen Long station The anti-extradition protests have morphed over time into a wider movement. While the government has paused work on the extradition bill, protesters now want it withdrawn completely, as well as an independent inquiry into police violence, and democratic reform. They want the territory's leader, Carrie Lam, who is not democratically elected, and whose handling of the crisis has been widely criticised, to resign. Some protesters have also expressed their anger at the mainland Chinese government, which they say has been eroding freedoms in Hong Kong. Last week, demonstrators stormed the Chinese government's office and defaced the national emblem. The authorities have now installed a protective casing around the sign. As a former British colony, Hong Kong has its own legal and judicial systems, and has been promised ""a high degree of autonomy"" from the Chinese government, except in foreign and defence affairs. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) does have troops stationed in Hong Kong, but they are not expected to interfere in local issues. However, the law does permit Hong Kong's government to request assistance from the PLA for purposes of maintaining public order, or disaster relief. Last week China's defence ministry spokesman condemned protesters who had vandalised the government's offices, and said there were ""clear stipulations"" in the law allowing Hong Kong's leaders to ask the army for help. Hong Kong's government and police have stated in recent weeks that they have no plans to involve the army - while some commentators argue that China would consider using its troops in Hong Kong to be too politically risky. 3 April- Hong Kong government introduces amendments to the city's extradition laws to the legislature that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China. 9 June- In the first of many huge protests against the changes, an estimated million people march to government headquarters. 12 June- Anti-extradition bill protesters block roads and try to storm government buildings - police fire  tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at protesters, in the worst violence the city has seen in decades. 15 June- Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam indefinitely delays the bill in a dramatic reversal. 16 June- Despite this, an estimated two million people take to the streets demanding the complete withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into alleged police violence, and Carrie Lam's resignation. 21 June- As anger grows towards police, protests blockade police headquarters for 15 hours. They now also want protesters that were arrested to be exonerated. 1 July- On the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from the UK to China, the Legislative Council (LegCo) building is stormed and broken into by protesters. 21 July- Protesters deface China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. That same night mobs of men wearing white shirts attack protesters and commuters in Yuen Long station, near mainland China, in a new escalation of violence. Tear gas fired at Hong Kong protesters.

UK sends second warship to Gulf amid Iran tensions,"HMS Duncan in the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping route in the Gulf A second Royal Navy warship has arrived in the Gulf to protect British ships amid heightened tensions in the region. HMS Duncan has joined frigate HMS Montrose to escort vessels sailing under the British flag through the Strait of Hormuz. HMS Montrose has so far accompanied 35 vessels through the strait, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK continued to push for a diplomatic resolution to the situation. He said: ""Freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz is vital not just to the UK, but also our international partners and allies. ""Merchant ships must be free to travel lawfully and trade safely, anywhere in the world.""

Vauxhall owner could move Astra production 'from UK',"The chief executive of Vauxhall-owner PSA says it could move all production from its Ellesmere Port factory if Brexit makes it unprofitable. Carlos Tavarestold the Financial Times,externalthat the carmaker has alternatives to the plant which it could use. The move would probably lead to the closure of the site, the FT said, threatening 1,000 jobs. That would leave Vauxhall's Luton-based van plant as its last presence in the UK. ""Frankly I would prefer to put it [the Astra car] in Ellesmere Port, but if the conditions are bad and I cannot make it profitable, then I have to protect the rest of the company and I will not do it,"" Mr Tavares told the paper. ""We have an alternative to Ellesmere Port."" In June, the carmaker announced plans to manufacture the next generation of the Astra, its best selling car, in Ellesmere Port and another factory in Germany. At the time, it warned that its decision would depend on the final Brexit terms. However, Mr Tavares has now gone further, indicating that the firm has another plant in mind should the UK leave the EU without a deal. In an official statement on Monday, PSA confirmed the group was still looking to manufacture the next-generation Astra at Russelsheim and Ellesmere Port. But it warned that the final decision on the role of the Ellesmere Port plant would be conditional on the ""final terms of the UK's exit from the European Union"". ""PSA Groupe has put in to place a comprehensive 'no-deal' contingency plan that covers human resources, taxation, customs, logistics, production, regulation, supply chain and IT,"" it added. The firm said it would closely monitor political developments and engage with politicians to understand the various potential Brexit outcomes. Vauxhall employs about 1,000 people at Ellesmere Port At the weekend, Michael Gove, who has been charged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to prepare for leaving the EU with no deal, said the government was now ""working on the assumption"" of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Gove said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels, but writing in the Sunday Times, he added: ""No deal is now a very real prospect."" Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of Unite, said the union and PSA had been in positive discussions about a new vehicle agreement and securing new models for the Ellesmere Port plant. ""All that hard work is now hanging by a thread as Boris Johnson and his government of hard Brexiteers play no-deal roulette with the livelihoods of thousands of Vauxhall workers and their colleagues in the supply chain,"" he added. ""A no-deal Brexit, or a deal that throws up barriers and tariffs, would be catastrophic for Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port workers and the UK car industry and make plants inefficient, components less attractive and cars built in the UK more expensive for export."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The UK automotive industry remains one of our great success stories. ""We are at the forefront of designing and manufacturing cutting-edge vehicles, and we continue to talk to industry, including the automotive sector, in the run-up to exit day, to ensure they are prepared to maximise the opportunities of our exit from the EU."" By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent This isn't the first time Carlos Tavares has warned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Vauxhall, but it is the most explicit threat he's made so far. Last year, for example, he told methere could be ""dramatic consequences"" for the firm's UK plants, but refused to specify what those consequences might be. Now he is being specific. Production of the next generation Vauxhall Astra could be moved from Ellesmere Port to another plant in southern Europe. Yet it is only a month since PSA Group first unveiled its plans to build the new car in Cheshire. So what's changed? In a word, nothing. That decision was always contingent on a suitable Brexit arrangement being reached to safeguard frictionless trade across the Channel. At the time, company insiders said no-deal was not an option. Now, with a new Prime Minister in office, Mr Tavares is offering him a clear-cut choice. Get a deal, and the future of the plant could be secured. Go for no-deal and - he says - the work will go elsewhere. The Confederation of British Industryhas warned the governmentthat neither the UK or EU is ready for a no-deal Brexit. And the car industry lobby group, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned on Friday that ""no-deal Brexit is simply not an option."" Car production has been falling in the UK over the past year, amid increasing pleas from the industry for a Brexit deal. The UK's automotive industry has received a series of blows in recent months, with Honda announcing it will close its Swindon plant in 2021. Ford also said its Bridgend engine plant in south Wales would close in September 2020 with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Japanese car producers, including Nissan, have said that Brexit uncertainty is not helping them ""plan for the future"". Earlier this year, Nissan opted to build the next X-Trail model in Japan, rather than in Sunderland.

Gove: No-deal Brexit now 'assumed' by government,"Michael Gove, the newly appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, is in charge of preparing for a no-deal Brexit The government is now ""working on the assumption"" of a no-deal Brexit, Michael Gove has said. Mr Gove said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels but, writing in theSunday Times,external, he added: ""No deal is now a very real prospect."" The prime minister hasmade Mr Gove responsible for preparing for no-deal. Treasury sources say they expect more than Â£1bn of extra funding to be made available later this week for no-deal planning and preparation. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Chancellor Sajid Javid said there would be ""significant extra funding"" for 500 new Border Force officers and ""possible"" improved infrastructure at British ports. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Mr Gove to chair no-deal meetings seven days a week until Brexit is delivered, according to the Sunday Times. Mr Gove said tweaks to Theresa May's withdrawal agreement - which was approved by the EU but resoundingly rejected by Parliament - would not be enough. Brexit: What happens next? What is proroguing? ""You can't just reheat the dish that's been sent back and expect that will make it more palatable,"" he wrote. He added he hoped EU leaders might yet open up to the idea of striking a new deal, ""but we must operate on the assumption that they will not"". ""While we are optimistic about the future, we are realistic about the need to plan for every eventuality."" Mr Gove highlighted a major flaw of Mrs May's deal asthe Irish backstop plan- a measure designed to prevent the introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland. So far the backstop has proved a sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. A no-deal Brexit would mean the UK leaving the EU and cutting ties immediately, with no agreement in place. The UK would follow World Trade Organization rules if it wanted to trade with the EU and other countries, while also trying to negotiate free-trade deals. But with Britain outside the EU, there could be physical checkpoints to monitor people and goods crossing in and out of the UK. Speaking to Sky's Sophy Ridge, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would do everything to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He reiterated his call for a new referendum - insisting he would still hold one if Labour were in power - and said, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Labour would campaign to remain in the EU. Mr Corbyn also said he would look at whether to call a no-confidence vote in the government after Parliament returns in September. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson told Sky that, in the event of a general election, her party's message would be: ""Stop Brexit, stop Boris and start renewing our country."" Jo Swinson was elected Lib Dem leader earlier this week Mr Gove is one of several new ministers pressing on with Brexit preparations sincejoining Mr Johnson's cabinetearlier this week. Newly appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, told Sky: ""We're turbo-charging preparations for no-deal, that is now the government's number one priority."" He said if the EU would not reopen discussions about the Irish backstop plan then ""it's right that we prepare properly, with conviction, and importantly with the financial resources that the Treasury will now supply properly"". Who is in charge of what? Faces of the radically new cabinet Dominic Cummings and other key advisers Laura Kuenssberg's 10 things to consider over summer Meanwhile, there have been reports of more dissatisfaction within the Conservative Party, as MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit continue to consider ways to avoid it. The Observer alleges former chancellor Philip Hammond held private talks with Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer before Mr Johnson became prime minister. The pair met shortly after Mr Hammond resigned from the government, the paper said. Mr Starmer told the paper,externalthat work to build ""a strong cross-party alliance"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit would ""intensify over the summer"". But despite several Tory MPsvoicing their opposition to Mr Johnsonin his first week in Downing Street, an opinion poll has suggested a recent boost in support for the party.

Talks to salvage Iran nuclear dealThe meeting comes amid rising tensions in the Gulf and Iran's decision to breach parts of the deal.Middle East,"The talks have been held in Vienna Talks to try to save the Iran nuclear deal have been held amid rising tensions over tankers in the Gulf.

Arriving at the meeting, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he considered the seizing of its oil tanker in breach of the JCPOA, and Iran also described as ""provocative"" British proposals for a European-led mission to escort tankers through theStrait of Hormuz, a vital international shipping route.

Boris Johnson wants renewal of 'ties that bind UK',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there is ""every chance"" the UK can get a deal with the EU Boris Johnson has pledged to ""hold out the hand"" and ""go the extra thousand miles"" to strike a new Brexit deal. During a visit to Scotland, the prime minister said the existing withdrawal agreement negotiated with European leaders was ""dead"" and had ""got to go"". However, he said there was ""every chance we can get a deal"". But Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Mr Johnson had set the UK on an ""almost inevitable path to a no-deal Brexit"". Preparations for leaving the European Union without a withdrawal deal are being ramped up, with Mr Johnson saying the UK must leave the EU by 31 October. While in Scotland he met Ms Sturgeon and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson - both of whom have positioned themselves against a no-deal exit. Don't underestimate Boris Johnson, EU warned Could PMâs trickiest meeting be with one of his own? Gove: No-deal Brexit now 'assumed' by government Johnson 'absolutely' rules out early election Two committees have been set up as the UK government intensifies preparations for a possible no-deal exit, including a ""daily operations committee"" of senior ministers. Meanwhile, the pound has sunk toa 28-month low against the dollar, apparently due to concerns about Brexit. Speaking at the Faslane naval base near Glasgow, Mr Johnson said his ""assumption is that we can get a new deal"", but said it was ""responsible for any government to prepare for no deal if we absolutely have to"". He said: ""I don't want the UK to be aloof or hanging back, I want us to engage, to hold out the hand, to go the extra thousand miles, and what we want to do is make it absolutely clear that the backstop is no good, it's dead, it's got to go. ""The withdrawal agreement is dead, it's got to go. But there is scope for us to do a new deal. ""We will make it very clear to our friends - we're talking to the Irish today - what the limits are and what we want to do. ""We're very confident that with goodwill on both sides, two mature political entities, the UK and EU, can get this thing done."" Mr Johnson announced a new Office for Veterans' Affairs while visiting the Faslane naval base Meanwhile,the prime minister's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, has urged his EU counterparts not to ""underestimate"" Mr Johnsonor his commitment to the 31 October deadline. Mr Johnson has faced scrutiny over his Brexit strategy from colleagues and opponents alike during his visit to Scotland. Ms Davidson has previously said Mr Johnson has her ""full support"" in his efforts to secure a withdrawal agreement with the EU, but that she will not support a no-deal Brexit. After a meeting at Holyrood, the Scottish Tory leader said the pair had discussed their ""shared determination to strengthen the Union"", adding Mr Johnson had ""made clear the government's preference is to leave the EU with a deal"". Mr Johnson, meanwhile, said he was Ms Davidson's ""number one fan"". Analysis by BBC Scotland editor Sarah Smith Ruth Davidson met Mr Johnson at the Scottish Parliament Boris Johnson's toughest meeting might not have been with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, but rather Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson. Ms Davidson made no secret of the fact that she did not want Mr Johnson as PM. And in the few days since he took charge relations have already gone further south. He ignored his Scottish leader's advice not to sack the Scottish Secretary David Mundell and replace him with the pro-Brexit MP Alister Jack. He then further snubbed the Scottish contingent of parliamentarians when heput an MP who sits for an English seatinto the Scotland office as a minister. Ms Davidson has said publicly that she would not support a no-deal exit from the EU and that as leader of the Scottish party she does not have to sign up to any loyalty pledge to support a no deal. She believes the PM would have sacked her if he could. But he can't - and she will take full advantage of her ability to speak out. Read more from Sarah Ms Sturgeon - who hosted Mr Johnson at her official Bute House residence - has also pledged to fight against a no-deal exit, saying it would cost 100,000 jobs and ""plunge the economy into recession"". Speaking after what she described as a ""very lively exchange"" with Mr Johnson, she also said she believed he was really pursuing a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played Sturgeon: UK government's Brexit path ""dangerous"" ""He says he wants to get a deal, but what is not clear to me is how he intends to get from the very hard-line, fixed position that he's taken to a position where a deal is possible, if the EU also sticks to the very consistent position it has taken,"" she said. ""That makes me think that whatever Boris Johnson is saying about his preference being to strike a deal, in reality he is pursuing a no-deal Brexit."" She added that she had made clear to Mr Johnson her opposition to Brexit and no-deal and that the people of Scotland should be able to ""choose their own future"". A No 10 spokesman said the PM told Ms Sturgeon he ""was a passionate believer in the power of the Union"" and ""would work tirelessly to strengthen the United Kingdom and improve the lives of people right across Scotland"". Mr Johnson said his preference was to negotiate a new deal that abolished the backstop - but the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October ""come what may"", the spokesman added. Mr Johnson is met Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at Bute House in Edinburgh Mr Johnson also used his trip to Scotland to announce funding for projects to boost the economy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay claimed the Â£300m ""isn't new funding"" and was already under negotiation before Mr Johnson became prime minister. Welsh Labour also hit out at the funding plans,calling them ""very thin stuff""which would not make up for a ""chronic lack of investment"". This video can not be played Emotions were high as Boris Johnson arrived at Bute House The UK government, however, insisted the money was new, with Scottish Secretary Alister Jack saying city deals would help ""create jobs and boost local economies"". The growth deal plan comes after Mr Johnson announced a Â£3.6bn towns fund over the weekend, which will initially support 100 places in England. As part of his visit to Scotland, the prime minister also announcedplans for a new Office for Veterans' Affairswithin the UK government, to coordinate medical treatment and training and ""ensure no veteran is disadvantaged because of their service"". The prime minister also plans to go to Wales to meet members of its farming community and Northern Ireland to discuss ongoing efforts to restore devolution at Stormont. Who is in charge of what?

Johnson 'absolutely' rules out early election,"Boris Johnson has said he will ""absolutely"" not call a general election before the latest Brexit deadline of 31 October. Speaking during a visit in Birmingham, the prime minister said voters did not want another general election or a referendum. ""What they want us to do is deliver on their mandate to come out of the EU,"" he added. Mr Johnson's comments come as he continues to appoint new ministers. Asked whether he could provide an assurance an election would not take place before the end of October, Mr Johnson replied, ""absolutely"". ""We want to, and we are going to, deliver on the mandate of the people, which is to take the UK out of the EU whole and entire on 31 October,"" he said. Could there be an early general election? Sturgeon and Johnson hold telephone talks Johnson accused of setting UK on 'collision course' The new PM continues to make changes to lower-ranked jobs, following a radical overhaul of his cabinet on Wednesday. Among the changes announced on Friday, Nick Hurd becomes a Northern Ireland minister, George Freeman has been given a transport brief, and Michael Ellis becomes the new solicitor general. Tobias Ellwood lost his job as a defence minister, but said he would support Mr Johnson as a backbench MP and make the case for further defence spending. Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, who had been a junior housing minister and junior minister at the Wales Office, said he was quitting government over Mr Johnson's Brexit strategy. Heposted on Twitter,externalthat he had been asked to continue in both roles, but declined because ""I cannot accept a no deal on 31 October"". Mr Johnson also confirmed he would change his own official title to include ""Minister for the Union"" - a pledge he made during his leadership campaign. A Downing Street spokesperson said this was a ""statement of his commitment"" to strengthening ties between the constituent parts of the UK. Who is in charge of what?

On Thursday, former Brexit minister Steve Baker turned down a return to a junior job within the Department for Exiting the European Union.

CBI: 'UK and EU not ready for no-deal Brexit',"CBI chief Carolyn Fairbairn has previously called for a Brexit deal that unlocks confidence The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned the government that neither the UK nor the EU is ready for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. ""While the UK's preparations to date are welcome, the unprecedented nature of Brexit means some aspects cannot be mitigated,"" said the CBI. It has published practical steps it says the UK, EU and firms can take. A government spokesman said the UK has increased the pace of planning for no-deal. The CBI had previously said leaving the EU with a dealwas essential to protect the economy and jobs. New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made Michael Gove responsible for planning a no-deal Brexit. Mr Gove has said the UK government is currently ""working on the assumption"" of a no-deal Brexit. He said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels but, writing in the Sunday Times, he added: ""No deal is now a very real prospect."" The CBI's report What Comes Next?

""Larger companies, particularly those in regulated areas such as financial services, have well-thought-through contingency plans in place, though smaller firms are less well prepared."" The CBI has warned of disruption to UK firms The report is based on thousands of interviews with firms of all sizes and sectors, including 50 trade associations, covering all areas of the UK economy. The CBI says that in a no-deal Brexit some 24 of 27 areas of the UK economy would experience disruption. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Josh Hardie, the CBI's deputy director general, said: ""A deal is absolutely essential if we're to manage the economy in the best way that we can.""

""It doesn't mean you're going to stop all the flood water, you'll probably still lose the kitchen but you might save the bedroom and that's where we are right now."" He said meetings between businesses and the government needed to ""scale up - and they have to scale up now"". He said that talks about no-deal preparations had been postponed since an initial March deadline to leave the EU was delayed until 31 October.

"South African report backs limited land seizuresWhite people, who make up just 9% of the population, own 72% of the farmland.","The radical EFF opposition party has made land expropriation without compensation a key national issue A presidential panel in South Africa has proposed expropriation of land without compensation, but in limited circumstances. Land held purely for speculative purposes or occupied by tenants should be given away, it advises. White people, who make up just 9% of the population, own 72% of the farmland that is held by individuals. President Cyril Ramaphosa backs land expropriation, which is popular with the black majority. The governing African National Congress (ANC) has repeatedly pledged to accelerate land transfers to the black majority since taking office in 1994, after white-minority rule ended, but progress has been slow. Those opposed to land expropriation point to Zimbabwe where a similar policy by former President Robert Mugabe wrecked the economy and scared away investors. Is South Africa's land reform a gimmick? â¢The groups playing on the fears of a 'white genocide' ANC manifesto: Land, jobs and blockchain President Ramaphosa set up the team of experts last year as the ANC was coming under pressure from opposition parties, especially from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The panel proposed that the government expropriate land held purely for speculative purposes land already occupied and used by tenants and former tenants land that has been abandoned inner city buildings with absentee landlords. It said those who had bought property since the end of apartheid should be treated differently to those who had inherited land that was held under the apartheid system. The main opposition Democratic Alliance party rejected the report's recommendations, saying land expropriation without compensation would ""further batter our ailing economy"". Parliament is due to debate proposed changes to the land expropriation bill in October. The Natives Land Act of 1913 restricted black people from buying or renting land in ""white South Africa"", leading to the forced removals of black people After the end of apartheid in 1994, the ANC government said it wanted to return 30% of this land to its previous owners by 2014 It is estimated that 10% of commercial farmland has been redistributed.

The background you need on the Hong Kong protests,"This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Hong Kong has seen several months of pro-democracy protests - and China appears to be tightening its grip. The protests began in June 2019 over plans - later put on ice, and finally withdrawn in September - that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. They then spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform, and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law, which critics believe could be used to crack down on rights and political activists. This is not all happening in a vacuum. There's a lot of important context - some of it stretching back decades - that helps explain what is going on. It's important to remember that Hong Kong is significantly different from other Chinese cities. To understand this, you need to look at its history. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests It was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years. It became a busy trading port, and its economy took off in the 1950s as it became a manufacturing hub. The territory was also popular with migrants and dissidents fleeing instability, poverty or persecution in mainland China. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Young, radical and ready for tear gas Read more about Hong Kong's history Then, in the early 1980s, as the deadline for the 99-year-lease approached, Britain and China began talks on the future of Hong Kong - with the communist government in China arguing that all of Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese rule. The two sides signed a treaty in 1984 that would see Hong Kong return to China in 1997, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". This meant that while becoming part of one country with China, Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press are protected. For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, where the military opened fire on unarmed protesters in Beijing. Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China - but they are widely thought to be on the decline. Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China. There are also accusations that press and academic freedoms have been deteriorating. In March, China effectively expelled several US journalists - but also prohibited them from working in Hong Kong. The public broadcaster RTHK has come under pressure from Hong Kong's government, first for broadcasting an interview with the World Health Organization about Taiwan, and then for targeting police in its satirical news show ""Headliner"". The local examinations body also came under fire for a world history question about relations between Japan and China, with the government demanding the exam question be invalidated. The government said it was a professional, rather than political, decision, but many academics expressed concern. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Another sticking point has been democratic reform. Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee - a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible voters. Not all the 70 members of the territory's lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, are directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers. Some elected members have even been disbarredafter Beijing issued a controversial legal ruling that effectively disqualified them. Hope and defiance on the streets of Hong Kong Were triads involved in Hong Kong attacks? Hong Kong'smini-constitution, the Basic Law,external, says that ultimately both the leader, and the Legislative Council, should be elected in a more democratic way - but there's been disagreement over what this should look like. The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee, but critics called this a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature. In 28 years' time in 2047, the Basic Law expires - and what happens to Hong Kong's autonomy after that is unclear. While most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese, and although Hong Kong is part of China, a majority of people there don't identify as Chinese. Surveys from the University of Hong Kong show thatmost people identify themselves as ""Hong Kongers"",external-only 11% would call themselves ""Chinese"",external- and 71% of people saythey do not feel proud about being Chinese citizens,external. The difference is particularly pronounced amongst the young. ""The younger the respondents, the less likely they feel proud of becoming a national citizen of China, and also the more negative they are toward the Central Government's policies on Hong Kong,"" the university's public opinion programme says. Hong Kongers have described legal, social and cultural differences - and the fact Hong Kong was a separate colony for 150 years - as reasons why they don't identify with their compatriots in mainland China. There has also been a rise in anti-mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong in recent years, with people complaining about rude tourists disregarding local norms or driving up the cost of living. Some young activists have even called for Hong Kong's independence from China, something that alarms the Beijing government. Demonstrations in 2014 went on for several weeks There's a rich history of dissent in Hong Kong, stretching back further even than the past few years. In 1966, demonstrations broke out after the Star Ferry Company decided to increase its fares. The protests escalated into riots, a full curfew was declared and hundreds of troops took to the streets. Do protests ever work in China? Young and unhappy in HK Protests have continued since 1997, but now the biggest ones tend to be of a political nature - and bring demonstrators into conflict with mainland China's position. This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake inside the Legislative Council after protests in 2019 While Hong Kongers have a degree of autonomy, they have little liberty in the polls, meaning protests are one of the few ways they can make their opinions heard. As a result, many see taking to the streets as their only way of forcing change. And, in the past, some protests have been successful. In 2003,up to 500,000 people took to the streets,externalto protest against a controversial security bill the Hong Kong government was trying to pass. The local government also backed down over""patriotic education"" classesfollowing rallies against the move. However, the Chinese government has adopted a harder stance in recent years, particularly with any movements it views as a direct challenge to its own authority. In 2014, demonstrators took to the streets peacefully for several weeks, demanding Hong Kongers be given the right to elect their own leader. But the so-called Umbrella movement eventually fizzled out with no concessions from Beijing. In June 2019, protesters took to the streets again, demonstrating against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. This time, clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 The bill was halted, and later fully withdrawn, but demonstrations continued for months, with demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions. In April this year, Hong Kong police arrested 15 of the city's most high-profile pro-democracy activists for taking part in unauthorised assemblies. In May, Hong Kong's police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police's part during the 2019 protests - in a report that was criticised by many rights groups and external experts. The street protests have mostly died down during the coronavirus pandemic, although some small demonstrations, including singing protesters in shopping malls, have started again as restrictions are gradually eased. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, which could be similar to the one withdrawn in 2003. It says the legislation is ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"". However, the new proposal is also controversial because it is expected to circumvent Hong Kong's own law-making processes - leading to accusations that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.

HK police and protesters clash near China officePolice fire tear gas at pro-democracy protesters for a second day in the eighth weekend of protestsChina,"This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake described the ""chaos"" on the streets as police fired tear gas Hong Kong has seen a second day of violent clashes between police and pro-democracy demonstrators who are also angry at alleged police brutality. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters trying to reach the Chinese government's office. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken over streets near Sai Wan and Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island. Hong Kong has seen eight consecutive weekends of anti-government and pro-democracy protests. It is ranked as one of the safest cities in the world - but recent protests have been followed by violent clashes between demonstrators, police and masked men wielding sticks suspected of being criminal gang members. The background you need on the protests Were triads involved in the attacks? Police fire tear gas at Yuen Long protest Sunday's protests saw activists wearing protective helmets and goggles erecting barricades at several different locations and chanting ""free Hong Kong"". The protests began as a police-authorised gathering in a park in the central business district before protesters defied the authorities and marched west towards the Chinese liaison office in Sai Wan and east towards the Causeway Bay shopping area. Hundreds of police blocked the protesters from reaching the Chinese liaison office. The building had been fortified with plastic barricades and a Chinese government emblem above the front door had been covered with a plastic shield, Reuters news agency reported. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets Last Sunday the office was targeted by protesters who wrote graffiti and threw paint on its walls. Chinese officials said this was a challenge to Beijing's authority that would not be tolerated. Some protesters chanted ""reclaim Hong Kong"" and ""revolution of our times"", or held up banners that read ""end the violence"". Meanwhile in the Causeway Bay shopping area, protesters with helmets and masks waited for police as tourists carrying shopping bags, including many from mainland China, continued to walk the streets.

Demonstrations began when the Hong Kong government introduced a controversial bill that would have enabled extraditions to mainland China. Protesters took over major roads in the financial and shopping districts There were clashes near China's liaison office in the territory It sparked huge protests as critics feared the bill would undermine Hong Kong's freedoms, and be used to target political activists. The row intensified as police were accused of using excessive force on anti-extradition bill protesters. Tensions increased further last Sunday, when suspected triad members descended on a subway station in Yuen Long, beating protesters, passersby and journalists with sticks. Demonstrators accused the police of colluding with the triads - claims angrily denied by the police. The authorities say they have arrested 12 people over the attack, including nine men with links to triads. This video can not be played A large group of masked men in white T-shirts stormed Yuen Long station The anti-extradition protests have morphed over time into a wider movement. While the government has paused work on the extradition bill, protesters now want it withdrawn completely, as well as an independent inquiry into police violence, and democratic reform. They want the territory's leader, Carrie Lam, who is not democratically elected, and whose handling of the crisis has been widely criticised, to resign. Some protesters have also expressed their anger at the mainland Chinese government, which they say has been eroding freedoms in Hong Kong. Last week, demonstrators stormed the Chinese government's office and defaced the national emblem. The authorities have now installed a protective casing around the sign. As a former British colony, Hong Kong has its own legal and judicial systems, and has been promised ""a high degree of autonomy"" from the Chinese government, except in foreign and defence affairs. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) does have troops stationed in Hong Kong, but they are not expected to interfere in local issues. However, the law does permit Hong Kong's government to request assistance from the PLA for purposes of maintaining public order, or disaster relief. Last week China's defence ministry spokesman condemned protesters who had vandalised the government's offices, and said there were ""clear stipulations"" in the law allowing Hong Kong's leaders to ask the army for help. Hong Kong's government and police have stated in recent weeks that they have no plans to involve the army - while some commentators argue that China would consider using its troops in Hong Kong to be too politically risky. 3 April- Hong Kong government introduces amendments to the city's extradition laws to the legislature that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China. 9 June- In the first of many huge protests against the changes, an estimated million people march to government headquarters. 12 June- Anti-extradition bill protesters block roads and try to storm government buildings - police fire  tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at protesters, in the worst violence the city has seen in decades. 15 June- Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam indefinitely delays the bill in a dramatic reversal. 16 June- Despite this, an estimated two million people take to the streets demanding the complete withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into alleged police violence, and Carrie Lam's resignation. 21 June- As anger grows towards police, protests blockade police headquarters for 15 hours. They now also want protesters that were arrested to be exonerated. 1 July- On the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from the UK to China, the Legislative Council (LegCo) building is stormed and broken into by protesters. 21 July- Protesters deface China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. That same night mobs of men wearing white shirts attack protesters and commuters in Yuen Long station, near mainland China, in a new escalation of violence. Tear gas fired at Hong Kong protesters.

"Man trapped in rocks off Norfolk coast rescuedFirefighters cut through the rock at Sheringham's east promenade to free the man, who was up to his neck in sea water.Norfolk","Emergency services were at the scene for more than three hours A man who had to be rescued after he got trapped in rocks had saved a toddler from the water as the tide came in on the Norfolk coast. The man, in his 20s, became stuck after rescuing one of his children near Sheringham's east promenade, senior coastguard Tony Garbutt said. He was up to his neck in the water for several hours and freed by firefighters who cut through the rock. Emergency services kept his head above water and gave him breathing apparatus. Mr Garbutt said the man sustained some injuries but they were not serious. The toddler was unharmed. HM Coastguard and Sheringham RNLI co-ordinated the rescue effort after the alarm was raised at 17:30 BST. Mr Garbutt said the man had been leaving the beach with his family when one of his children slipped. Then as he stepped over to grab the child the man slipped and became stuck. The coastguard earlier described the incident as ""a very frightening experience"". Spokesman Sam Stockdale said: ""It's such good news that this man has been freed. Everyone worked together on scene to look after the man and also to free him as soon as was practically possible.""

Gove: No-deal Brexit now 'assumed' by governmentMichael Gove says he expects the EU will not consider striking a new withdrawal deal with the UK.UK Politics,"Michael Gove, the newly appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, is in charge of preparing for a no-deal Brexit The government is now ""working on the assumption"" of a no-deal Brexit, Michael Gove has said. Mr Gove said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels but, writing in theSunday Times,external, he added: ""No deal is now a very real prospect."" The prime minister hasmade Mr Gove responsible for preparing for no-deal. Treasury sources say they expect more than Â£1bn of extra funding to be made available later this week for no-deal planning and preparation. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Chancellor Sajid Javid said there would be ""significant extra funding"" for 500 new Border Force officers and ""possible"" improved infrastructure at British ports. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Mr Gove to chair no-deal meetings seven days a week until Brexit is delivered, according to the Sunday Times. Mr Gove said tweaks to Theresa May's withdrawal agreement - which was approved by the EU but resoundingly rejected by Parliament - would not be enough. Brexit: What happens next? What is proroguing? ""You can't just reheat the dish that's been sent back and expect that will make it more palatable,"" he wrote. He added he hoped EU leaders might yet open up to the idea of striking a new deal, ""but we must operate on the assumption that they will not"". ""While we are optimistic about the future, we are realistic about the need to plan for every eventuality."" Mr Gove highlighted a major flaw of Mrs May's deal asthe Irish backstop plan- a measure designed to prevent the introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland. So far the backstop has proved a sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. A no-deal Brexit would mean the UK leaving the EU and cutting ties immediately, with no agreement in place. The UK would follow World Trade Organization rules if it wanted to trade with the EU and other countries, while also trying to negotiate free-trade deals. But with Britain outside the EU, there could be physical checkpoints to monitor people and goods crossing in and out of the UK. Speaking to Sky's Sophy Ridge, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would do everything to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He reiterated his call for a new referendum - insisting he would still hold one if Labour were in power - and said, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Labour would campaign to remain in the EU. Mr Corbyn also said he would look at whether to call a no-confidence vote in the government after Parliament returns in September. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson told Sky that, in the event of a general election, her party's message would be: ""Stop Brexit, stop Boris and start renewing our country."" Jo Swinson was elected Lib Dem leader earlier this week Mr Gove is one of several new ministers pressing on with Brexit preparations sincejoining Mr Johnson's cabinetearlier this week. Newly appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, told Sky: ""We're turbo-charging preparations for no-deal, that is now the government's number one priority."" He said if the EU would not reopen discussions about the Irish backstop plan then ""it's right that we prepare properly, with conviction, and importantly with the financial resources that the Treasury will now supply properly"". Who is in charge of what? Faces of the radically new cabinet Dominic Cummings and other key advisers Laura Kuenssberg's 10 things to consider over summer Meanwhile, there have been reports of more dissatisfaction within the Conservative Party, as MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit continue to consider ways to avoid it. The Observer alleges former chancellor Philip Hammond held private talks with Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer before Mr Johnson became prime minister. The pair met shortly after Mr Hammond resigned from the government, the paper said. Mr Starmer told the paper,externalthat work to build ""a strong cross-party alliance"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit would ""intensify over the summer"". But despite several Tory MPsvoicing their opposition to Mr Johnsonin his first week in Downing Street, an opinion poll has suggested a recent boost in support for the party. Since Mr Johnson took office on Wednesday the Conservatives have gained 10 points to stand at 30%, asurvey for the Mail on Sunday,externalshowed.

Verstappen wins in Germany as Hamilton crashes,"Red Bull's Max Verstappen took his second win of the year in a chaotic and incident-strewn German Grand Prix held in intermittent rain. The Dutchman led a topsy-turvy result in which Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel took second from last on the grid and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat was third. Lewis Hamilton had a day to forget, finishing 11th after two mistakes. But the Briton did not lose any ground to team-mate Valtteri Bottas in the championship after the Finn crashed. It was a dismal way for Mercedes to end a weekend when the team celebrated 125 years in motorsport and their 200th Formula 1 race. But the Mercedes drivers were not the only ones to fall foul of the treacherous conditions in a race that featured a remarkable six safety cars - two of them virtual - and the winner made five pit stops to change back and forth between wet and dry tyres. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc crashed when looking in strong shape for at least second place. Renault's Nico Hulkenberg went off at the same place, the treacherous penultimate corner, which was also where Hamilton made one of his errors. After the race Hamilton was classified as finishing ninth following 30-second penalties handed to the Alfa Romeos of Kimi Raikkonen and Antonio Giovinazzi for driver aid infringements. Hamilton therefore gained two points in the title race over Bottas. The action also ensured Williams scored an unlikely point for the first time this season, with Robert Kubica 10th. Unwell Hamilton is 'only human' German Grand Prix full race results Hard Drive: What happened to the woman who beat Hamilton in go-karts? Plenty of drivers came to grief on the slippery run-off area at the final corner. First Leclerc gets stuck, ironically, underneath a Mercedes advert... But don't get too smug; Hamilton joined the fun soon afterwards... ... subsequently spending nearly one agonising minute in the pits having his car fixed - before being handed a penalty for enterign the pit lane dangerously Through the chaos, Verstappen drove an almost flawless race, tracking the Mercedes in third place through the first half of the grand prix and then moving to the front as the world champions' race fell apart. Red Bull made all the strategy calls correctly and Verstappen judged the conditions perfectly to take a well-deserved victory which made him look the class of the field - although even he had a big spin, one corner before the bend that took out Leclerc, Hulkenberg and Hamilton. Mercedes' race began to unravel when Hamilton ran wide at the penultimate corner, slid across the slippery run-off and hit the wall. Unlike Leclerc, who had gone off into the gravel the lap before when looking poised to take second place and was unable to get out of it, Hamilton did rejoin the track but with a damaged front wing. Crazy racing: Who could have predicted this podium combination before lights out? He pulled straight into the pits, breaking the rules by going the wrong side of a bollard, and then spent 50 seconds stationary as the Mercedes mechanics - who had been expecting Bottas to come in - mirrored an episode of Wacky Races as they ran about trying to replace his front wing and find the right set of tyres, bumping into one another along the way. To make matters worse, the infringement with the bollard earned him a five-second penalty. He rejoined the track in fifth place and after the restart soon passed Alexander Albon's well-driven Toro Rosso for fourth and then Hulkenberg's Renault for third. But when Hulkenberg followed Leclerc and Hamilton into the wall after running wide at the second-last corner, there was another safety car, which went a long way to defining the finishing positions. Verstappen pitted for fresh intermediate tyres but Mercedes did not, a decision Hamilton immediately questioned, the team saying they did not want to have to serve the penalty then, even though it seemed the obvious thing to do. But shortly after the re-start on lap 46, with 18 laps to go, the track was drying and drivers pitted for dry-weather tyres. Mercedes left it a lap later for Hamilton than Verstappen and Bottas and he rejoined in 12th place. He asked the team: ""How did it go this bad?"" ""Copy that, Lewis,"" he was told by his race engineer Peter Bonnington, who said they would look into it later. Trying to make up lost ground, Hamilton then had a massive spin at Turn One with 11 laps to go, requiring him to stop again for fresh tyres. It looked like he had gifted Bottas a great opportunity to make up some serious ground in the championship but then the Finn made his own mistake at the first corner four laps after Hamilton. It was an error Bottas will probably rue for a very long time. Before the chaos, Mercedes were decked out in '50s clothes to celebrate their 200th race in Formula 1 - complete with white-livered cars At the opposite end of the scale, it was a remarkable day for Kvyat and Vettel - and redemption for both, in a way. Vettel returned to the track where he crashed out of the lead last year and - after a quiet race spent largely in the lower reaches of the top 10 - came alive in the closing laps. Fourth at the time of the final safety car following Bottas' crash, Vettel picked his way past McLaren's Carlos Sainz, Racing Point's Lance Stroll and Kvyat to take a superb second place. Stroll and Kvyat had found themselves up in second and third after their teams decided to pit them towards the end of the safety car period for Hulkenberg's crash. Kvyat, who has returned to F1 this season after being sacked by Red Bull at the end of 2017, passed Stroll to take second place but could not hold off Vettel's late charge. ""It was like a horror movie mixed with a black comedy,"" the Russian said - a quote that seemed to sum up the events of the day. Stroll fell behind Vettel but still managed an excellent fourth place for the team now owned by his father, while Sainz took fifth - another excellent race drive from the Spaniard, who escaped his own off at the penultimate   corner - and Albon a career-best finish of sixth halfway through his debut season. The Anglo-Thai was unfortunate - he was well ahead of Kvyat all race and running consistently in the points, but lost out when his team gambled on Kvyat pitting under the key safety car, while they left Albon out because he was running fourth. There was a treat for fans at Hockenheim as Mick Schumacher took his father Michael's championship-winning Ferrari F2004 around the circuit for a spin Vettel's performance was a much-needed boost for Ferrari after a nightmare weekend. Both cars went out of qualifying with engine problems, leaving Leclerc 10th on the grid and Vettel last. Leclerc had made good progress in the opening laps and Ferrari's strategists had put him in a great position with perfect strategy calls in the first half of the race. But he ran wide at the penultimate corner on lap 28, just after gambling on dry-weather tyres on a drying track. He got on to the slippery run-off, which seemed to be covered with a kind of film of soap, and slid into the gravel, his wheels spinning as he vainly fought to extricate himself. ""It was very slippery but the only thing I can say is I think it is unacceptable to have this kind of Tarmac. It is like a dragster track and once you go on it is very dangerous,"" Leclerc said. ""I take full responsibility for the mistake but I believe this kind of Tarmac shouldn't be on a Formula 1 track."" Verstappen won the public vote, and he was the outstanding driver from the top teams. But I'm going to give it to Albon, for an excellent drive in his first wet grand prix. Attacking Hamilton at one point, he was sixth in the end, after a small mistake at the final restart, but only lost out to Kvyat because of team tactics Only a week to wait until the next instalment, the Hungarian Grand Prix. It is a track where Hamilton has always excelled and where Mercedes will be strong. It will have to go some to surpass the thrills and spills of Hockenheim. The last time Kvyat and Vettel shared a podium there were handbags aplenty. At the Chinese Grand Prix in 2016, Vettel was furious with Kvyat's aggressive overtake on the first lap and criticised the Russian before the podium ceremony - who promptly ignored him and sprayed him with champagne anyway Verstappen: ""It was amazing to win, it was really tricky out there to make the right calls, you had to be focused. I made a nice 360, I enjoyed that. It was about trying to not make too many mistakes. You learn over the years I'm very happy with the result."" Vettel:""It was a long race at some stage it felt never ending. It was very fun, it was tough with the conditions and tough to read what was the smartest move. Before the last safety car it was straight-forward, I was fast and could time it right and people were being cautious into the first corner and I had DRS and I could get the moves in the back straight."" Kvyat:""It was amazing to be back on the podium. Incredible with Toro Rosso to bring a podium back to the team is amazing. I'm really happy. It was a horror movie with a black comedy. At some point i thought the race was done, but it was incredible, a rollercoaster, just like my career.""

Tear gas fired at protest in HK shopping area,"This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake described the ""chaos"" on the streets as police fired tear gas Hong Kong has seen a second day of violent clashes between police and pro-democracy demonstrators who are also angry at alleged police brutality. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters trying to reach the Chinese government's office. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken over streets near Sai Wan and Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island. Hong Kong has seen eight consecutive weekends of anti-government and pro-democracy protests. It is ranked as one of the safest cities in the world - but recent protests have been followed by violent clashes between demonstrators, police and masked men wielding sticks suspected of being criminal gang members. The background you need on the protests Were triads involved in the attacks? Police fire tear gas at Yuen Long protest Sunday's protests saw activists wearing protective helmets and goggles erecting barricades at several different locations and chanting ""free Hong Kong"". The protests began as a police-authorised gathering in a park in the central business district before protesters defied the authorities and marched west towards the Chinese liaison office in Sai Wan and east towards the Causeway Bay shopping area. Hundreds of police blocked the protesters from reaching the Chinese liaison office. The building had been fortified with plastic barricades and a Chinese government emblem above the front door had been covered with a plastic shield, Reuters news agency reported. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets Last Sunday the office was targeted by protesters who wrote graffiti and threw paint on its walls. Chinese officials said this was a challenge to Beijing's authority that would not be tolerated. Some protesters chanted ""reclaim Hong Kong"" and ""revolution of our times"", or held up banners that read ""end the violence"". Meanwhile in the Causeway Bay shopping area, protesters with helmets and masks waited for police as tourists carrying shopping bags, including many from mainland China, continued to walk the streets.

Demonstrations began when the Hong Kong government introduced a controversial bill that would have enabled extraditions to mainland China. Protesters took over major roads in the financial and shopping districts There were clashes near China's liaison office in the territory It sparked huge protests as critics feared the bill would undermine Hong Kong's freedoms, and be used to target political activists. The row intensified as police were accused of using excessive force on anti-extradition bill protesters. Tensions increased further last Sunday, when suspected triad members descended on a subway station in Yuen Long, beating protesters, passersby and journalists with sticks. Demonstrators accused the police of colluding with the triads - claims angrily denied by the police. The authorities say they have arrested 12 people over the attack, including nine men with links to triads. This video can not be played A large group of masked men in white T-shirts stormed Yuen Long station The anti-extradition protests have morphed over time into a wider movement. While the government has paused work on the extradition bill, protesters now want it withdrawn completely, as well as an independent inquiry into police violence, and democratic reform. They want the territory's leader, Carrie Lam, who is not democratically elected, and whose handling of the crisis has been widely criticised, to resign. Some protesters have also expressed their anger at the mainland Chinese government, which they say has been eroding freedoms in Hong Kong. Last week, demonstrators stormed the Chinese government's office and defaced the national emblem. The authorities have now installed a protective casing around the sign. As a former British colony, Hong Kong has its own legal and judicial systems, and has been promised ""a high degree of autonomy"" from the Chinese government, except in foreign and defence affairs. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) does have troops stationed in Hong Kong, but they are not expected to interfere in local issues. However, the law does permit Hong Kong's government to request assistance from the PLA for purposes of maintaining public order, or disaster relief. Last week China's defence ministry spokesman condemned protesters who had vandalised the government's offices, and said there were ""clear stipulations"" in the law allowing Hong Kong's leaders to ask the army for help. Hong Kong's government and police have stated in recent weeks that they have no plans to involve the army - while some commentators argue that China would consider using its troops in Hong Kong to be too politically risky. 3 April- Hong Kong government introduces amendments to the city's extradition laws to the legislature that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China. 9 June- In the first of many huge protests against the changes, an estimated million people march to government headquarters. 12 June- Anti-extradition bill protesters block roads and try to storm government buildings - police fire  tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at protesters, in the worst violence the city has seen in decades. 15 June- Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam indefinitely delays the bill in a dramatic reversal. 16 June- Despite this, an estimated two million people take to the streets demanding the complete withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into alleged police violence, and Carrie Lam's resignation. 21 June- As anger grows towards police, protests blockade police headquarters for 15 hours. They now also want protesters that were arrested to be exonerated. 1 July- On the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from the UK to China, the Legislative Council (LegCo) building is stormed and broken into by protesters. 21 July- Protesters deface China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
