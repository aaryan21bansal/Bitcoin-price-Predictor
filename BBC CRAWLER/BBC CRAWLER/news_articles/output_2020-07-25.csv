Indoor gyms and pools in England start to reopen,"This video can not be played The BBC's Katy Austin on the new safety measures at a gym that has reopened in Twickenham Indoor gyms, swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities have seen a cautious return of customers as they reopen their doors for the first time since March. Gym-goer Jamelah May said it was great to be one of the first people through the doors of her south-west London gym. ""As well as physically getting back to where I want to be, mentally it's had a massive impact,"" she said. However, it's thought at least a third of public facilities have stayed shut. The leisure sector has warned it will still struggle because of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. How are indoor gyms and pools going to open? 'I can't wait to be back on the squat rack' Gyms that reopen must follow strict hygiene and social distancing measures, such as limiting the number of people using the facility and spacing out equipment. Facilities should also reduce class sizes and ensure adequate ventilation, according to governmentguidance issued earlier this month,external. Jamelah May, who has been going to the same gym for 12 years, said she didn't sleep last night because she was so excited to come back Outdoor gyms and pools have been open in England since 4 July because there is less risk of catching coronavirus outdoors. Indoor gyms in Northern Ireland opened earlier this month, but they remain closed in Scotland and Wales. Swim England has publishedits own guidance,externalfor operators on how to reopen indoor pools, including implementing a one-way entry and exit system. Its chief executive Jane Nickerson said financial problems meant less than 20% of pools will reopen this weekend. The cost of heating the pools and implementing the new guidelines, as well as the reduced footfall and fewer swimming lessons, mean many cannot afford to open, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She also called on the government to give more financial support to struggling pools, saying the money would also help withits plan to tackle obesity. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed gyms and sports facilities will not reopen in Luton or Blackburn with Darwen due to an increase in coronavirus cases in those areas. This video can not be played The BBC's Mike Bushell explores new safety measures at the London Aquatics Centre Luke Willmott, manager of the Castle Gym in Nottingham, said his gym was at capacity by about 06:25 BST, and it was ""only right for people to have a choice"" to return. He said returning members are being advised to spray equipment with sanitiser before, during and after use - but there were ""loads"" of membership cancellations during lockdown. ""I think it's down to people's circumstances,"" he said. ""A lot of our community have supported us which has been fantastic... but it has been a struggle."" Michelle and Tomasz used to train in the gym together. But the couple from Putney, south-west London, have come to different conclusions about whether to go back now that it's reopened. Michelle has cancelled her membership and says she won't return for the foreseeable future, while Tomasz is already out the door for his first gym session since lockdown began. ""I work in the leisure industry - I still don't believe it's 100% safe,"" says Michelle. ""There is a lot of equipment crammed in there and the gym doesn't have very good ventilation."" Instead, she's been using resistance bands and training outside. But for Tomasz, who used to do bodybuilding in Poland, the gym is part of his lifestyle. ""To not have that, it affects his mindset,"" Michelle says. ""Training outside doesn't do it for him. I can't stop him going to the gym and he can't make me go!"" Paul Douglas-Smith, manager of the Littlehampton Wave swimming pool, said the facility can now take 40 swimmers at once, down from more than 130 before the pandemic. He said the pool will be hit financially, and is aiming for a ""staged return"". ""We're looking at the fitness swimmers first and then we're looking at the family and the junior swimming. That will probably follow in the next two or three weeks,"" he said. Despite the relaxed rules, industries bodies have warned many facilities could be forced to close amid the pandemic. Community Leisure UK, the members' association that specialises in representing charitable leisure and culture trusts across England, Scotland and Wales, estimates that 48% of all public leisure facilities face closure, meaning as many as 1,300 could disappear by the end of the year, along with more than 58,000 jobs. By Katy Austin, BBC News business correspondent Some fitness clubs saw queues outside their doors this morning and members we spoke to said they were overjoyed to be back. However, it's inevitable some people do not yet feel ready to exercise around others indoors. The fortunes of gyms, pools and leisure centres depend on instilling confidence in the safety measures they've put in place, as well as how much people are prepared to spend at a time of economic uncertainty. Membership cancellation rates have reached 15-23% due to the impact of the pandemic, trade body UKActive said. Meanwhile, online classes and home equipment sales have boomed. Today is an important milestone, but not all venues can afford to open straight away under the new arrangements. UKActive said support will still be needed with costs such as back-dated rent in coming months. The District Councils' Network (DCN) is also warning of the ""uncertain future"" faced by gyms and leisure centres, pointing out that the sector is expected to lose about Â£305m this year. The DCN, which represents 187 district councils in England that provide leisure services, is calling on the Treasury to provide a rescue package to save leisure centres from collapse. Leisure centres and indoor gyms, along with swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities were closed on 21 March as part of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

What your holiday will be like,"Beaches around Europe have seen an influx of holidaymakers since June when many countries lifted border restrictions The prospect of a holiday abroad is on the cards again, after the UK government eased quarantine rules. People returning to the UK from certain countries do not need to self-isolate. The full lists of the countries that are exempt from the quarantine rule are here forEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Here are details of what to expect when you're in some of the most popular warm weather destinations for Britons. Englandâs quarantine-free list of places published Which countries can I travel to? Where can I now go on holiday in the UK? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Need to quarantine on arrival?No Need to quarantine when back in UK?Yes Spainis the most popular destinationfor Britons on their summer holidays, and 400,000 people from the UK own second homes in the country. It had one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe,recording 28,355 coronavirus deaths,externalup to the end of June. Since then, its borders have reopened to tourists butit is currently facing the worst coronavirus infection ratein Western Europe. Daily cases have risen from fewer than 150 in June to more than 1,500 throughout August. As of 26 July, people returning from Spain to the UK must quarantine for 14 days. In addition, the Foreign Office is now also advising against all but essential travel to Spain, including the Balearic and Canary Islands. Some beaches - like Cala Aiguablava Beach near Girona - remain busy Visitors arriving from the UKwill not be required,externalto self-isolate - but you will have to give your contact details and undergo a temperature check and health check on arrival at the airport. People must stay 1.5m apart in public. Everyone aged six and over should wear face masks in public spaces where it is not possible to follow the 1.5m distance rule. However, different provinces in Spain have introduced different measures. For example, masks are compulsory everywhere, even when the social distancing rule can be followed, in areas including Madrid, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. Some areas have also reintroduced lockdowns after local outbreaks. In July, parts of Catalonia - including Barcelona -faced new restrictions,with cinemas, theatres and nightclubs temporarily closed. Smoking in public spacesis also bannedin areas such as Galicia and the Canary Islands. German tourists are greeted by receptionists at a hotel in Ronda, in Spain's AndalucÃ­a region Hotels and other accommodation, such as campsites and hostels, are open - but they are required to put in place capacity limits so all guests can stay 1.5m apart. In most of Spain,barsandrestaurantsare open but are running at reduced capacity and must follow strict social distancing rules.Nightclubsare also open, although capacity is limited and  people must provide contact details and wear masks. Exhibitions, theatres and cinemashave reopened, again with reduced capacity. Outdoor concerts of up to 400 people are allowed with social distancing measures in place. Visitors are able to go to thebeaches,while mostwater parks, zoos, museumsandtheme parkshave reopened to a limited number of visitors. Two of Spain's most visited sites,Barcelona's Sagrada Familia cathedraland theAlhambra Palace near Granada,have already welcomed tourists back. This video can not be played Spain's Alhambra Palace reopens to visitors The country is open to tourists entering by car, ferry, train or air. However, some travel companies, including Jet2 and Tui have cancelled flights and holidays to mainland Spain, as well as the Balearic and Canary Islands, since the UK government changed its guidance. British Airways and Ryanair continue to operate scheduled flights to Spain. Need to quarantine on arrival?Not currently, but Francehas suggested,externalmeasures are to be introduced Need to quarantine when back in UK?Yes, quarantine measures were imposed on travellers arriving in the UK from France from 15 August at 04:00 BST France is the second-most popular country for UK visitors, with around 17 million crossing the Channel every year. Some 200,000 Britons have chosen it as the place for a second home. The country began to ease its strict lockdown on 11 May. President Emmanuel Macron declared on 14 June that France had won its ""first victory"" against the virus as he lifted more restrictions, which has recorded more than 30,000 deaths. A quarantine-free travel corridor was established between the UK and France in early July, but after a surge in cases in August,the UK government changed its travel advice,requiring people arriving from France to self-isolate. Tables and deckchairs are set out to respect social distancing on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice People should remain 1m apart, andno more than 10 people may gather in any public space.,external You also have to wear a maskin all enclosed public spaces.When travelling by train, you need to make a reservation in advance. France is one of several European countries to tighten coronavirus restrictions in August, amid a rise in infections - particularly among younger people. Paris and Marseille are among those areas now deemed so-called ""red zones"" - high risk areas where local authorities have extra powers to impose restrictions. In both cities, masks are now compulsory in all public spaces. Hotels, gites, and campsites have reopened, as well as private rental accommodation. Disneyland Paris, one of Europe's top visitor attractions, has reopened Bars,restaurantsandcafesare allowed to open inside and outside areas, but they have to follow strict hygiene rules. Customers are asked to wear a face covering when walking inside, but this can be removed when seated. No service is allowed at the bar and a distance of 1m is kept between tables. There is a limit of 5,000 people for large venues and strict health rules apply forshowsandcinemas. Nightclubsremain closed. Beachesandparkshave reopened, and you can now sunbathe or have a picnic, and play non-contact sports.River cruiseshave been allowed since 11 July. Museums, monuments, zoosandtheme parksare gradually opening their doors again - but a mask is required to visit. The Eiffel Tower started allowing visitors on 25 June. Disneyland Paris began a phased reopening on 15 July. Somewater parkshave new rules in place. For example Aqualand, which has eight sites across the country, has advised visitors to arrive in their swimming costumes to avoid contamination in changing areas. It remains possible to get to France by air, sea or train. If arriving by Eurotunnel, travellers are being asked to fill out and carry with them a statement certifying that they do not have any coronavirus symptoms. The major airlines, Ryanair, EasyJet and British Airways, all continue to fly to France, although at a lower frequency than normal. A variety of routes across the Channel are on offer from ferry companies at reduced capacity, but since the re-imposition of quarantine measures in August, some companieshave reduced passenger services. Need to quarantine on arrival?No Need to quarantine when back in UK?No Italy, which surpassed 35,000 virus-related deaths in July, imposed one of the strictest and earliest lockdowns on 7 March. The first European country to be hit hard by the virus, it isthe third-most visited destination,externalfor UK travellers annually. Italy reopened its borders on 3 June to travellers from other European countries, although the mayor of the island of Caprihas complained that visitors haven't been obeying the rules at its hotels and beaches.,external Attractions like the Colosseum in Rome are open for business again The country's tourist board has releasedan extensive list of guidelines for visitors,externalthis summer. In four regions - Sardinia, Sicily, Puglia and Calabria - tourists arerequired to register in advance.,external People must stay 1m apart in public areas, including hotels and other communal spaces. In most parts of the country, holidaymakers over the age of six will need to wear a mask at all times in public spaces indoors, and outdoors where social distancing isn't possible. However, in Lombardy - the area around Milan, and the location of Italy's original coronavirus outbreak - a mask outdoors is mandatory at all times. On public transport travellers will be required to wear masks, while temperature scanners may be in operation at train stations and airports. Hotels, campsites, mountain huts and beach resorts have made arrangements to safely welcome visitors. However,an Italian hotel industry trade report said 60% stayed closed in June,,externalwith about 20% reportedly deciding not open their doors again this summer. Tourists at the Leaning Tower of Pisa have to wear face masks and an electronic device which sends out signals and sounds if anyone gets within 1m Bars,cafes, restaurantsandgelateriasreopened on 18 May, but they are hosting reduced numbers of diners, with tables further apart and plastic shields to separate customers. Masks must be worn when you go inside and anytime you get up from your table. Many venues are asking customers to provide their name and contact details before using their services. Parksandbeacheshave reopened, along withswimming pools,although the tourist board says you need to wear a swim cap in a pool. Mostmuseums,galleriesandarchaeological sitesare open, but entry must be pre-booked online. Capacity has been vastly reduced at some major tourist sites, like the Colosseum in Rome and the Uffizi gallery in Florence. Amusement parks, zoos, fun fairsandwater parksare also open but entrance numbers may be limited. Airlines running flights include Ryanair, EasyJet and British Airways, although the number of destinations and flights is markedly reduced. Need to quarantine on arrival?No Need to quarantine when back in UK?No Greece acted swiftly to impose lockdown in late February, and it was first eased in late April. As of 27 August, it had a total of 9,280 confirmed cases and a death toll of 248, according to Johns Hopkins University. Its tourism season officially began on 15 June and it has already opened its borders to some countries. But British travellers had to wait after a ban on flights from the UK was extended. Since 15 July, British holidaymakers can now fly there, butmay be asked to take a test,externaland practice social distancing and self-monitor for coronavirus symptoms until they get a negative result (usually within 24 hours). If the test result is positive Greek authorities are likely to ask you to self-isolate for 14 days. Greek islands like Santorini are a big draw for tourists People should aim to stay 1.5m apart and face masksmust be worn,externalon public transport - including flights and ferries - at airports, in shops, cafes, hairdressers, government offices, lifts and taxis. Masks are also strongly advised in other closed spaces. Travelling in a car or taxi is limited to a maximum of three adult passengers as well as the driver, although children do not count towards the limit. Restaurants and cafes have been open for a while in Greece All hotels, campsites and Airbnb accommodation are allowed to reopen. Hotels can run at capacity but they have specific rules, including having a doctor on standby. Reception desks must also be moved outdoors where possible, and food served in buffets must be placed under protective acrylic screens known as sneeze guards.Read more on what Greek hotels might be like here. Shops, cafes, bars, restaurantsandnightclubsare now able to reopen but with limits on capacity. No more than six adults can sit at a table together, although children are exempt. Beachesandparkshave also opened.Swimming poolscan open but the number allowed in will depend on the size of the pool, while water slides may be shut. Most tourist attractions, includingmuseums, zoos, gardensandtheme parksare up and running again, whilearchaeological sitessuch as the country's world-renowned Acropolis in Athens have also reopened. The Acropolis Museum in Athens has reopened The major airlines have gradually reinstated flights to Greece, althoughthey had to cancel some flights in the first half of July,externalwhen the Greek government extended its travel ban for UK citizens. For those nationalities allowed to enter, travel to the Greek islands is also possible, although passengers will need to complete a health questionnaire before boarding or take temperature checks. It is obligatory to wear masks when travelling on all ferries, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing. Need to quarantine on arrival?No, but arriving in mainland Portugal you will be subject to health screening and travellers to Madeira, Porto Santo and the Azores will be tested on entry Need to quarantine when back in UK?No Like Greece, Portugal has had fewer coronavirus cases and deaths than some other European nations. After initially lifting restrictions, it later reintroduced some of the rules following local outbreaks in Lisbon. As of 27 August, it had a total of 56,274 confirmed cases and a death toll of 1,809, according to Johns Hopkins University. British tourists usually flock to beaches like this one in the Algarve People must keep 2m away from others,externaland there are capacity rules in shops and on public transport. Face masks are compulsory in enclosed spaces such as shops and on public transport for everyone over the age of 10. Drinking alcohol in public places, except for pavement cafes and restaurants, is banned. Gatherings are limited to 20 people, except for religious ceremonies and family events, such as weddings and christenings. The Greater Lisbon area is in a state of contingency due to localised outbreaks. Restrictions currently in place include gatherings are limited to 10 people, while shops have to close at 8pm. Tourism accommodation that meets the so-called""Clean and Safe"" hygiene standard,externalare allowed to open. Portugal has recently seen a rise in new cases around Lisbon Restaurants, cafesandbarsare allowed to open,externalwith capacity rules and 2m distancing in place. Last orders are at 11pm. It is up to the local area whethermarketswill open. Beachesare open but with measures in place to limit capacity and people must stay 2m apart. There is a mobile app to assess how full beaches are. Water sportshave also been given the green light. Museums, art galleries, monuments, palacesandhistoricbuildingshave all reopened, as well aszoos. Many flight routes between the UK and Portugal have already resumed. Need to quarantine on arrival?Yes, but British nationals are not allowed in anyway Need to quarantine when back in UK?Yes Holidays to the US are still not a likely prospect.British nationals are not allowed to enter the USA,externalif they have been in the UK (or a number of other countries) within the past two weeks. Those who are eligible to enter the US - such as US citizens flying in from the UK - must be prepared to quarantine for 14 days. Even US travellers arriving from some US states must quarantine. And, since the US is not exempt from the UK's quarantine, anyone returning to the UK will have to self-isolate for 14 days. What's more, the Foreign Office still advises against non-essential travel to the US. The US has reported more than 5.8 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 179,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. Disney has shut its resort in Hong Kong, but its Florida one is open Well, it varies state by state. You cancheck individual states' rules here,external. A number of US states have now made face masks compulsory while in public. Social distancing of 2mis recommended by the USA's Center for Disease Control and Prevention.,external Hotelsare reopening across the country,the Foreign Office says,,externalbut there will be local rules on capacity. Again, it depends on the state.Shops, restaurants, bars, beachesand otherleisure activitiesare likely to be following local regulations. California - a popular holiday destination for Britons - reintroduced sweeping restrictions on 13 July following a surge in cases. It ordered all indoor restaurants, bars, shopping malls and cinemas to close again. Churches, gyms, shopping malls, zoos, museums, hair salons and non-essential offices must shut indoor operations in some of the state's worst-affected counties, including Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Florida - another popular destination -is fast becoming the centre of America's latest Covid-19 outbreak.However, its Disney World resort reopened with limited capacity on 11 July. Supermarket chain Walmart announced it would make all customers wear masks Some flights are running between the UK and US, but on a reduced schedule and at higher than usual prices. You can also return to the UK from these destinations without needing to isolate,as well as many others listed here.,external Turkey:It reopened its borders to UK visitors on 12 June, and passengers are required to complete a form before arriving. Face masks are compulsory in crowded places and on public transport.In certain provinces,,externalface masks are compulsory at all times outside the home. Those aged over 65 (although this doesn't apply to those visiting for tourism) require a permit to travel between cities and must remain at their destination for a minimum of 30 days unless travelling for an international flight. Germany:The country is open to travellers from the UK, but people must keep a distance of 1.5m. Face masks are required in some public spaces but itvaries by state.,externalAll shops, tourist accommodation and restaurants are open - but bars and cafes in some states are shut. Travellers using Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg airport to return to the UK will transit France and therefore will be required to self-isolate. Switzerland:Self-isolation rules might change soon for travellers returning from Switzerland to the whole of the UK,following Scotland's decision to tell people to self-isolate on their return. Social distancing here is 1.5m. Most places are back open including shops, restaurants, bars and cafes. Masks are compulsory when travelling on public transport, except for children under 12. In the Alps, mountain railways and cable cars are running. Australia:Its bordersare closed,externalto foreign nationals, and all travellers entering must undergo a 14-day quarantine.

Did Sweden's strategy succeed or fail?,"Brightly coloured beach towels line the shores of Lake Storsjon, two hours north of Stockholm. Staycations are popular here this summer, thanks to a slew of travel restrictions imposed on Sweden by other countries, due to its coronavirus infection rate. More than 5,500 people have died with Covid-19 in this country of just 10 million. It is one of the highest death rates relative to population size in Europe, and by far the worst among the Nordic nations. Unlike Sweden, the rest all chose to lock down early in the pandemic. ""Maybe we should have taken some more care of each other,"" says Dan Eklund, 31, visiting the lake on his friend's boat. Latest figures suggest Sweden is getting better at containing the virus. The number of daily reported deaths has been in single digits for much of July, in contrast with the peak of the pandemic in April, when more than 100 fatalities were logged on several dates. There has also been a marked fall in serious cases, with new intensive care admissions dropping to fewer than a handful each day. Though still not as low as elsewhere in Scandinavia, it's a clear improvement. ""It feels good. I mean, finally, we are where we hoped we would be much earlier on,"" says Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist leading the strategy.He's admitted too many have died, especially in Swedish care homes. But he believes there is still ""no strong evidence that a lockdown would have made that much of a difference"". Sweden has largely relied on voluntary social distancing guidelines since the start of the pandemic, including working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. There's also been a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people, restrictions on visiting care homes, and a shift to table-only service in bars and restaurants. The government has repeatedly described the pandemic as ""a marathon not a sprint"", arguing that its measures are designed to last in the long term. Dan Eklund (R) says ""maybe we should have taken some more care of each other"" The unusual strategy has attracted global criticism, with even some of Dr Tegnell's early supporters saying they now regret the approach. Annika Linde, who did his job between 2005 and 2013, recently told Sweden's biggest daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter she believed tougher restrictions at the start of the pandemic could have saved lives. But according to clinical epidemiologist Helena Nordenstedt, there's no consensus in Sweden's scientific community that the strategy as a whole has failed. Anders Tegnell says his modelling indicates that, on average, Swedes have around 30% of the social interactions they did prior to the pandemic. And a survey released this week by Sweden's Civil Contingencies Agency suggests 87% of the population are continuing to follow social distancing recommendations to the same extent as they were one or two weeks earlier, up from 82% a month ago. Restaurant manager Shiar Ali says not everyone is adhering to social distancing guidelines Nordenstedt believes since Swedes have had longer to adjust how they act in public than countries that went into lockdown, this could help Sweden to mitigate a potential second wave. ""People are not as exhausted as they might be in other countries where the restrictions have been much wider and much stricter."" But while Swedes are aware of the guidelines, there have been reports of large gatherings and mingling in some tourist hotspots since domestic travel restrictions were relaxed last month. ""We try to tell them and show them to keep their distance,"" says Shiar Ali, a manager at one of the beachfront restaurants on Lake Storsjorn. ""Especially young men and young people, they don't care about it."" Sweden's authorities never said achieving herd immunity was their goal, but they did argue that by keeping more of society open, Swedes would be more likely to develop a resistance to Covid-19. Five months into Europe's pandemic and only 6% of the population here is known to have antibodies, according to Swedish Public Health Agency research. However, Anders Tegnell believes the true figure is ""definitely a lot higher"", as immunity ""has proven to be surprisingly difficult to measure"". Eva Britt Landin (right) backs Sweden's approach ""because nobody knows exactly how we should do it"" The state epidemiologist points to recent research by the Karolinska Institute that found even people testing negative for coronavirus antibodies had specific T-cells which can provide immunity by identifying and destroying infected cells. But other Swedish scientists are more cautious about predicting resistance to the virus. ""I think he is overconfident,"" says Helena Nordenstedt. ""We can all hope it will have an effect on the infection case numbers in Sweden during the fall, but we don't know yet."" The strategy was not designed to protect the economy either, but the government argued keeping more of society open could limit job losses and mitigate the impact on business. Research from Scandinavian bank SEB in April suggested Swedes were spending at a higher rate than consumers in neighbouring Nordic nations. Despite this, various forecasts predict the Swedish economy will still shrink by about 5% this year. That's less than other countries hit hard by Covid-19 such as Italy, Spain and the UK, but still similar to the rest of Scandinavia. Sweden's unemployment rate of 9% remains the highest in the Nordics, up from 7.1% in March. Though more businesses stayed open than in other countries, forecasts predict the Swedish economy will still shrink by about 5% this year ""Sweden, like the other Nordic countries, is a small, open economy, very dependent on trade. So the Swedish economy tends to do poorly when the rest of the world is doing poorly,"" explains Prof Karolina Ekholm, a former Deputy Governor of Sweden's central bank. Restaurants, shops and gyms have been allowed to remain open, but they have still struggled to attract customers, she says. But she does believe the right call was made to keep schools open for under-16s. In the short term, Sweden's Covid strategy is affecting its usually close relationship with its neighbours. Norway, Denmark and Finland opened their borders to one another in June, but excluded Sweden due to its high infection rate, although Swedes from less affected regions have since been given more freedom to visit Denmark. A YouGov survey last month found that 71% of Norwegians and 61% of Danes were concerned about keeping Swedish tourists away, a higher number than for visitors from countries like Spain, Italy and the UK. ""I don't think this will affect the relations in the longer term,"" says Helen Lindberg, a senior lecturer in government at Uppsala University. ""But it has highlighted or brought back old grievances between our countries."" A bigger problem could be the impact on Sweden's wider international reputation for high-quality state health and elderly care, she believes. ""There has been a blow to the Swedish image of being this humanitarian superpower in the world. Our halo has been knocked down, and we have a lot to prove now."" At the start of the pandemic, there was a consensus that Sweden's state scientists should be trusted to guide political decisions. But debates sharpened as the death toll increased, especially in care homes, and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven recently announced a coronavirus commission to look into the response from authorities at a national, regional and local level. What's going wrong in Sweden's care homes? Helen Lindberg believes the strategy has called into question a historic reliance on public agencies to inform policies and highlighted a lack of preparedness for crises. ""It's a perfect storm for our weak, minority government,"" she says. When it comes to the pandemic, polls suggest Swedes have more confidence in the Public Health Agency than in their government Just 45% of Swedes now have confidence in the government's ability to handle the pandemic, according to a Novus survey last month, down from 63% in April. Confidence in the Public Health Agency has also dipped, but remains at a much higher 65%, compared with 73% at the peak of the pandemic. ""We believe they have the right strategy, because nobody knows exactly how we should do it,"" says holidaymaker Eva Britt Landin, 66, who's having a socially-distanced lunch with her 102-year-old father at Lake Storsjorn, But Catherina Eriksson, 42, who's visiting from Stockholm, says the jury is still out.

Magaluf: Partying Brits force strip to close,"This time of year Magaluf is usually packed with tourists. Punta Ballena also known as the ""strip"" is where you might head out for a drink, bite to eat and then onto a nightclub. But the authorities have decided to close it because people aren't following social distancing rules. The Mayor of CalviÃ , Alfonso RodrÃ­guez said: ""We understand the concern, even the anger, of the affected business owners."" The move comes after videos showing German and British tourists partying in packed bars without face masks. There was also a video of a man jumping up and down on a parked car. The Mayor says he supports the decision to close, made by the Balearic Islands Regional Government. ""Public health is really important,"" he said while reassuring people that it's a ""safe destination"". Three areas are closing altogether until September, including in the Palma Beach area, two streets known as Calle de la Cerveza and Calle del Jamon. Laura works in Sinky's bar in Magaluf Laura works in Sinky's Scottish pub in Magaluf. She's told Radio 1 Newsbeat she's always in fear of doing something wrong. ""We're on the same street as BCM - one of the big nightclubs but they're not allowed to open."" The bar she works in is still open. ""We've been open since 11 May but the people who aren't allowed on the strip, they'll be coming into us and you struggle and I feel like I'm on edge all the time."" Since European borders reopened in July, the local government has wanted to market the islands as a safe place to visit. Last week it became the second Spanish region to make face masks compulsory even when social distance can be guaranteed. Laura says some people aren't taking the rules seriously enough. ""I feel the bars are finding it really hard to control the people and this is why they've closed down the main strip."" She says it's ""sad for people who have just started working again,"" but understands why it's happened. A Feel Summer event in the summer of 2019 in Magaluf Mark Bottomley, one of the owners of Feel Summer - a company that sells tickets to festivals - pool parties and clubs on the Island, says they've had to cancel all their events. ""Due to the actions of a few tourists, businesses on the party strip are now going to suffer,"" Mark said. ""We do feel this is a little extreme as it's unfair to tarnish every single company with the same brush. ""However, it is apparent that tourists also have a part to play in acting responsibly and with respect for the resort and locals that live here in Magaluf."" People who had been planning to go on holiday to Magaluf have been posting on Facebook that they may have to change their plans. At the moment it's only the strip that has closed and the square in Magaluf is still open where there are lots of bars. The local council says, as it stands the strip will be closed for two months but it it could be lifted if the circumstances change for the better.

"Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green dies aged 73The British-American rock band's influential guitarist died peacefully in his sleep, his family says.","Peter Green performed at a charity event at London's Royal Albert Hall in 2004 Fleetwood Mac co-founder and influential blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died aged 73. Solicitors acting on behalf of his family said in a statement: ""It is with great sadness that the family of Peter Green announce his death this weekend, peacefully in his sleep. ""A further statement will be provided in the coming days."" Green, from Bethnal Green in east London, formed Fleetwood Mac with drummer Mick Fleetwood in 1967. They came together after Green's stint filling in for Eric Clapton in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Green and Fleetwood then convinced John McVie to join the band as bass guitarist, in part by naming the band Fleetwood Mac. He wrote the instantly recognisable instrumental track Albatross, which remains the band's only number one hit, plus two other early hits, Black Magic Woman and Oh Well. And it was under Green's direction that they produced their first three albums. The band's debut album was released in 1968. Simply called Fleetwood Mac, but also known as Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, it gained widespread acclaim and reached number four in the charts. Obituary: From humble beginnings to Blues fame Green left the band after a last performance in 1970 as he struggled with his mental health. He was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia and spent time in hospital in the mid-70s. He married Jane Samuels in January 1978. They divorced in 1979 and share a daughter. Green was among the eight members of the band - along with Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, John McVie, Christine McVie, Danny Kirwan and Jeremy Spencer - who were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. The news of his death comes days after Fleetwood Mac announced they would release aretrospective box set,externaldocumenting the band's early years between 1969 and 1974. Musicians have led tributes to Green. David Coverdale, the lead singer of Whitesnake, said he was an artist he ""truly loved and admired"".

Man of the world, oh well, albatross, need your love so bad. Some of my favourites songs and performances of all time. Thank you for the music."" Actor David Morrissey praised Green's ""fantastic soulful voice"" while Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler described Green as ""one of the greats"". And Scottish musician Midge Ure tweeted: ""One of the great ones gone. You taught me well."" Peter Green was one of the greatest Blues guitarists Britain ever produced. His shape-shifting riffs and long, improvisational excursions made Fleetwood Mac one of the most exciting live bands of the 1960s Blues explosion. He first picked up a hand-me-down guitar at the age of 10 and, like many of his peers, began to devour the import vinyl that trickled into the UK from the US. He studied the greats - Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy and BB King - combining their tensely coiled playing style with the shimmering vibrato of The Shadows' Hank Marvin. But he actually started his professional career as a bassist, until an encounter with Eric Clapton persuaded him to ditch the instrument. ""I decided to go back on lead guitar after seeing him with the Bluesbreakers. He had a Les Paul, his fingers were marvellous. The guy knew how to do a bit of evil, I guess.""

Rapper Wiley dropped over anti-Semitic posts,"Rapper Wiley has been dropped by his management following anti-Semitic posts on his social media accounts. Wiley's Twitter account has been temporarily locked while Instagram said it had deleted some of his content, after a long series of posts on both platforms on Friday and Saturday. The social media giants are facing growing pressure to close his accounts. Police said they were looking at ""relevant material"" as critics accused Wiley of incitement to racial hatred. Metropolitan Police officers in Tower Hamletssaid in a statement,external: ""We have received a number of reports relating to alleged anti-Semitic tweets posted on social media. The Met takes all reports of anti-Semitism extremely seriously. The relevant material is being assessed."" There are also calls for Wiley's MBE, appointed for services to music, to be forfeited. Wiley, 41, known as the ""godfather of grime"", shared conspiracy theories and insulted Jewish people on his Instagram and Twitter accounts, which together have more than 940,000 followers. In one tweet he said: ""I don't care about Hitler, I care about black people"", and also compared the Jewish community to the Ku Klux Klan. On Instagram, videos of himself were interspersed with posts of screenshots - which have since been deleted - including one at about midday on Saturday suggesting Twitter has suspended him from tweeting for a week. He had already been given a 12-hour ban on Friday night, but resumed tweeting on Saturday. The platform has removed some of his tweets, with a note saying they violated its rules. Wiley's manager, John Woolf, confirmed that the Twitter account, which is not verified, belongs to the London-born rapper, whose real name is Richard Cowie. In a tweet on Friday evening that is no longer visible, Mr Woolf initially said he was ""talking to him privately"". Healso said that, having known Wiley for 12 years,,externalhe knows ""he does not truly feel this way"". Buton Twitter on Saturday morning,externalhe tweeted: ""Following Wiley's antisemitic tweets today we at @A_ListMGMT have cut all ties with him. There is no place in society for antisemitism."" The two men were pictured together in December with boxer Anthony Joshua. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a subsequent statement, Mr Woolf said: ""To be very clear here. I do not support or condone what Wiley has said today online in any way shape or form. ""I am a proud Jewish man and I am deeply shocked and saddened but what he has chosen to say. ""I am speaking to key figures in my community in light of today's tweets. This behaviour and hateful speech is not acceptable to me."" Wiley later claimed in a video posted on Instagram that he had ""cut ties"" with Mr Woolf - not the other way around. Broadcaster and producer DJ Spoony criticised Wiley's ""inflammatory"" comments, tweeting that the artist ""still has a huge role in our community but he must first see the error of his ways/comments and then make himself open to the help that will be offered"". The Ivors Academy, an association for music writers which gave Wiley its Inspiration Award in 2019, said ""such appalling views have no place in the music creator community"". There has been growing outrage over the social media companies' responses. The Campaign Against Antisemitism said it had reported Wiley to the Metropolitan Police and asked Twitter and Facebook, which owns Instagram, to close his accounts to ""prevent further outpouring of anti-Jewish venom"". ""We consider that Wiley has committed the offence of incitement to racial hatred, which can carry a substantial prison sentence,"" a statement read. It added that it would contact the Cabinet Office to ask for his MBE be forfeited. The rapper, known as Wiley Kat earlier in his career, was appointed MBE in 2018 Lord Mann, an adviser to the government on anti-Semitism, called on Twitter and Instagram to remove him from their platforms. He said some of the content glorifies a violent attack on a rabbi in London, adding: ""That breaches all their standards, it's not even marginal."" Luciana Berger, a Liberal Democrat politicianwho left the Labour Party over anti-Semitism last year, said the ""bile... permeates impressionable (often younger) minds"". Actors David Baddiel and Tracy-Ann Oberman, who are both Jewish, also called for more action. Facebook, which owns Instagram, said in a statement: ""There is no place for hate speech on Instagram. We have deleted content that violates our policies from this account and are continuing to investigate."" Twitter said Wiley's account had been temporarily locked ""for violating our Hateful Conduct policy"". ""Abuse and harassment have no place on our service and we have policies in place - that apply to everyone, everywhere - that address abuse and harassment, violent threats, and hateful conduct,"" it added. ""If we identify accounts that violate any of these rules, we'll take enforcement action."" Wiley first entered the UK singles charts with Wearing My Rolex in 2008. His subsequent hits include Heatwave in 2012 and Boasty in 2019, a collaboration with rappers Stefflon Don and Sean Paul and actor Idris Elba.

France to impose on-the-spot fines for drugs use,"Jean Castex (C) with the mayor of Nice, which has seen drug-related violence for weeks France will introduce on-the-spot fines nationwide for drug users, particularly targeting cannabis, from September. The move comes amid concerns about drug-related violence and was announced by PM Jean Castex on a trip to Nice, which has seen weeks of unrest. The roll-out of fines follows tests in cities such as Rennes and Marseilles. The â¬200 ($233; Â£182) fixed fine will reduce to â¬150 if paid within 15 days. France is one of the leading consumers of cannabis in Europe. Legislation on recreational cannabis use varies widely from country to country. Several nations, like Canada, have legalised it while others have policies of minor punishment. But many others impose severe jail terms. France does alreadyhave laws that allow for up to a year in prison,externaland fines of up to â¬3,750 for the use of illicit drugs, without specifically distinguishing drug types. But the laws, dating back to 1970, seldom lead to prison sentences, with magistrates preferring alternative punishments, often warnings. Although there is the reduction for early fine payment in the new system, if an offender fails to pay up in time it increases to â¬450. Mr Castex said the system would come in at the start ofla rentrÃ©e, the beginning of the school year after the summer break. The fines were initially proposed back in 2018 and were rolled out as tests in Rennes, Marseilles, Lille, CrÃ©teil and Boissy-Saint-LÃ©ger. It's part of the new prime minister's plans to strengthen security. He said he wanted to ""put an end to the violence of everyday life"" . He said the drugs measure would simplify police procedures by ""inflicting punishment without delay"". A further 60 officers will be brought in to help Nice Mr Castex added that it would target drug dealers at their points of sale, which were ""eating away at neighbourhoods"". He was speaking in the southern port city of Nice, which has witnessed growing drugs-related violence, including in its Moulins district, where shots were fired in broad daylight outside a supermarket this week. As Mr Castex made his visit on Saturday, a young man was found dead from wounds in the city. For Nice, Mr Castex said 60 more police officers would be deployed in the coming weeks. There would also be extended powers for the police in the city, although these would be detailed later, and refurbishment of the main prison. More generally, 150 jobs would be created elsewhere to target what he called ""local criminal action and everyday delinquency"". The death of a bus driver this month in Bayonne, attacked by passengers who reportedly refused to wear face masks amid the coronavirus outbreak, touched a particular nerve in France.

Indoor gyms and pools in England start to reopenBut at least a third of public facilities are thought to have stayed shut amid financial struggles.UK,"This video can not be played The BBC's Katy Austin on the new safety measures at a gym that has reopened in Twickenham Indoor gyms, swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities have seen a cautious return of customers as they reopen their doors for the first time since March. Gym-goer Jamelah May said it was great to be one of the first people through the doors of her south-west London gym. ""As well as physically getting back to where I want to be, mentally it's had a massive impact,"" she said. However, it's thought at least a third of public facilities have stayed shut. The leisure sector has warned it will still struggle because of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. How are indoor gyms and pools going to open? 'I can't wait to be back on the squat rack' Gyms that reopen must follow strict hygiene and social distancing measures, such as limiting the number of people using the facility and spacing out equipment. Facilities should also reduce class sizes and ensure adequate ventilation, according to governmentguidance issued earlier this month,external. Jamelah May, who has been going to the same gym for 12 years, said she didn't sleep last night because she was so excited to come back Outdoor gyms and pools have been open in England since 4 July because there is less risk of catching coronavirus outdoors. Indoor gyms in Northern Ireland opened earlier this month, but they remain closed in Scotland and Wales. Swim England has publishedits own guidance,externalfor operators on how to reopen indoor pools, including implementing a one-way entry and exit system. Its chief executive Jane Nickerson said financial problems meant less than 20% of pools will reopen this weekend. The cost of heating the pools and implementing the new guidelines, as well as the reduced footfall and fewer swimming lessons, mean many cannot afford to open, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She also called on the government to give more financial support to struggling pools, saying the money would also help withits plan to tackle obesity. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed gyms and sports facilities will not reopen in Luton or Blackburn with Darwen due to an increase in coronavirus cases in those areas. This video can not be played The BBC's Mike Bushell explores new safety measures at the London Aquatics Centre Luke Willmott, manager of the Castle Gym in Nottingham, said his gym was at capacity by about 06:25 BST, and it was ""only right for people to have a choice"" to return. He said returning members are being advised to spray equipment with sanitiser before, during and after use - but there were ""loads"" of membership cancellations during lockdown. ""I think it's down to people's circumstances,"" he said. ""A lot of our community have supported us which has been fantastic... but it has been a struggle."" Michelle and Tomasz used to train in the gym together. But the couple from Putney, south-west London, have come to different conclusions about whether to go back now that it's reopened. Michelle has cancelled her membership and says she won't return for the foreseeable future, while Tomasz is already out the door for his first gym session since lockdown began. ""I work in the leisure industry - I still don't believe it's 100% safe,"" says Michelle. ""There is a lot of equipment crammed in there and the gym doesn't have very good ventilation."" Instead, she's been using resistance bands and training outside. But for Tomasz, who used to do bodybuilding in Poland, the gym is part of his lifestyle. ""To not have that, it affects his mindset,"" Michelle says. ""Training outside doesn't do it for him. I can't stop him going to the gym and he can't make me go!"" Paul Douglas-Smith, manager of the Littlehampton Wave swimming pool, said the facility can now take 40 swimmers at once, down from more than 130 before the pandemic. He said the pool will be hit financially, and is aiming for a ""staged return"". ""We're looking at the fitness swimmers first and then we're looking at the family and the junior swimming. That will probably follow in the next two or three weeks,"" he said. Despite the relaxed rules, industries bodies have warned many facilities could be forced to close amid the pandemic. Community Leisure UK, the members' association that specialises in representing charitable leisure and culture trusts across England, Scotland and Wales, estimates that 48% of all public leisure facilities face closure, meaning as many as 1,300 could disappear by the end of the year, along with more than 58,000 jobs. By Katy Austin, BBC News business correspondent Some fitness clubs saw queues outside their doors this morning and members we spoke to said they were overjoyed to be back. However, it's inevitable some people do not yet feel ready to exercise around others indoors. The fortunes of gyms, pools and leisure centres depend on instilling confidence in the safety measures they've put in place, as well as how much people are prepared to spend at a time of economic uncertainty. Membership cancellation rates have reached 15-23% due to the impact of the pandemic, trade body UKActive said. Meanwhile, online classes and home equipment sales have boomed. Today is an important milestone, but not all venues can afford to open straight away under the new arrangements. UKActive said support will still be needed with costs such as back-dated rent in coming months. The District Councils' Network (DCN) is also warning of the ""uncertain future"" faced by gyms and leisure centres, pointing out that the sector is expected to lose about Â£305m this year. The DCN, which represents 187 district councils in England that provide leisure services, is calling on the Treasury to provide a rescue package to save leisure centres from collapse. Leisure centres and indoor gyms, along with swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities were closed on 21 March as part of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

"Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green dies aged 73The founder of the British-American rock band died peacefully in his sleep, his family says.UK","Peter Green performed at a charity event at London's Royal Albert Hall in 2004 Fleetwood Mac co-founder and influential blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died aged 73. Solicitors acting on behalf of his family said in a statement: ""It is with great sadness that the family of Peter Green announce his death this weekend, peacefully in his sleep. ""A further statement will be provided in the coming days."" Green, from Bethnal Green in east London, formed Fleetwood Mac with drummer Mick Fleetwood in 1967. They came together after Green's stint filling in for Eric Clapton in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Green and Fleetwood then convinced John McVie to join the band as bass guitarist, in part by naming the band Fleetwood Mac. He wrote the instantly recognisable instrumental track Albatross, which remains the band's only number one hit, plus two other early hits, Black Magic Woman and Oh Well. And it was under Green's direction that they produced their first three albums. The band's debut album was released in 1968. Simply called Fleetwood Mac, but also known as Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, it gained widespread acclaim and reached number four in the charts. Obituary: From humble beginnings to Blues fame Green left the band after a last performance in 1970 as he struggled with his mental health. He was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia and spent time in hospital in the mid-70s. He married Jane Samuels in January 1978. They divorced in 1979 and share a daughter. Green was among the eight members of the band - along with Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, John McVie, Christine McVie, Danny Kirwan and Jeremy Spencer - who were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. The news of his death comes days after Fleetwood Mac announced they would release aretrospective box set,externaldocumenting the band's early years between 1969 and 1974. Musicians have led tributes to Green. David Coverdale, the lead singer of Whitesnake, said he was an artist he ""truly loved and admired"". In a tweet,external, he said: ""I supported the original Fleetwood Mac at Redcar Jazz Club when I was in a local band... he was a breathtaking singer, guitarist and composer. I know who I will be listening to today. RIP"" An early line-up of Fleetwood Mac (L-R): Peter Green, John McVie, Jeremy Spencer, Mick Fleetwood and Danny Kirwan Mumford and Sons guitarist Winston Marshall tweeted: ""RIP Peter Green. #GOAT. Man of the world, oh well, albatross, need your love so bad. Some of my favourites songs and performances of all time. Thank you for the music."" Actor David Morrissey praised Green's ""fantastic soulful voice"" while Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler described Green as ""one of the greats"". And Scottish musician Midge Ure tweeted: ""One of the great ones gone. You taught me well."" Peter Green was one of the greatest Blues guitarists Britain ever produced. His shape-shifting riffs and long, improvisational excursions made Fleetwood Mac one of the most exciting live bands of the 1960s Blues explosion. He first picked up a hand-me-down guitar at the age of 10 and, like many of his peers, began to devour the import vinyl that trickled into the UK from the US. He studied the greats - Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy and BB King - combining their tensely coiled playing style with the shimmering vibrato of The Shadows' Hank Marvin. But he actually started his professional career as a bassist, until an encounter with Eric Clapton persuaded him to ditch the instrument. ""I decided to go back on lead guitar after seeing him with the Bluesbreakers. He had a Les Paul, his fingers were marvellous. The guy knew how to do a bit of evil, I guess."" He later had the seemingly impossible task of taking over from Clapton in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Fans were unconvinced at first, but after a handful of incendiary performances, he won them over, earning the nickname ""The Green God"". Read morehere. The singer-songwriter Cat Stevens, also known as Yusuf Islam, tweeted: ""God bless the ineffable Peter Green, one of the unsung heroes of musical integrity, innovation and spirit. When I heard he left Fleetwood Mac in 1970 to get a real life and donate his wealth to charity, he became something of a model for me."" In February this year, artists including Fleetwood, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons and guitarists Jonny Lang and Andy Fairweather Low performed at the London Palladium in a gig celebrating the early years of Fleetwood Mac. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Green at number 58 in its all-time list of the100 greatest guitarists,external, describing him as ""Britain's most progressive blues guitarist"" in his heyday.

Aziza Aljahwari and her son Ali wererescued from the River Rheidol in Aberystwython Wednesday. Mrs Aljahwari said the emergency service teams that saved them had ""really touched"" her heart. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service used a rescue sled, throw bags and floating line to retrieve the pair. Aberystwyth Lifeboat launched to help Mrs Aljahwari and Ali Mrs Aljahwari had visited the river on Wednesday with her friend and three of her six children, aged 12, 10 and six. She said while she and her friend were looking for somewhere to sit her six-year-old son Mohammad dropped a small toy boat into the water and went in after it. Boy, 10, rescued after falling into river She retrieved Mohammad quickly but Ali had gone into the water after her and was trying to get the boat when she lost sight of him. The incident started when Aziza Aljahwari's six-year-old dropped a toy boat into the River Rheidol ""I heard his voice but I couldn't see him,"" she said. After running onto the road to to get a better view of the river she was unable to see him so asked her friend to call 999 while she waded into the water after him. Mrs Aljahwari, who cannot swim, said: ""I didn't have any choice. The water became faster. The water was so cold. ""I was scared for my son. I asked Allah to save him."" Emyr Jones said the pair were ""very fortunate"" Mrs Aljahwari said she was in the water for up to 10 minutes before she eventually saw her son clinging to a tree. ""I slipped,"" she said. ""Ali was crying and saying 'mummy please don't go'. ""The water was up to my neck. I was frightened, I said 'Ali don't come to me, just stay there'. ""I reached Ali and climbed onto the bank of the river. I was trying to call my friend but she couldn't hear us."" The coastguard and police were at the scene while the search was under way Mrs Aljahwari, said once she had located Ali she had faith they would be okay: ""I didn't feel scared,"" she said.

She wrote: ""Thank you for your kindness and hard work that day. ""I was truly amazed by your incredible work. ""There were few small unseen moments that really touched my heart that I would like to share. ""For example when fireman tried to break the branches from trees, until blood came out of his hand but he didn't complain or showed a sign, he did all that just to make sure that I walk safely. ""When we finally reached safety he kneeled down to speak to Ali and try to comfort him and cheer him. ""Or the firefighter who took his jacket off and put it in the ground to protect our feet from the cold. ""Or when a man saw us shivering and quickly asked the helicopter to drop us a blanket and a mat."" A fire engine was also at the scene She also thanked people who had supported her ""anxious"" husband while they were in the water. She added: ""I feel lucky to live in Aber in such a wonderful community where everyone is a family. ""Thank You God for allowing all those people into my life."" Speaking on Wednesday, Aberystwyth fire station manager Emyr Jones said due to the terrain on the banks of the river, the pair could not be seen and two of his crew members had to enter the water ""as a last resort"".

Campsites reopen - but not as you remember them,"Holidaymakers are able to use sites with shared facilities from this weekend Holidaymakers can once again carry on camping in Wales - but it won't be as you remember it. From Saturdaysites with shared facilities are allowed to open, with strict rules and regulations, having missed most of the high season. Businesses said they had been inundated with inquiries but it would not make up for lost trade during lockdown. There had also been the expense of deep cleaning, adding social distancing and reducing pitch numbers, some said. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford warned holidaymakers they ""must get used to some changes"" to protect everyone from coronavirus. ""It's the responsibility of all of us to follow these new rules so we can keep ourselves and our loved ones safe,"" he said. The British Holiday and Home Parks Association said it expected almost all of the 1,322 sites in Wales that offer shared facilities to open. And Philippa George, who chairs the Forum for South East Wales Tourism, estimated 97% would be welcoming visitors. Coronavirus: Socially distanced holiday preparations under way Coronvirus: Shell Island campsite closed until 2021 Lake District rangers find hundreds illegally camping and partying ""It's been very hard, because all these businesses that have not been open have had no income for the season,"" she said. There is less than two months of that left. ""It pretty well dries up in September, that is one of the quietest months in the season,"" said Ms George. Philippa George has reduced numbers at her Monknash campsite and followed Covid-19 social distancing and hygiene advice The cost of adding measures to conform to coronavirus regulations was ""quite expensive"", she said. Ms George worried sites would be driven out of business. ""That is three winters of no income for some people,"" she said. ""It has been extremely serious and I am hoping the Welsh Government will help. ""Across tourism we need to look at these businesses otherwise we are going to lose some."" Ms George, who runs Heritage Coast Camping, in Monknash, Vale of Glamorgan, said: ""I'm only going to be effectively open for August and September, so income is reduced massively."" This video can not be played Ms George said more people wanted to take holidays in the UK Since the announcement sites would be allowed to reopen, her phone has been ringing off the hook. ""It has been ringing from half-seven to half-11 at night,"" Ms George said. ""People want a staycation. ""The people who ring, I've been discussing with them what we are doing to protect them and their safety. ""Without exception they have enjoyed that discussion and welcomed it."" Heritage Coast Camping is not opening until 31 July as it is not ready yet. ""With shared facilities it is difficult because you are talking about showers, toilets, washing up rooms,"" Ms George said. To maintain social distancing this means no more than two people at a time can use them. Sharon Evans runs Llandow Touring Caravan Park, which also accepts tents and is opening on Saturday. She said: ""We have been able to open a fortnight now with the caravans on site, where customers are using their own facilities, which has given us a bit of a trial run. ""We have screens in reception and hand sanitisers and social distancing and we have spent a great deal of time deep cleaning. ""The level of interest has been overwhelming."" Roger Thomas, of the Three Golden Cups site, said demand was so pent up he expected people ""whatever the weather"" It was ""frustrating"" sites were banned from opening in Wales until Saturday, Ms Evans said, adding: ""Our customers have been going to England."" Some of her customers have been visiting for years, she said: ""It's been very lonely without them, very quiet."" Roger Thomas, who runs the Three Golden Cups campsite a few miles away in Southerndown, said trade was normally weather dependent. ""If the weather is dreadful people tend not to come,"" he said. ""But this year the demand is so pent up I expect they will come whatever."" The Camping and Caravanning Club said in Wales sites at Bala, Rhandirmwyn, Cardigan Bay and Wyeside were open. But only Wyeside will be open with shared facilities from Saturday. ""It's great for campsites across Wales to be able to open their shared facilities, such as toilet blocks, as this will mean tent-campers and campervanners can now pitch up alongside caravans and motorhomes, which have self-contained washrooms,"" a spokesman said. British Holiday and Home Parks Association boss Ros Pritchard said: ""We are hoping to see the return of our tent campers on Saturday.""

"France to impose on-the-spot fines for drugs useThe system will apply nationwide from September, as the new PM cracks down on ""every day violence"".Europe","Jean Castex (C) with the mayor of Nice, which has seen drug-related violence for weeks France will introduce on-the-spot fines nationwide for drug users, particularly targeting cannabis, from September. The move comes amid concerns about drug-related violence and was announced by PM Jean Castex on a trip to Nice, which has seen weeks of unrest. The roll-out of fines follows tests in cities such as Rennes and Marseilles. The â¬200 ($233; Â£182) fixed fine will reduce to â¬150 if paid within 15 days. France is one of the leading consumers of cannabis in Europe. Legislation on recreational cannabis use varies widely from country to country. Several nations, like Canada, have legalised it while others have policies of minor punishment. But many others impose severe jail terms. France does alreadyhave laws that allow for up to a year in prison,externaland fines of up to â¬3,750 for the use of illicit drugs, without specifically distinguishing drug types. But the laws, dating back to 1970, seldom lead to prison sentences, with magistrates preferring alternative punishments, often warnings. Although there is the reduction for early fine payment in the new system, if an offender fails to pay up in time it increases to â¬450. Mr Castex said the system would come in at the start ofla rentrÃ©e, the beginning of the school year after the summer break. The fines were initially proposed back in 2018 and were rolled out as tests in Rennes, Marseilles, Lille, CrÃ©teil and Boissy-Saint-LÃ©ger. It's part of the new prime minister's plans to strengthen security. He said he wanted to ""put an end to the violence of everyday life"" . He said the drugs measure would simplify police procedures by ""inflicting punishment without delay"". A further 60 officers will be brought in to help Nice Mr Castex added that it would target drug dealers at their points of sale, which were ""eating away at neighbourhoods"". He was speaking in the southern port city of Nice, which has witnessed growing drugs-related violence, including in its Moulins district, where shots were fired in broad daylight outside a supermarket this week. As Mr Castex made his visit on Saturday, a young man was found dead from wounds in the city. For Nice, Mr Castex said 60 more police officers would be deployed in the coming weeks. There would also be extended powers for the police in the city, although these would be detailed later, and refurbishment of the main prison. More generally, 150 jobs would be created elsewhere to target what he called ""local criminal action and everyday delinquency"". The death of a bus driver this month in Bayonne, attacked by passengers who reportedly refused to wear face masks amid the coronavirus outbreak, touched a particular nerve in France.

Singapore man admits being Chinese spy in US,"A Singaporean man has pleaded guilty in the US to working as an agent of China, the latest incident in a growing stand-off between Washington and Beijing. Jun Wei Yeo was charged with using his political consultancy in America as a front to collect information for Chinese intelligence, US officials say. Separately, the US said a Chinese researcher accused of hiding her ties to China's military was detained. China earlier ordered the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu. The move to shut down the diplomatic mission in the south-western city was in response to the US closing China's consulate in Houston. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the decision was taken because China was ""stealing"" intellectual property. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded by saying that the US move was based on ""a hodgepodge of anti-Chinese lies"". A US official guards the former Chinese consulate in Houston after doors were forced open on Friday afternoon After a 72-hour deadline for Chinese diplomats to leave the Houston consulate expired on Friday at 16:00 (21:00 GMT) reporters saw men who appeared to be US officials force open a door to enter the premises. Uniformed staff from the US State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security took up position to guard the entrance. Tensions have been rising between the two nuclear powers over several key issues. Why US-China relations are at their lowest point in decades The US-China battle behind the scenes What's behind Trump's new strategy on China? President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic, as well as China's imposition of a controversial new security law in Hong Kong. Jun Wei Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo, on Friday pleaded guilty in a federal court to working as an illegal agent of the Chinese government in 2015-19,the US Department of Justice said in a statement,external. He was earlier charged with using his political consultancy in the country as a front to collect valuable, non-public information for Chinese intelligence. In his guilty plea, he admitted to scouting for Americans with high-level security clearance and getting them to write reports for fake clients. According to court documents he was recruited by Chinese intelligence in 2015 after giving a presentation in Beijing. At the time he was a PhD student at a prestigious Singaporean university. According to the guilty plea, Mr Yeo used a professional networking website - assumed to be LinkedIn - to contact potential targets likely to have access to sensitive information. Mr Yeo was arrested as he flew in to the US in 2019. The researcher was named by US officials as Juan Tang, aged 37. She was amongfour Chinese nationals charged earlier this week with visa fraudfor allegedly lying about serving in China's People's Liberation Army. Juan Tang was the last of the four to be detained in California, after the US had accused the Chinese consulate in San Francisco of harbouring her. It was not immediately clear how she was arrested. FBI agents have found pictures of Juan Tang dressed in military uniform and reviewed articles in China identifying her military affiliation, the Associated Press reports. It is quoting the University of California Davis as saying that she left her job as a visiting researcher in the Department of Radiation Oncology in June. US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping There are a number of factors in play. US officials have blamed China for the global spread of Covid-19. More specifically, President Donald Trump has alleged, without presenting evidence, that the virus originated from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan. And, in unsubstantiated remarks, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said in March that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan. The US and China have also been locked in a tariff war since 2018. US-China trade war in 300 words Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft, but in Beijing there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power. The US has also imposed sanctions on Chinese politicianswho it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.  China is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others. Beijing denies the allegations and has accused the US of ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs. China's imposition of a sweeping security law there is also a source of tension in relations with the US and the UK, which administered the territory until 1997. In response,the US last week revoked Hong Kong's special trading status, which allowed it to avoid tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the US. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Trump hits China with order on Hong Kong trade The US and UK see the security law as a threat to the freedoms Hong Kong has enjoyed under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK - before sovereignty reverted to Beijing. The UK has angered China by outlining a route to UK citizenship for nearly three million Hong Kong residents. China responded by threatening to stop recognising a type of British passport - BNO - held by many of those living in Hong Kong.

"1,000 apply for receptionist jobWith the hospitality sector savaged by the pandemic, jobs are attracting many more applicants.Business","When a Manchester restaurant advertised for a receptionist on Monday, the owners were shocked to received almost 1,000 applicants in a day. They had only expected about 30 people to be interested. The UK's hospitality sector has been savaged by the coronavirus crisis, with many bars, restaurants and hotels struggling. ""It really is quite sad to see the amount of people that are looking for a job,"" the company said. ""On Monday we placed an advert for a receptionist role for our 20 Stories restaurant in Manchester,"" Carol Cairnes, director of people at the restaurant's owner D&D London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The next day, James, our head of talent, went to look at applications and was amazed to find that in less than 24 hours we had 963 people apply."" Normally for such a role they'd expect at that stage to receive about 30 applications, she said. ""Going through the candidates who applied, we could see there were a lot of very talented and highly-qualified people that applied for the role, including some restaurant general managers."" Restaurant chain Zizzi and Ask Italian closing 75 branches Coronavirus: Restaurant no-shows 'putting jobs at risk' Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closures Hospitality jobs have proved highly-sought-after as thousands of roles have been slashed by restaurant groups. In the last two weeks, popular chains such as Pizza Express and Azzurri have kick-started restructures of their businesses that are likely to lead to more than 2,000 job losses and hundreds of restaurant outlets closing. Social-distancing rules have also led to businesses reducing staff numbers, as they have re-opened with less space, meaning they can cater for fewer customers at a time now. Other businesses have reported similar experiences this week. Emily Pringle of Alnwick-based fragrance company Notes of Northumberland told the BBC that she received 583 applicants when she advertised a 16 hour-a-week retail job. ""Most of the applicants were massively over-qualified,"" she said. ""It's a very sad sign of the times. A large number of people have been educated to PhD level and applying for our job, which is telling about the current state of the job market."" ""Massively over-qualified"" people are applying for retail, restaurant, cafe and bar jobs In Swansea, Sarah John, founder of Boss Brewing, said that her firm had advertised for a bar manager two days before and were surprised by the number and quality of applicants. ""We would normally only get five or so responses, but have had 35 people apply already and the calibre of applicants is really high,"" she said. Most of the applicants had worked at reasonably well-known businesses, but have either lost their jobs, or are still furloughed and worried about their future, she added. ""There have also been quite of a lot of people who said they would be happy to relocate to work,"" she said. ""We're in Swansea and have had applications from people from as far as Manchester, Leeds and Cornwall."" Meanwhile, when a London pub manager posted an advert for a Â£9-an-hour bar job last week, he was so overwhelmed by the response that he took to Twitter to report it. Mick Dore, general manager of the Alexandra pub in Wimbledon, said: ""I don't want to alarm anyone about the economy or anything, but I advertised two bar jobs at 16:30 on Thursday. We've had well over 400 applicants. Gulp."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Research by the Institute for Employment Studies this week found that the total number of live job vacancies across the country now stands at 433,000. That's less than half of the number in February, indicating that there's a long way to go in the recovery for the UK job market. ""Without doubt, this is now the toughest jobs market in a generation, and there are no signs yet of a significant recovery,"" said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies.

Indoor gyms and pools in England start to reopenFacilities must follow strict hygiene and social distancing measures in latest easing of lockdown.UK,"This video can not be played The BBC's Katy Austin on the new safety measures at a gym that has reopened in Twickenham Indoor gyms, swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities have seen a cautious return of customers as they reopen their doors for the first time since March. Gym-goer Jamelah May said it was great to be one of the first people through the doors of her south-west London gym. ""As well as physically getting back to where I want to be, mentally it's had a massive impact,"" she said. However, it's thought at least a third of public facilities have stayed shut. The leisure sector has warned it will still struggle because of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. How are indoor gyms and pools going to open? 'I can't wait to be back on the squat rack' Gyms that reopen must follow strict hygiene and social distancing measures, such as limiting the number of people using the facility and spacing out equipment. Facilities should also reduce class sizes and ensure adequate ventilation, according to governmentguidance issued earlier this month,external. Jamelah May, who has been going to the same gym for 12 years, said she didn't sleep last night because she was so excited to come back Outdoor gyms and pools have been open in England since 4 July because there is less risk of catching coronavirus outdoors. Indoor gyms in Northern Ireland opened earlier this month, but they remain closed in Scotland and Wales. Swim England has publishedits own guidance,externalfor operators on how to reopen indoor pools, including implementing a one-way entry and exit system. Its chief executive Jane Nickerson said financial problems meant less than 20% of pools will reopen this weekend. The cost of heating the pools and implementing the new guidelines, as well as the reduced footfall and fewer swimming lessons, mean many cannot afford to open, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She also called on the government to give more financial support to struggling pools, saying the money would also help withits plan to tackle obesity. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed gyms and sports facilities will not reopen in Luton or Blackburn with Darwen due to an increase in coronavirus cases in those areas. This video can not be played The BBC's Mike Bushell explores new safety measures at the London Aquatics Centre Luke Willmott, manager of the Castle Gym in Nottingham, said his gym was at capacity by about 06:25 BST, and it was ""only right for people to have a choice"" to return. He said returning members are being advised to spray equipment with sanitiser before, during and after use - but there were ""loads"" of membership cancellations during lockdown. ""I think it's down to people's circumstances,"" he said. ""A lot of our community have supported us which has been fantastic... but it has been a struggle."" Michelle and Tomasz used to train in the gym together. But the couple from Putney, south-west London, have come to different conclusions about whether to go back now that it's reopened. Michelle has cancelled her membership and says she won't return for the foreseeable future, while Tomasz is already out the door for his first gym session since lockdown began. ""I work in the leisure industry - I still don't believe it's 100% safe,"" says Michelle. ""There is a lot of equipment crammed in there and the gym doesn't have very good ventilation."" Instead, she's been using resistance bands and training outside. But for Tomasz, who used to do bodybuilding in Poland, the gym is part of his lifestyle. ""To not have that, it affects his mindset,"" Michelle says. ""Training outside doesn't do it for him. I can't stop him going to the gym and he can't make me go!"" Paul Douglas-Smith, manager of the Littlehampton Wave swimming pool, said the facility can now take 40 swimmers at once, down from more than 130 before the pandemic. He said the pool will be hit financially, and is aiming for a ""staged return"". ""We're looking at the fitness swimmers first and then we're looking at the family and the junior swimming. That will probably follow in the next two or three weeks,"" he said. Despite the relaxed rules, industries bodies have warned many facilities could be forced to close amid the pandemic. Community Leisure UK, the members' association that specialises in representing charitable leisure and culture trusts across England, Scotland and Wales, estimates that 48% of all public leisure facilities face closure, meaning as many as 1,300 could disappear by the end of the year, along with more than 58,000 jobs. By Katy Austin, BBC News business correspondent Some fitness clubs saw queues outside their doors this morning and members we spoke to said they were overjoyed to be back. However, it's inevitable some people do not yet feel ready to exercise around others indoors. The fortunes of gyms, pools and leisure centres depend on instilling confidence in the safety measures they've put in place, as well as how much people are prepared to spend at a time of economic uncertainty. Membership cancellation rates have reached 15-23% due to the impact of the pandemic, trade body UKActive said. Meanwhile, online classes and home equipment sales have boomed. Today is an important milestone, but not all venues can afford to open straight away under the new arrangements. UKActive said support will still be needed with costs such as back-dated rent in coming months. The District Councils' Network (DCN) is also warning of the ""uncertain future"" faced by gyms and leisure centres, pointing out that the sector is expected to lose about Â£305m this year. The DCN, which represents 187 district councils in England that provide leisure services, is calling on the Treasury to provide a rescue package to save leisure centres from collapse. Leisure centres and indoor gyms, along with swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities were closed on 21 March as part of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

The socially distanced show must go on - is it fun? âââââ,"On 29 January 2020, I went to the London Palladium to see Madonna perform her Madame X show. She made the 2,297-seat theatre feel as intimate as a downtown cabaret club. She came down into the audience, sat next to fans, had a chat, swigged beer from their plastic bottles. It was all very cosy. On Thursday, I was back at the Palladium to watch Beverley Knight and her band perform. What a difference six months make. The shows were polar opposites. Bev was pitch-perfect, Madonna was not. Bev moved around the stage with dynamism and grace, an injured Madonna hobbled. Bev's banter had everyone cheering, Madonna's left us feeling a bit awkward. Butâ¦ Madonna's show was better. Not because she was better, she wasn't, but because we, the audience, were better. That's nobody's fault. It's down to the wretched virus and the associated social distancing rules. More than 70% of the Palladium's seats were empty Madonna performed to a full house, Beverley Knight had the unenviable task of performing to row upon row of empty seats, consisting of about 1,650 plush pink chairs occupied by black crosses on white paper rather than people. There were 640 of us with tickets, whom Andrew Lloyd Webber in a pre-show welcome cheerfully described as guinea pigs. He was making the premise for the show quite clear - it was not so much about entertainment, more about being part of a series of official experiments to see if a major indoor venue such as the Palladium could manage the logistics of putting on a socially distanced show. This video can not be played Andrew Lloyd Webber: âTheatre canât run with social distancingâ It was a strange affair. The wearing of facemasks was obligatory, as a fellow journalist discovered when he surreptitiously let his slip mid-show, only for a (masked) usher to sidle up and insist he pull it back up. Notwithstanding debates about the effectiveness of masks, I found the compulsory measure reassuring, while accepting it subdues the atmosphere: a gig without atmosphere is like a joke without a punchline - it can fall a bit flat. Tickets were checked at a safe distance at the entrance The social distancing worked well, in so much as we were so spread out (unless you'd bought a pair of tickets to sit together) that you'd need the vocal projection of Brian Blessed to communicate with your neighbour. The only snag with that is live entertainment is all about a sense of shared experience, which is pretty much non-existent in a huge auditorium with people scattered about like ships on the ocean. The net result was a feeling of watching a rehearsal rather than a show. There wasn't the tension in the air you normally get at a gig, or the union between performer and crowd. Not that Bev didn't give it her best - she was fantastic. But how weird it must have been for her, staring out at hundreds of pieces of paper, in between which was the occasional mask-wearing punter whose facial expressions were impossible to read or respond to. In the circumstances, she was five-star brilliant. The singer stared out at a sparse, mask-wearing crowd The way in which she tore into Piece of My Heart would have made Janis Joplin proud, while a full-bloodied cover of the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction was a highlight. The stand-out moment, though, was her rendition of Memory from the musical Cats - a number she'd performed many times on the same stage when playing Grizabella in Lloyd Webber's long-running show. She nailed the song, which you'd expect. But what caught her by surprise was the audience reaction. We rose as one to give her a spontaneous standing ovation, which caused her to pause, wipe away a tear, and walk away to gather herself.  In retrospect it's easy to see why. She was two-thirds of the way through her set, and because we were wearing masks had no clue about how she was doing. We were loving it? Hating it? Bored? Who knew? Not Bev. We were as non-communicative as those cardboard cut-outs in today's football stadiums. Until, that is, we did something impulsive to demonstrate our appreciation, acknowledging she was touching us from afar (safety measures dictate that performers must stand several metres away from the front of the stage). It was a moment of 'liveness' that makes theatre and concerts so unique and important. You can stream Memory a million times, but it'll never be as good as it was at 3:46pm on 23 July 2020 at the London Palladium. It proved to be a cathartic experience for both singer and audience, who found a way to bond as Bev and her well-tuned band powered through I'm Every Woman and Come As You Are. The show stopped with a showstopper: an a capella cover of Ben E King's 60s hit Stand By Me. Did the experiment work? Can a venue such as the Palladium manage the logistics of a socially distanced show? The answer to that appear to be yes. Will it be a template for the future? Beverley Knight and Andrew Lloyd Webber hope not, because as far as they are concerned it doesn't work artistically or commercially. So, it's hopeless really. Was this test better than nothing? Yes. But then what's the point of testing something that is ultimately doomed to fail? The stark choice is simple: for most shows to go on, it will be a case of all or nothing.

Campsites reopen - but not as you remember themBusinesses say they have been inundated with inquiries but it will not make up trade lost in lockdown.Wales,"Holidaymakers are able to use sites with shared facilities from this weekend Holidaymakers can once again carry on camping in Wales - but it won't be as you remember it. From Saturdaysites with shared facilities are allowed to open, with strict rules and regulations, having missed most of the high season. Businesses said they had been inundated with inquiries but it would not make up for lost trade during lockdown. There had also been the expense of deep cleaning, adding social distancing and reducing pitch numbers, some said. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford warned holidaymakers they ""must get used to some changes"" to protect everyone from coronavirus. ""It's the responsibility of all of us to follow these new rules so we can keep ourselves and our loved ones safe,"" he said. The British Holiday and Home Parks Association said it expected almost all of the 1,322 sites in Wales that offer shared facilities to open. And Philippa George, who chairs the Forum for South East Wales Tourism, estimated 97% would be welcoming visitors. Coronavirus: Socially distanced holiday preparations under way Coronvirus: Shell Island campsite closed until 2021 Lake District rangers find hundreds illegally camping and partying ""It's been very hard, because all these businesses that have not been open have had no income for the season,"" she said. There is less than two months of that left. ""It pretty well dries up in September, that is one of the quietest months in the season,"" said Ms George. Philippa George has reduced numbers at her Monknash campsite and followed Covid-19 social distancing and hygiene advice The cost of adding measures to conform to coronavirus regulations was ""quite expensive"", she said. Ms George worried sites would be driven out of business. ""That is three winters of no income for some people,"" she said. ""It has been extremely serious and I am hoping the Welsh Government will help. ""Across tourism we need to look at these businesses otherwise we are going to lose some."" Ms George, who runs Heritage Coast Camping, in Monknash, Vale of Glamorgan, said: ""I'm only going to be effectively open for August and September, so income is reduced massively."" This video can not be played Ms George said more people wanted to take holidays in the UK Since the announcement sites would be allowed to reopen, her phone has been ringing off the hook. ""It has been ringing from half-seven to half-11 at night,"" Ms George said. ""People want a staycation. ""The people who ring, I've been discussing with them what we are doing to protect them and their safety. ""Without exception they have enjoyed that discussion and welcomed it."" Heritage Coast Camping is not opening until 31 July as it is not ready yet. ""With shared facilities it is difficult because you are talking about showers, toilets, washing up rooms,"" Ms George said. To maintain social distancing this means no more than two people at a time can use them. Sharon Evans runs Llandow Touring Caravan Park, which also accepts tents and is opening on Saturday. She said: ""We have been able to open a fortnight now with the caravans on site, where customers are using their own facilities, which has given us a bit of a trial run. ""We have screens in reception and hand sanitisers and social distancing and we have spent a great deal of time deep cleaning. ""The level of interest has been overwhelming."" Roger Thomas, of the Three Golden Cups site, said demand was so pent up he expected people ""whatever the weather"" It was ""frustrating"" sites were banned from opening in Wales until Saturday, Ms Evans said, adding: ""Our customers have been going to England."" Some of her customers have been visiting for years, she said: ""It's been very lonely without them, very quiet."" Roger Thomas, who runs the Three Golden Cups campsite a few miles away in Southerndown, said trade was normally weather dependent. ""If the weather is dreadful people tend not to come,"" he said. ""But this year the demand is so pent up I expect they will come whatever."" The Camping and Caravanning Club said in Wales sites at Bala, Rhandirmwyn, Cardigan Bay and Wyeside were open. But only Wyeside will be open with shared facilities from Saturday. ""It's great for campsites across Wales to be able to open their shared facilities, such as toilet blocks, as this will mean tent-campers and campervanners can now pitch up alongside caravans and motorhomes, which have self-contained washrooms,"" a spokesman said. British Holiday and Home Parks Association boss Ros Pritchard said: ""We are hoping to see the return of our tent campers on Saturday.""

"1,000 apply for receptionist job","When a Manchester restaurant advertised for a receptionist on Monday, the owners were shocked to received almost 1,000 applicants in a day. They had only expected about 30 people to be interested. The UK's hospitality sector has been savaged by the coronavirus crisis, with many bars, restaurants and hotels struggling. ""It really is quite sad to see the amount of people that are looking for a job,"" the company said. ""On Monday we placed an advert for a receptionist role for our 20 Stories restaurant in Manchester,"" Carol Cairnes, director of people at the restaurant's owner D&D London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The next day, James, our head of talent, went to look at applications and was amazed to find that in less than 24 hours we had 963 people apply."" Normally for such a role they'd expect at that stage to receive about 30 applications, she said. ""Going through the candidates who applied, we could see there were a lot of very talented and highly-qualified people that applied for the role, including some restaurant general managers."" Restaurant chain Zizzi and Ask Italian closing 75 branches Coronavirus: Restaurant no-shows 'putting jobs at risk' Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closures Hospitality jobs have proved highly-sought-after as thousands of roles have been slashed by restaurant groups. In the last two weeks, popular chains such as Pizza Express and Azzurri have kick-started restructures of their businesses that are likely to lead to more than 2,000 job losses and hundreds of restaurant outlets closing. Social-distancing rules have also led to businesses reducing staff numbers, as they have re-opened with less space, meaning they can cater for fewer customers at a time now. Other businesses have reported similar experiences this week. Emily Pringle of Alnwick-based fragrance company Notes of Northumberland told the BBC that she received 583 applicants when she advertised a 16 hour-a-week retail job. ""Most of the applicants were massively over-qualified,"" she said. ""It's a very sad sign of the times. A large number of people have been educated to PhD level and applying for our job, which is telling about the current state of the job market."" ""Massively over-qualified"" people are applying for retail, restaurant, cafe and bar jobs In Swansea, Sarah John, founder of Boss Brewing, said that her firm had advertised for a bar manager two days before and were surprised by the number and quality of applicants. ""We would normally only get five or so responses, but have had 35 people apply already and the calibre of applicants is really high,"" she said. Most of the applicants had worked at reasonably well-known businesses, but have either lost their jobs, or are still furloughed and worried about their future, she added. ""There have also been quite of a lot of people who said they would be happy to relocate to work,"" she said. ""We're in Swansea and have had applications from people from as far as Manchester, Leeds and Cornwall."" Meanwhile, when a London pub manager posted an advert for a Â£9-an-hour bar job last week, he was so overwhelmed by the response that he took to Twitter to report it. Mick Dore, general manager of the Alexandra pub in Wimbledon, said: ""I don't want to alarm anyone about the economy or anything, but I advertised two bar jobs at 16:30 on Thursday. We've had well over 400 applicants. Gulp."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's less than half of the number in February, indicating that there's a long way to go in the recovery for the UK job market.

Trump acts to cut prescription drug prices in US,"Donald Trump said he wanted to ""completely restructure the prescription drug market"" President Donald Trump has signed four executive orders aimed at cutting prescription drug prices in the US. ""The four orders I'm signing today will completely restructure the prescription drug market,"" said Mr Trump, who has long criticised ""astronomical"" prices. The measures would allow discounts and import of cheaper drugs from abroad. Mr Trump will meet pharmaceutical bosses on Tuesday, but some industry analysts have criticised the move, saying it would not have much effect. ""This administration has decided to pursue a radical and dangerous policy to set prices based on rates paid in countries that he [President Trump] has labelled as socialist, which will harm patients today and into the future,""Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said in a statement,external. It said Mr Trump's move was ""a reckless distraction that impedes our ability to respond to the current [coronavirus] pandemic - and those we could face in the future"". This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus President Trump's administration has been criticised for its response for the worsening Covid-19 crises, as the number of confirmed virus-related deaths in America has now topped 145,000. Why do Americans pay so much for prescription drugs? Coronavirus: The week when everything changed for Trump Things US has got wrong - and right Since taking office, Mr Trump has made repeated attacks against those who set drug prices and has pledged to take radical steps to reduce them. But with the presidential election just several months away, industry experts have voiced doubts that any major decisions could come into force before the 3 November vote. They also say that the White House has limited power to implement drug pricing policies. Executive orders do not have any automatic legal force and can also be challenged in court. According toa 2019 report by the OECD group of industrialised nations,,externalthe US spends roughly twice the average amount spent by other member countries on pharmaceuticals per head. For example, where the UK paid Â£398 ($497) per head in 2015, the USA paid $1,162. This is despite having similar levels of prescription drug use.

Thanks for joining us. Thank you for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. We're pausing for now - but before we go, here are the main headlines from the UK and worldwide today.  For many of us, face masks have become an essential part of everyday life thanks to the coronavirus. But regularly wearing one can have an unfortunate side-effect: mask-induced acne, aka ""maskne"". So what causes ""maskne""?Our colleague Yvette Tan explains here. Lee Westwood in action during this week's British Masters Leading golf professional Lee Westwood sayshe will not playat next month's US PGA Championship, for which coronavirus quarantine rules have been relaxed for players and caddies. The lifting of the 14-day quarantine on arrival in the US means Westwood could have gone straight into the tournament ""bubble"" and played. ""I still don't feel comfortable and I don't feel it is right to jump on a plane for 12 hours,"" said the Englishman, who is world number 34. The tournament is scheduled to be the first major of 2020 and will be played in Haring Park, San Francisco, from 6 August with no fans present. The delayed US Open is set to be contested in September, with the Masters, normally the April highlight, being held in November. Britain's Open Championship has been cancelled. A further 767 coronavirus cases were reported across the UK on Saturday. The downward trend of new cases seen throughout May and June appears to have stalled. Government-announced deaths have continued to drop since a peak in mid-April, though the downward trend has slowed recently. On Saturday, a further 61 deaths were reported. Read more. What do you do if you're super-rich and stuck in a coronavirus hotspot? The answer's simple - just buy yourself a safe haven somewhere else. According to Bloomberg,external, they are spending millions of dollars on investor visas in countries with low Covid-19 infection rates. Some are moving to remote Caribbean islands where they can isolate on sunny beaches, while others are choosing countries where the pandemic has been halted. One of these visas in New Zealand, for example, sets people back between NZ$3m ($2m; Â£1.5m) and NZ$10m ($6.7m; Â£5.2m). New Zealand has had just over 1,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 22 deaths. Signs instructing people to keep two metres apart have become part of life since lockdown around the UK. But in the town of Montgomery in Powys, Wales, graphic designer Keith Williams and friend Katrina Collins wanted to lighten the mood a little. They've been painting messages on pavements that describe two metres in quirky ways, such as ""7 Chihuahuas"" and ""50 chips"". Katrina Collins said each sign has some relevance to a nearby business Mr Williams said: ""I thought we could do something different. Every two metres there are random phrases."" Phrases also include ""14.3 pairs of scissors"", ""23.5 tins of tuna"", ""85.36 pound coins"" and ""153.85 marbles"". Read more here. As confirmed cases of the virus rise exponentially in the US, many states are continuing to enforce strict measures to try and prevent its spread. Massachusetts is the latest to announce restrictions. Under a new executive order, announced by governor Charlie Baker yesterday, people - including residents - will need to go into quarantine for 14 days after travelling to the state. Anyone who doesn't comply will face a $500-per-day fine (Â£391). There are some exemptions, though: people travelling from low-risk states including New York, Maine and Hawaii, for example, as well as anyone who can prove that they've had a negative Covid-19 test no more than 72 hours prior to their arrival. A further 25 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospitals in England, official figures show. This brings the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,272, NHS England has said. Patients were aged between 52 and 93 years old and all had known underlying health conditions. Another eight deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The vulnerable mum and daughter continuing to shield The 2.2 million medically vulnerable people who have been self-isolating in England for four months during the coronavirus pandemic will no longer need to shield from 1 August. It will mean the government's free food boxes will stop being delivered to their door. Rebecca Richmond and her daughter Poppy are both at risk and say they will continue to self-isolate at their home in Billingham, County Durham, due to fears over a second wave of the virus. They, and families like them, are helped by charities like Pipsco, a Teeside-based organisation which buys food and collects donations from the supermarket before making them up into meal kits to deliver to vulnerable peopleâs homes. The army sniffer dogs are undergoing training at Ulmen near Koblenz, Germany Sniffer dogs can be trained to detect people who have Covid-19, researchers in Germany have found. A study published by scientists at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover,externalfound that the trained dogs detected the coronavirus with a relatively high rate of accuracy. Eight sniffer dogs from the German army were used in the study,Deutsche Welle reported,external. After only a week's training they could distinguish between the mucus and saliva of infected and non-infected patients. Holger Volk, chair of the university's department of small animal medicine, said it was only a pilot study but there was ""potential to take this further - to really use these dogs in the field"". Earlier this month,a UK charity said it was making progress with training dogs to detect coronavirus. Claire Guest, who runs Medical Detection Dogs in Milton Keynes, has previously trained dogs to spot the scent of malaria, cancer and Parkinson's disease. Jamelah May didn't sleep last night because she was so excited There were queues outside some fitness clubs in England, with members telling the BBC they were overjoyed to be back. Jamelah May was delighted to be one of the first people through the doors of her south-west London gym when it opened for the first time since March. ""Iâm so happy. Itâs
been awful being stuck at home for four months. Iâve been coming here for 12
years. All my friends come here - itâs a social thing and you miss it a lot,"" says But not everyone is convinced it's safe to return yet. Michelle and Tomasz, a couple from south-west London, used to train in the gym together. While Michelle has cancelled her membership and says she won't return for the foreseeable future, Tomasz has already enjoyed his first gym session since lockdown began. ""I work in the leisure industry - I still don't believe it's 100% safe,"" says Michelle. But for Tomasz, who used to do bodybuilding in Poland, the gym is part of his lifestyle. ""To not have that, it affects his mindset,"" Michelle says. ""Training outside doesn't do it for him. I can't stop him going to the gym and he can't make me go!"" Read more. There have been 767 new coronavirus cases reported across the UK, according to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external. This brings the total number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK to 298,681. Data on deaths has been paused whilean urgent review into Public Health England'sdata is carried out. Covid-19 patients with only mild symptoms can still take weeks to fully recover from an infection - even younger people with no underlying health conditions, US researchers say. The public health body Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said about a fifth of patients under the age of 35 did not return to their normal state of health up to 21 days after testing positive. The CDC said the findings warranted the targeting of public health messages at groups which might not
perceive Covid-19 as being a severe illness. In itsMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,externalon Friday, the CDC said that a telephone survey of mildly symptomatic adults across 13 states 
found that 35% were reporting health issues two to three weeks later.

Fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath were among the
symptoms that persisted weeks later, the report said. This video can not be played Coronavirus and Schools: Forgotten Key workers A Public Health England review found that death rates from Covid-19 were higher for Black and Asian ethnic groups when compared to whites. As pupils prepare to return to classrooms from September, teachers - who are classed as key workers - will have a lot to do to make their schools Covid-safe. Headteacher Allana Gay is a founding member of a group called the BAMEed Network, which has drawn up guidelines to keep Black, Asian and minority ethnic teachers safe because they feel there is a gap in advice from the Department for Education. The Department for Education said: ""Schools should discuss any concerns with staff and explain measures being put in place to reduce risks"", and that school leaders should try and accommodate ""additional measures where appropriate"". Vietnam is back on high alert after detecting its first locally transmitted case in about three months. A 57-year-old grandfather in the central city of Danang tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. State media reported today that he was in a critical condition, and specialist doctors had flown from Ho Chi Minh City to Danang to treat him. Where he caught the virus is a mystery, but officials say 50 people he came into contact with have been put into isolation. In total, 103 people connected to the patient have been tested for the virus, but all of their results were negative. Vietnam, a single-party communist state,has been praisedfor its swift andeffective responseto the outbreak. It has only had 417 cases of coronavirus in total, and zero deaths. Until Friday, the country had gone 100 days without a locally-transmitted case of the virus. It has been a month since thousands of people flocked to Bournemouth beach for this year's warmest weekend. The pictures of crowded stretches of sand - at a time when more than 100 people a day were still dying of Covid-19 - caused concern about the spread of the virus, following the loosening of lockdown rules in early June. On 25 June,Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council declared a ""major incident"". However, a month on, the statistics do not suggest a significant spike in coronavirus cases. But how does Bournemouth's experience compare to other tourist hotspots? Read more here to find out. Mayor Muriel Bowser also ordered DC residents to wear face masks in public All travellers arriving in Washington DC on non-essential business from areas where coronavirus is widely circulating will have to quarantine for 14 days from Monday. The order, issued by District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, excludes
neighbouring Maryland and Virginia. A full list of hotspots will be published later. âWe know, unfortunately, there are states that are seeing significant spikes in new cases,â Ms Bowser told reporters. âWe know there are places where people are not being as cautious or making the sacrifices we are making here in Washington DC.â It is unclear how the order will be enforced.

On Wednesday, the Democratic mayor ordered residents to wear a mask while outside in public. Those who violate the ruling risk being fined up to $1,000 (Â£780). As we know, some indoor gyms and leisure centres have been reopening in England on Saturday after coronavirus restrictions were eased. But the leisure sector has warned that it will struggle due to the financial impact of being closed for months during the government lockdown. Mark Sesnan, chief executive of GLL, the UK's largest operator of public leisure facilities, says gyms and leisure centres will be unable to dig themselves out of a ""financial hole"" caused by the closures for around ""two to three years"". He said: ""The reality is, you've got a business that has no income, and still has half the costs. Even though the furlough scheme, which has been very helpful, pays the staff costs - or most of them - the other half of our costs we've had to cover ourselves. ""We've used our reserves to pay for that, but they're running out and running out fast. So getting open is important, but actually running at half capacity, as you can guess, is still not going to solve the problem."" The District Councils' Network (DCN)is also warning of the ""uncertain future""faced by gyms and leisure centres, pointing out that the sector is expected to lose about Â£305m this year Bars across Texas were ordered to close on 26 June Hundreds of bar owners in the US state of Texas say they will open on Saturday, in defiance of an order from Governor Greg Abbott. Mr Abbott previously eased restrictions on bars in the state but thenordered them closed again on 26 Juneas coronavirus infections surged. About 800 bar owners said they would take part in ""Freedom Fest"" - an event organised by Fort Worth bar owner Chris Polone. The owners say they face going out of business. âIf you can get every single bar to stand up in solidarity, well, thatâs a statement that wonât be ignored,â Mr Polone said,quoted by local publication Fort Worth Star-Telegram,external. He urged Mr Abbott to allow bars to reopen with a set of safety guidelines.

The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission said it was aware of the event and that those violating the order could face a 30-day suspension of their licence. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Manager drops Wiley over anti-Semitic tweets,"Rapper Wiley has been dropped by his management following anti-Semitic posts on his social media accounts. Wiley's Twitter account has been temporarily locked while Instagram said it had deleted some of his content, after a long series of posts on both platforms on Friday and Saturday. The social media giants are facing growing pressure to close his accounts. Police said they were looking at ""relevant material"" as critics accused Wiley of incitement to racial hatred. Metropolitan Police officers in Tower Hamletssaid in a statement,external: ""We have received a number of reports relating to alleged anti-Semitic tweets posted on social media. The Met takes all reports of anti-Semitism extremely seriously. The relevant material is being assessed."" There are also calls for Wiley's MBE, appointed for services to music, to be forfeited. Wiley, 41, known as the ""godfather of grime"", shared conspiracy theories and insulted Jewish people on his Instagram and Twitter accounts, which together have more than 940,000 followers. In one tweet he said: ""I don't care about Hitler, I care about black people"", and also compared the Jewish community to the Ku Klux Klan. On Instagram, videos of himself were interspersed with posts of screenshots - which have since been deleted - including one at about midday on Saturday suggesting Twitter has suspended him from tweeting for a week. He had already been given a 12-hour ban on Friday night, but resumed tweeting on Saturday. The platform has removed some of his tweets, with a note saying they violated its rules. Wiley's manager, John Woolf, confirmed that the Twitter account, which is not verified, belongs to the London-born rapper, whose real name is Richard Cowie. In a tweet on Friday evening that is no longer visible, Mr Woolf initially said he was ""talking to him privately"". Healso said that, having known Wiley for 12 years,,externalhe knows ""he does not truly feel this way"". Buton Twitter on Saturday morning,externalhe tweeted: ""Following Wiley's antisemitic tweets today we at @A_ListMGMT have cut all ties with him. There is no place in society for antisemitism."" The two men were pictured together in December with boxer Anthony Joshua. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a subsequent statement, Mr Woolf said: ""To be very clear here. I do not support or condone what Wiley has said today online in any way shape or form. ""I am a proud Jewish man and I am deeply shocked and saddened but what he has chosen to say. ""I am speaking to key figures in my community in light of today's tweets. This behaviour and hateful speech is not acceptable to me."" Wiley later claimed in a video posted on Instagram that he had ""cut ties"" with Mr Woolf - not the other way around. Broadcaster and producer DJ Spoony criticised Wiley's ""inflammatory"" comments, tweeting that the artist ""still has a huge role in our community but he must first see the error of his ways/comments and then make himself open to the help that will be offered"". The Ivors Academy, an association for music writers which gave Wiley its Inspiration Award in 2019, said ""such appalling views have no place in the music creator community"". There has been growing outrage over the social media companies' responses. The Campaign Against Antisemitism said it had reported Wiley to the Metropolitan Police and asked Twitter and Facebook, which owns Instagram, to close his accounts to ""prevent further outpouring of anti-Jewish venom"". ""We consider that Wiley has committed the offence of incitement to racial hatred, which can carry a substantial prison sentence,"" a statement read.

UK ministers' Â£1.2bn 'advance payment' for Wales,"Lockdown in Wales has been the responsibility of the Welsh Government UK ministers have announced Â£1.2bn funding for the Welsh Government. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said it was ""like an advance payment"" ahead of announcements to be made in England. TheBarnett formulais used to decide how much money the other nations receive when the UK government spends in England. The Welsh finance minister said it would ""give the NHS the kind of certainty that it needs"" to plan for a potential second wave of the virus. The Welsh Government has previously said it was ""not clear how much of this package is wholly new"". Mr Hart told BBC Radio Wales: ""What we're trying to do here as a UK-wide project is make sure all the devolved nations have the money they need during Covidâ¦ ""The sum has gone from 2.3 [billion pounds] to 2.8 last week. With the chancellor's announcement it has now gone up by a further 1.2 so the total the Welsh Government will have received for Covid-related activity will be Â£4bn since March... ""It is a consequential of announcements to be made, like an advance payment - still fresh money, still new money... ""It's like get your money up front, in advance, rather than retrospectively."" Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the additional funding would allow the Welsh Government to announce ""a really significant stabilisation package for the NHS"". She added that the money would be used to respond to ""a really wide range of pressures"" such as those faced by local authorities. But it would also enable the government to ""give the NHS the kind of certainty that it needs in order to to plan most effectively for a potential second wave of the coronavirus"" and to ensure that it's ""in good shape"" to cope with winter pressures. The Â£4bn figure does not include direct spending by the Conservative UK government in Wales - such as the furlough scheme or VAT cuts for the tourism and hospitality sector. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the UK government's ""guarantee"" means the Welsh Government can invest to protect jobs Speaking to BBC Radio Wales ahead of Mr Hart's interview, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""It was reported as being clearly additional money over and above Barnett but we don't think that's the case at all and it's one of the difficult and disappointing things that is just unnecessary... ""It is difficult and disappointing because I'd like the public to have a straight message where you don't hear Welsh Government politicians disagreeing with UK government politicians about the state of the money being provided."" 'Â£500m extra for Wales' from chancellor statement The billions being spent on coronavirus in Wales What Covid-19 decisions are made in Wales? The Welsh Government has called for more freedom to borrow cash Welsh Government ministers have previously called for their UK counterparts to allow them to borrow more money to help deal with the pandemic. ""The pressures facing our budget are unrivalled in the post Second World War era,"" a Welsh Government spokesperson said in response to the funding announcement. ""And while we welcome confirmation of Wales' share of spend in England, it is not clear how much of this package is wholly new. ""We fully expected to receive funding on major PPE (personal protective equipment) costs and NHS winter funding. ""We look forward to receiving the full detail on new funding and hope that the UK Treasury will finally lift the restrictions on our ability to access our own savings to address urgent pressures."" Reacting to the announcement, Plaid Cymru's health and finance spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth told BBC Radio Wales: ""The union can't be sewn together with a bung where you don't even know what's in the brown envelope, where we're expected to trust that somehow it's a lot of money. ""What we need, and we're in agreement with Welsh Government actually, is we need additional flexibility with the spending powers that we have in Wales. ""This is the time when we need to be making decisions now on how much money to borrow to get us through this incredibly sticky point in our history... rather than expect to be grateful for somebody filling a begging bowl with money that we don't know how much it is anyway."" Expect to hear UK government ministers talk a lot more about the union in months to come. The pandemic has led to greater awareness of devolved powers - especially health and education. While Welsh Government ministers have faced scrutiny for their response to the pandemic, like being later to test all care home staff and residents, the UK government equally has faced criticisms for being behind on issues like committing to providing free school meals for eligible children during the summer holidays. The prime minister's visit to Scotland, praising the furlough scheme and UK armed forces, and this announcement today send a clear signal: trying to strengthen support for the union is heavily back on the UK government's agenda. Meanwhile a group of MPs have also set up a new pro-union lobby group to keep it on the agenda in government and Parliament, chaired by Conservative Aberconwy MP Robin Millar. Boris Johnson visited Scotland on Thursday The UK government has been in charge of much of the UK's economic response to the virus, including the coronavirus job retention furlough scheme. But devolved governments have been responsible for the severe restrictions on day-to-day life, as well as their national health services, and different parts of the UK have come out of lockdown in different ways. On a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he ""pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the United Kingdom"", adding that the response to the pandemic had shown his government's commitment to the whole of the UK.

Small music venues get Â£2.2m government fundingUp to 150 English venues will get help to stop them going to the wall after four months with no gigs.,"The Deaf Institute in Manchester, pictured hosting a Girli gig in 2018, was recently saved from closure Up to 150 small music venues in England will share Â£2.25m emergency government funding to stop them going to the wall after four months with no gigs. It is the first slice of a Â£1.57bn arts relief fund to be allocated and follows warnings that many venues are at risk. The Music Venues Trust welcomed the funding as ""a short-term fix"". Earlier this month, 1,500 artists from Liam Gallagher and Dua Lipa to Sir Paul McCartneysigned an open lettercalling for support for the live music scene. If 150 venues are helped, they would receive an average of Â£15,000 each. Some grants could be bigger, up to Â£80,000. The MVT, which represents small venues, said the money was ""very welcome and desperately needed as we wait to hear how the recently announced Â£1.57bn rescue package for the arts will be administered and distributed"". Chief executive Mark Davyd added: ""This interim solution will provide a short-term fix for those venues identified as being in crisis but we urgently need information and guidance on when and how venues can access the larger fund, which is so vital to safeguarding their longer term futures."" Idles playing at Gorilla in Manchester in 2018 Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said such clubs and venues were where ""nearly all of our globally successful music stars started out"", and he wanted to ""make sure those organisations weather the Covid storm"". ""We're working to deliver the rest of the Â£1.57bn emergency package as quickly as possible, so that we can protect and preserve our precious culture, arts and heritage for future generations,"" he added. The amount available for grassroots music, worth 1/700th of the total relief package, will go to venues at ""severe risk of insolvency"" and can be spent on ongoing costs like rent, utilities, maintenance contracts and other bills. The money will be dished out by Arts Council England, which does not usually fund regular live music venues, ""within the next few weeks"". In the past fortnight, beloved Manchester venues Gorilla and The Deaf Institutehave been saved from closure, but the companies behind the Welly and the Polar Bear in Hullhave gone into administration. Details of how organisations in other areas of the arts can apply for a slice of the Â£1.57bn will be revealed ""in the coming days"", the government said. Mr Dowden has previously said the fund will protect the nation's cultural ""crown jewels"" and small venues around the country. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Thanks for joining us. Thank you for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. We're pausing for now - but before we go, here are the main headlines from the UK and worldwide today.  For many of us, face masks have become an essential part of everyday life thanks to the coronavirus. But regularly wearing one can have an unfortunate side-effect: mask-induced acne, aka ""maskne"". So what causes ""maskne""?Our colleague Yvette Tan explains here. Lee Westwood in action during this week's British Masters Leading golf professional Lee Westwood sayshe will not playat next month's US PGA Championship, for which coronavirus quarantine rules have been relaxed for players and caddies. The lifting of the 14-day quarantine on arrival in the US means Westwood could have gone straight into the tournament ""bubble"" and played. ""I still don't feel comfortable and I don't feel it is right to jump on a plane for 12 hours,"" said the Englishman, who is world number 34. The tournament is scheduled to be the first major of 2020 and will be played in Haring Park, San Francisco, from 6 August with no fans present. The delayed US Open is set to be contested in September, with the Masters, normally the April highlight, being held in November. Britain's Open Championship has been cancelled. A further 767 coronavirus cases were reported across the UK on Saturday. The downward trend of new cases seen throughout May and June appears to have stalled. Government-announced deaths have continued to drop since a peak in mid-April, though the downward trend has slowed recently. On Saturday, a further 61 deaths were reported. Read more. What do you do if you're super-rich and stuck in a coronavirus hotspot? The answer's simple - just buy yourself a safe haven somewhere else. According to Bloomberg,external, they are spending millions of dollars on investor visas in countries with low Covid-19 infection rates. Some are moving to remote Caribbean islands where they can isolate on sunny beaches, while others are choosing countries where the pandemic has been halted. One of these visas in New Zealand, for example, sets people back between NZ$3m ($2m; Â£1.5m) and NZ$10m ($6.7m; Â£5.2m). New Zealand has had just over 1,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 22 deaths. Signs instructing people to keep two metres apart have become part of life since lockdown around the UK. But in the town of Montgomery in Powys, Wales, graphic designer Keith Williams and friend Katrina Collins wanted to lighten the mood a little. They've been painting messages on pavements that describe two metres in quirky ways, such as ""7 Chihuahuas"" and ""50 chips"". Katrina Collins said each sign has some relevance to a nearby business Mr Williams said: ""I thought we could do something different. Every two metres there are random phrases."" Phrases also include ""14.3 pairs of scissors"", ""23.5 tins of tuna"", ""85.36 pound coins"" and ""153.85 marbles"". Read more here. As confirmed cases of the virus rise exponentially in the US, many states are continuing to enforce strict measures to try and prevent its spread. Massachusetts is the latest to announce restrictions. Under a new executive order, announced by governor Charlie Baker yesterday, people - including residents - will need to go into quarantine for 14 days after travelling to the state. Anyone who doesn't comply will face a $500-per-day fine (Â£391). There are some exemptions, though: people travelling from low-risk states including New York, Maine and Hawaii, for example, as well as anyone who can prove that they've had a negative Covid-19 test no more than 72 hours prior to their arrival. A further 25 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospitals in England, official figures show. This brings the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,272, NHS England has said. Patients were aged between 52 and 93 years old and all had known underlying health conditions. Another eight deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result.

It will mean the government's free food boxes will stop being delivered to their door. Rebecca Richmond and her daughter Poppy are both at risk and say they will continue to self-isolate at their home in Billingham, County Durham, due to fears over a second wave of the virus. They, and families like them, are helped by charities like Pipsco, a Teeside-based organisation which buys food and collects donations from the supermarket before making them up into meal kits to deliver to vulnerable peopleâs homes. The army sniffer dogs are undergoing training at Ulmen near Koblenz, Germany Sniffer dogs can be trained to detect people who have Covid-19, researchers in Germany have found. A study published by scientists at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover,externalfound that the trained dogs detected the coronavirus with a relatively high rate of accuracy. Eight sniffer dogs from the German army were used in the study,Deutsche Welle reported,external. After only a week's training they could distinguish between the mucus and saliva of infected and non-infected patients. Holger Volk, chair of the university's department of small animal medicine, said it was only a pilot study but there was ""potential to take this further - to really use these dogs in the field"". Earlier this month,a UK charity said it was making progress with training dogs to detect coronavirus. Claire Guest, who runs Medical Detection Dogs in Milton Keynes, has previously trained dogs to spot the scent of malaria, cancer and Parkinson's disease.

Jamelah May was delighted to be one of the first people through the doors of her south-west London gym when it opened for the first time since March. ""Iâm so happy. Itâs
been awful being stuck at home for four months. Iâve been coming here for 12
years. All my friends come here - itâs a social thing and you miss it a lot,"" says But not everyone is convinced it's safe to return yet. Michelle and Tomasz, a couple from south-west London, used to train in the gym together. While Michelle has cancelled her membership and says she won't return for the foreseeable future, Tomasz has already enjoyed his first gym session since lockdown began. ""I work in the leisure industry - I still don't believe it's 100% safe,"" says Michelle. But for Tomasz, who used to do bodybuilding in Poland, the gym is part of his lifestyle. ""To not have that, it affects his mindset,"" Michelle says. ""Training outside doesn't do it for him. I can't stop him going to the gym and he can't make me go!"" Read more. There have been 767 new coronavirus cases reported across the UK, according to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external. This brings the total number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK to 298,681. Data on deaths has been paused whilean urgent review into Public Health England'sdata is carried out. Covid-19 patients with only mild symptoms can still take weeks to fully recover from an infection - even younger people with no underlying health conditions, US researchers say. The public health body Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said about a fifth of patients under the age of 35 did not return to their normal state of health up to 21 days after testing positive. The CDC said the findings warranted the targeting of public health messages at groups which might not
perceive Covid-19 as being a severe illness. In itsMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,externalon Friday, the CDC said that a telephone survey of mildly symptomatic adults across 13 states 
found that 35% were reporting health issues two to three weeks later.

Fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath were among the
symptoms that persisted weeks later, the report said. This video can not be played Coronavirus and Schools: Forgotten Key workers A Public Health England review found that death rates from Covid-19 were higher for Black and Asian ethnic groups when compared to whites. As pupils prepare to return to classrooms from September, teachers - who are classed as key workers - will have a lot to do to make their schools Covid-safe. Headteacher Allana Gay is a founding member of a group called the BAMEed Network, which has drawn up guidelines to keep Black, Asian and minority ethnic teachers safe because they feel there is a gap in advice from the Department for Education. The Department for Education said: ""Schools should discuss any concerns with staff and explain measures being put in place to reduce risks"", and that school leaders should try and accommodate ""additional measures where appropriate"". Vietnam is back on high alert after detecting its first locally transmitted case in about three months. A 57-year-old grandfather in the central city of Danang tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. State media reported today that he was in a critical condition, and specialist doctors had flown from Ho Chi Minh City to Danang to treat him. Where he caught the virus is a mystery, but officials say 50 people he came into contact with have been put into isolation. In total, 103 people connected to the patient have been tested for the virus, but all of their results were negative. Vietnam, a single-party communist state,has been praisedfor its swift andeffective responseto the outbreak. It has only had 417 cases of coronavirus in total, and zero deaths. Until Friday, the country had gone 100 days without a locally-transmitted case of the virus. It has been a month since thousands of people flocked to Bournemouth beach for this year's warmest weekend. The pictures of crowded stretches of sand - at a time when more than 100 people a day were still dying of Covid-19 - caused concern about the spread of the virus, following the loosening of lockdown rules in early June. On 25 June,Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council declared a ""major incident"". However, a month on, the statistics do not suggest a significant spike in coronavirus cases. But how does Bournemouth's experience compare to other tourist hotspots? Read more here to find out. Mayor Muriel Bowser also ordered DC residents to wear face masks in public All travellers arriving in Washington DC on non-essential business from areas where coronavirus is widely circulating will have to quarantine for 14 days from Monday. The order, issued by District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, excludes
neighbouring Maryland and Virginia. A full list of hotspots will be published later. âWe know, unfortunately, there are states that are seeing significant spikes in new cases,â Ms Bowser told reporters. âWe know there are places where people are not being as cautious or making the sacrifices we are making here in Washington DC.â It is unclear how the order will be enforced.

On Wednesday, the Democratic mayor ordered residents to wear a mask while outside in public. Those who violate the ruling risk being fined up to $1,000 (Â£780). As we know, some indoor gyms and leisure centres have been reopening in England on Saturday after coronavirus restrictions were eased. But the leisure sector has warned that it will struggle due to the financial impact of being closed for months during the government lockdown. Mark Sesnan, chief executive of GLL, the UK's largest operator of public leisure facilities, says gyms and leisure centres will be unable to dig themselves out of a ""financial hole"" caused by the closures for around ""two to three years"". He said: ""The reality is, you've got a business that has no income, and still has half the costs. Even though the furlough scheme, which has been very helpful, pays the staff costs - or most of them - the other half of our costs we've had to cover ourselves. ""We've used our reserves to pay for that, but they're running out and running out fast. So getting open is important, but actually running at half capacity, as you can guess, is still not going to solve the problem."" The District Councils' Network (DCN)is also warning of the ""uncertain future""faced by gyms and leisure centres, pointing out that the sector is expected to lose about Â£305m this year Bars across Texas were ordered to close on 26 June Hundreds of bar owners in the US state of Texas say they will open on Saturday, in defiance of an order from Governor Greg Abbott. Mr Abbott previously eased restrictions on bars in the state but thenordered them closed again on 26 Juneas coronavirus infections surged. About 800 bar owners said they would take part in ""Freedom Fest"" - an event organised by Fort Worth bar owner Chris Polone. The owners say they face going out of business. âIf you can get every single bar to stand up in solidarity, well, thatâs a statement that wonât be ignored,â Mr Polone said,quoted by local publication Fort Worth Star-Telegram,external. He urged Mr Abbott to allow bars to reopen with a set of safety guidelines.

The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission said it was aware of the event and that those violating the order could face a 30-day suspension of their licence. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
PM: We could have done things differently,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: We followed scientific advice Boris Johnson has admitted the government did not understand coronavirus during the ""first few weeks and months"" of the UK outbreak. The PM told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg there were ""very open questions"" about whether the lockdown had started too late. Mr Johnson also spoke of ""lessons to be learned"" and said ministers could have done some things ""differently"". Labour accused the government of ""mishandling"" the crisis. More than 45,000 peoplein the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus, government figures show, with almost 300,000 cases confirmed. Last week, Mr Johnsonpromised an ""independent"" inquiryinto the pandemic, but no details have been given of its scope or timing. Boris Johnson's year in No 10 How is the PM doing? Johnson's battles PM to target junk food ads in obesity crackdown Previously, the prime minister has said he took the ""right decisions at the right time"", based on the advice of scientists. But, in an interview with Laura Kuenssberg to mark the first anniversary of his entering Downing Street, he said: ""We didn't understand [the virus] in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months. ""And I think, probably, the single thing that we didn't see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person."" Mr Johnson wants to use the government's experience of what happened during the pandemic to speed up his agenda, to ""double down on levelling up"", as he puts it in his peculiar political jargon. In other words, to push ahead with more determination, and less fudge in Whitehall, with the changes that he says will actually improve the lives of voters, particularly those who voted Tory for the first time in 2019. While preparing the NHS for a potential second surge, he clearly wants to concentrate on what's next, not what's gone before. But perhaps until the government is really ready to acknowledge what has happened, the questions will continue - and the public may still feel anxious about whether they can really trust ministers to handle a second surge next time round. Just as 366 days ago, optimism is Boris Johnson's trademark. But if the last few months have shown anything, it is that the real challenge of life in power, is that events that can surprise. Read Laura's full blog The prime minister added: ""I think it's fair to say that there are things that we need to learn about how we handled it in the early stages...There will be plenty of opportunities to learn the lessons of what happened."" The UK went intofull lockdown in late March, which critics say was too late and cost lives. Mr Johnson said: ""Maybe there were things we could have done differently, and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done differently."" Boris Johnson was himself diagnosed with coronavirus in March He added that these were still ""very open questions as far as [scientists] are concerned, and there will be a time, obviously, to consider all those issues"". On Friday, the government announced that30 million people in England would be offered a flu vaccinethis year, to reduce pressure on the NHS in case of a surge in coronavirus infections during the autumn and winter. Mr Johnson said this was in addition to increased testing and tracing and more procurement of personal protective equipment, adding: ""What people really want to focus on now is what are we doing to prepare for the next phase."" He said: ""We mourn every one of those who lost their lives and our thoughts are very much with their families. And I take full responsibility for everything that government did."" The prime minister, who was himself placed in intensive care in April after contracting coronavirus, said he would ""very soon"" set outnew measures to deal with obesity,seen as an added risk factor for patients. In December, Mr Johnson's Conservative Party pulled off a convincing general election win over Jeremy Corbyn's Labour, after promising to ""level up"" all parts of the UK. And, despite the economic damage caused by coronavirus in the past four months or so, the prime minister promised more nurses, doctors, hospitals and police, saying his government's priorities were ""exactly what they always have been, except more so. We're doubling down."" ""The agenda is what it was when I stood on the steps of Downing Street a year ago, but we want to go further and we want to go faster."" Mr Johnson reminisced about first entering No 10 as prime minister on 24 July 2019, saying it ""was very exciting, and everybody seemed to be in a very good mood"" and ""happy, upbeat"". He added that coronavirus had caused many ""difficulties"" since then. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg speaks to Boris Johnson ""Psychologically it's been an extraordinary time for the country,"" Mr Johnson said. ""But I also know that this is a nation with incredible natural resilience, and fortitude and imagination. And I think we will bounce back really much stronger than ever before."" For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Boris Johnson has finally admitted the government has mishandled its response to the coronavirus. ""It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown and too slow to take this crisis seriously."" The threat of a second wave of infections was ""still very real"", he added, while it was ""imperative the government learns the lessons of its mistakes so we can help to save lives"". Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said an ""immediate"" coronavirus inquiry was ""essential"", and that the prime minister had shown ""no remorse"" for his ""catastrophic mistakes"".

10 goals: How Johnson has done,"Boris Johnson has been in power for a year. Standing outside 10 Downing Street on 24 July 2019 he said: ""The time has come to act, to take decisions, to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better."" With the coronavirus pandemic, tens of thousands have died in the UK and many have lost jobs or businesses in the economic downturn. Since the first case was confirmed in the UK at the end of January, the government has been dealing with an unprecedented crisis that has consumed an immense amount of effort. But looking back to that first speech, which contained both short-term and long-term goals, how much progress has been made? ""We are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on 31 October. No ifs or buts and we will do a new deal, a better deal."" The UK did not leave the European Union on 31 October as the prime minister failed to get his renegotiated version of the Brexit withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons. But he went on to win a large majority in December's general election and the UK left the EU at 23:00 on 31 January. The UK is now in a transition period during which it continues to follow EU rules and regulations. It will leave the economic structures of the EU - the single market and the customs union - at the end of this year. Negotiations on a future trade agreement with the EU continue, but have yet to make significant progress. ""My job is to make your streets safer - and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets"" The government aims to reach its 20,000 target by March 2023. And police forces in England and Wales have recruited 3,005 additional officers in the year to March 2020,according to the Home Office,external. There will be new figures out on Thursday. In the same period, increases in police recorded crime have slowed down, butknife crime has hit a record high. The number of crimes being solved has hit a record low, with just 7% of crimes resulting in a charge or court summons. ""We start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades"" The government announced Â£1.8bn for NHS hospitals in England, with Â£1bn immediately made available for new equipment and the 20 upgrades. At the time, health think tank the Nuffield Trust said that the funding, would ""only be a fraction of what it would cost to really upgrade 20 hospitals"". One year on from Mr Johnson's speech, the Department of Health and Social Care says work is due to begin soon on the first of the 20 upgrades. The coronavirus outbreak has seen large sums of money poured into the NHS to deal with the crisis, and a rapid, temporary expansion of capacity. A number of temporary Nightingale hospitals were to be used in the event of admissions with coronavirus increasing dramatically. ""I am announcing now - on the steps of Downing Street - that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared"" This plan has not been revealed yet. In January, Mr Johnson said that ""we will be bringing forward a plan this year but we'll get it done in this parliament [by 2024]"". On 8 March, Health Secretary Matt Hancock sent a letter to all MPs about their ""proposed solutions"" and ""concerns about reforming the way that people pay for their care as part of the cross-party talks"". The coronavirus crisis spiked in the weeks after the offer of cross-party talks, highlighting the vulnerability of the care sector. The talks are yet to begin. Newscast: Boris Johnson Year One ""We are going to level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools"" For 2020-21, the government increased the minimum per pupil spend in England to: Â£5,000 for secondary pupils, up Â£200 from the previous year Â£3,750 for primary pupils, up Â£250. The government has also introduced rules meaning local authoritieshave to ensure each pupil receives,externalthis funding. Previously, it was up to local authorities to allocate the money to schools in their area. Roughly 21% of primary schools and 37% of secondary schools have benefited from the increase because their per pupil spending was previously below this,according to the House of Commons Library,external. This is described as ""levelling up"" because these schools' budgets will have been pushed closer to those with more funding. Many schools will have well above the minimum per pupil funding, for reasons such as being in a deprived area. By 2022-23, schools in England will be receiving an extra Â£7.1bn a year. This willreverse spending cuts since 2010, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. ""Fantastic new road and rail infrastructure..."" Mr Johnson also pledged to unite the country and ''level up'' through new transport links, and this has been a big focus during his first year in charge. He hasgiven the go-aheadfor the controversial high-speed rail project HS2, which will run between London and the Midlands, and then on to Manchester and Leeds in a second phase. Supporters say it will create jobs and rebalance the UK economy as well as creating jobs. The Spring Budget in March allocated Â£640bn for infrastructure investment, Â£100m of which wasrecently allocated to 29 road network projectsto ""get Britain moving"". In May, a Â£1.7bn Infrastructure Investment Fund was launched to ''make sure Britain is ready to bounce back from coronavirus''. This included money to upgrade the UK's roads and railways, but corresponded to sums announced in the Budget and other existing funding pots. ""...and full fibre broadband"" Boris Johnson promised full-fibre broadband - that means having a fibre-optic cable running into every home and business. By the party conference in September that had become ""full-fibre, 5G and other gigabit-capable networks"" by 2025, with a Â£5bn investment for reaching the most remote areas. Anearlier review,externalreckoned the whole country could get full-fibre by 2033 with government funding of Â£3bn to Â£5bn, so Â£5bn to do it eight years sooner had been deemed optimistic by some commentators. Thelatest update,externalfrom the regulator Ofcom in May found that full-fibre ""continues to improve at a rapid pace"" and that 3.5 million homes in the UK, which is 12%, have it available to them. But there is still a long way to go for everyone to be connected in 2025. Also, if the government is relying on 5G to provide gigabit-capable networks in remote areas, its decision to remove Huawei equipment from the 5G infrastructurewill delay its rollout. ""We level up across Britain with higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity"" In his spring statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a rise in the National Living Wage from Â£8.21 to Â£8.72 an hour. This week, the government also announced that almost 900,000 public sector workers, including doctors and teachers, would receive an above-inflation pay rise of up to 3.1%. Wages and productivity have both been falling in recent months, although that is partly connected with the coronavirus outbreak. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays 80% of the employment costs of employees who are not working. Coronavirus is also likely to be a problem for attempts to level up regional inequality.The Social Market Foundation warnedthat the economies of London and the South East were likely to bounce back more quickly than other regions. The Conservative manifesto promised to address the country's poor productivity by investing in education, infrastructure and R&D. Since then the government has pledged Â£120m for eight Institutes of Technology and Â£7m for 11 maths schools and promised that R&D spending would rise by Â£22bn by 2025. ""We close the opportunity gap giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes"" This year, the government has committed itself to adding Â£9.5bn to a scheme to build affordable housing, which was introduced by Theresa May in 2018. As part of a recent speech on infrastructure, the prime minister also promised to cut regulations that stop developers converting commercial properties into housing. However,some have argued,externalthat the current planning regulations do not have a significant impact on the number of homes being built. There has also been a temporary cut in stamp duty, which will not be payable on homes up to Â£500,000, although that will have less impact on first-time buyers, who already did not have to pay stamp duty on the first Â£300,000. ""I am convinced that we can do a deal without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks"" Mr Johnson delivered on his promise to get rid of thebackstop planfor the Irish border, while ensuring the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland remained as open as it was while both countries were in the EU. But the prime minister's new plan means there will be checks and controls within the UK instead, on goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That lost him the support of his former allies in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party. Mr Johnson has repeatedly denied that there will be any kind of border down the Irish Sea, but his government has submitted applications to the EU to create border control posts at ports in Northern Ireland to check animals and food arriving in the EU single market. Northern Ireland will stay in the single market for goods when the Brexit transition period ends. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?
