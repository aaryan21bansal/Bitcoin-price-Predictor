Â£21bn Briton has turned cast-offs into gold,"One of the UK's richest men, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has built a multi-billion pound business by buying unloved assets. He has now agreed a deal worth aboutÂ£1.25bn to acquire a 25% stakein one of the UK's best-loved brands: Manchester United FC. United's men's team, 20-time English champions, are languishing in the Premier League and have been dumped out of other competitions this season under manager Erik ten Hag. But as a business, the club has always scored highly, boasting fans around the world. Sir Jim, 71, the founder of chemical firm Ineos, first expressed his interest in buying a stake in the club in January, after the Glazer family said they were considering a sale. The Glazers have been criticised for their perceived lack of investment in the club, which has struggled since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. Before clinching the 2022-23 Carabao Cup, the club had not won a trophy since 2017. Until recently Sir Jim faced a rival bid from Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani. Buthe withdrew his offer, leaving the field clear for Sir Jim. Born in Failsworth in Greater Manchester, the son of a joiner, Sir Jim is a boyhood United fan. Known for his tough negotiating stance, he was once called Dr No by trade unions. Through buying up and turning around cast-off parts of other businesses, Sir Jim has built up a huge fortune - although estimates of his wealth vary. Forbes puts it at about $18bn (Â£15.8bn),external,whereasthe Sunday Times Rich List,external,which has him as the second wealthiest person in the UK, says it's closer to Â£30bn. Victory over Brentford at Old Trafford earlier this month still left United 10th in the Premier League From operations once owned by the likes of oil giant BP, Sir Jim created a company - Ineos - whose chemicals and raw materials go into nearly everything we touch every day. From 194 sites across 29 countries, Ineos generates sales of around Â£50bn and employs more than 26,000 people. Its raw materials are used in everything from packaging for toiletries, medicines and food, to mobile phones and furniture. Sir Jim has always been involved with chemicals and industry. After graduating with a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Birmingham in 1974, he spent several years at oil firms BP and Esso before joining the fabric and chemicals producer Courtaulds. Team Sky change name to Team Ineos Son of a joiner becomes UK's richest man Firm astonished over stance on fracking Then, in 1989, he made a career-changing step into the world of private equity when he joined Advent International. It taught Sir Jim the cut and thrust of doing deals, before he made the leap into co-owning a business himself based on what would become a well-worn strategy. He and fellow businessman John Hollowood bought BP's chemicals division in Hythe near Southampton for Â£40m in 1992. By 1994, it was valued at Â£100m when it floated on the London Stock Exchange. The business, called Inspec, went on to acquire BP's speciality chemicals business in Antwerp, Belgium. Sir Jim then left to form his own firm, Ineos, in 1998 which bought the Belgian business for Â£89m. Ineos has since grown to become a chemical powerhouse, expanding through acquisitions or by investing in controversial areas such as fracking. Ineos reversed a plan to close its Grangemouth plant in 2013 Because of his decision never to float the company and thus have no City shareholders to consult, Sir Jim - who is also the majority shareholder of Ineos - has been able to move quickly on deals. He has also earned a reputation as a tough negotiator in industrial disputes. Famously he faced off against unions at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery in Scotland in 2013, amid the threat of company-wide strikes over pay and pensions. The dispute - which earned Sir Jim the Bond villain moniker of Dr No - led to Ineos announcing that it would close the plant and cut 800 jobs. However, the firm reversed its decision shortly afterwards when the Unite union agreed to a survival plan to invest Â£300m in the site to keep it open. No stranger to controversy, Sir Jim attracted criticism when in 2016 Ineos imported the first evershipment of shale gas (derived from fracking) from the US into the UKamid fierce opposition from green groups. He also reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco in 2020, a place that does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes. Sir Jim declined to comment butwhen asked about reports he was moving to the principality in 2019 he told the BBC,externalthat he tried to ""give back to the UK"" and had invested Â£2.5bn in the country. Ineos bought the motorcycle wear maker Belstaff In recent years, Sir Jim's business interests have moved away from chemicals. He announced plans to build a new vehicle based on the Land Rover Defender, which was discontinued in 2016. However, in 2020, Sir Jim, who was a Leave campaigner in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, saidthe new 4x4 vehicle would be built in France, ending hopes it would be made at a new plant in Wales. In 2017, Ineos bought Belstaff, the luxury motorcycle wear maker whose jackets were once worn by actor Steve McQueen and modelled by the likes of David Beckham. Ineos also has a partnership with the Mercedes F1 team. And in 2019, Sir Jim became the new owner of a high-profile professional cycling team, after Ineos took over the former Team Sky. The team is now called Ineos Grenadiers. Whether or not these businesses could be classed as unloved is not certain, but Sir Jim clearly saw plenty of potential in them. Sir Jim already has some footballing interests, as he owns French side Nice and Swiss club Lausanne-Sport. In May last year, Sir Jimmade an unsuccessful Â£4.25bn offerto buy Chelsea after owner Roman Abramovich put the London club up for sale. At the time, he told BBC Sport he was a Manchester United fan and the only reason he was not bidding for the Red Devils was because they were not for sale. That is obviously no longer the case. Under the deal announced on Christmas Eve, he is set to take control of United's football operations, alongside a minority stake. Sir Jim will also provide $300m (Â£236m) for future investment into Old Trafford.

Family of bombers 'had been to Syria',"This video can not be played Surabaya is in shock over the deadly bombings A family of six who carried out three church bombings in Indonesia had returned from Syria, police say. The Islamic State group has claimed the attacks, which killed at least 13 people on Sunday. A mother and two daughters blew themselves up at a church, while the father and two sons targeted two others in Indonesia's second city, Surabaya. National police chief Tito Karnavian said they belonged to an IS-inspired network, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). Police say the family were among hundreds of Indonesians who had returned from Syria, where IS has been fighting government forces. No details were given about the family's alleged involvement in that conflict. The bombings are the deadliest in Indonesia in more than a decade, and also left more than 40 people injured. Visiting the scene of one of the attacks, President Joko Widodo described them as ""barbaric"", adding that he had ordered police to ""look into and break up networks of perpetrators"". Why is Indonesia a target for militants? Inside the home of Indonesia's most notorious IS militant Sent out to die: The young women used in militant attacks Police identified the father as Dita Oepriarto, saying he was the head of a local JAD cell. He reportedly dropped off his wife, Puji Kuswati, and their two daughters at Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church, where they blew themselves up. The girls - aged 9 and 12 - had bombs strapped to them, as did their mother. Oepriarto then drove off, launching his own bomb-laden car into the grounds of Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church, police said. The sons - aged 16 and 18 - rode motorcycles into Santa Maria Catholic Church, and detonated explosives they were carrying. It was their attack that came first, at around 07:30 local time (00:30 GMT). The other two attacks followed five minutes apart, police said. A security guard told the Associated Press news agency that the woman had arrived at the Diponegoro church carrying two bags, and forced her way inside ignoring the guards. ""Suddenly, she hugged a civilian, then [the bomb] exploded,"" said the eyewitness, who identified himself as Antonius. A burnt-out car in front of one of the bombed churches in Surabaya Later on Sunday, another bomb exploded at an apartment complex in Surabaya, killing three people, according to AFP news agency. East Java's police chief, Mahfud Arifin, said that those killed at the apartment were the perpetrators, not victims. It is not yet known if this bombing was connected to the other attacks. Also on Sunday, police said they killed four suspected members of JAD in Cianjur, in West Java province, and arrested two others. On Monday morning, another blast struck a police station in Surabaya. Police said it was a vehicle bomb and that some officers had been injured. Indonesian President Joko Widodo (R) visited the bomb sites on Sunday This appears to be the worst attack linked to IS in Indonesia. The group claimed its first attack in the country in 2016, when four civilians were killed in explosions and shootings in the capital Jakarta. It has also claimed other attacks, including one in a high-security prison near Jakarta which killed five members of security forces earlier this month. But the country's deadliest jihadist attacks predate IS. In 2002, over 200 people were killed in two bombings carried out by al-Qaeda-linked militants on the island of Bali, a popular tourist destination. In May 2005, bomb blasts killed 22 on the island of Sulawesi. Less than six months later, a suicide bombing in Bali killed 20. The BBC's Rebecca Henschke in Jakarta says Indonesia had been widely praised for its anti-terrorism crackdown since then, but the rise of IS overseas has invigorated the country's loosely constituted jihadi networks.

Kidnapped Brits 'very grateful' after release,"The pair were abducted north of the city of Goma, North Kivu province Two Britons kidnapped in a national park in DR Congo have said they are ""very grateful"" after their release. Bethan Davies and Robert Jesty wereamong three people held when their vehicle was ambushedin Virunga National Park on Friday. They paid tribute to the ""excellent support"" they had received and said they would not comment any further. Park ranger Rachel Masika Baraka was killed by the kidnappers; a driver was injured and released. The 25-year-old ranger is the eighth to be murdered at the park this year. Park director Emmanuel de Merode said: ""Ranger Baraka's life was tragically cut short in service to Virunga National Park. ""She was one of the park's 26 female rangers and was highly committed, showing true bravery in her work.

Trump delegation arrives in Israel,"Ivanka Trump greets US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman with her husband Jared Kushner (R) at Ben Gurion International Airport US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, have arrived in Israel ahead of the opening of the new US embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. The couple - both senior White House advisers - will attend the ceremony. Mr Trump himself will not be there. His decision to move operations from Tel Aviv angered Palestinians. The plan was brought forward to coincide with the state of Israel's 70th anniversary. Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future state. Mr Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital broke with decades of US neutrality on the issue and put it out of step with most of the international community. Why do evangelicals support Trump on Jerusalem? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the embassy move was a reason for celebration and called on other nations to follow suit. ""I call on all countries to join the US in moving their embassies to Jerusalem,"" Mr Netanyahu said, adding: ""It's the right thing to do... because it advances peace."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has described Mr Trump's decision to move the embassy as the ""slap of the century"". The US consulate that will act as America's interim embassy in Jerusalem A small interim embassy will open inside the existing US consulate building in Jerusalem on Monday, while a larger site will be found later when the rest of the embassy moves from Tel Aviv. President Trump is expected to address attendees at Monday's event via video link. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan will be there in person, alongside Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Mr Kushner is set to meet Israel's prime minister on Sunday afternoon, according to the local press. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The European Union has voiced strong objections to the embassy move, and most EU ambassadors in Israel will be boycotting the event. However, dozens of other foreign diplomats are expected, including representatives from Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic - countries which reportedly blocked a joint EU statement on the issue. The presidents of Guatemala and Paraguay are also set to attend; both countries decided to move their embassies to Jerusalem after Mr Trump made his announcement. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is not recognised internationally and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. What makes Jerusalem so holy? Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Various countries once had embassies based in Jerusalem but many moved after a 1980 law saw the country explicitly claim the city's east, despite UN objections. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The timing of the embassy move has led to concerns about increased tension in Gaza. Since the end of March, more than 40 Palestinians have been killed in protests at the border. The day after Israel marks its anniversary, Palestinians commemorate what they refer to as theNakbaor Catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of their people fled their homes or were displaced following the foundation of the Israeli state in 1948. Organisers call the rolling protests the Great March of Return, which is set to culminate on Tuesday. UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein accused Israel of using ""excessive force"". Israel maintains it has acted legitimately to protect its civilians from militants trying to breach the border. Why do evangelicals support Trump on Jerusalem?

PM raises jailed Briton cases with Iran,"The prime minister has raised the cases of the dual nationals being held in Iran with the country's president. In a telephone call, Theresa May urged Hassan Rouhani to make further progress over the release of British-Iranians ""on humanitarian grounds"". Mrs May also reiterated the UK's commitment to the Iran nuclear deal, which the US pulled out of last week. Downing Street said both leaders agreed to keep in contact about both topics ahead of a Brussels meeting on Tuesday. There are nearly 30 dual nationals being held by the Iranian authorities - many of whom are accused of security offences. Iran envoy seeks nuclear deal pledges Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Last month,London's Imperial College professor Abbas Edalat was detainedwhile reportedly attending an academic workshop in Tehran. Another case is that ofNazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, who is currently serving a five-year prison sentence,after being convicted of spying charges. She has always denied the claims. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in 2016 during a holiday to introduce her baby daughter Gabriella to her parents. Meanwhile, Mrs May also used the phone callto bolster the European support for the Iran nuclear deal- designed to prevent the country developing atomic weapons. US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal, which was one of his election pledges, but the UK, Germany and France remain ""firmly committed"" to upholding it. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""[Mrs May said] it is in both the UK and Iran's national security interests to maintain the deal and welcomed president Rouhani's public commitment to abide by its terms, adding that it is essential that Iran continues to meet its obligations. ""The prime minister made clear that the UK condemns the Iranian missile attacks against Israeli forces and called on Iran to refrain from any further attacks.

Britons held in DR Congo freed,"Eight rangers have been killed at Virunga National Park in 2018 so far Two Britons held hostage in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have been released unharmed, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has announced. Mr Johnson paid tribute to the DRC authorities and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation for their ""tireless help"". The Britons are receiving ""support and medical attention"", according to a statement by Virunga National Park. A park ranger killed by the kidnappers has been named as Rachel Masika Baraka. The group's driver was injured and released shortly after the abduction, which took place near the village of Kibati, just north of Goma, on the morning of 11 May. Earlier, tributes were paid to 25-year-old Ms Baraka, the eighth ranger to be murdered at the park this year. Mr Johnson said his thoughts were with Ms Baraka's family, the injured driver, ""and the released British nationals as they recover from this traumatic incident"". Park director Emmanuel de Merode said: ""Ranger Baraka's life was tragically cut short in service to Virunga National Park. She was one of the park's 26 female rangers and was highly committed, showing true bravery in her work.

""The bravery and determination of all the staff of Virunga is vital for the conservation of animals in the park, and the protection of local communities,"" he said. Congolese authorities are working with the Foreign Office to repatriate the British tourists, according to a park statement. Cosma Wilungula, director general of the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation, said: ""We would like to thank our brave team for ensuring the swift resolution of this incident, and the safe return of the two British nationals."" The BBC's Louise Dewast, reporting from the country's capital Kinshasa, said there were armed groups operating in the park and there had been kidnappings before, with half involving a ransom demand. In April, Mr de Merode,told the BBC World Servicethat recent attacks were part of ""a bigger picture which involves the trafficking of natural resources"". He said the park was protected by around 800 rangers but there were also estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 militia members in and around the park. Last month five young rangers and a driver were killed in a militia ambush, the park said. It was the deadliest attack in recent years and took the total number of rangers killed in the last 20 years to 175. A fifth of the park's southern sector was also deforested due to illegal charcoal production last year, the park said. The national park, which runs along the border with Uganda and Rwanda, covers 3,000 sq miles (7,800 sq km). It is a Unesco world heritage site and home to critically-endangered mountain gorillas, as well as lions, elephants and hippos. BBC Africa editor Will Ross said poachers were active in the park, which was also under threat due to the illegal felling of trees to make charcoal and plans for oil exploration. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to Goma and has urged Britons not to go beyond the city. Theadvice, last updated four days ago,,externalsays tourists are vulnerable if travelling without escorted transport in the eastern part of the country, and the ""risk of kidnap or injury as a result of armed or criminal activity remains high"". It said that UK government staff were not always in the area and the British embassy's ability to offer consular assistance could be ""severely limited"".

Records tumble in Premier League finale,"Mohamed Salah was named Premier League player of the year on Sunday Mohamed Salah broke the Premier League scoring record for a 38-game season as Liverpool qualified for the Champions League on a busy final day of the season. Salah's 32nd goal - taking him past Alan Shearer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez, a Dejan Lovren header, Dominic Solanke's first goal for the club and Andrew Robertson's goal secured victory. They needed only a point to head off Chelsea and seal the fourth remaining spot in Europe's premier club competition next season. Victory was not enough to take Liverpool up to third place, which was claimed by Tottenham with a stunning 5-4 win over Leicester in what may be their final game at Wembley before moving to their new stadium at White Hart Lane. Mauricio Pochettino's side trailed three times, but a brace each for Erik Lamela and Harry Kane - the latter reached 30 goals for the league season as a result - along with an own goal from Christian Fuchs gave them victory. Kane's England team-mate Jamie Vardy scored two of Leicester's four goals. Match report: Liverpool 4-0 Brighton Match report: Tottenham 5-4 Leicester If Liverpool had lost to Brighton, they would not have missed out on the top four as a result of Chelsea's 3-0 loss at Newcastle. Ayoze Perez scored twice after Dwight Gayle's opener to ensure Rafael Benitez's Newcastle finished 10th in the table, while Antonio Conte's side had to settle for fifth and a shot at the FA Cup in Saturday's final against Manchester United. Match report: Newcastle 3-0 Chelsea Swansea needed to win, Southampton lose to Man City and there be a 10-goal swing to avoid being relegated on the final day. Swansea took the lead against Stoke but fell to a 2-1 defeat and a place in the Championship next season. An injury-time goal from Gabriel Jesus consigned Southampton to defeat but, more significantly, gave champions Manchester City the win they needed to end their remarkable season with a record 100 points. Match report: Swansea 1-2 Stoke Match report: Southampton 0-1 Man City Arsene Wenger's final game of his 22-season Arsenal career was a victorious one as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's first-half goal gave them a win at Huddersfield. Both sets of fans applauded Wenger in the 22nd minute of the game and two planes flew overhead dragging messages of support for the Frenchman. Match report: Huddersfield 0-1 Arsenal West Brom's stay in the Premier League ended with a 2-0 defeat at Crystal Palace, for whom Wilfried Zaha and Patrick van Aanholt scored. Match report: Crystal Palace 2-0 West Brom In a game between two sides managed by a former boss of the other team, David Moyes' West Ham came out on top against Sam Allardyce's Everton, with Manuel Lanzini scoring twice in a 3-1 win. Marcus Rashford scored the only goal in Manchester United's 1-0 home win over Watford, while Callum Wilson's 93rd-minute strike gave Bournemouth a 2-1 comeback win at Burnley. Match report: West Ham 3-1 Everton Match report: Man Utd 1-0 Watford Match report: Burnley 1-2 Bournemouth In Scotland, Rangers and Hibernian shared 10 goals in a superb game at Easter Road. Hibs took a 3-0 lead inside 22 minutes but Rangers levelled the score before the break. The away side looked on course for victory, leading 5-4 going in to the last five minutes but Jason Holt's sending-off left them vulnerable and Jamie Maclaren completed his hat-trick to rescue a point for Hibs. Aberdeen became the first Scottish team to inflict a home defeat on Brendan Rodgers' Celtic as the Dons secured second place in the Premiership and limited Rangers to third. Lee Erwin's early goal was enough to give Kilmarnock a 1-0 win over Hearts and seal fifth place with their highest Premiership points tally of 59.

Trump delegation arrives in IsraelIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner will open the new US embassy in Jerusalem on Monday.,"Ivanka Trump greets US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman with her husband Jared Kushner (R) at Ben Gurion International Airport US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, have arrived in Israel ahead of the opening of the new US embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. The couple - both senior White House advisers - will attend the ceremony. Mr Trump himself will not be there. His decision to move operations from Tel Aviv angered Palestinians. The plan was brought forward to coincide with the state of Israel's 70th anniversary. Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future state. Mr Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital broke with decades of US neutrality on the issue and put it out of step with most of the international community. Why do evangelicals support Trump on Jerusalem? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the embassy move was a reason for celebration and called on other nations to follow suit. ""I call on all countries to join the US in moving their embassies to Jerusalem,"" Mr Netanyahu said, adding: ""It's the right thing to do... because it advances peace."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has described Mr Trump's decision to move the embassy as the ""slap of the century"". The US consulate that will act as America's interim embassy in Jerusalem A small interim embassy will open inside the existing US consulate building in Jerusalem on Monday, while a larger site will be found later when the rest of the embassy moves from Tel Aviv. President Trump is expected to address attendees at Monday's event via video link. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan will be there in person, alongside Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Mr Kushner is set to meet Israel's prime minister on Sunday afternoon, according to the local press. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The European Union has voiced strong objections to the embassy move, and most EU ambassadors in Israel will be boycotting the event. However, dozens of other foreign diplomats are expected, including representatives from Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic - countries which reportedly blocked a joint EU statement on the issue. The presidents of Guatemala and Paraguay are also set to attend; both countries decided to move their embassies to Jerusalem after Mr Trump made his announcement. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is not recognised internationally and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. What makes Jerusalem so holy? Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Various countries once had embassies based in Jerusalem but many moved after a 1980 law saw the country explicitly claim the city's east, despite UN objections. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The timing of the embassy move has led to concerns about increased tension in Gaza. Since the end of March, more than 40 Palestinians have been killed in protests at the border. The day after Israel marks its anniversary, Palestinians commemorate what they refer to as theNakbaor Catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of their people fled their homes or were displaced following the foundation of the Israeli state in 1948. Organisers call the rolling protests the Great March of Return, which is set to culminate on Tuesday. UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein accused Israel of using ""excessive force"". Israel maintains it has acted legitimately to protect its civilians from militants trying to breach the border. Why do evangelicals support Trump on Jerusalem?

Paris attack suspect 'of Chechen origin',"This video can not be played Eyewitness Jonathan says the attacker's hands were covered in blood The suspect in a deadly knife attack in central Paris on Saturday evening is a French citizen born in 1997 in Russia's republic of Chechnya, sources say. Named by media as Khamzat Asimov, he was on a French watch list of people who could pose a threat to national security, the sources said. Police shot dead the attacker in the busy OpÃ©ra district after he killed a man and injured four other people. The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted (in French): ""France has once again paid in blood,external, but will not give an inch to the enemies of freedom."" Later on Sunday, a judicial source said that a friend of the suspect had been detained for questioning in the eastern city of Strasbourg. France has been on high alert following a series of attacks. More than 230 people have been killed by IS-inspired jihadists in the past three years. The suspect was not carrying any identification papers and has not yet been officially named. Sources told French media the man had no criminal record and his parents had been held for questioning. He is believed to be a French citizen who was naturalised in 2010. This video can not be played French police at the scene of the attack in Paris The man had been categorised as ""fiche S"", the sources said. This flags people considered to be a possible threat to national security and allows for surveillance without being a cause for arrest. It includes those suspected of Islamist radicalisation but is wide-ranging and covers such groups as political extremists, gangsters and even football hooligans. In 2015, then Prime Minister Manuel Valls said there were 20,000 names on the list, about half related to Islamist radicalisation. This would be the first time an assailant of Chechen origin has carried out a terrorist attack in France. France is home to some 30,000 people of Chechen origin. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the man who died was a 29-year-old passer-by but gave no further details. The four who were injured have also not yet been named. AFP news agency, citing sources, said a 34-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman were seriously hurt, while a 26-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man were slightly wounded. One of the injured was a Chinese citizen, Chinese media have reported. Mr Collomb said none had life-threatening injuries. The attacker began stabbing passers-by at about 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT). Eyewitnesses described him as a young man with brown hair and a beard, dressed in black tracksuit trousers. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) during the attack, witnesses said. The man tried to enter several bars and restaurants but was blocked by people inside. Police first tried to stop the assailant with a Taser before shooting him dead, nine minutes after he began the attack. Jonathan, a waiter at a local restaurant, told AFP: ""I saw him with a knife in his hand. He looked crazy."" AFP news agency released an undated photo of Khamzat Asimov He said a woman, stabbed by the attacker, had run into into the restaurant bleeding. The assailant tried to follow her inside but was fended off and finally fled. Two of the wounded in the attack are in a serious condition but do not have life-threatening injuries. IS said it was behind the attack in a brief statement posted on its news outlet. Chechnya is a republic in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia. The republic declared independence in 1991 but three years later Russian troops were sent in to quash the movement, sparking a decade-long conflict. Chechnya - boiling point for conflict Jihadist groups, including those aligned with IS, have long operated in the region. The brothers behind the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had Chechen links and Turkish authorities said a Chechen jihadist was the suspected organiser of an attack on Istanbul airport in 2016 that killed 45 people. The jihadist, Akhmed Chatayev, a member of IS,was killed in a clash with special forces in the Georgian capital Tbilisi in 2017. IS has actively recruited fighters in Chechnya, sending hundreds to conflicts in Syria and elsewhere. A report from the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in 2016 spoke of the fear that the fighters would return to carry out terrorist attacks at home. This video can not be played Officials at Grozny's central mosque are looking carefully for hints of radicalisation Strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, who was nominated for the Chechen presidency by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007 and is now firmly in control, has tried to halt IS recruitment but human rights activists say his measures have been brutal and have often helped radicalisation.

Eurovision sheds light on stage invasion,"This video can not be played Watch: A man interrupts the UK's Eurovision entry in Lisbon The Eurovision Song Contest stage invader gained access to the stage by climbing into a camera run and going over a bridge, organisers have said. The man interrupted the UK's singer SuRie, who finished third from bottom at the event in Lisbon on Saturday. The European Broadcasting Union said an internal investigation was under way. The EBU said he was pursued by security over the bridge, adding: ""He was removed off stage after seven seconds and is being questioned by police."" The statement continued: ""We take security very seriously and an investigation into what happened is already under way."" The stage invader took the microphone off SuRie, before being dragged off stage SuRie was singing her song Storm when a man with a rucksack ran onto the stage, grabbed her microphone, and appeared to say: ""Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom.""

Brexit customs plan has 'flaws' - Gove,"This video can not be played Gove expresses doubts about Brexit customs plan Michael Gove has cast doubt on the viability of Theresa May's proposed customs partnership with the EU after Brexit, telling the BBC it has ""flaws"". The environment secretary said there were ""significant question marks"" about whether the model, described as crazy by Boris Johnson, was deliverable. The PM, whose ministers are considering two customs options, says ""compromises"" will be needed but she will ""deliver"". But Labour said the lack of a decision on the critical issue was ""farcical"". The UK is committed to leaving the current customs union when it exits the EU on 29 March 2019 and ministers are under pressure to agree soon on a successor arrangement amid divisions in cabinet. The customs partnership thought to be preferred by Mrs May would see Britain continue to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, as well as refunding UK firms if they were only liable for lower rates. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mrs May promised a solution which ensured frictionless trade, enabled the UK to strike trade deals around the world and which did not result in a hard border on the island of Ireland. Johnson: No 10's customs plans 'crazy' DUP MP hits out at Irish foreign minister Leonard calls for cross-party Brexit talks ""You can trust me to deliver,"" she wrote. ""I will not let you down"". On the customs issues, she said she had ""proposed different options for a new customs arrangement with the EU and the government will continue to develop them during the negotiations"". A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods crossed a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Mr Gove, one of the leading Brexiteers in the cabinet, told the Andrew Marr show that he trusted the PM to reach an agreement but he expressed doubts about what is believed to be her preferred option. The leading Leave campaigner is one of a group of cabinet ministers asked by the PM to stress-test the partnership model - which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU on goods coming into the UK. ""Because it is novel, because no model like this exists, there have to be significant question marks over the deliverability of it on time,"" he said. ""More than that, what it requires the British government to do is, in effect, act as the tax collector... for the European Union... It is my view that the new customs partnership has flaws and that they need to be tested."" The Irish foreign minister said he ""did not take his lead"" from Boris Johnson Neither this option nor the alternative - a ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement using technology to ensure the seamless movement of goods - was ""absolutely perfect"", he acknowledged. But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said neither of the options were ""workable nor acceptable to the EU"" and, with time running out, Parliament must force the government's hand by backing a ""comprehensive"" customs union. ""We are in a farcical situation,"" he told the Andrew Marr show. ""We want a vote on a customs union with the EU. That is the only way to resolve this impasse."" Mrs May has insisted the final Brexit deal must honour the agreements in the Northern Ireland peace process - and that there can be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, dismissed the idea of using any form of infrastructure or technology to maintain separate customs regimes between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We just simply think it won't work. If you don't believe me on it, listen to people who are living locally. Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? May splits cabinet to seek Brexit solution ""Listen to the chief constable of the PSNI. He is saying any infrastructure on the border, any physical infrastructure on the border, is going to represent a risk to his officers."" Suggesting the Irish government ""did not take its lead"" from Boris Johnson and warning of a ""difficult summer"", he said the two governments could agree a ""shared customs space or shared customs territory"". In other Brexit developments, a cross-party group of former cabinet ministers - including former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband - has urged Parliament to vote to remain in both the customs union and the single market, arguing it is vital for the economy. And student organisations representing almost a million young people have also written to MPs demanding a referendum on any final Brexit deal. Organised by the campaign group For our Future's Sake, the letter from 60 student unions says promises made by pro-Brexit groups have not been kept and that an estimated 1.4 million people were too young to vote in June 2016 but now deserve a say.

Family launches Indonesia suicide attacksPolice blame a single family for suicide blasts that killed 13 people at churches.1han hour agoAsia,"This video can not be played Surabaya is in shock over the deadly bombings A family of six, including a nine-year-old girl, were behind a wave of blasts targeting three churches in Indonesia's second city of Surabaya, police say. At least 13 people died in Sunday's bombings, which the Islamic State group has claimed. The mother and two daughters blew themselves up at one church, while the father and two sons targeted two others. The family had recently spent time in Syria, according to the police. The bombings are the deadliest in Indonesia since 2005, and they have also left dozens of people injured. Why is Indonesia a target for militants? Inside the home of Indonesia's most notorious IS militant Police chief Tito Karnavian said the family belonged to an Indonesian IS-inspired network, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). The father drove a bomb-laden car into the grounds of Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church, police said. The mother and her two daughters - aged 9 and 12 - had bombs strapped to them and blew themselves up at Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church. The family's sons - aged 16 and 18 - rode motorcycles into Santa Maria Catholic Church, and detonated explosives they were carrying. It was their attack that came first, at around 07:30 local time (00:30 GMT). The other two attacks followed five minutes apart, police said, according to the Jakarta Post. Officials reportedly foiled attacks against other churches. Police helped people looking for missing loved ones after the attacks Visiting the scene of one of the bombings, President Joko Widodo described the attacks as ""barbaric"", adding that he had ordered police to ""look into and break up networks of perpetrators"". Also on Sunday, police said they killed four suspected members of JAD in Cianjur, West Java, and arrested two others. By BBC Indonesia Editor Rebecca Henschke The blasts were co-ordinated to hit those coming to morning services and were over within the space of just 10 minutes. In recent years women have become increasingly active in terrorist cells in Indonesia but this would be the first time children have been used. Indonesia had been widely praised for its sustained anti-terrorism crackdown following the 2002 Bali bombings. It has managed a seemingly successful combination of arrests and killings, alongside a de-radicalisation program that focused on changing minds and providing alternative incomes for released terrorists. But the rise of IS overseas has invigorated the loosely constituted jihadi networks. There has also been rising intolerance in recent years in this once tolerant, pluralist, majority-Muslim nation, which has made minority groups increasingly uncomfortable. This appears to be the worst attack linked to IS in Indonesia. The group claimed its first attack in the country in January 2016, when four civilians were killed in a series of explosions and shootings in the capital Jakarta. It has also claimed other attacks, such as violence earlier this month in a high-security prison near Jakarta, in which five members of security forces were killed. But the country's deadliest jihadist attacks predate IS. In 2002, over 200 people were killed in two bombings carried out by al-Qaeda-linked militants outside a bar and nightclub on the island of Bali, a popular tourist destination. In May 2005, bomb blasts killed 22 on the island of Sulawesi. Less than six months later, a suicide bombing in Bali killed 20. Why is Indonesia a target for IS militants?

Grandfather 'planned' mass shooting,"This video can not be played Aaron Cockman describes his grief The father of four children found shot dead along with their mother in rural Western Australia has pointed the finger of blame at their grandfather. Aaron Cockman said he believed that Peter Miles, 61, had not ""snapped"" but had been ""thinking this through for a long time"". The bodies of Miles, his wife Cynda, daughter Katrina and four grandchildren were found in Osmington on Friday. Police have said they are not looking for any other suspects. They have not confirmed the identity of the killer but say they believe him to be among the dead. Three long firearms found at the property were licensed to Mr Miles, they say. Katrina Miles lived on the property with her parents and four children Mr Cockman was estranged from Katrina Miles at the time of the killings. He told reporters he did not feel angry about what had happened, just ""tremendous sadness for my kids. I don't want anyone to feel angry"". Of Mr Miles, he said: ""I still love who Peter was and... if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have Katrina, I wouldn't have any kids. So it's not some random guy off the street who's taken them away from me, he gave them to me and now he's taken them away"". Mr Cockman said he believed that Mr Miles had been facing some difficulties. His comments came amid local media reports - citing social media posts published earlier by Katrina - that the children had autism. ""Peter has been trying to hold it together for a long time. He's just thought... I can't live anymore, so this is it for me,external,"" he is quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald. He said on Sunday he took some solace from knowing his children had died peacefully in their sleep but added: ""I've lost everything in my life."" Cynda Miles was well known in her community Police say they were alerted to the killings by a phone call from a man at the property early on Friday morning. When they arrived, they found the bodies of Peter Miles, outside the property, Cynda, 58, in the house, and Katrina, 35, and her children, Taye, 13, Rylan, 12, Ayre, 10, and Kayden, eight, in a nearby converted shed they were living in. The killings have rocked the tiny rural community of Osmington, which is about 20km (12 miles) from Margaret River, a popular tourist and wine-growing area. Police probe Western Australia deaths.

Salah breaks Premier League scoring record,"Mohamed Salah has scored 44 goals in 51 games for Liverpool in all competitions this season Mohamed Salah set a new Premier League scoring record as Liverpool sealed a place in next season's Champions League with an emphatic victory over Brighton, and manager Jurgen Klopp believes the forward can ""still improve so much"". It was an impressive Liverpool performance on a perfect sunny afternoon at Anfield and Klopp's side lingered long after the final whistle, soaking up the celebratory atmosphere with the Champions League final against Real Madrid to come on 26 May. ""Two weeks' break is perfect for us,"" said Klopp. ""We will be ready for the final. This group of players really deserve it. They keep moving to the next level."" Salah was the centre of attention as he was feted on his side's home pitch after the match. There was the Golden Boot for Premier League's top scorer to be presented, the club's player of the year trophy too. The forward was clearly moved, and he shared the moment with his wife and young daughter. It was his record goal that set the Reds on course to blowing Brighton away. The opener, a low finish from Dominic Solanke's pass, was his 32nd goal of the campaign - the most by a player in a 38-game Premier League season. Dejan Lovren doubled the lead by powerfully heading in Andrew Robertson's cross and after the break it was more of the same - Liverpool continued to dominate. Solanke smashed in his first goal for the club off the underside of the bar, having met Salah's lay-off at the end of a strong run, while full-back Andrew Robertson also got his first Liverpool goal, sweeping in from close range with five minutes to play. Liverpool would have slipped out of the top four had they lost and Chelsea beaten Newcastle, but they made sure the Blues' result - a 3-0 defeat at St James' Park - was irrelevant. Victory meant the Reds matched their fourth-place finish of last season - they would have moved up to third had Tottenham not edged a thrilling 5-4 win at home to Leicester - while Brighton ended their first top-flight campaign since 1983 in the safety of 15th. Football Daily: 'Liverpool head to Kiev full of confidence' The Premier League table - from August to May,external What a remarkable season it has been for Egypt forward Salah, who signed from Roma for Â£34m last summer. Some doubted his ability to perform in England following his disappointing spell at Chelsea, but the goal that broke the Premier League record was his 44th in 51 games for Liverpool in all competitions this season. Alan Shearer scored 31 Premier League goals for Blackburn in 1995-96, Cristiano Ronaldo did the same for Manchester United in 2007-08, and Luis Suarez netted 31 for Liverpool in 2013-14. Shearer, for Blackburn in 1994-95, and Andy Cole, for Newcastle United in 1993-94, jointly hold the Premier League scoring record for a 42-match season - with 34 goals. Perhaps that total is what Salah was thinking of when he was taken off just before Liverpool's fourth, visibly disappointed. He left with Brighton at their most vulnerable, weary and exhausted from an afternoon living on their nerves against Liverpool's attack. Earlier on Sunday, Salah added thePremier League's Player of the Season awardto the two other major individual prizes he was won this year - the PFA Player of the Year and Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year awards. But with the Champions League final against Real - winners of the past two tournaments - to come, the biggest piece of silverware is still to be settled. Chris Hughton's Brighton team can feel proud of what they have achieved this season. Many will have tipped them for relegation, but they have proved themselves more than capable of competing at English football's elite level. There was the impressive 3-0 victory at West Ham in October, March's 2-1 home win over Arsenal at the end of a five-match unbeaten run, and a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals, where they lost to Manchester United. Revenge over United came in the shape of a 1-0 win that confirmed their Premier League status on 4 May, and survival was always the only aim for Brighton this season - Hughton said it ""meant everything"". But perhaps there will be a slight regret over their end-of-season form. The 4 March victory over Arsenal put the Seagulls 10th in the table, after which they fell sharply over a run of seven matches without a win. A 10th-place finish would have earned them Â£21.4m in prize money - the take for finishing 15th will instead be Â£11.6m. Regardless, the most important thing has been achieved - they will be back next season. How can you overlook the man of the moment? Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport:""The boys had pressure on them - massive pressure for the last few weeks. It is fantastic to qualify for the Champions League. It's a massive achievement. This video can not be played Champions League qualification massive success - Jurgen Klopp ""We did it in an impressive manner. We tried to win the game from the first second. A point was enough but I have no real idea how to go for a point. ""We could have scored many more but I'm glad we didn't. Brighton did not deserve that after a really good season. ""James Milner (who was left out of the squad) will be fine, just today was a bit early for him. ""I had no clue about (Salah's) record. I took him off and then I heard that Tottenham had scored five - Harry Kane could have got them all! He has been brilliant and he can improve so much. He will score in the future, 100%."" This video can not be played Liverpool were relentless - Hughton Brighton boss Chris Hughton told BBC Sport:""It was a very hard afternoon for us. We knew when we came here we would have to play at a very high level and stay in the game but they caused us so many problems. ""The only disappointment was that we didn't keep possession well enough today. The season as a whole, we have been in nearly every game and we have had good performances against the big clubs. ""We find it hard playing the top six away from home but our season shows more good than bad."" BBC Match of the Day pundit Ian Wright Salah was back to his best against Brighton. I've only seen him have two poor games all season: against Chelsea and Roma. But he got his record-breaking goal and I think he should have had a penalty too. He was unmarkable, unplayable. I was very surprised to see him play in some games recently because I would have been saving him. But he's scored against 17 teams and now he's got the Golden Boot. Liverpool have gone unbeaten at home in a top-flight season for the seventh time, more than any other side They have finished in the top four in consecutive Premier League seasons for the first time since a run of four campaigns between 2005-06 and 2008-09 Salah has scored against 17 different opponents in the league this season; a Premier League record He has scored in 34 different club games in all competitions this season, at least four more than any other player in Europe's big five leagues (Paris St-Germain's Edinson Cavani, 30) Premier League final day - Swansea down, Man City reach 100 points, Liverpool in top four Man City hit century - final-day stats 5 live's Football Daily: Liverpool head to Kiev full of confidence - Nevin Premier League official site Liverpool FC Brighton & Hove Albion - Homepage Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Bergvall is headline act as young Spurs show incredible maturity' West Ham to appoint Potter after sacking Lopetegui Tottenham's Bentancur taken off on stretcher after injury against Liverpool Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the factory he used to work in to find out how they bake 1.4 million loaves a week Dara Ã  Briain and Isy Suttie discover strange-but-true tales The pair are joined by astronaut Helen Sharman to learn about how humans learned to survive in space A round-up of 2024's top sports stories.

Son of a joiner becomes UK's richest man,"Jim Ratcliffe owns 60% of Ineos, the chemicals company he founded A businessman who once lived in a council house near Manchester is the richest person in the UK, according to theSunday Times Rich List,external. Jim Ratcliffe, who founded chemical firm Ineos, topped the list with an estimated worth of Â£21.05bn - after coming 18th last year. Two of the company's directors are also on the list, which ranks Britain's wealthiest 1,000 people or families. Jamie Oliver and fashion tycoon Sir Philip Green saw their fortunes drop. Profile: The man who turned cast-offs into gold Mr Ratcliffe, 65, moved from the council house in Failsworth to East Yorkshire as a boy. He went to Beverley Grammar School, studied chemical engineering at Birmingham University, and got an MBA from London Business School,according to a Financial Times profile.,external His father, who was a joiner, went on to run a factory that made laboratory furniture, while his mother worked in an accounts office. Mr Ratcliffe's firm is currentlylocked in a legal battlewith the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking. His wealth leapt by Â£15bn in the past year - partly because of a revaluation of his assets. He is the first UK-born person to top the rich list since the Duke of Westminster in 2003. This video can not be played Ineos chairman, Jim Ratcliffe, on how Britain should negotiate Brexit Mr Ratcliffe has been on expeditions to the North and South Poles, has run marathons, and is a Manchester United fan. In 2015, he said the UK could thrive outside the European Union. ""The Brits are perfectly capable of managing the Brits and don't need Brussels telling them how to manage things,"" he said. ""I just don't believe in the concept of a United States of Europe. It's not viable."" In 2016, he told the BBC the government needed ""backbone"" when negotiating its exit from the EU. Jamie Oliver fell off the list altogether At second place in the list were the Hinduja brothers, Sri and Gopi, worth Â£20.64bn. Their fortune jumped by Â£4.44 billion from 2017. British-American industrialist-turned-media mogul Sir Len Blavatnik came in third place with Â£15.26bn. Sir Philip Green's estimated fortune fell by Â£787m to Â£2bn - partly because of his decision to contribute Â£363m to the BHS pension deficit. Jamie Oliver fell off the list entirely, afterproblems at his restaurant group. In total, 141 women are on the rich list, with Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, of the brewing dynasty, ranked highest at number six. McIlroy tops young sports star rich list Ed, Rita and Calvin are raking it in Six surprising ways to get rich Robert Watts, who compiled the list, said: ""Britain is changing. Gone are the days when old money and a small band of industries dominated the Sunday Times Rich List. ""Aristocrats and inherited wealth has been elbowed out of the list and replaced by an army of self-made entrepreneurs. ""Today's super rich include people who have set up businesses selling chocolate, sushi, pet food and eggs.

Dame Tessa Jowell dies aged 70,"This video can not be played Tessa Jowell opens up about living with brain cancer Former Labour cabinet minister Dame Tessa Jowell has died aged 70, her family has said. Dame Tessa, who was diagnosed with brain cancer in May last year, suffered a haemorrhage on Friday, and had been in a coma until her death on Saturday.

She earned a minute-long standing ovation in the House of Lords in January for speaking about the issue. Obituary: Dame Tessa Jowell 'No London 2012 without Tessa Jowell' ""In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close,"" she said during her speech.

Tessa Jowell once said she'd ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair. She was probably only half-joking. However, her loyalty to New Labour was more than simply tactical or careerist. She was pro-European and in favour of a mixed-economy when both were deeply unfashionable on the left. Her belief that Labour should ""modernise"" was passionately held - forged at the coal face of a decade of Labour local activism. Dame Tessa will be remembered at Westminster as someone who managed to be ideologically committed to her cause without overt sectarian bitterness. Obituary: Dame Tessa Jowell Dame Tessa, a former social worker, first stood for Parliament in a 1978 by-election in Ilford North on the Essex-London border. She lost to her Conservative rival and was defeated again the following year. She made it to Westminster in 1992, as MP for Dulwich and West Norwood. In 1997, she was one of the 101 female Labour MPs on the benches following the party's landslide victory. Dame Tessa first stood for Parliament in a 1978 by-election in Ilford North on the Essex-London border Dame Tessa was employment minister and minister for women, before joining the cabinet as culture secretary in 2001, during which she helped bring the Olympic Games to London. In 2012 she was made Dame Tessa Jowell in the Birthday Honours for political and charitable services.

Lady Jowell once said she'd ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair. She was probably only half-joking. However, her loyalty to New Labour was more than simply tactical or careerist. She was pro-European and in favour of a mixed-economy when both were deeply unfashionable on the left. Her belief that Labour should ""modernise"" was passionately held - forged at the coal face of a decade of Labour local activism. Lady Jowell will be remembered at Westminster as someone who managed to be ideologically committed to her cause without overt sectarian bitterness. Obituary: Dame Tessa Jowell Lady Jowell, a former social worker, first stood for Parliament in a 1978 by-election in Ilford North on the Essex-London border. She lost to her Conservative rival and was defeated again the following year. She made it to Westminster in 1992, as MP for Dulwich and West Norwood. In 1997, she was one of the 101 female Labour MPs on the benches following the party's landslide victory. Lady Jowell was employment minister and minister for women, before joining the cabinet as culture secretary in 2001, during which she helped bring the Olympic Games to London. In 2012 she was made Dame Tessa Jowell in the Birthday Honours for political and charitable services. After stepping down from the Commons at the 2015 general election, she was made Baroness Jowell of Brixton.

'One family' behind Indonesia blasts,"This video can not be played Surabaya is in shock over the deadly bombings A family of six, including a nine-year-old girl, were behind a wave of blasts targeting three churches in Indonesia's second city of Surabaya, police say. At least 13 people died in Sunday's bombings, which the Islamic State group has claimed. The mother and two daughters blew themselves up at one church, while the father and two sons targeted two others. The family had recently spent time in Syria, according to the police. The bombings are the deadliest in Indonesia since 2005, and they have also left dozens of people injured. Why is Indonesia a target for militants? Inside the home of Indonesia's most notorious IS militant Police chief Tito Karnavian said the family belonged to an Indonesian IS-inspired network, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). The father drove a bomb-laden car into the grounds of Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church, police said. The mother and her two daughters - aged 9 and 12 - had bombs strapped to them and blew themselves up at Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church. The family's sons - aged 16 and 18 - rode motorcycles into Santa Maria Catholic Church, and detonated explosives they were carrying. It was their attack that came first, at around 07:30 local time (00:30 GMT). The other two attacks followed five minutes apart, police said, according to the Jakarta Post. Officials reportedly foiled attacks against other churches. Police helped people looking for missing loved ones after the attacks Visiting the scene of one of the bombings, President Joko Widodo described the attacks as ""barbaric"", adding that he had ordered police to ""look into and break up networks of perpetrators"". Also on Sunday, police said they killed four suspected members of JAD in Cianjur, West Java, and arrested two others. By BBC Indonesia Editor Rebecca Henschke The blasts were co-ordinated to hit those coming to morning services and were over within the space of just 10 minutes. In recent years women have become increasingly active in terrorist cells in Indonesia but this would be the first time children have been used. Indonesia had been widely praised for its sustained anti-terrorism crackdown following the 2002 Bali bombings. It has managed a seemingly successful combination of arrests and killings, alongside a de-radicalisation program that focused on changing minds and providing alternative incomes for released terrorists. But the rise of IS overseas has invigorated the loosely constituted jihadi networks. There has also been rising intolerance in recent years in this once tolerant, pluralist, majority-Muslim nation, which has made minority groups increasingly uncomfortable. This appears to be the worst attack linked to IS in Indonesia. The group claimed its first attack in the country in January 2016, when four civilians were killed in a series of explosions and shootings in the capital Jakarta. It has also claimed other attacks, such as violence earlier this month in a high-security prison near Jakarta, in which five members of security forces were killed. But the country's deadliest jihadist attacks predate IS. In 2002, over 200 people were killed in two bombings carried out by al-Qaeda-linked militants outside a bar and nightclub on the island of Bali, a popular tourist destination. In May 2005, bomb blasts killed 22 on the island of Sulawesi. Less than six months later, a suicide bombing in Bali killed 20. Why is Indonesia a target for IS militants?

Deported EU rough sleepers win damagesThe UK government is to pay compensation after trying to deport EU nationals sleeping rough.,"This video can not be played Tomas Lusas, a Lithuanian national, was awarded Â£10,000 after being illegally detained The government is to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to European rough sleepers who were illegally detained and deported. Figures obtained by the BBC reveal that in the year to May 2017, 698 homeless EU nationals were targeted and removed from the country. The Home Office said no further action was being taken against European citizens for rough sleeping. Law firms told the BBC that at least 45 clients were currently pursuing claims. Each claim is worth thousands of pounds, and varies according to the length of time spent in detention as well as other aggravating factors. Tomas Lusas, from Lithuania, was arrested by immigration officers in 2016 after being kicked out of his home and forced onto the streets in west London. He said: ""One morning I was woken up in my sleeping bag. There were six or seven officers and they said 'Home Office'. ""They took my ID. Two minutes later I was in handcuffs. Two minutes after that I was in a van. ""I was shouting, 'I'm gonna lose my job if you arrest me today'. But nobody listened to me. Nobody allowed me to explain why I was sleeping rough."" Mr Lusas refused to sign his removal papers and was detained at Brook House Immigration Centre in Gatwick for 19 days. ""It was like being in jail,"" he said. ""Your freedom is taken away. And what kills you is that you don't know the end of your sentence. ""I've spent nine years of my life in England and I didn't want to leave just because I was sleeping rough."" Mr Lusas appealed against his deportation and was successful. He was later awarded more than Â£10,000 in damages. The Home Office under Theresa May introduced the concept of rough sleeping as an abuse of EU treaty rights two years ago. But immigration enforcement teams were targeting rough sleepers even if they were in work or had a permanent right of residence in the UK. The policy was halted aftera judicial review in Decemberruled it to be unlawful and discriminatory. Leonie Hirst, an immigration and public law barrister, said anyone from the EU or the European Economic Area who had been detained or deported in similar circumstances could now make a potential claim. ""The EU law is clear and very robust, but the policy was a very flimsy attempt to misuse the law, simply to meet immigration targets,"" she said. ""I think it is highly unlikely, particularly given that people were targeted who were working, that this policy has done anything except cost significant amounts of public money."" Ms Hirst said she had heard evidence that immigration teams were working to quotas. She said she had seen cases where officials were ignoring the usual practice of inquiring into individual circumstances before deciding whether to remove them. ""One of my clients told immigration officers that he had payslips with him to prove he was working, and he had the response, 'we don't want to see those, we're operating quotas',"" she said. A Home Office spokesperson said that ""claims for compensation will be considered on a case-by-case basis"" and that the government was ""determined to break the homelessness cycle"".

'I'll keep competing with myself till I die'Eurovision 2018's winner Netta says the competition was always with herself.10h10 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played Meet Netta Barzilai So it was the relatable Netta from Israel who won this year's Eurovision rather than Cyprus' glamorous Eleni. Eurovision proved once more that it embraces the outsider, the person who doesn't fit in. It follows Conchita Wurst's victory in 2014 and, before her, that of Dana International in 1998. Nettatold BBC Newsthat she came to realise that she was ""different"" because of her size and found out that ""different is often not accepted"". Israel wins Eurovision Song Contest Eurovision: As it happened Stage stormed during UK's Eurovision song The night in pictures Some of Graham Norton's best bits This is why, as she lifted her winner's trophy, she said: ""Thank you for choosing different."" Netta stood out in this year's competition right from the beginning. Cyprus had been the bookies' favourite In the weeks leading up to the contest all the buzz was about the Israeli entry. But in the past few days, her star seemed to have waned in favour of Cyprus' hair-flicking Eleni Foureira. Certainly among the press, Netta had been almost written off - with Cyprus, France, Ireland and Italy thought to be the more credible acts. By the half-way point in the scoring, though, the national juries had confounded this and she was in a strong third position. And then for the public vote - where the 25-year old gained enough points from viewers at home to move into first and take the Eurovision crown. They had seen someone who was fun and quirky but who also carried a meaningful and substantial message of accepting who you are. In 2018, Netta's victory feels particularly deserved following the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. Eleni - all credit to her - was perhaps just too beautiful, too slick and too mainstream. In the end, the vote wasn't even that close: Eleni's 436 points to Netta's 529. Netta said the competition wasn't against Eleni, but was about challenging herself. ""I'll keep competing with myself till I die,"" she said in an interview following her win. This video can not be played A man interrupts the UK's SuRie during her Eurovision performance in Lisbon Aside from Netta's win, outside the Altice Arena all fans wanted to talk about was the stage invasion during SuRie's performance for the UK. SuRie had her microphone snatched out of her hand as she was mid-song, leaving her unable to perform for 15-20 seconds. In response, Eurovision fans rallied around SuRie, giving her the biggest cheer of the night, and imploring her to carry on. And that she did gamely, finishing her song powerfully, but visibly shaken. She was offered the chance to perform again, but declined. Portuguese colleagues tell me they felt ashamed at that moment, that they had let SuRie down, after months of her preparing for these three minutes on stage. Whether or not the event had any effect on the vote is hard to tell. The jury votes are already cast the night before the grand final, so this hitch would not have been taken into account at all. Perhaps the UK gained a few more votes from the televote, but it was still to be 24th place out of 26. Swedish commentator and Eurovision 2016 organiser, Edward af Sillen, told me that it's nothing personal or political against the UK. ""It's all about the song,"" he says. ""This year's entry (Storm) was not the best, but the BBC is moving in the right direction. ""It's never too late,"" he says. ""We are just waiting for you to enter the right song, and when that happens Eurovision will be so happy for you."" Austria's Cesar Sampson got douze points from the UK One of the major upsets of the night came in the guise of Austria's Cesar Sampson, which the UK jury was the first of many to award 12 points to. There had been no buzz around this act whatsoever. Nobody But You is a nice enough song, and Cesar has a rich, warm voice - but it just didn't seem to stand out among the other entries. And yet. And yet it led at half time, once all the jury votes were in. Sampson himself said he couldn't believe it. Once all was said and done it ended up in third place - an incredible result, although Sampson actually came second last year when he performed as a backing singer for the Bulgarian entrant. I don't think he'll be too upset though. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

The accolades will be handed out at a ceremony hosted by Sue Perkins at the Royal Festival Hall in London later. Police thriller Line of Duty has the most nominations, with a total of four. Other nominees include Blue Planet II, Black Mirror and Love Island, while Ant and Dec are tipped to win for Saturday Night Takeaway, despite Ant's absence from two recent episodes.

Ant's recently admitted drink drivingand went into treatment for ""alcohol issues"", which meant Dec had to finish the series solo. But Sunday's Baftas are for programmes shown last year - so those upheavals shouldn't affect the result. Ant said in March he was taking ""time off for the foreseeable future"".

Hang The DJ's Joe Cole, who played Frank, is up for best lead actor, while Jimmi Simpson, who played the bullying boss/subservient crew member Walton in USS Callister, is up for best supporting actor.

Broken, Little Boy Blue, Hang the DJ and King Charles III all have two nominations each. Peaky Blinders has just the one, but it's in the big category - best drama series - and it wouldn't be a total shock to see it pull off its first Bafta win. Daisy May Cooper stars in This Country alongside her brother Charlie, who plays her cousin This Country isone of the best new comediesand is nominated for best scripted comedy and best female performance in a comedy programme for Daisy May Cooper.

Queen consents to Harry and Meghan's marriagePictures of the Queen's official written consent have been released by Buckingham Palace.10h10 hours agoUK,"A picture of the Queen's written consent, allowing Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to marry, has been released by Buckingham Palace. The Instrument of Consent was signed by the Queen in March. The first six people in line to the throne must seek the Queen's approval to marry. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are due to be wed on 19 May in Windsor. Without the Queen's consent Prince Harry would have been disqualified from the line of succession. The Instrument of Consent says: ""Now know ye that we have consented and do by these presents signify our consent to the contracting of matrimony between our most dearly beloved grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales KCVO and Rachel Meghan Markle."" The globe-trotting Harry and Meghan fans Meghan's father to walk her down aisle A non-Brit's guide to the royal wedding The Instrument of Consent began after the Royal Marriages Act of 1772. It required descendents of George II to get the sovereign's consent before they wed, otherwise their marriages would be invalid. The Queen's Great Seal of the Realm is included with the document The Royal Marriages Act was ordered by King George III - King George II's grandson. The law came after King George III's younger brother, the Duke of Cumberland, secretly married Lady Anne Horton, deemed to be the highly disreputable widow of a commoner. The law was repealed and replaced with the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. As a result a member of the Royal Family can marry a Roman Catholic (but a Roman Catholic cannot become King or Queen). The act also removed male bias from the line of succession. Royal succession law takes effect Royal Family tree and line of succession The first six people in line to the throne need to obtain the Queen's permission. With the birth of Prince Louis, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's third child, Prince Harry is now sixth in line to the throne.

"Paris attack suspect 'of Chechen origin'The suspect in Saturday's deadly knife attack was on a French security watch list, sources say.6m7 minutes agoEurope","This video can not be played Eyewitness Jonathan says the attacker's hands were covered in blood The suspect in a deadly knife attack in central Paris on Saturday evening is a French citizen born in 1997 in Russia's republic of Chechnya, sources say. Named by media as Khamzat Asimov, he was on a French watch list of people who could pose a threat to national security, the sources said. Police shot dead the attacker in the busy OpÃ©ra district after he killed a man and injured four other people. The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted (in French): ""France has once again paid in blood,external, but will not give an inch to the enemies of freedom."" Later on Sunday, a judicial source said that a friend of the suspect had been detained for questioning in the eastern city of Strasbourg. France has been on high alert following a series of attacks. More than 230 people have been killed by IS-inspired jihadists in the past three years. The suspect was not carrying any identification papers and has not yet been officially named. Sources told French media the man had no criminal record and his parents had been held for questioning. He is believed to be a French citizen who was naturalised in 2010. This video can not be played French police at the scene of the attack in Paris The man had been categorised as ""fiche S"", the sources said. This flags people considered to be a possible threat to national security and allows for surveillance without being a cause for arrest. It includes those suspected of Islamist radicalisation but is wide-ranging and covers such groups as political extremists, gangsters and even football hooligans. In 2015, then Prime Minister Manuel Valls said there were 20,000 names on the list, about half related to Islamist radicalisation. This would be the first time an assailant of Chechen origin has carried out a terrorist attack in France. France is home to some 30,000 people of Chechen origin. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the man who died was a 29-year-old passer-by but gave no further details. The four who were injured have also not yet been named. AFP news agency, citing sources, said a 34-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman were seriously hurt, while a 26-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man were slightly wounded. One of the injured was a Chinese citizen, Chinese media have reported. Mr Collomb said none had life-threatening injuries. The attacker began stabbing passers-by at about 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT). Eyewitnesses described him as a young man with brown hair and a beard, dressed in black tracksuit trousers. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) during the attack, witnesses said. The man tried to enter several bars and restaurants but was blocked by people inside. Police first tried to stop the assailant with a Taser before shooting him dead, nine minutes after he began the attack. Jonathan, a waiter at a local restaurant, told AFP: ""I saw him with a knife in his hand. He looked crazy."" AFP news agency released an undated photo of Khamzat Asimov He said a woman, stabbed by the attacker, had run into into the restaurant bleeding. The assailant tried to follow her inside but was fended off and finally fled. Two of the wounded in the attack are in a serious condition but do not have life-threatening injuries. IS said it was behind the attack in a brief statement posted on its news outlet. Chechnya is a republic in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia. The republic declared independence in 1991 but three years later Russian troops were sent in to quash the movement, sparking a decade-long conflict. Chechnya - boiling point for conflict Jihadist groups, including those aligned with IS, have long operated in the region. The brothers behind the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had Chechen links and Turkish authorities said a Chechen jihadist was the suspected organiser of an attack on Istanbul airport in 2016 that killed 45 people. The jihadist, Akhmed Chatayev, a member of IS,was killed in a clash with special forces in the Georgian capital Tbilisi in 2017. IS has actively recruited fighters in Chechnya, sending hundreds to conflicts in Syria and elsewhere. A report from the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in 2016 spoke of the fear that the fighters would return to carry out terrorist attacks at home. This video can not be played Officials at Grozny's central mosque are looking carefully for hints of radicalisation Strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, who was nominated for the Chechen presidency by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007 and is now firmly in control, has tried to halt IS recruitment but human rights activists say his measures have been brutal and have often helped radicalisation.

"Breaking|Breaking news'One family' behind Indonesia blastsMembers of one family were behind a wave of blasts targeting churches in the Indonesian city of Surabaya, police say4m5 minutes agoAsia","This video can not be played Surabaya is in shock over the deadly bombings A family of six, including a nine-year-old girl, were behind a wave of blasts targeting three churches in Indonesia's second city of Surabaya, police say. At least 13 people died in Sunday's bombings, which the Islamic State group has claimed. The mother and two daughters blew themselves up at one church, while the father and two sons targeted two others. The family had recently spent time in Syria, according to the police. The bombings are the deadliest in Indonesia since 2005, and they have also left dozens of people injured. Why is Indonesia a target for militants? Inside the home of Indonesia's most notorious IS militant Police chief Tito Karnavian said the family belonged to an Indonesian IS-inspired network, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). The father drove a bomb-laden car into the grounds of Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church, police said. The mother and her two daughters - aged 9 and 12 - had bombs strapped to them and blew themselves up at Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church. The family's sons - aged 16 and 18 - rode motorcycles into Santa Maria Catholic Church, and detonated explosives they were carrying. It was their attack that came first, at around 07:30 local time (00:30 GMT). The other two attacks followed five minutes apart, police said, according to the Jakarta Post. Officials reportedly foiled attacks against other churches. Police helped people looking for missing loved ones after the attacks Visiting the scene of one of the bombings, President Joko Widodo described the attacks as ""barbaric"", adding that he had ordered police to ""look into and break up networks of perpetrators"". Also on Sunday, police said they killed four suspected members of JAD in Cianjur, West Java, and arrested two others. By BBC Indonesia Editor Rebecca Henschke The blasts were co-ordinated to hit those coming to morning services and were over within the space of just 10 minutes. In recent years women have become increasingly active in terrorist cells in Indonesia but this would be the first time children have been used. Indonesia had been widely praised for its sustained anti-terrorism crackdown following the 2002 Bali bombings. It has managed a seemingly successful combination of arrests and killings, alongside a de-radicalisation program that focused on changing minds and providing alternative incomes for released terrorists. But the rise of IS overseas has invigorated the loosely constituted jihadi networks. There has also been rising intolerance in recent years in this once tolerant, pluralist, majority-Muslim nation, which has made minority groups increasingly uncomfortable. This appears to be the worst attack linked to IS in Indonesia. The group claimed its first attack in the country in January 2016, when four civilians were killed in a series of explosions and shootings in the capital Jakarta. It has also claimed other attacks, such as violence earlier this month in a high-security prison near Jakarta, in which five members of security forces were killed. But the country's deadliest jihadist attacks predate IS. In 2002, over 200 people were killed in two bombings carried out by al-Qaeda-linked militants outside a bar and nightclub on the island of Bali, a popular tourist destination. In May 2005, bomb blasts killed 22 on the island of Sulawesi. Less than six months later, a suicide bombing in Bali killed 20. Why is Indonesia a target for IS militants?

Serial killer Dennis Nilsen dies in prisonThe 72-year-old admitted killing at least 15 men in the 1970s and 1980s.1han hour agoUK,"Dennis Nilsen, on the right hand side, lured his victims to his flat before killing them, often by strangulation Serial killer Dennis Nilsen, who admitted killing at least 15 people in the 1970s and 1980s, has died in prison. The 72-year-old was jailed for life in 1983, with a recommendation he serve at least 25 years. The former civil servant murdered and dismembered several of his victims, most of them homeless young gay men, at his home in Muswell Hill, north London. He was convicted of six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. The Prison Service said Nilsen, who was born in Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, died at HMP Full Sutton near York. The death of Nilsen will be investigated by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, as is normal for custody deaths, a spokesman added. Nilsen was 37 when he was arrested, after human remains were found in a blocked drain at his home. He and other tenants in his block of flats had complained to the landlord about the smell from the drains. An inspection by a plumber found pipes packed with human flesh. During his trial at the Old Bailey, the court heard the remains of three bodies were found at his home and bones from at least eight bodies were found at his previous address in Melrose Avenue, Cricklewood in north-west London. The death of Nilsen - wearing glasses - will be investigated as is normal for custody deaths He met his victims, all of them men, in a pub and he would take them back to his flat for a drink. Most were homeless, some were homosexuals and some were prostitutes. His trial heard how Nilsen strangled many of his victims with a tie and then disposed of the bodies, either through hiding them under the floorboards or by cutting up the body and flushing parts down the toilet. On many occasions, he would sit with their bodies for days before he dismembered them. Nilsen admitted killing at least 15 people, but he was convicted of the murders of six men: Kenneth James Ockenden Martyn Brandon Duffey William David Sutherland Malcolm Barlow John Peter Howlett Stephen Neil Sinclair There were others who survived. Mr Nilsen spent 11 years in the Army, with some time spent in the catering corps where he learned certain butchery skills. He later served briefly as a probationary police constable before becoming a security officer with the Manpower Services Commission in 1974.

Trust me to deliver Brexit - Theresa May,"This video can not be played Gove expresses doubts about Brexit customs plan Michael Gove has cast doubt on the viability of Theresa May's proposed customs partnership with the EU after Brexit, telling the BBC it has ""flaws"". The environment secretary said there were ""significant question marks"" about whether the model, described as crazy by Boris Johnson, was deliverable. The PM, whose ministers are considering two customs options, says ""compromises"" will be needed but she will ""deliver"". But Labour said the lack of a decision on the critical issue was ""farcical"". The UK is committed to leaving the current customs union when it exits the EU on 29 March 2019 and ministers are under pressure to agree soon on a successor arrangement amid divisions in cabinet. The customs partnership thought to be preferred by Mrs May would see Britain continue to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, as well as refunding UK firms if they were only liable for lower rates. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mrs May promised a solution which ensured frictionless trade, enabled the UK to strike trade deals around the world and which did not result in a hard border on the island of Ireland. Johnson: No 10's customs plans 'crazy' DUP MP hits out at Irish foreign minister Leonard calls for cross-party Brexit talks ""You can trust me to deliver,"" she wrote. ""I will not let you down"". On the customs issues, she said she had ""proposed different options for a new customs arrangement with the EU and the government will continue to develop them during the negotiations"". A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods crossed a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Mr Gove, one of the leading Brexiteers in the cabinet, told the Andrew Marr show that he trusted the PM to reach an agreement but he expressed doubts about what is believed to be her preferred option. The leading Leave campaigner is one of a group of cabinet ministers asked by the PM to stress-test the partnership model - which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU on goods coming into the UK. ""Because it is novel, because no model like this exists, there have to be significant question marks over the deliverability of it on time,"" he said. ""More than that, what it requires the British government to do is, in effect, act as the tax collector... for the European Union... It is my view that the new customs partnership has flaws and that they need to be tested."" The Irish foreign minister said he ""did not take his lead"" from Boris Johnson Neither this option nor the alternative - a ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement using technology to ensure the seamless movement of goods - was ""absolutely perfect"", he acknowledged. But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said neither of the options were ""workable nor acceptable to the EU"" and, with time running out, Parliament must force the government's hand by backing a ""comprehensive"" customs union. ""We are in a farcical situation,"" he told the Andrew Marr show. ""We want a vote on a customs union with the EU. That is the only way to resolve this impasse."" Mrs May has insisted the final Brexit deal must honour the agreements in the Northern Ireland peace process - and that there can be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, dismissed the idea of using any form of infrastructure or technology to maintain separate customs regimes between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We just simply think it won't work. If you don't believe me on it, listen to people who are living locally. Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? May splits cabinet to seek Brexit solution ""Listen to the chief constable of the PSNI. He is saying any infrastructure on the border, any physical infrastructure on the border, is going to represent a risk to his officers."" Suggesting the Irish government ""did not take its lead"" from Boris Johnson and warning of a ""difficult summer"", he said the two governments could agree a ""shared customs space or shared customs territory"". In other Brexit developments, a cross-party group of former cabinet ministers - including former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband - has urged Parliament to vote to remain in both the customs union and the single market, arguing it is vital for the economy. And student organisations representing almost a million young people have also written to MPs demanding a referendum on any final Brexit deal. Organised by the campaign group For our Future's Sake, the letter from 60 student unions says promises made by pro-Brexit groups have not been kept and that an estimated 1.4 million people were too young to vote in June 2016 but now deserve a say.

The death of Nilsen - wearing glasses - will be investigated as is normal for custody deaths He met his victims, all of them men, in a pub and he would take them back to his flat for a drink. Most were homeless, some were homosexuals and some were prostitutes. His trial heard how Nilsen strangled many of his victims with a tie and then disposed of the bodies, either through hiding them under the floorboards or by cutting up the body and flushing parts down the toilet. On many occasions, he would sit with their bodies for days before he dismembered them. Nilsen admitted killing at least 15 people, but he was convicted of the murders of six men: Kenneth James Ockenden Martyn Brandon Duffey William David Sutherland Malcolm Barlow John Peter Howlett Stephen Neil Sinclair There were others who survived. Mr Nilsen spent 11 years in the Army, with some time spent in the catering corps where he learned certain butchery skills. He later served briefly as a probationary police constable before becoming a security officer with the Manpower Services Commission in 1974.

Indonesia church bombings kill 11 people,"This video can not be played Surabaya is in shock over the deadly bombings Suicide bombers have attacked three churches in Indonesia's second-largest city Surabaya, killing at least 11 people. Around 40 others were injured in the attacks, which occurred within minutes of each other. No group has so far said it carried them out. TV pictures showed debris scattered around the entrance of one church. Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country, has seen a resurgence of Islamist militancy in recent months. More than 90% of Indonesians are Muslim, but there are also significant populations of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists. The attack is the deadliest since 2005, when three suicide bombings on the resort island of Bali killed 20 people. Indonesia's new breed of militants So-called Islamic State's influence in Indonesia Inside the home of Indonesia's most notorious IS militant The first explosion took place between services at the Santa Maria Catholic Church around 07:30 local time (00:30 GMT). Inspector General Machfud Arifin told CNN Indonesia that a motorbike was used in the attack. According to Reuters, the second bombing targeted the cark park of a Pentecostal church. Images of the scene showed a number of burnt motorcycles. Unconfirmed eyewitness reports say that the third attack was carried out by one or more veiled women who entered a church with children. Officials reportedly foiled attacks against other churches. Firefighters attended the scene at the Pentecost Church Central Surabaya (GPPS) So far there has been no claim of responsibility for the attacks. But Wawan Purwanto, of Indonesia's intelligence agency, said the Islamic State-inspired group, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), was suspected to be behind them. He added that the bombings were likely to be linked to an incident earlier this month, when five members of the security forces were killed during a 36-hour standoff with militant Islamist prisoners at a high security prison on the outskirts of the capital Jakarta. Separately, police said they had killed four suspected members of JAD in Cianjur, West Java. The attacks were carried out within minutes of each other Christian leaders urged calm. ""We don't need to be afraid when facing terror threats. We must leave it completely to the government to handle,"" the head of the Indonesian Communion of Churches said in a statement on Sunday quoted by The Jakarta Post. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi condemned the attack and sent her condolences to the victims and their families. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Four civilians and four attackers were killedin a series of explosions and shootings in central Jakarta in January 2016; the first attack claimed by the group. In February this year, a number of people were injured in a sword attack at a church in Sleman, Yogyakarta. Police said that the attacker had previously tried to join IS in Syria.

Israel wins Eurovision Song Contest,"This video can not be played Eurovision Song Contest 2018 highlights Israel's Netta has won the Eurovision Song Contest for her quirky dance song Toy - complete with its trademark chicken dance. She had been an early favourite, but the vote went down to the wire with Cyprus finishing in second place. Netta thanked juries and the public for ""choosing different"" as she lifted the glass microphone trophy. UK entrant SuRie, whose performance was interrupted by a stage invader, finished 24th out of the 26 countries. Man grabs microphone from SuRie SuRie's calm before the storm SuRie came 24th out of 26 countries She was part-way through singing Storm when a man, with a rucksack on his back, ran on and grabbed the microphone from her hands. She was given the chance to perform again but declined. SuRie later tweeted that she knew ""anything could happen"" on stage. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Netta - full name Netta Barzilai - picked up a total of 529 points to take the title, while bookies' favourite Eleni Foureira from Cyprus got 436 points, with Fuego. Austria had topped the leaderboard of the 63rd annual contest after the juries' votes had been given, with Cesar Sampson's Nobody But You the surprise frontrunner. But it became clear it was between Netta and Eleni when the viewers' votes started coming in. Eurovision: As it happened Graham Norton's best bits Meet Netta, Eurovision's #MeToo voice All the best pictures Eleni Foureira singing Fuego On stage, the Israeli singer said of her win: ""Thank you so much for choosing different. Thank you so much for accepting differences between us. ""Thank you for celebrating diversity. I love my country!"" She later added: ""It's an empowerment song for everybody, for everybody who's been struggling being themselves - struggling with their bosses, with the government, with someone stepping on them. ""I've been told so many times that I'm not pretty enough, that I'm not smart enough, that I'm not skinny enough to do what I want to do."" Analysis by Lucy Todd, BBC News entertainment reporter in Lisbon Netta looked shocked by her win This is not the first time Eurovision has rewarded the person who sees themselves as an outsider struggling to fit in. Conchita Wurst winning in 2014 and before her Dana International in 1998 suggests Europe embraces those who are true to themselves. Netta told BBC Newsshe had always been told she should ""diet a little bit"", wear black because it was ""more flattering"", and to ""sing like Adele"". But she decided not to follow these rules: ""We're only here for a minute, why are we busy being unhappy?"" A decidedly happy Netta spoke to the international press after her victory, and told us she was ""proud and honoured"" - although it was still all ""a little hard to take in"". In the interview, she also revealed she had a secret weapon during her performance. She said she had been given her late grandmother's ring by her father shortly before the contest. She said the ring gave her ""power"" and ""a lot of confidence"" for the competition. Netta also admitted she had no idea what was going on during the results stage of the show, because she didn't have her glasses on to see the scoreboard. She said she had to piece together the results from the shrieks of her team around her. Finally, when asked the first thing she would do when she got home she replied simply: ""Houmous!"" Asked about the close race with Cyprus, Netta said: ""I always said that comparing between musical genres is funny - and comparing between musicians is a little bit peculiar...  I was competing with myself."" She said everything about the moment of winning was ""a black blur"", and that she thought ""what is happening?"" - partly because she couldn't see the points on the board without her glasses.

'I'll keep competing with myself till I die',"This video can not be played Meet Netta Barzilai So it was the relatable Netta from Israel who won this year's Eurovision rather than Cyprus' glamorous Eleni. Eurovision proved once more that it embraces the outsider, the person who doesn't fit in. It follows Conchita Wurst's victory in 2014 and, before her, that of Dana International in 1998. Nettatold BBC Newsthat she came to realise that she was ""different"" because of her size and found out that ""different is often not accepted"". Israel wins Eurovision Song Contest Eurovision: As it happened Stage stormed during UK's Eurovision song The night in pictures Some of Graham Norton's best bits This is why, as she lifted her winner's trophy, she said: ""Thank you for choosing different."" Netta stood out in this year's competition right from the beginning. Cyprus had been the bookies' favourite In the weeks leading up to the contest all the buzz was about the Israeli entry. But in the past few days, her star seemed to have waned in favour of Cyprus' hair-flicking Eleni Foureira. Certainly among the press, Netta had been almost written off - with Cyprus, France, Ireland and Italy thought to be the more credible acts. By the half-way point in the scoring, though, the national juries had confounded this and she was in a strong third position. And then for the public vote - where the 25-year old gained enough points from viewers at home to move into first and take the Eurovision crown. They had seen someone who was fun and quirky but who also carried a meaningful and substantial message of accepting who you are. In 2018, Netta's victory feels particularly deserved following the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. Eleni - all credit to her - was perhaps just too beautiful, too slick and too mainstream. In the end, the vote wasn't even that close: Eleni's 436 points to Netta's 529. Netta said the competition wasn't against Eleni, but was about challenging herself. ""I'll keep competing with myself till I die,"" she said in an interview following her win. This video can not be played A man interrupts the UK's SuRie during her Eurovision performance in Lisbon Aside from Netta's win, outside the Altice Arena all fans wanted to talk about was the stage invasion during SuRie's performance for the UK. SuRie had her microphone snatched out of her hand as she was mid-song, leaving her unable to perform for 15-20 seconds. In response, Eurovision fans rallied around SuRie, giving her the biggest cheer of the night, and imploring her to carry on. And that she did gamely, finishing her song powerfully, but visibly shaken. She was offered the chance to perform again, but declined. Portuguese colleagues tell me they felt ashamed at that moment, that they had let SuRie down, after months of her preparing for these three minutes on stage. Whether or not the event had any effect on the vote is hard to tell. The jury votes are already cast the night before the grand final, so this hitch would not have been taken into account at all. Perhaps the UK gained a few more votes from the televote, but it was still to be 24th place out of 26. Swedish commentator and Eurovision 2016 organiser, Edward af Sillen, told me that it's nothing personal or political against the UK. ""It's all about the song,"" he says. ""This year's entry (Storm) was not the best, but the BBC is moving in the right direction. ""It's never too late,"" he says. ""We are just waiting for you to enter the right song, and when that happens Eurovision will be so happy for you."" Austria's Cesar Sampson got douze points from the UK One of the major upsets of the night came in the guise of Austria's Cesar Sampson, which the UK jury was the first of many to award 12 points to. There had been no buzz around this act whatsoever. Nobody But You is a nice enough song, and Cesar has a rich, warm voice - but it just didn't seem to stand out among the other entries. And yet. And yet it led at half time, once all the jury votes were in. Sampson himself said he couldn't believe it. Once all was said and done it ended up in third place - an incredible result, although Sampson actually came second last year when he performed as a backing singer for the Bulgarian entrant. I don't think he'll be too upset though. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Queen consents to Harry and Meghan's marriage,"A picture of the Queen's written consent, allowing Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to marry, has been released by Buckingham Palace. The Instrument of Consent was signed by the Queen in March. The first six people in line to the throne must seek the Queen's approval to marry. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are due to be wed on 19 May in Windsor. Without the Queen's consent Prince Harry would have been disqualified from the line of succession. The Instrument of Consent says: ""Now know ye that we have consented and do by these presents signify our consent to the contracting of matrimony between our most dearly beloved grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales KCVO and Rachel Meghan Markle."" The globe-trotting Harry and Meghan fans Meghan's father to walk her down aisle A non-Brit's guide to the royal wedding The Instrument of Consent began after the Royal Marriages Act of 1772. It required descendents of George II to get the sovereign's consent before they wed, otherwise their marriages would be invalid. The Queen's Great Seal of the Realm is included with the document The Royal Marriages Act was ordered by King George III - King George II's grandson. The law came after King George III's younger brother, the Duke of Cumberland, secretly married Lady Anne Horton, deemed to be the highly disreputable widow of a commoner. The law was repealed and replaced with the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. As a result a member of the Royal Family can marry a Roman Catholic (but a Roman Catholic cannot become King or Queen). The act also removed male bias from the line of succession. Royal succession law takes effect Royal Family tree and line of succession The first six people in line to the throne need to obtain the Queen's permission.

Obituary: Dame Tessa Jowell,"This video can not be played Baroness Jowell: From social worker to London 2012 Tessa Jowell once said she'd ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair. She was probably only half-joking. However, her loyalty to New Labour was more than simply tactical or careerist. She was pro-European and in favour of a mixed-economy when both were deeply unfashionable on the left. Her belief that Labour should ""modernise"" was passionately held - forged at the coal face of a decade of Labour local activism. Baroness Jowell will be remembered at Westminster as someone who managed to be ideologically committed to her cause without overt sectarian bitterness. Tessa Jane Helen Douglas Palmer began her life in London in September 1947 - the oldest of three siblings. Like Blair, hers was a middle-class family of Conservative voters. Her childhood was spent in Aberdeen - where her father, Kenneth, was a chest specialist at the university medical school. Her radiographer mother, Rosemary, bridled against the social snobbery of university life - where lecturers' wives did not have coffee with the professors' wives. St Margaret's School for Girls was fee-paying and traditional - occasionally described as ""Scotland's Roedean"".  Age 14, she saw Stanley Kubrick's film Spartacus - which ""moved me hugely with its themes of exploitation, courageous revolt and the heroism of the slave uprising"". She abandoned notions of a career in medicine and qualified as a psychiatric social worker. A friend recalled meeting her for lunch at London's Maudsley Hospital - finding her physically shaking after an encounter with an aggressive patient. Fighting the Ilford North by-election in 1978. ""It was the worst three weeks of my life"", she said. She was elected to Camden Council - chairing its Social Services Committee at just 25 - a standard bearer of Labour ""sensiblism"" against ""loony left"" activists bent on confrontation with Margaret Thatcher. Once, she ended up covered with chicken livers hurled from the floor. She fought the Ilford North by-election in 1978 - only to lose Labour's majority.  ""It was the worst three weeks of my life,"" she said, targeted by the National Front and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which sent her pictures of foetuses. The press also hounded her - smelling scandal. She'd left her first husband - statistician Roger Jowell - and was living with corporate lawyer, David Mills. They later married.  It was another 13 years before she made it to Westminster - as MP for Dulwich & West Norwood in 1992. Tessa Jowell was Labour moderniser and supporter of Tony Blair She arrived determined to play her part in the New Labour revolution.  A fierce loyalty to Tony Blair never dimmed. Friends included Margaret Hodge, Harriet Harman, David Blunkett and the Blairs themselves - a Who's Who list of the movement. Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell became god parents to her children. In Opposition, Blair made her a whip - dealing with a party dominated by northern men. They found her direct, thoughtful - but with sharp political elbows. ""If there is someone powerful in the room she has an almost subconscious locking on device,"" said one source. David Mills' business affairs were controversial and the couple split. They were later reconciled. Her marriage to David Mills sustained for nearly 40 years.  But his business affairs twice badly damaged her political career. She became minister for public health in Blair's first government.  A promise to be the ""scourge of the tobacco industry"" rebounded when it was discovered that Formula One had been given an exemption from a ban on tobacco advertising. It was discovered that Bernie Ecclestone - Formula One's boss - had donated a million pounds to the party. Blair pleaded he ""was a pretty straight kind of guy"". For Tessa Jowell the problem was her husband's connections to the company that owned the Benetton racing team.  She only just survived.. A decade later, a second scandal was far worse. In 2006, by now secretary of state for culture, media and sport, her marriage came under renewed scrutiny.  David Mills was accused of once taking money from Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial Italian prime minister, in return for illegally helping fight corruption charges. The money had paid down the couple's mortgage. Mills furiously disputed the allegations and would spend years fighting the charges.  Blair decided  Jowell was free from wrong-doing - but she was politically damaged and the couple separated. Opponents on the left felt all this was somehow emblematic of the New Labour project and its love affair with the ultra-rich. Tessa Jowell admitted she hoped to restore the relationship over time. After she'd left office, she told Woman's Hour that they were seeing each other regularly and had ""reached a state of stability which I never thought possible"". A hug from David Beckham to celebrate the announcement that London would host the 2012 Summer Olympics Her department was shocked when she insisted the UK should bid for the 2012 Olympics.  There was a concerted attempt to talk her out of it.  She sold it to Blair in a seven-minute meeting on the Downing Street veranda - despite his real reservations. When London won - after a Herculean lobbying effort - delivery fell to her. By the night of the opening ceremony, Labour was out of office - although she had remained a key member of the organising committee alongside Seb Coe and Jeremy Hunt. She travelled to the stadium on the inevitable red London bus - only for the driver to get hopelessly lost.  Boris Johnson and Ed Miliband teased her as they crossed the same roundabout for the third time.  But she recognised that magical night as the high point of her career. Inevitably, her political star waned after Blair left office. She never had the same affinity with Gordon Brown or Ed Miliband - although neither dispensed with her altogether.  She left Westminster at the 2015 general election. Congratulating Sadiq Khan after she lost the nomination to be Labour's candidate for mayor of London Dame Tessa Jowell, as she now was, fought hard to become Labour's candidate for London mayor in 2016.  She had high hopes - the Olympics had been successfully delivered and, as minister for London, she had handled the aftermath of the 7/7 bombings well - remaining close to the families of many victims. She won the most votes from party members in the first round of voting. But among registered supporters - who could now pay Â£3 to vote - the most New Labour candidate was well beaten by both Sadiq Khan and Diane Abbott.  The winds of change were blowing through the party. In May 2017, and by now a member of the House of Lords - Baroness Jowell of Brixton - she was on her way to give a speech about Sure Start children's centres - one of her proudest achievements as a minister and one she would herself highlight. She got into a taxi and suddenly found she couldn't speak. Lords Speech: ""I am not afraid"", she said - to a standing ovation Two days later she was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer. She knew the prognosis wasn't good.  She could only have the operation and wait. Later, in a moving speech to the House of Lords, she called for adaptive trials.  If one treatment wasn't working, she argued, patients should be able to try something different - even if it hadn't been fully tested.  The risks, she said, look different if the clock's ticking against you. ""In the end what gives life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close,"" she said. To a standing ovation Baroness Jowell quoted the last words of the poet Seamus Heaney...  ""Noli timere"" - meaning ""do not be afraid"". ""I am not,"" she said, ""afraid.""

One killed in Paris 'terror' knife attack,"This video can not be played French police at the scene of the attack in Paris A knifeman has killed one person and wounded four in a suspected terror attack in central Paris, French officials say. The attacker was then shot dead by police in the OpÃ©ra district. Witnesses say they heard him shout ""Allah Akbar"". So-called Islamic State (IS) later said one of its ""soldiers"" had carried out the attack on Saturday evening. Judicial sources told French media the attacker was a man born in 1997 in the southern Russian republic of Chechnya. The sources said his parents had been held for questioning. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the victim of the attack was a 29-year-old man, but gave no further details. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted (in French): ""France has once again paid in blood,external, but will not give an inch to the enemies of freedom."" The attacker began stabbing passers-by at about 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on the rue Monsigny. Eyewitnesses described him as a young man with brown hair and a beard, dressed in black tracksuit trousers. The man tried to enter several bars and restaurants but was blocked by people inside. Police arrived at the scene within minutes. They first tried to stop the assailant with a stun-gun before shooting him dead. An eyewitness, named as Gloria, told AFP news agency: ""We didn't know what was going on, we were quickly moved inside the bar, I went outside and I saw a man lying on the floor."" Forensic officers have been examining the scene of the attack Jonathan, a waiter at a local restaurant, told AFP: ""I saw him with a knife in his hand. He looked crazy."" He said a woman the attacker had stabbed ran into into the restaurant bleeding. The assailant tried to follow her inside, but was fended off and finally fled. Two of the wounded in the attack are in a serious condition but do not have life-threatening injuries. Later in the evening the IS group said it was behind the attack, in a brief statement posted on its news outlet. The anti-terrorism unit of the Paris prosecutor's office has launched an investigation. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said police were on the scene five minutes after an emergency call and the attacker was killed ""less than nine minutes later"".

Escaped horses force motorway closureDrivers were stranded on the M11 in Essex for more than two hours while 12 animals were rounded up.,"The M11 was shut in both directions near Harlow Drivers were stranded on a motorway for more than two hours after 12 horses escaped onto the carriageway.

Deadpool finally apologises to David Beckham,"Deadpool has apologised to David Beckham after making a joke about him in his first film. In the 2016 movie Deadpool, the superhero said the former England captain sounds like he's been sucking helium. Ryan Reynolds turned up at Becks' house to make a very over the top apology in a clip promoting the sequel. Becks did get his own back though, reeling off some films he thinks Ryan should apologise for instead. The latest Deadpool is out later this month Unlike the other Marvel superheroes, Deadpool is all about breaking the rules. He's x-rated, he looks directly into the camera to speak to the audience, and he loves to have a laugh. Beckham is just one of many to have been mocked by the character, but in the clips it appears to have got to the former footballer. The video sees Becks watching the scene that mentions him in the first Deadpool film - and rewinding it to watch it again with an unimpressed look on his face. It goes without saying that there will be some graphic language in the clip. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Deadpool clearly feels bad that David's feelings have been hurt and sends him a text message asking for forgiveness. Then Deadpool turns up at Becks' door after the text is ignored - but milk and cookies, helium balloons and a mariachi band aren't enough to earn Beckham's forgiveness. Tickets to a football match eventually do the job, with Beckham telling Deadpool: ""I can't stay mad at you"". But then Becks gets a few digs in too. Deadpool reminds him about the voice joke but David seemingly doesn't know what he's talking about. ""What did you think I was apologising for?"" Deadpool asks. ""Green Lantern, R.I.P.D, Self/less, Blade: Trinity,"" Becks replies. Ouch. Fans have been loving the promo from the two stars. Allow Twitter content?

Dr Dre loses trademark case to Dr Drai,"Dr Dre (not to be confused with Dr Drai) Hip-hop star Dr Dre has lost a long-running trademark dispute against a gynaecologist with a similar name. The case was first lodged in 2015, when Pennsylvania-based gynaecologist Draion M Burch tried to trademark the name Dr Drai. Dr Dre objected, saying the similarity could cause ""confusion"", especially as his near-namesake wanted to sell audio books and seminars under the moniker. But the US trademark office has disagreed and dismissed Dr Dre's case. In a ruling made last week, it said that, while the two names were similar, Dr Dre had failed to show that people would be misled into buying by Dr Drai's products. Given that the doctor's typical fee for a speaking engagement is $5,000 (Â£3,700), the consumer would be likely to exercise a ""higher degree of care"" than someone making a casual purchase, it said. Mr Burch had also argued that consumers would be unlikely to confuse the two names ""because Dr Dre is not a medical doctor nor is he qualified to provide any type of medical services or sell products specifically in the medical or healthcare industry"". He further testified that he did not seek to trade on Dr Dre's reputation because the association would be ""a bad reflection on me as a doctor"" - citing lyrics he characterised as misogynistic and homophobic. The gynaecologist is the author of books such as 20 Things You May Not Know About A Vagina and describes himself as one of America's top health experts. Dr Dre can currently be seen in the Netflix documentary The Defiant Ones, which charts his rise from the streets of Compton to the multi-millionaire executive in charge of Beats 1.

Patience Trevor, Historic England's Senior Listings Adviser said: ""Rather than the functional, modernist box you might expect... it's a very elegant and distinctive building.  It's dignified, but strong and robust at the same time"". Last year, a survey found Slough was thebest place to work and live. Also Grade II listed is a business park near Bristol, that is ""injected with glamour"" and ""features circular forecourts following the turning circle of a car"". Aztec West in South Gloucestershire is a landscaped campus close to the M4 and Bristol The ""solar"" spiral staircase symbolises the sun's rays and the house's themes relate to the seasons Renowned historian and architecture critic Charles Jencks designed Thematic House, which has been Grade I listed. Historic England said Thematic House was Charles Jencks' most ambitious project and is ""full of symbolism"" China Wharf, Cascades, Newlands Quay and Swedish Quays were all given the third level of listing protection and were built between 1982 and 1990. China Wharf near Tower Bridge was designed in 1982-1983 by Piers Gough of CZWG, one of the main forces behind post-modern architecture A number of other London terraces and blocks of flats were listed in Kensington, Hackney and Islington as has the Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. Judge Business School in Cambridge was given the second highest listing status, Grade II*. The 19th century arcaded faÃ§ade of the hospital was retained and an early 20th century attic storey was rebuilt The Katharine Stephen Rare Books Library at Newnham College, Cambridge, and the Gough Building at Bryanston School in Dorset, were both Grade II listed. The Katharine Stephen Rare Books Library was built between 1981 and 1982 and has a barrel-vaulted roof inspired by the college's first library Facebook and Twitter-inspired street signs in Oxford Prince Charles and Camilla surprise newly-weds in Nice Young inmates rewarded with sweets Historic England said the Cornwall court's architects, Eldred Evans and David Shalev, achieved ""a landmark civic complex that is an elegant and sophisticated addition to Truro"". The architects behind Truro Crown court also designed the Tate Gallery in St Ives The building has been Grade II* listed.  Its courtrooms are built within complex circular patterns around a naturally-lit atrium. Hillingdon Civic Centre in Uxbridge and Founders' Hall in the City of London were both Grade II listed. Founders' Hall is the fifth home of the Worshipful Company of Founders in the City of London The system used for listing buildings in England was introducedjust over 70 years ago. A building is listed when it is of special architectural or historic interest considered to be of national importance and therefore worth protecting. Grade I buildings are of exceptional interest, with 2.5% in this category. Grade II* buildings are important buildings of more than special interest and account for 5.8% of listed buildings. Grade II buildings are of special interest; 91.7% of listed buildings are in this class - the most likely grade for domestic buildings. Today there are around 400,000 structures listed - from windmills, pigsties, piers and one rocket. A building's listed status means there will be extra control over what changes can be made to its interior and exterior, which is different for each one that makes the list.

But a few years ago she realised her size could be a good thing. ""It was [first] through rugby I started utilising my strength, then I started weightlifting and that's when I really knew I could use my height and weight to my advantage.

Stage stormed during UK's Eurovision songIt is thought the stage invader also stormed January's National Television Awards and The Voice.,"This video can not be played Watch: A man interrupts the UK's Eurovision entry in Lisbon A man stormed the stage while the UK's entry, SuRie, was performing at the Eurovision Song Contest. SuRie was singing her song Storm when a man wearing a rucksack ran onto the stage, grabbed her microphone, and appeared to say: ""Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom."" He was swiftly dragged off stage and SuRie continued performing the song. Israel won the contest with 520 points while SuRie's song was third from bottom, gaining 48 points. Israel wins Eurovision Song Contest Eurovision 2018: The night in pictures Some of Graham Norton's best bits The invader is in police custody, the European Broadcasting Union said. He is understood to be a European citizen but not British. It is thought the same man invaded the stage at the National Television Awards this year, and The Voice in 2017. SuRie was given the chance to perform again, but declined. The BBC said: ""SuRie and her team are extremely proud of her performance and have together decided that there is absolutely no reason to perform the song again."" The stage invader took the microphone off SuRie, before being dragged off stage The Eurovision 2018 final in Lisbon, Portugal, was watched by an estimated TV audience of 200 million. Israel's entry Netta won the contest with the song Toy, and stood out with an unconventional singing style likened to chicken clucking. The Cypriot entry Eleni Foureira came second with the song Fuego. The voting was weighted so that half the points come from public telephone votes from viewers in each country, and half from a jury of musical experts in each nation. Netta won the Eurovision Song Contest with her song Toy Although SuRie was left without a microphone for about 10 seconds - during which she clapped along to the song - the music track continued with backing vocals. Graham Norton, who presented the UK's coverage, said: ""There was a stage invasion, SuRie coped incredibly well. I can't stress enough what a brilliant job she did - she must have been terrified."" The 29-year-old was also praised on Twitter for her composure. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
