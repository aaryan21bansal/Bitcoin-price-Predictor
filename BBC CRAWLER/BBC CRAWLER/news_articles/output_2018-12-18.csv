Yemeni mum gets US visa to visit dying son,"The boy cannot survive for much longer, and must urgently see his mother, the family say The Yemeni mother of a dying toddler in California has been granted a waiver to travel to the US to visit her son, officials say. Shaima Swileh, who currently lives in Egypt, was prevented initially from entering the US due to the Trump administration's travel ban. Her son, two-year-old Abdullah Hassan, was born with a brain disease that doctors say he will not survive. The government had faced mounting public pressure to allow the visit. The Department of State granted Mrs Swileh permission to enter the US on Tuesday morning, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a nonprofit advocacy group representing the family. Mrs Swileh is expected to arrive in San Francisco on Wednesday evening, local time, CAIR said, and will see her son before he is taken off life support. ""This is the happiest day of my life,"" Abdullah's father, Ali Hassan, 22, saidin a CAIR statement,external. ""This will allow us to mourn with dignity."" Thousands of emails were sent to officials along with tweets and letters from members of Congress in support of the family, according to CAIR. ""We are so relieved that this mother will get to hold and kiss her son one last time,"" CAIR-Sacramento attorney Saad Sweilem said. ""The public outpouring of support for this family was incredible."" The organisation also rebuked the government for enforcing the travel ban to begin with, saying the toddler ""could have been receiving comfort from his mother"" for weeks. The administration, CAIR said, ""required a massive public mobilisation to commit an act of humanity"". The state department had declined to comment on this specific case earlier, but said the US makes ""every effort to facilitate legitimate travel by international visitors"". Soon after he took office, US President Donald Trump imposed travel restrictions on mainly majority Muslim countries. The executive order went through several versions before being upheld by the US Supreme Court this summer. What is the Trump travel ban? It bans nationals of Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. Abdullah and his father are US citizens, but Mrs Swileh is a citizen of Yemen. The family had moved to Cairo, Egypt in order to escape civil war in Yemen when Abdullah was eight-months-old. US 'bans Yemen mum from seeing dying son' Yemen ceasefire delayed after clashes Can Yemen truce deal finally bring peace? Abdullah was diagnosed with hypomyelination - a brain disease affecting his ability to breathe. About three months ago, Mr Hassan brought his son to California for treatment. When doctors in Oakland informed him Abdullah's condition was terminal, Mrs Swileh applied for a visa to join her husband and son. The family says they received a rejection letter from the state department, citing the US president's travel ban, and had been fighting for a waiver ever since. What is the Trump travel ban?

Skin creams can lead to fire deaths,"People who use emollient creams to treat dry and itchy skin conditions are being warned they can build up in fabrics and cause them to catch fire more easily. The medicines regulator says clear warnings on product packaging is needed to alert consumers. The MHRA says it has heard of more than 50 such deaths reported by UK fire and rescue services. People should not stop using the creams but be aware of the risk. Washing clothing and bedding can reduce product build-up but not totally remove it. It was previously thought the risk occurred with emollients that contained more than 50% paraffins. But evidence now points to a risk with all emollients, including paraffin-free ones. Fabric that has been in repeated contact with these products burns more easily, meaning users should not smoke or go near naked flames. Sparks from Philip Hoe's cigarette reacted with a cream he was covered in Philip Hoedied after accidentally setting himself on fire at Doncaster Royal Infirmary in 2006, when sparks from a cigarette reacted with the emollient cream he was covered in. Within seconds, Mr Hoe, who was receiving treatment for psoriasis, was engulfed in flames and he died shortly after being transferred to another hospital, in Sheffield. June Raine, from the MHRA, said: ""We don't want to unduly worry people into not using these products, which offer relief for what can be chronic skin conditions, but it is equally important people are aware of the risks and take steps to mitigate them. ""If you use emollients and have any questions or concerns, we'd recommend speaking to a healthcare professional, such as your pharmacist or GP."" The MHRA has been working with the Commission on Human Medicines, which has come up with recommendations for manufacturers: outer packaging and product containers should include a warning about the fire hazard and advice not to smoke, accompanied by short explanatory text and a picture warning in the most prominent field of view where available, the patient information leaflet or instructions for use and the summary of product characteristics should be updated to include warnings about the risk and how best to minimise it John Smith, from the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, said: ""Emollient products are an important and effective treatment for chronic and often severe dry skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis. ""People should continue to use these products but it is vital they understand the fire risk associated with a build-up of residue on fabric and take steps to mitigate that risk. ""We have been working with MHRA during its review of the evidence to ensure the warning is implemented consistently across industry and to support efforts to raise awareness of this issue.""

"Manchester United sack boss MourinhoManager Jose Mourinho is sacked after the club's poor performance, despite spending ÃÂ£400m on 11 players.BBC SportComments","This video can not be played Mourinho's Man Utd ups and downs Manchester United have sacked manager Jose Mourinho after identifying a catalogue of his failings at the club. The Portuguese, 55, took over in May 2016 and led United to League Cup and Europa League titles, but they are 19 points behind league leaders Liverpool. The club have made a change after no progress with results or style despite spending nearly Â£400m on 11 players. They also say the new manager will understand the philosophy of the club, including their attacking tradition. It is understood players and staff are not happy after a disappointing and unsettling period during which young players were not developed. United are sixth in the Premier League, but closer in terms of points to the relegation zone than to leaders Liverpool, who beat them 3-1 on Sunday. Analysis: Yesterday's man? Is Mourinho finished at the top level? Football Daily podcast: What next for Man Utd? 'Caption this', 'Do one' and other reactions to Mourinho's sacking Solskjaer in running for Man Utd caretaker role as Pochettino tight-lipped The decision to sack Mourinho, which will cost more than Â£18m, has been taken in the long-term interests of United with a view that the club is bigger than any one individual. Mourinho is understood to have wanted his own structure, but the new manager will be appointed with a head of football above him reporting to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. A United statement said: ""A caretaker manager will be appointed until the end of the season while the club conducts a thorough recruitment process for a new, full-time manager. ""The club would like to thank Jose for his work during his time at Manchester United and to wish him success in the future."" The club hope to appoint a caretaker manager before they face Cardiff City on 22 December but it will not be assistant manager Michael Carrick or academy boss Nicky Butt. The candidate will be drawn from outside the club, but will not be former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. Prime targets and long shots: Who will be the next Man Utd manager? 'Take stock and reset structure' - Neville on Man Utd This tweet was posted on Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba's account before being deleted soon after United's haul of 26 points after their first 17 Premier League games is their worst tally at this stage of a season since 1990-91. They are 11 points off the top four, which would earn a Champions League qualification place. The sacking of Mourinho, who replaced Louis van Gaal in May 2016 and signed a contract extension in January, comes after a fall-out with Â£89m record signing Paul Pogba, who was an unused substitute for the defeat at Anfield on Sunday. Following a 1-1 draw with Wolves, Pogba said he wanted United to be able to ""attack, attack, attack"" at home, which led Mourinho to say the France midfielder would no longer be the club's ""second captain"". After Mourinho was sacked, a post which said ""caption this"", along with a knowing expression on Pogba's face, appeared on his Twitter account before being deleted. Former United captain Gary Nevillereplied:,external""You do one as well!"" United later claimed it was a ""scheduled marketing post"" by Pogba's sponsors Adidas. Mourinho's third season did not begin well after missing out on key transfer targets in the summer, and two defeats in the first three league games - to Tottenham at home and Brighton away - meant his side were playing catch-up with the leading teams. By October, there were reports Mourinho might be sacked prior to the home game against Newcastle, but after the team trailed 2-0, they turned it around to win 3-2 and seemingly buy the former Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss more time. Mourinho's agent Jorge Mendes attempted to calm matters earlier this month by taking the step of issuing a statement to say his client was ""very happy"" and ""fully committed"" to the club. Despite reaching the Champions League last 16, where United will play Paris St-Germain, they have won just one of their past six games in the Premier League. Mourinho's dismissal continues his run of having never completed four consecutive seasons in charge of a club. Only once has he made it into a fourth campaign, but he left Chelsea on 20 September 2007 during his first spell at Stamford Bridge.

"Lorries toppled after 'big dip' on ferryA major emergency response is triggered after the incident on a Larne to Cairnryan service in ""extreme weather'.South Scotland","This video can not be played Footage filmed inside the ferry shows several lorries had toppled like dominos A man caught up in a ""major incident"" on a ferry from Northern Ireland to Scotland has described how a ""big dip"" caused lorries to topple over. Emergency services were called out to Cairnryan at about 07:40 after severe weather hit the service from Larne. Lorry driver Niall Mcerlean said ""all the wrecking took place"" about halfway through the journey. No-one was badly hurt but some people were stuck in vehicles. Police said the port would be shut for some time. They said anyone planning on sailing should only travel ""if absolutely necessary"". The Marine Accident Investigation Branch said it was ""liaising closely"" with those involved to determine the circumstances of the ""cargo shift"" on board the vessel. Ferry operator P&O said its 16:30 sailing had been cancelled and it urged affected passengers to call0800 130 0030to arrange alternative travel. Mr Mcerlean was on board when the alarm was raised. He said: ""We got on the ferry about half four and it was a wee bit rough and choppy coming along. ""About halfway across it sort of went into a big dip and came back out of it and that is when all the wrecking took place. ""After that the boat was sort of capsizing over a wee bit, leaning over a wee bit."" Cars were also damaged on board the ferry Asked if he thought the ferry was going to topple over, Mr Mcerlean replied: ""We thought she was away at that time."" He also said passengers were taken aback by the speed with which the incident unfolded. Mr Mcerlean said: ""It happened that quick that people didn't know what was taking place and everybody was nervous and afraid if we were going on over. ""There was a lot of panic going on."" Lorry driver Niall Mcerlean said there was panic on board the ferry Mr Mcerlean said the sailing was the only one out of Northern Ireland last night. He added: ""I don't know why P&O sailed last night because it was giving out for a storm. ""Maybe they shouldn't have sailed."" In a statement, P&O Ferries said an incident had taken place on one of its vessels, the European Causeway. ""In extreme weather conditions, a number of vehicles have moved position on the decks causing damage onboard,"" it said. ""All passengers and crew are safely accounted for, there are no reports of injuries and the emergency services are in attendance."" Police Scotland said it had been called out after reports of a ""number of vehicles"" having overturned on the ferry. They confirmed none of the 52 passengers and 56 crew had been seriously hurt. This video can not be played Several lorries are thought to have overturned on the ferry Ch Insp Stephen Stiff said: ""Emergency services were on the scene very quickly and as the ferry docked into Cairnryan staff were able to board the ferry and start making sure all passengers and crew were safe and well.

Waste plan floats bottle deposit scheme,"Consumers will have to pay a returnable deposit on bottles, cans and disposable cups under a new government strategy. Homes in England will be provided by councils with separate collections for food waste. Recycling will be made less confusing for households, and manufacturers will need to foot the cost of disposing of the goods they produce. The plan has been cautiously welcomed by green groups, but some business groups are wary. The strategy is designed to help combat climate change, safeguard resources and reduce the flow of plastic to the ocean. Check what you can recycle in your area Plastic recycling: How do bottle deposit schemes work? A passion for recycling: 'It's my day job' The last waste strategy was set out 11 years ago and since then concern has boomed over climate change, the oceans and the way we use resources. Rotting waste is a major source of greenhouse gases that are over-heating the planet. And plastic litter is killing marine life. The governmentâs Resources and Waste Strategy sets out how ministers aim to change the way we deal with waste from the home to the workplace. This video can not be played Norway's bottle deposit scheme is the best in the world. How does it work? Tackle the current postcode recycling lottery under which different materials are recyclable in different areas. Introduce consistent labelling on packaging so consumers know what they can recycle â this should drive up recycling rates. Make the firms that produce materials responsible for the cost of disposing of those items. This could extend from drinks cartons to electrical goods and cars, though this is not yet certain. Industry will pay higher fees if their products are harder to reuse, repair or recycle. Compel local councils tooffer separate collections for food wasteâ details will go for consultation. Tell councils to scrap the charge for disposing of garden waste because if it ends up in landfill it produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Encourage manufacturers to design products that last longer and increase the levels of repair and re-use. Crack down on waste crime by introducing electronic tracking of waste shipments. The Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: âOur strategy sets out how we will go further and faster, to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Together we can move away from being a âthrow-awayâ society, to one that looks at waste as a valuable resource."" Plans are not finalised, and many issues are under consultation, but broadly here is how this would affect you: If you don't already have a caddy for food waste, you may do soon. You would be encouraged to use it but not be forced to do so. The introduction of food waste containers may mean getting your main rubbish bin emptied less often. You would have to pay a bit extra as a deposit on drinks containers, including coffee cups. You would get the deposit back if and when you recycled it. You may have to be more careful which trader you employ to get rid of your old fridge or unwanted mattress - because they could be electronically tracked to ensure they do not dump it. The goods that you buy may last longer and be more easily repaired, if government plans are effective. There are considerable differences currently around the UK. For instance, only around 35% of households in England are obliged to put food waste in its own caddy. That compares with 56% in Scotland and 100% in Wales. The figures exclude food waste mixed with garden waste. We must stop throwing so much away, because there is no ""away"". This is the key philosophy behind the government waste strategy. It is a huge and complicated area of policy, touching the lives of each of us, of businesses and of councils as well as government. There is frustration among campaigners and opposition parties that many policy details are missing, and many going out to further consultation. But some of the measures do look genuinely ambitious, and experts say that some of the policies will go further than those proposed by the EU. If Michael Gove actually delivers, many will think the wait has been worthwhile, as this strategy could transform our attitudes to resources on the planet. Libby Peake from the Green Alliance responded: âThereâs a lot of good in the policy â itâs on the right lines. But we need to see the detail of exactly how things will work.â She, and others, worry that major retailers will persuade the government during its consultation phase to exclude large drinks bottles from the deposit return scheme. The British Retail Consortium says most of the problem with beach litter is âon-the-goâ containers, not one litre bottles from supermarkets. They also fear the cost of installing the âreverse vendingâ machines that pay people for returning their containers. Shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said: ""You can't aim to prevent fly tipping without ending cuts to the councils. And we need a plan for stopping the export of UK recycling and waste plastics to countries where they currently end up in landfill or polluting our oceans. ""Rather than a vision for building our recycling infrastructure, it talks about voluntary action and distant target deadlines, while talking up the value of more incinerators."" Councils fear that if aluminium cans are part of the deposit scheme they will no longer appear in household bins, where they are the most lucrative item for recycling. Martin Tett from the Local Government Association, which represents councils, welcomed plans for companies to pay the cost of recycling their products. However he warned:  ""Moves to standardise waste services, including weekly food collections, need to be fully funded."" Samantha Harding, from the green group CPRE, told BBC News she welcomed some proposals in the report. She said: âSeparating food waste is essential â because decomposing food in general household bins reduces the value of other material sent for re-cycling.â There is some frustration among campaigners that key issues are still not tied down after many months of debate. But sources suggest the Treasury is resisting measures that might increase costs, and industry is warning that rushed policies could backfire.

Renzo Piano to oversee new Genoa bridgeThe Italian architect agrees to lead a â¬200m construction after the collapse that killed 43 people.Europe,"Mayor of Genoa Marco Bucci displays a section plan of the new bridge. Renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano has agreed to oversee the construction of a new Genoa bridge to replace one that collapsed and killed 43 people. A section of the 51-year-old Morandi bridge fell down on 14 August, crushing vehicles and buildings underneath. The new project will cost over â¬200m ($230m; Â£180m) and is expected to be completed in 12 months, officials said. Mr Piano is best known for designing buildings such as London's Shard and the New York Times headquarters. The 81-year-old had earlier volunteered to help design a replacement bridge, which he said would ""last for 1,000 years"". The Morandi bridge in Genoa was said to have been damaged by sea air On Tuesday, Italian companies Salini Impregilo and Fincantieri, who were awarded the contract to rebuild the structure, said Mr Piano would be in charge of the project, which is said to be based on a design he had submitted for free. The cross section of the new bridge would have the shape of a boat Among Renzo Piano's designs is the Whitney Museum in New York Mr Piano, who designed the Pompidou Centre in Paris with Richard Rogers and the Whitney Museum in New York, also designed the Ushibuka bridge which links three Japanese islands. He was in Genoa on the day the Morandi bridge collapsed. It later emerged that the steel rods suspending the 1.2km motorway bridge had been slowly decaying over decades and were badly damaged by the sea air. Victims of the Genoa bridge collapse CCTV shows structure moments before tragedy 'Miracle escape' stories from the disaster In an interview with Italy's La Repubblica newspaper shortly after the tragedy, the architect said that what was needed was a beautiful and safe bridge that would provide a ""rebirth and redemption"" for the affected area. According to Italian reports, Mr Piano provided sketches to Genoa officials, showing the road sitting on pillars that each resembled the prow of a ship. Also featured were 43 very tall posts illuminating the bridge at night in the shape of sails - one for each victim of the disaster, the Corriere website reported.

Banning sweets at checkouts 'works',"Banning sweets, chocolate and crisps at supermarket checkouts appears to stop unhealthy impulse buying by shoppers, a large UK study suggests. Researchers used data from 30,000 households to look at the year before and after bans were introduced by six out of nine major supermarkets. Purchases fell immediately after the bans and the reduction continued while the policies were in place. Ministers will soon consult on making it a mandatory ban in England. The nine supermarkets included in the study, which is published inPLOS Medicine,external, were Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Lidl, M&S, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose. Shoppers at the ones that removed sweets and crisps from checkouts bought almost a fifth less of the unhealthy products. Britain's Fat Fight: Why we're losing Child obesity plan targets sweets at checkouts Crossing the border for a sugar fix Data from another 7,500 shoppers who recorded any food they had purchased at supermarkets to eat ""on-the-go"" rather than take home, showed an even bigger decrease. Lead researcher Dr Jean Adams, from the University of Cambridge, says that although the study cannot prove a causal link, it suggests changing where products are displayed does alter consumer habits. She said: ""It's really heartening that small changes in supermarket layout could make such a difference and have an impact on people's diets."" Many snacks picked up at the checkout may be unplanned, impulse buys. Supermarkets have been accused of using ""pester power"" to sell food high in fat, salt or sugar by putting crisps, sweets and chocolates at the checkout for young children to see and then want. Dr Adams said these purchases were not necessarily parents giving in to their children. ""Sometimes parents buy them as a reward for their child having behaved well in the supermarket."" Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ""You would have to be superhuman to resist some promotions. They appear to offer great value but they're actually designed to make us spend more on foods we simply don't need. ""Restricting promotions would help to tackle excess calories and reduce obesity, while saving us money over time."" The government's ambition to end the promotion of unhealthy foods and drinks at checkouts is part of its strategy to halve childhood obesity in England in the next 12 years. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""This research supports what parents have been saying all along - check-out deals for sugary and fatty foods mean they end up buying products they don't need or want. That is why we will soon be consulting on restricting these types of offers.""

Lorries toppled after 'big dip' on ferry,"This video can not be played Footage filmed inside the ferry shows several lorries had toppled like dominos A man caught up in a ""major incident"" on a ferry from Northern Ireland to Scotland has described how a ""big dip"" caused lorries to topple over. Emergency services were called out to Cairnryan at about 07:40 after severe weather hit the service from Larne. Lorry driver Niall Mcerlean said ""all the wrecking took place"" about halfway through the journey. No-one was badly hurt but some people were stuck in vehicles. Police said the port would be shut for some time. They said anyone planning on sailing should only travel ""if absolutely necessary"". The Marine Accident Investigation Branch said it was ""liaising closely"" with those involved to determine the circumstances of the ""cargo shift"" on board the vessel. Ferry operator P&O said its 16:30 sailing had been cancelled and it urged affected passengers to call0800 130 0030to arrange alternative travel. Mr Mcerlean was on board when the alarm was raised. He said: ""We got on the ferry about half four and it was a wee bit rough and choppy coming along. ""About halfway across it sort of went into a big dip and came back out of it and that is when all the wrecking took place. ""After that the boat was sort of capsizing over a wee bit, leaning over a wee bit."" Cars were also damaged on board the ferry Asked if he thought the ferry was going to topple over, Mr Mcerlean replied: ""We thought she was away at that time."" He also said passengers were taken aback by the speed with which the incident unfolded. Mr Mcerlean said: ""It happened that quick that people didn't know what was taking place and everybody was nervous and afraid if we were going on over. ""There was a lot of panic going on."" Lorry driver Niall Mcerlean said there was panic on board the ferry Mr Mcerlean said the sailing was the only one out of Northern Ireland last night. He added: ""I don't know why P&O sailed last night because it was giving out for a storm. ""Maybe they shouldn't have sailed."" In a statement, P&O Ferries said an incident had taken place on one of its vessels, the European Causeway. ""In extreme weather conditions, a number of vehicles have moved position on the decks causing damage onboard,"" it said. ""All passengers and crew are safely accounted for, there are no reports of injuries and the emergency services are in attendance."" Police Scotland said it had been called out after reports of a ""number of vehicles"" having overturned on the ferry. They confirmed none of the 52 passengers and 56 crew had been seriously hurt.

BA to resume flights to Pakistan,"Islamabad's new airport opened this year British Airways is to restart flights to Pakistan next year, more than 10 years after it halted services following a major hotel bombing. The airline stopped flying to the country after the Marriott hotel in the capital, Islamabad, was bombed in 2008, killing more than 50 people. BA will be the first Western airline,externalto resume services to the country. A new airport was opened recently in Islamabad, which has eased concerns about both security and congestion. The attack on the Marriott was one of the most high-profile attacks in Pakistan's history. Thomas Drew, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, said BA's return was a ""reflection of the great improvements"" in security. BA's Robert Williams said: ""It's exciting to be flying between Islamabad and Heathrow from next year, which we believe will be particularly popular with the British Pakistani community who want to visit, or be visited by, their relatives."" More than a million people of Pakistani origin live in the UK. BA, which is owned by airline group IAG, aims to run three flights a week, starting on 2 June. Currently, Pakistan's PIA is the only airline to run direct flights from Pakistan to Britain.

Reality Check: Brexit spending,"The Treasury says that since 2016 it has provided Â£4.2bn for Brexit preparations. Not all of that money will be spent on getting ready for no deal. Even if a withdrawal agreement is finalised and the UK enters a 21-month transition period after Brexit, plenty of things will need to be done to prepare the country for life outside the EU. But no deal would mean the UK needing to spend the largest amount of money in the shortest possible time. And it has been struggling to spend money quickly. According to the Treasury, Â£1.5bn is due to be spent on Brexit during the course of this financial year. But while the government says it is stepping up the pace of planning,the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has predicted,externalthat Â£0.4bn, nearly a third of the money available this year, will not be spent before the end of March 2019. At the moment, it looks like more money will be spent in the financial year after Brexit is due to happen (from April 2019-April 2020) than in the current financial year. And that's not much use for no-deal preparations that will have to take place before the UK leaves. Extra staff will be needed at UK borders So what's the money being spent on and why the delays in spending it? Plenty of extra staff have been recruited across government departments to deal with the challenges of Brexit. ""We have hired about 10,000 people so far,"" John Manzoni, the chief executive of the civil service told the House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee last week. ""There are about another 5,000 in the pipeline and there are probably another 5,000 to come, in the event of a disorderly exit."" Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), for example, already had more than 3,000 people in EU exit roles at the end of November this year. But it takes time to recruit, vet and train staff, and then it takes more time to get money out of the door into the projects that need to be implemented. It has also been very difficult for government departments to know how to spend their money amid the extreme political uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations. A report by the National Audit Office,external, published in September, emphasises this point. ""The constantly changing environment that Defra is working in,"" it said, ""in particular the fluctuations in the likelihood of reaching a (Brexit) deal, has made it difficult for Defra to make, and stick to, a robust plan."" Perhaps the biggest questions, in the event of no deal, relate to what would happen at UK borders after Brexit. This may be where the most intensive planning is taking place, and a significant tranche of government money will have to be spent to meet the challenge. A statement issued by the Cabinet Office earlier this month said cross-government planning assumptions have been revised after the European Commission made it clear that, in the event of no deal, it would treat the UK like any other third country, and impose the full range of controls on people and goods entering the EU from the United Kingdom. The Cabinet Office statement said the impact would be felt most severely at the ports of Dover and Folkestone, where both exports and imports would be affected because of the frequency of crossings of the English Channel, and the knock-on effects of any delays. Revised government planning assumptions are that - in a worst-case scenario - there will be ""significantly reduced access"" across the Channel ""for up to six months"". Among the contingency plans being proposed, the government is investigating chartering ships to use on less congested sea routes to other ports such as Felixstowe and Tilbury.

May 'to hold series of votes',"Theresa May is now thought to be in favour of giving MPs a vote on alternatives to her plans when they debate her Brexit deal. The prime minister was previously thought to be against this idea. But sources have told the BBC she wants the ""meaningful vote"" planned for the third week of January to be a ""moment of reckoning"" for Brexit. It comes as the cabinet announced it was stepping up preparations in case there is a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. The votes would be on amendments to the motion on her Brexit deal - and would take place before the key vote on her plan. BBC Parliament Live: Commons debate Brexit Cabinet 'ramps up' no-deal Brexit planning Labour makes no-confidence move against PM The Brexit deal Theresa May has reached with the EU has to be passed by Parliament but most MPs - including many on her own side - are against it. She had been planning to present Parliament with a choice between her deal and no-deal, hoping that enough MPs would swallow their objections and get behind her version of Brexit. But MPs are showing few signs of changing their minds - with some hoping that the next step after her deal being rejected would be leaving without a deal, others hoping for a fresh referendum and some backing alternative deals like the ones Norway or Canada have with the EU. So rather than wait for what seems like an inevitable defeat, she is thought to be planning a new approach. The prime minister does not believe any of the factions criticising her plan have enough support to get their own version of Brexit through Parliament. By allowing them to put forward their proposals and vote on them, she is hoping they will be defeated and her plan will emerge by a process of elimination as the best and only alternative to leaving without a deal. By BBC Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar On all sides at Westminster, MPs feel sure her plan is doomed to defeat. Many - including some in her own Cabinet - want other ideas: a Norway-style Brexit which leaves the UK closely tied to the EU, say, or a referendum, or no deal, put to MPs after that happens. The prime minister's formula might flush out those who are quietly waiting for her plan to fail before offering their own ideas as a solution. She wants, in effect, a moment of reckoning for Brexit, with all the rival outcomes debated and voted upon when MPs discuss and decide on her plan next month. If MPs reject every plan - and that is possible - she might just be able to continue the fight for her own. Several cabinet ministers have publicly suggested alternative next steps if Mrs May's plan is rejected. Penny Mordaunt: Against a second referendum At a marathon cabinet meeting earlier: The BBC understands Justice Secretary David Gauke said a ""managed no-deal"" - which some ministers are thought to favour - is not a viable option. He said it was not on offer from the EU and it was the responsibility of ministers not to propagate unicorns but to slay them International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, one of those thought to be in favour of a ""managed no-deal"", is understood to have spoken out against a second referendum Sources say Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who has advocated a softer, Norway-style Brexit, told the Cabinet ""just because you put a seat belt on doesn't mean you should crash the car"", adding that a positive future depended on getting a Brexit deal Mrs May was originally planning to put her plan to a Commons vote last week but pulled it at the last minute over fears it would be defeated, sparking widespread outrage among MPs. ""Last time, for one reason or another, people only set out what they opposed. Next time could be an opportunity for people to set down what they support - and vote on it,""  a senior source close to Mrs May said. Downing Street is also hoping to get more reassurances from Brussels that any outcome that keeps the UK tied to EU rules - as part of measures to ensure there is no return to a physical Northern Ireland border, will be temporary.

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher in Washington Donald Trump's charitable foundation is being dismantled, but the headaches it has created for the president aren't going away anytime soon. According to New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, her investigation into alleged misconduct could still result in millions of dollars in penalties and sanctions against the president and his three oldest children. As the Washington Post has reported, Mr Trump frequently used his family foundation - which was funded in large part by outside donations - as a resource to settle business lawsuits and, during the 2016 presidential campaign, as a political tool. The president has been quick to dismiss the New York investigation into his foundation, but with Tuesday's dissolution deal Ms Underwood's criticisms could have sharper teeth. At the very least, they are sure to resurface as the 2020 presidential election approaches. The state's lawsuit against the Trump Foundation was announced over the summer after a two-year investigation which began under previous New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. In October 2016Mr Schneiderman ordered the Trump Foundation to stop fundraising in New York, after finding it had no proper registration. President-elect Trumpvowed to shut the charitable foundation down in December 2016, to avoid ""even the appearance"" of any conflict of interest. A41-page document filed with the New York Supreme Court by the attorney general's officein June 2018 spells out a range of alleged violations of laws concerning non-profit organisations dating back more than a decade. Mr Trump, who has not contributed any personal funds to the foundation since 2008, was the sole signatory on the foundation's bank accounts and approved all of its grants. Several pages of the document focus on a charity fundraiser for veterans in Iowa in January 2016, which Mr Trump chose to hold instead of taking part in a TV debate with other Republican presidential hopefuls ahead of the influential state's caucuses. More than $2.8m was donated to the Trump Foundation at that event. The petition alleges that those funds raised from the public were used to promote Mr Trump's campaign for the presidency, in particular in the Iowa nominating caucuses. The lawsuit also claims that the foundation paid $100,000 to settle legal claims against Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort; $158,000 to settle claims against one of his golf clubs; and $10,000 to purchase a painting of Mr Trump to hang at another of his golf clubs Eight legal headaches for Donald Trump New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E 'Where do I go?': Fear and anxiety as people flee Hollywood fire Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy Politics Essential: Get the latest news and analysis delivered to your inbox every weekday Delivering brand-new miracles in 1970s East End Watch the latest series of Call the Midwife on iPlayer now Mark-Anthony Turnage shares the soundtrack of his life Once called 'Britainâs hippest composer', he's tackled topics from drug abuse to football in his work Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the bread factory he used to work in, and sees how they make 1.4 million loaves a week What's behind the global surrogacy boom?

'We were one bill away from disaster'A mother tells of her financial struggle as regulators outline plans to simplify overdraft fees.Business,"Cindy Toth dipped into an overdraft to pay for an emergency but, like millions of people in the UK, she then found it tough to climb back out. She said daily overdraft charges meant her family had nothing to spend after rent and grocery bills and were ""one bill from financial disaster"". Newly-announced plans on overdrafts would end this kind of charging. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants banks to charge a single interest rate for all types of overdraft. Banks would set a single rate for going into the red and customers would be able to compare banks for the best deal. The FCA, the City regulator, is also proposing a ban on any fixed fees linked to an overdraft. The body that represents UK banks, UK Finance, said it would consider the proposals carefully. One analyst has suggested the FCA's plans could hasten the end of ""free banking"". Young and in the red: Personal debt in five charts Millions miss bills as finances bite How debt kills Mrs Toth, who is married and in her 40s, said she had used her arranged overdraft as it was intended - to cover an unexpected cost which, in her case, was flights to the US for a funeral. However, she was then made redundant and the debt was never paid off. Each month the family would go up to Â£4,500 into the red. The crunch came when her bank - Barclays - switched from an overdraft interest rate to a daily fee for going overdrawn. She said that increased the typical monthly bill from Â£30 to Â£90. She said the extra charges meant she was worrying about other costs including buying school shoes for her son and paying a plumber's bill. ""It meant no family holidays, and no Christmas presents exchanged with my husband. It is mentally and emotionally difficult. You just feel that you are treading water the whole time."" Barclays has always said there are options for account holders in such a situation, but Mrs Toth said the bank's offer to switch the overdraft into a loan did not suit their financial plight. Eventually, the family came into some inheritance, immediately paid off the overdrafts, and it means this is the first Christmas for years that the couple will be giving each other Christmas gifts. There are arranged overdrafts, when current account holders borrow up to a limit agreed with, or offered by, the bank. About 19 million people use one each year. Some banks also have unarranged overdrafts, with extra or higher charges for going beyond this limit or going into the red without permission, used by 14 million people a year. Those aged 35 to 44 are most likely to have some form of overdraft, and about 10% of all 18 to 24-year-olds have exceeded their overdraft limit in the past 12 months. For customers, the charges and fees are difficult to compare - with a mix of interest rates, daily fees, or monthly fees among banks. Those costs could be high even with a small debt. For example, someone could be charged Â£5 a day for borrowing Â£100 overdraft. The majority of unarranged overdraft charges are paid by only 1.5% of customers. They pay about Â£450 a year in fees and charges, according to the FCA. On average, consumers in more deprived areas paid twice as much in charges for unarranged overdrafts than consumers living in less deprived areas, the FCA found. The overdraft system would be overhauled, in what the FCA calls the ""biggest intervention in the overdraft market for a generation"". Instead of arranged and unarranged overdrafts, the regulator is proposing a simple, single interest rate for customers going into an overdraft. There would no longer be any monthly or daily fees - like the ones charged to Mrs Toth. Under the plans, banks would have to advertise their overdraft rate as a single annual interest rate, or APR. They would also be encouraged to explain that cost in pounds and pence. A series of alerts and calculators would have to be offered to customers, and banks must identify anyone who looks as though they are getting into financial trouble and help them. Banks will still be able to refuse to make a payment if a customer does not have the funds to cover it, but any resulting fee for the customer must reflect that cost. The same is true of a letter sent to inform someone they are overdrawn - the bank can charge for the letter, but only Â£2 or so. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive, said the regulator's ""radical"" proposals would ""make overdrafts simpler, fairer, and easier to manage"", but UK Finance is opposed to ending the difference between the two types of overdraft. ""It is important however that individuals are still able to use unarranged overdrafts where appropriate. UK Finance members have been working with the regulator to explore new ways to better identify and support customers with repeat overdraft use,"" said Eric Leenders, from the trade body. Initially the cost of overdrafts compared to old arranged overdraft rates could be higher as banks take a hit on their income. The FCA, which wants the changes to come into force by December 2019, said it would expect banks to start competing on their overdraft rate in the longer term. That could push down costs, if customers switch banks. UK Finance said the personal current account market was already ""highly competitive"". Analyst Andrew Hagger, from Moneycomms, said that ""the end of free banking could become much more of a reality"" because of the FCA proposals, as banks could start charging a monthly fee to everyone with a current account. He said: ""It will be interesting to see how the banks react - will they charge sky high interest rates for overdrafts, instead of hiding behind complex tariffs or will they look to recoup lost revenue by charging monthly fees?"" However, Christopher Woolard, of the FCA, said the regulator expected free banking to continue as there were still major advantages for banks in doing so. A longer term challenge to free banking could come when major technology companies entered the sector. The FCA is no stranger to price caps. It is introducinga rule for so-called rent-to-own productsthat means, from April 2019, customers will pay no more in interest than the cost of the product itself. Campaigners have saida cap on the cost of payday loans, introduced by the FCA in 2015, should be a template for overdrafts. However, financial regulators have a chequered history when attempting to put a cap on overdraft charges. In 2009, the Supreme Court overturned earlier court rulings that allowed the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the fairness of charges for unauthorised overdrafts. In effect, this halted more than a million claims from bank customers for refunds of unarranged overdraft fees. The FCA said the new proposals were a more appropriate way to deal with the problems with overdraft. How much debt do UK households have?

The Portuguese, 55, took over in May 2016 and led United to League Cup and Europa League titles, but they are 19 points behind league leaders Liverpool. The club have made a change after no progress with results or style despite spending nearly Â£400m on 11 players. They also say the new manager will understand the philosophy of the club, including their attacking tradition. It is understood players and staff are not happy after a disappointing and unsettling period during which young players were not developed. United are sixth in the Premier League, but closer in terms of points to the relegation zone than to leaders Liverpool, who beat them 3-1 on Sunday. Analysis: Yesterday's man? Is Mourinho finished at the top level? Football Daily podcast: What next for Man Utd? 'Caption this', 'Do one' and other reactions to Mourinho's sacking Solskjaer in running for Man Utd caretaker role as Pochettino tight-lipped The decision to sack Mourinho, which will cost more than Â£18m, has been taken in the long-term interests of United with a view that the club is bigger than any one individual. Mourinho is understood to have wanted his own structure, but the new manager will be appointed with a head of football above him reporting to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. A United statement said: ""A caretaker manager will be appointed until the end of the season while the club conducts a thorough recruitment process for a new, full-time manager. ""The club would like to thank Jose for his work during his time at Manchester United and to wish him success in the future."" The club hope to appoint a caretaker manager before they face Cardiff City on 22 December but it will not be assistant manager Michael Carrick or academy boss Nicky Butt. The candidate will be drawn from outside the club, but will not be former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. Prime targets and long shots: Who will be the next Man Utd manager? 'Take stock and reset structure' - Neville on Man Utd This tweet was posted on Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba's account before being deleted soon after United's haul of 26 points after their first 17 Premier League games is their worst tally at this stage of a season since 1990-91. They are 11 points off the top four, which would earn a Champions League qualification place. The sacking of Mourinho, who replaced Louis van Gaal in May 2016 and signed a contract extension in January, comes after a fall-out with Â£89m record signing Paul Pogba, who was an unused substitute for the defeat at Anfield on Sunday. Following a 1-1 draw with Wolves, Pogba said he wanted United to be able to ""attack, attack, attack"" at home, which led Mourinho to say the France midfielder would no longer be the club's ""second captain"". After Mourinho was sacked, a post which said ""caption this"", along with a knowing expression on Pogba's face, appeared on his Twitter account before being deleted. Former United captain Gary Nevillereplied:,external""You do one as well!"" United later claimed it was a ""scheduled marketing post"" by Pogba's sponsors Adidas. Mourinho's third season did not begin well after missing out on key transfer targets in the summer, and two defeats in the first three league games - to Tottenham at home and Brighton away - meant his side were playing catch-up with the leading teams. By October, there were reports Mourinho might be sacked prior to the home game against Newcastle, but after the team trailed 2-0, they turned it around to win 3-2 and seemingly buy the former Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss more time. Mourinho's agent Jorge Mendes attempted to calm matters earlier this month by taking the step of issuing a statement to say his client was ""very happy"" and ""fully committed"" to the club. Despite reaching the Champions League last 16, where United will play Paris St-Germain, they have won just one of their past six games in the Premier League. Mourinho's dismissal continues his run of having never completed four consecutive seasons in charge of a club. Only once has he made it into a fourth campaign, but he left Chelsea on 20 September 2007 during his first spell at Stamford Bridge.

Cabinet 'ramps up' no-deal Brexit planning,"The cabinet has decided to ""ramp up"" preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid uncertainty over the fate of Theresa May's proposed EU exit deal. It allocated to ministries Â£2bn set aside in case the UK leaves on 29 March without MPs having accepted any deal. Letters will be sent to 140,000 firms updating them on what they should do while 3,500 troops will be put on standby to help government departments. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said it amounted to ""psychological warfare"". With 101 days left until Brexit and many MPs still opposed to the government's withdrawal agreement, which MPs will vote on in mid-January, ministers met for a longer-than-normal two and a half hour meeting. Parliament Live: Rolling updates Brexit: A really simple guide They agreed that businesses should activate their own no deal contingency plans, as they think appropriate. Updated Revenue and Customs information packs will be sent to firms later this week, setting out what changes could be needed at the border. Consumers are being advised to familiarise themselves with advice published this summer, in areas ranging frombooking flightstousing credit cards, with more details promised in the coming weeks. Please upgrade your browser The Treasury said Â£480m of the Â£2bn of preparation funding would go to the Home Office, helping it to employ more Border Force officers and boost national security. Defra would receive Â£410m, allowing it to focus on ensuring the trade in fish, food products and chemicals remains uninterrupted. HMRC, which is being allocated Â£375m, plans to hire more than 3,000 new staff to handle increases in customs activities, as well as investing in new technology at borders. The next largest allocations will be Â£190m for the Department for Business and Â£128m for the Department for International Trade. Separately, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs that 3,500 military personnel, including logisticians and engineers as well as infantry units, were ready to be deployed if needed. About 10% of the force would be reservists who will receive their call up papers in the middle of January so that if needed they would be ready in March. In other developments: Theresa May is now thoughtto be in favour of giving MPs a vote on alternativesto her plans when they debate her Brexit deal The government'starget of reducing net migrationto less than 100,000 a year has been left out of draft proposals for a new immigration system A Labour motion of no confidence in Theresa May will not be tabled until January The Daily Telegraph published a letter by 53 business leaders,external, including ex-Sainsbury's boss Justin King and Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis, have called on the PM to ""take her deal to the British people"". Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the cabinet had agreed that ""preparing for a no deal will be an operational priority within government but our overall priority is to secure a deal"". This video can not be played James Brokenshire tells Today the government has been preparing for a no deal ""for some time"" He said no-deal planning ""needs to be much more of a priority for businesses"" and there would be a ""significant increase"" in the guidance issued to them over the next 14 weeks, as Brexit day approaches. E-mails will be sent out to 80,000 of those businesses most like to be affected over the next few days. In the autumn of 2017, The Treasury earmarked Â£3bn for no-deal planning between 2018 and 2020. In March, Chancellor Philip Hammond said half of that had been allocated to 20 government departments, with the Home Office, transport, the environment and business among the largest recipients. At Tuesday's cabinet meeting ministers approved the second tranche - plus an under-spend from the current year - to go to departments for the 2019/20 year, with the priority areas being borders, security and international trade. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already ordered full ""no deal"" planning across the National Health Service, he told the BBC's Newsnight on Monday. But Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, criticised UK ministers, who he said were ""glorifying"" the prospect of leaving without a comprehensive deal in the hope individual agreements could be reached in areas like transport and livestock movements.

And Labour said a no-deal exit was ""not viable"" and it would work with other parties to stop it. ""It is testament to the prime minister's failure in these negotiations that the government is now spending billions of pounds of taxpayers' money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that is rejected by Parliament and many of those sat around the Cabinet table,"" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. And the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for another referendum, said the government was ""attempting to scare"" MPs, businesses and the public with the threat of a no-deal. ""Theresa May is irresponsibly trying to run down the clock so that the only option is to support her discredited deal,"" Sir Vince Cable said. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn wants MPs to get a Brexit deal vote before Christmas MPs will vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations, in the middle of January. The deal will only come into force if both the UK and European parliaments approve it. The BBC understands Mrs May is planning to use the Commons vote as a ""moment of reckoning"" for the Brexit process. Sources have told the BBC that Downing Street will not stand in the way of MPs who seek to amend the government's motion on the Brexit deal to put forward potential alternatives. The prime minister was previously thought to be against this idea. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to push for a further vote of no-confidence in the government as a whole. On Monday night, the Labour leader tabled a motion calling on MPs to declare they have no confidence in the prime minister because she failed to have a vote on her Brexit deal straight away. Reality Check: What is the government spending on Brexit preparations? Kuenssberg: Parliamentary shenanigans Q&A: The backstop Brexit: What could happen next? No 10 has refused to make time for the motion and Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed on Tuesday that there were under no obligation to do so. Other parties - the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - have called on Mr Corbyn to push for a no-confidence vote against the government as a whole. Unlike a vote aimed at the prime minister, the government would have to allow a vote on this motion and, if successful, it could force a general election. This video can not be played Could there be a second Brexit vote? Northern Ireland's DUP, whose votes the Conservative government has relied on in big votes since the June 2017 election, said they would not support Labour. Mrs May also appeared to have the support of pro-Brexit backbench critics who last week failed in a bid to oust her as Tory leader. One of them, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he would never vote against Mrs May or a Conservative government. He said on Tuesday evening that he had a ""civilised and courteous"" meeting with the PM, and that the government was ""prudent"" to engage in no-deal planning.

Is Mourinho's time at the top finished?,"Jose Mourinho's relationship with United midfielder Paul Pogba has not always been smooth Jose Mourinho's managerial career stands at the crossroads after his sacking by Manchester United - but is the 'Special One' now yesterday's man? Mourinho can take his place as one of management's greats after winning the Champions League with Porto and Inter Milan, and enjoying silver-lined spells in charge of Chelsea, Real Madrid and United. But are Mourinho's colourful and controversial glory days as one of the game's elite coaches now over? Football Daily podcast: What next for Man Utd? 'Caption this', 'Do one' and other reactions to Mourinho's sacking Solskjaer in running for Man Utd caretaker role as Pochettino tight-lipped Mourinho's time at Old Trafford was heavily laced with accusations the modern game - in the shape of managers such as Manchester City's Pep Guardiola, and Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool - had left the 55-year-old Portuguese behind. And games in opposition to Guardiola and Klopp that are fresh in the memory intensify the image Mourinho, once the trailblazer, is light years behind the modernisers. Guardiola's City outclassed their neighbours two months ago, and it was symbolic that the sight of United cowering as Klopp's Liverpool blew them away at Anfield on Sunday was the final straw. The intense, attacking, easy-on-the-eye approaches of Guardiola, Klopp, and Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham, have been used as sticks to beat what is regarded as Mourinho's more pragmatic strategy. In Mourinho's defence, it should be stated he won more trophies in his first season at United (the League Cup and the Europa League) than Klopp or Pochettino have in their whole time at Liverpool and Spurs - indeed they are still waiting for their first trophies in England. Football's landscape moves swiftly, however, and while that trio are fresh and innovative, Mourinho has cut a tired, careworn, negative figure out of touch with their vibrant approach. So is it fair to say he is now yesterday's man? Prime targets and long shots: Who will be the next Man Utd manager? 'Take stock and reset structure' - Neville on Man Utd Mark Schwarzer joined Chelsea a month after Mourinho returned for his second spell in 2013 and spent two years working under him, during which they won the Premier League. The former Australia goalkeeper told BBC Sport: ""Yesterday's man? Not at all. He is still very relevant no matter what has happened at United, and his methods are modern in his training and approach to tactics. ""People talk about his style compared to the likes of Klopp and Guardiola but everyone has a different interpretation on how football should be played. If everyone played the same way as Klopp or Guardiola's teams I think it would be pretty boring after a while with everyone doing the same thing. ""This is what makes football so appealing. There is such a variety of styles, and just because one manager employs a different style to another doesn't make them outdated or yesterday's man."" That support is in contrast to some players under his charge in recent years who, while privately accepting he always had a plan and was tactically meticulous, often felt he leaned too heavily towards the defensive aspects. Schwarzer added: ""You can argue all day long, and if you are one of those people in the camp who say the way the modern game is going it is all about the way Manchester City and Liverpool play then they might say he is past it and his methods are old. This video can not be played 'Something had to give' - Shearer Q&A on Mourinho sacking ""I don't agree. I am a firm believer there are a variety of ways you can play football. Yes, one is more appealing on the eye than the other but ultimately it is about delivering results, performances and trophies. ""This is how you are judged and he has won trophies everywhere he has been, including Manchester United."" South African striker Benni McCarthy, who played in Mourinho's Porto team that won the Champions League in 2004, agrees. He told BBC Sport: ""I don't think you become outdated all of a sudden. I just think it is down to the players not applying what the manager's expecting from them. ""Mourinho is still one of the best in the world. He has not become a bad manager overnight."" The narrative surrounding Mourinho's decline at both Chelsea and United has involved friction - and often friction with star players. Michael Emenalo, Chelsea's technical director when Mourinho was sacked in December 2015, lifted the lid on problems behind the scenes when he said: ""There obviously seemed to be a palpable discord between manager and players and we felt it was time to act."" Mourinho's dealings with Chelsea forward Eden Hazard were often seen as one of the difficulties there, and the manager's relationship with midfielder Paul Pogba has provided a constant backdrop to the unrest at Old Trafford. The sight of Mourinho's Â£89m marquee signing sitting forlornly behind him at Anfield - unused and seemingly not to be trusted in the sort of game that shapes United's great players - could almost be used as an image to illustrate the manager's downfall. It is believed Mourinho's relationship with Hazard collapsed during his third season at Stamford Bridge after Chelsea regained the Premier League title - the Belgian's sunny, humble nature at odds with the 'win-at-all-costs' pragmatism of his manager, who was prepared to - as one insider put it - ""get nasty"" to get results. This video can not be played Mourinho's Man Utd ups and downs The big-stick approach was never designed to get the best out of Hazard and it was a relationship that deteriorated, though the pair have since spoken warmly about each other, the Belgian actually suggesting he could work under Mourinho again. Those who have worked with Mourinho talk about his demanding, challenging style - but a major bone of contention behind the scenes was his willingness to play out drama in his news conferences. Mourinho has been conducting almost a weekly narrative of discontent about life at Old Trafford since the summer and, as at other clubs, it has eventually worn everyone down, including even the manager himself. It is also understood his ""us against the world"" siege mentality did not always play to a unanimously appreciative dressing-room audience. Mourinho's troubles with Pogba were even more toxic and puzzling given he insisted on the gifted midfielder returning to Old Trafford on his appointment in summer 2016, even though he had left United for Juventus for only Â£1.5m four years earlier when his contract expired. Yet others inside a Mourinho dressing room accepted his demanding nature, and also speak about his supportive side. Schwarzer said: ""Working with him was demanding but at that level I didn't expect anything else. The pressure and demands were on everyone and the expectation was from everyone - the club, hierarchy, supporters, players and manager. ""I expected him to be demanding and he was, and clearly at United the same applied. ""There was an expectation to deliver a certain standard. This was the overwhelming sensation from the moment I arrived."" This video can not be played Jose Mourinho: How Manchester United manager's season collapsed Mourinho's direct style has led to tensions throughout his career, and this led to a familiar manner of departure, particularly mirroring hissacking at Chelsea three years ago- almost to the day. Will another acrimonious end mean the big clubs shy away from Mourinho and go for younger coaches who are perceived to possess more up-to-date methods? Schwarzer gave an insight into his methods when he said: ""At Chelsea we had a dressing room full of world-class players. We had Ashley Cole, John Terry, Petr Cech, Cesar Azpilicueta, Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard, Gary Cahill... Cesc Fabregas was brought in by Jose. ""These guys wanted to be pushed. They could handle the manager being upset, being very, very direct in his criticisms and demands. ""As a player no-one likes to be told, no-one likes to be shouted at or made an example of in front of people but I never felt the manager was doing it in a vindictive way. ""He would pick on people but he would pick on them for a specific reason. He did it because he wanted to show people no-one was exempt from criticism. Just because you're a big name doesn't mean you can't be told you've done something wrong. ""Too often I have been at clubs where managers have danced around that and were too afraid to tell the big-name player they'd not been good enough or they weren't putting that work in, that their level of performance wasn't enough. ""Very rarely did a manager have the bottle to say it, whereas Jose was never afraid to say it no matter who they were."" Mourinho's abrasive style has led to repeated patterns of brushes with authority, clashes with players, and eventually his departure from clubs he has elevated to success, often after long barren years - he delivered Chelsea's first league title in 50 years and Inter Milan's first European Cup for 45 years. It has also led to the accumulation of tensions that have made Mourinho's departure necessary - just as it has at United. So is there still a place for this confrontational, challenging style, or will he need to acquire a measure of reinvention when he emerges again? Mourinho's hardline approach is, publicly at least, a contrast to the arm-around-the-shoulder, animated approaches of Guardiola and Klopp - but make no mistake they are just as ruthless when it comes to hugging players right out of the door. Schwarzer speaks again of a man who is not out of his time in the modern game but a results-driven individual who could also be in tune with the game's modern nuances, a manager with more to his approach than confrontation. He said: ""His moods were determined by performances and results. Generally, at Chelsea, we had far more better results than bad and he was someone who was always generally in a pretty good mood and was approachable. ""Obviously if you lost he wasn't used to it and he showed it. It was hard and you didn't get in his way or do anything to antagonise him. You had to show it hurt you as much as it hurt him. ""But if you give him everything, if you deliver, work hard and do everything you possibly can, you know your place and you back him and show it by performances and application he will back you. ""There is no way he will have a problem with you. In fact he will admire you even more."" McCarthy believes he may need to make an adjustment: ""Maybe just understanding the new generation of players. When you come with superstar status maybe you need to loosen up a little and manage the players accordingly. ""Say with Hazard or Pogba, you maybe can't ask them to work their socks off because they need to use their energy to drive the team forward, to use their skills to produce that little bit of magic they have that others don't have. ""Mourinho is demanding of them that they work equally as hard as your so-called 'normal' players. ""You want them to work hard but you also need them to produce their best football and sometimes you have to make exceptions for those special, talented players that you have to let them be free so maybe that part of his style he can adjust to the modern-day coaching."" Mourinho has had so much success he may feel no need to alter the style that has brought him trophies - but will he ever again get a club of the stature he has enjoyed at the likes of Chelsea, Inter, Real and United?

Man Utd need to reset - Neville,"This video can not be played Jose Mourinho: How Manchester United manager's season collapsed Manchester United need to ""reset"" and ""take stock"" after sacking manager Jose Mourinho, says former captain Gary Neville. Mourinho was sacked on Tuesdayafter two and a half years at the club, with United sixth in the Premier League, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool. Speaking to Sky Sports, Neville said the club needed to appoint someone who meets the club's ""key principles"". ""It's about making sure the next manager is the right manager,"" he said. ""The reality of that is they're going to have to put the right football structure in around him."" Football Daily podcast: What next for Man Utd? 'Caption this', 'Do one' and other reaction to Mourinho's sacking Live: All the latest reaction to Mourinho's sacking United decided a change was needed after no progress with results or style despite spending Â£400m on 11 players. The club said the new manager would understand the philosophy of the club, including its attacking traditions. It is understood players and staff were not happy after a disappointing and unsettling period. Neville added: ""This is not just a moment to sack Jose Mourinho and appoint another manager. This is a moment for the club to take stock of what they're doing, to reset the structure in terms of recruitment, in terms of the decision-making in the football club, and make sure what they do next is the right move."" The 43-year-old, who played for United from 1992-2011, believes Mourinho is not the only one to blame. ""The players take responsibility, the board take responsibility, the manager and the coaching staff,"" he said. ""There have been seven years of poor decisions and poor recruitment. I've no idea who makes the decisions in the football club from a point of view of recruitment and structure - who has the final say? Who is it that is telling Jose Mourinho that those players shouldn't be signed? I can't see anybody in the football club that has the qualifications to do that. ""The recruitment over the last years has been erratic, the current management team have had three chances at appointing a manager, they're probably going to get a fourth.""

Things aren't improving and he has taken it as far as he can. I was one of his biggest advocates two and half years ago when he joined the club and felt he stabilised #MUFC when we needed it. You can't ignore what Jose has achieved as a manager previously but I feel the time has come for fresh ideas at #MUFC! People have been critical of my comments on TV of late but as a fan I am saying it as I see it. The club needs an injection of positivity and hopefully this decision will allow that to happen. I wish Jose all the best and wish him well for the future."" Former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra said onTwitter:,external""The thing that is annoying me the most right now is why are people so focused on Paul Pogba and Jose Mourinho? ""Let's focus on rebuilding something solid instead of being in a playground. Doing this is only disrespecting the badge, from now we only need positivity."" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""He is a competitive guy, very ambitious. I can imagine the last few months were not a joy. It is not nice to face all those questions. ""But nobody can take away all the things he has won. I hope he has that on his mind as he leaves. He is an outstanding manager."" Rangers manager and former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said:""He's obviously a world-class manager. He's been a rival for many, many years when I played. He's a winner, isn't he? I mean, how can I sit here and say anything about Jose Mourinho? He's a serial winner, he always has been everywhere he's gone. ""He's done the best job since Alex Ferguson's left. It seemed they sort of struggled before that but Jose came in and put a couple of trophies in the cabinet, so I don't think you can criticise him too much. ""It will be interesting to see which direction they go in now with the new manager but none of the Manchester United fans will care what I say about it, so it's none of my business."" Former Manchester United striker Michael Owen said onTwitter:,external""Inevitable is the word I'd use. Mourinho had to go in the end. Simply not getting anywhere near enough out of his players."" Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen said on BBC Radio 5 live:""I think they've looked back critically to where they are and asked themselves: 'Is this the right way forward?' With the transfer window right ahead of them, I can understand the timing. ""You hear people talking about how United have lost their identity and that's what you see among the players. There is no really clear direction and certainly not after they'd been under Sir Alex Ferguson for so many years."" Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker said onTwitter:,external""With Man Utd 19 points behind Liverpool after 17 games, with the vast majority of players playing way below their best... and dour football to boot. Given Mourinho was allowed to spend hundreds of millions on those players the split seemed inevitable. ""Would imagine one of the main reasons for sacking Mourinho now would be to stop the attempted mass exodus of their best players next month."" Former Manchester United winger Lee Sharpe said on BBC Radio 5 live:""The timing is a little bit weird. They have four games in 10 or 12 days. ""They obviously don't have anyone lined up permanently and I just think it is because the team is not playing great and have had poor results. ""The demeanour of Jose Mourinho and the players has dropped. They have probably accepted they are not going to make the top four so now is the time to change."" Andy Mitten, editor of Manchester United fanzine United We Stand, on BBC Radio 5 live:""It has been coming in recent weeks. We've been doing polls where 80% of fans wanted him to leave. Very few people will be upset he has gone. ""He had a very good first season, an acceptable second season, but this season has been a disaster. ""The manager is not wholly responsible but he must take a lot of the blame. He is not the only one culpable, the players are not playing anywhere near their best level. ""They won't be sad he's gone."" Broadcaster and Manchester United fan Sam Homewood, on the BBC News Channel:""It is better not to wait five more months if it is not going to work out. Football styles come and go and all the more successful teams around Europe are playing a more attacking game and I imagine some of the players are looking around and wishing that they could be freed up to play that way. ""I think Manchester United have been very fair in giving Mourinho time. ""Mauricio Pochettino is the favourite and then there is Zinedine Zidane, either of which would be very exciting choices.""

Dying man leaves girl 14 years of presents,"A family was left shocked to find their late elderly neighbour had left Christmas presents to give to their daughter for the next 14 years. Ken, who was in his late 80s, lived near to Owen and Caroline Williams in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, for the last two years. The couple said Ken ""doted"" on their two-year-old daughter Cadi. He died recently and on Monday evening, his daughter knocked on the Williams' home to deliver the presents. Two-year-old Cadi has presents to open for the next 14 years ""She was clutching this big bag plastic sack and I thought it was rubbish she was going to ask me to throw out,"" said Mr Williams. ""But she said it was everything her dad had put away for Cadi. It was all of the Christmas presents he had bought for her. School asks parents not to buy staff gifts The early Christmas gift many of us now buy Should we still be giving gift cards this Christmas? ""I brought it back in and my wife was on FaceTime to her mum in Ireland. My wife started to tear up and I started to tear up, and her mum started to tear up. ""It's difficult describing it because it was so unexpected. I don't know how long he put them away whether it was over the last two years or whether he bought them towards the end of his life."" Mr Williams said they have opened one of the presents which was a book but were not sure what to do about the rest. ""We can tell there's some books, there's three or four soft toys, maybe some Duplo,"" he added. Mr Williams said his neighbour - a retired commercial deep sea diver - was a ""real, real character"".

Members of banned Nazi group jailed,"Claudia Patatas and Adam Thomas were members of National Action after it was banned under terrorism laws in December 2016 A neo-Nazi couple who named their baby after Adolf Hitler and were convicted of being members of a banned terrorist group have been jailed. Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, from Banbury, were part of National Action and had ""a long history of violent racist beliefs"", a judge said. Birmingham Crown Court heard the couple gave their child the middle name Adolf in ""admiration"" of Hitler. Thomas was jailed for six years and six months, and Patatas for five years. In total six people were sentenced for being part of what Judge Melbourne Inman QC described as a group with ""horrific aims"". Daniel Bogunovic, 27, from Leicester, was convicted of being a member of the banned group after standing trial alongside the couple. Described by prosecutors as a ""committed National Action leader, propagandist and strategist"", he was jailed for six years and four months. The new parents and the neo-Nazi terror threat National Action co-founder confronted by the BBC YouTube attacked over Neo-Nazi video Darren Fletcher, 28, from Wolverhampton, Nathan Pryke, 27, from March, Cambridgeshire, and Joel Wilmore, 24, from Stockport, had previously pleaded guilty to being in the group. Fletcher, described by the judge as an ""extreme member"", was sentenced to five years. Pryke, the group's ""security enforcer"" was given five years and five months and Wilmore, the ""banker"" and ""cyber security"" specialist, was imprisoned for five years and 10 months. Daniel Bogunovic, (left), Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas were convicted in November Joel Wilmore (left), Nathan Pryke (centre) and Darren Fletcher admitted being in National Action before the trial began The judge said of National Action: ""Its aims and objectives are the overthrow of democracy in this country by serious violence and murder and the imposition of a Nazi-style state that would eradicate whole sections of society."" In sentencing Patatas, he added: ""You were equally as extreme as Thomas both in your views and actions. ""You acted together in all you thought, said and did, in the naming of your son and the disturbing photographs of your child, surrounded by symbols of Nazism and the Ku Klux Klan."" Thomas, a former Amazon security guard, and Patatas, a wedding photographer originally from Portugal, held hands and wept as they were sentenced. Last week, the court heard Fletcher had trained his toddler daughter to perform a Nazi salute and sent a message to Patatas saying ""finally got her to do it"". Jurors saw images of Thomas wearing Ku Klux Klan robes while cradling his baby, which he claimed were ""just play"" but he admitted being a racist. Adam Thomas said he first discovered a ""fascination"" with Ku Klux Klan aged 11 Thomas was also found guilty of having bomb making instructions for which he was given a two-year-and-six-month sentence which he will serve concurrently. A police search of the home he shared with Patatas uncovered machetes, knives and crossbows - one kept just a few feet from the baby's crib. Extremist-themed paraphernalia including pendants, flags and clothing emblazoned with symbols of the Nazi-era SS and National Action was also recovered. Among the items were a swastika-shaped pastry cutter and swastika scatter cushions. A swastika-shaped pastry cutter was found in the home of Patatas and Thomas The group was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24 It was intended to be an explicitly neo-Nazi party Raymond was a politics graduate from the University of Essex, and Davies was a Welsh former member of the British National Party National Action shunned democratic politics, regarding itself instead as a youth-based street movement It is believed it never had more than 100 members Its activities involved leafleting university campuses, aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations In 2015, 25-year-old member Zack Davies used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist and was jailed for attempted murder After the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, an official National Action Twitter account posted: ""Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad"" The group was banned later that year after the government concluded it was ""concerned in terrorism"" It became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two Fletcher was close friends with Thomas and Patatas Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said the defendants had taken part in National Action's chat groups, posting comments that showed ""virulent racism, particularly from Thomas, Patatas and Fletcher"". He added: ""Leaders Pryke, Wilmore and Bogunovic were more circumspect in their views but on occasion the true depth of their racial hatred leeched out."" He said a deleted Skype log recovered from Thomas's laptop stated that the ""Midlands branch"" of the neo-Nazi group would ""continue the fight alone"" after National Action disbanded after it was outlawed under anti-terror legislation in 2016. Following the sentencing, Det Ch Supt Matt Ward, of West Midlands Police, said: ""These sentences are the culmination of two years of painstaking work in the West Midlands and across the country to recognise and understand the threat of National Action. ""These individuals were not simply racist fantasists; we now know they were a dangerous, well-structured organisation. ""Their aim was to spread neo-Nazi ideology by provoking a race war in the UK and they had spent years acquiring the skills to carry this out. ""They had researched how to make explosives, they had gathered weapons and they had a clear structure to radicalise others. Unchecked they would have inspired violence and spread hatred and fear across the West Midlands.""

Russian cargo ship grounded off beach,"This video can not be played Grounded Russian cargo ship freed A 16,000-tonne Russian cargo ship ran aground off a beach in Cornwall. The Kuzma Minin grounded off Gyllyngvase Beach in Falmouth at about 05:40 GMT. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) declared a major incident and said the 590ft (180m) ship had a list of about five degrees. The massive vessel, which had 18 Russian crew members on board but no cargo, was refloated in a ""tricky and delicate"" operation at high tide. Three harbour tugs and a lifeboat towed the ship off the beach just after 14:00. Marc Thomas, senior coastal operations manager, said the coastguard had been forced to work ""really hard to manoeuvre the vessels"" during windy conditions. Latest news from Cornwall and on the Kuzma Minin An earlier attempt to refloat the ship failed after several tow ropes snapped Falmouth harbourmaster Mark Sansom said: ""This has been a successful and well co-ordinated operation involving multiple agencies. ""We would like to recognise the outstanding performance of the pilot and of all vessel crews involved in what was a very demanding incident. ""The Kuzma Minin has been taken to Falmouth Bay to anchor, in order for it to be inspected."" The coastguard said there had been no reports of any pollution. An earlier effort to refloat the ship failed when tow ropes snapped. A helicopter team winched coastguard members on to the ship earlier in order to check up on the Kuzma Minin's crew.

"UK 'still committed to migration target'A minister says the 100,000 target has not been ditched despite being left out of draft immigration laws.UK PoliticsComments","The government's target of reducing net migration to less than 100,000 a year has been left out of draft proposals for a new immigration system. But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said the government remained committed to the target. He said the aim was to get net migration down to ""sustainable"" levels. The final version of the much-delayed immigration plan, which aims to end free movement from the EU after Brexit, has yet to be agreed. Ministers had insisted it would be issued this week, before the Christmas break, but it is unclear if that will now happen as officials work round the clock to finalise the plans. UK firms 'fearful' for future migration system Immigration: Who should we let in after Brexit? UK migration steady despite EU arrivals dip The goal of cutting net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country - was introduced by David Cameron in 2011 and was a Conservative manifesto commitment at last year's general election. The BBC's Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said removing it from the immigration white paper would be a ""hugely symbolic step"". The government has never come close to meeting the target and has faced repeated calls to drop it. The number of EU citizens moving to the UK has fallen since Britain voted to leave the EU, but more people coming from elsewhere means the overall migration rate is unchanged and stands at 273,000 a year. Home Secretary Sajid Javid will reportedly use the immigration white paper to set out plans to cut net migration from the EU by as much as 80%. He wants to limit the number of low and medium-skilled workers coming to the UK from EU countries by saying they must earn at least Â£30,000 a year. But there will be no cap on the number of highly skilled workers, reports suggest. James Brokenshire: Government wants migration back to 1998 levels This will create a level playing field with immigration from outside the EU, the government says. But some businesses have warned of labour shortages, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark are arguing for the proposed Â£30,000 minimum salary for low-skilled workers to be reduced,according to The Daily Mail.,external By Political Reporter Brian Wheeler The Conservatives went into the 2010 general election with a pledge to return to the ""sustainable"" levels of net migration seen in the 1990s. David Cameron promised to meet the target ""no ifs, no buts"". But the idea has always had its critics. A country can only control how many people come in, not how many emigrate. And Mr Cameron only had limited control over those coming in anyway, because of EU free movement rules. But focusing on net migration did shift attention away from the far higher immigration figure - 630,000 in 2017 - which had previously dominated the headlines. Why did Cameron set migration target? Communities Secretary James Brokenshire refused to speculate on the contents of the draft white paper, which have been shown to the cabinet for the first time this week. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are committed to seeing net migration reduced to those sustainable numbers that we saw back before 1998 when it was less than 100,000."" He said the government had focused on that number ""because that is what is sustainable in the long-term"". Global employment consultancy Mercer has predicted a UK workforce shortage of 1.9 million by 2025, if the government remains committed to its 100,000 target and demand for labour continues to rise at the same rate as it has for the past 10 years. But the company claims there is an ""untapped"" workforce of 1.8 million UK-born workers, if firms started recruiting more workers aged over 50, women, and people with disabilities.

BA to resume flights to PakistanFlights will restart more than 10 years after it halted services following a major hotel bombing.Business,"Islamabad's new airport opened this year British Airways is to restart flights to Pakistan next year, more than 10 years after it halted services following a major hotel bombing. The airline stopped flying to the country after the Marriott hotel in the capital, Islamabad, was bombed in 2008, killing more than 50 people. BA will be the first Western airline,externalto resume services to the country. A new airport was opened recently in Islamabad, which has eased concerns about both security and congestion. The attack on the Marriott was one of the most high-profile attacks in Pakistan's history. Thomas Drew, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, said BA's return was a ""reflection of the great improvements"" in security. BA's Robert Williams said: ""It's exciting to be flying between Islamabad and Heathrow from next year, which we believe will be particularly popular with the British Pakistani community who want to visit, or be visited by, their relatives.""

Ceasefire takes effect in key Yemen port,"Pro-government forces and the Houthis (pictured) both say they are committed to the truce Fighting between Yemeni pro-government forces and Houthi rebels in the city of Hudaydah has reportedly subsided, after a ceasefire came into effect overnight. Skirmishes continued for several hours following the start of the UN-brokered truce at midnight (21:00 GMT), but locals now say it is relatively calm. UN envoy Martin Griffiths said the initiative seemed to be working so far. The battle for Hudaydah threatened the operation of its port, which is crucial to the delivery of aid supplies. Half of the war-torn country's population - 14 million people - are on the brink of famine and an estimated 85,000 children may have died from malnutrition. Why is there a war in Yemen? Why the battle for Hudaydah matters Can ceasefire deal bring peace? Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country, including the capital Sanaa, and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.

By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent, BBC News No-one expected the ceasefire to be smooth, simple, or straightforward. There is no trust between the warring sides. Both believe the other still wants a military solution. The key to this truce largely holding will be the UN's presence on the ground and its ability to enforce the gradual pull-out of all forces and put in place a new order. That is why Martin Griffiths has called for its ""swift"" deployment. Pressure from all the outside players in this war made this unexpected truce happen in a week of talks in Sweden. It is also essential if it is to hold. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, regarded as the architect of this war in Yemen, is said to be playing a key role in this shift from a military to a political push. But the risk of an all-out assault on Hudaydah and Yemen's descent into famine still looms, if it all fails. Millions of Yemenis are hoping against hope that it holds. The ceasefire covering the city of Hudaydah and the ports of Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Issa was first announced last week following talks in Sweden's capital, Stockholm.

Members of banned Nazi group jailedA couple who named their child Adolf in honour of Hitler are sentenced alongside a third defendant.Oxford,"Claudia Patatas and Adam Thomas were members of National Action after it was banned under terrorism laws in December 2016 A neo-Nazi couple who named their baby after Adolf Hitler and were convicted of being members of a banned terrorist group have been jailed. Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, from Banbury, were part of National Action and had ""a long history of violent racist beliefs"", a judge said. Birmingham Crown Court heard the couple gave their child the middle name Adolf in ""admiration"" of Hitler. Thomas was jailed for six years and six months, and Patatas for five years. In total six people were sentenced for being part of what Judge Melbourne Inman QC described as a group with ""horrific aims"". Daniel Bogunovic, 27, from Leicester, was convicted of being a member of the banned group after standing trial alongside the couple. Described by prosecutors as a ""committed National Action leader, propagandist and strategist"", he was jailed for six years and four months. The new parents and the neo-Nazi terror threat National Action co-founder confronted by the BBC YouTube attacked over Neo-Nazi video Darren Fletcher, 28, from Wolverhampton, Nathan Pryke, 27, from March, Cambridgeshire, and Joel Wilmore, 24, from Stockport, had previously pleaded guilty to being in the group. Fletcher, described by the judge as an ""extreme member"", was sentenced to five years. Pryke, the group's ""security enforcer"" was given five years and five months and Wilmore, the ""banker"" and ""cyber security"" specialist, was imprisoned for five years and 10 months. Daniel Bogunovic, (left), Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas were convicted in November Joel Wilmore (left), Nathan Pryke (centre) and Darren Fletcher admitted being in National Action before the trial began The judge said of National Action: ""Its aims and objectives are the overthrow of democracy in this country by serious violence and murder and the imposition of a Nazi-style state that would eradicate whole sections of society."" In sentencing Patatas, he added: ""You were equally as extreme as Thomas both in your views and actions. ""You acted together in all you thought, said and did, in the naming of your son and the disturbing photographs of your child, surrounded by symbols of Nazism and the Ku Klux Klan."" Thomas, a former Amazon security guard, and Patatas, a wedding photographer originally from Portugal, held hands and wept as they were sentenced. Last week, the court heard Fletcher had trained his toddler daughter to perform a Nazi salute and sent a message to Patatas saying ""finally got her to do it"". Jurors saw images of Thomas wearing Ku Klux Klan robes while cradling his baby, which he claimed were ""just play"" but he admitted being a racist. Adam Thomas said he first discovered a ""fascination"" with Ku Klux Klan aged 11 Thomas was also found guilty of having bomb making instructions for which he was given a two-year-and-six-month sentence which he will serve concurrently. A police search of the home he shared with Patatas uncovered machetes, knives and crossbows - one kept just a few feet from the baby's crib. Extremist-themed paraphernalia including pendants, flags and clothing emblazoned with symbols of the Nazi-era SS and National Action was also recovered. Among the items were a swastika-shaped pastry cutter and swastika scatter cushions. A swastika-shaped pastry cutter was found in the home of Patatas and Thomas The group was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24 It was intended to be an explicitly neo-Nazi party Raymond was a politics graduate from the University of Essex, and Davies was a Welsh former member of the British National Party National Action shunned democratic politics, regarding itself instead as a youth-based street movement It is believed it never had more than 100 members Its activities involved leafleting university campuses, aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations In 2015, 25-year-old member Zack Davies used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist and was jailed for attempted murder After the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, an official National Action Twitter account posted: ""Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad"" The group was banned later that year after the government concluded it was ""concerned in terrorism"" It became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two Fletcher was close friends with Thomas and Patatas Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said the defendants had taken part in National Action's chat groups, posting comments that showed ""virulent racism, particularly from Thomas, Patatas and Fletcher"". He added: ""Leaders Pryke, Wilmore and Bogunovic were more circumspect in their views but on occasion the true depth of their racial hatred leeched out."" He said a deleted Skype log recovered from Thomas's laptop stated that the ""Midlands branch"" of the neo-Nazi group would ""continue the fight alone"" after National Action disbanded after it was outlawed under anti-terror legislation in 2016. Following the sentencing, Det Ch Supt Matt Ward, of West Midlands Police, said: ""These sentences are the culmination of two years of painstaking work in the West Midlands and across the country to recognise and understand the threat of National Action. ""These individuals were not simply racist fantasists; we now know they were a dangerous, well-structured organisation. ""Their aim was to spread neo-Nazi ideology by provoking a race war in the UK and they had spent years acquiring the skills to carry this out. ""They had researched how to make explosives, they had gathered weapons and they had a clear structure to radicalise others. Unchecked they would have inspired violence and spread hatred and fear across the West Midlands.""

Are too many women being jailed?A woman 'lost everything' when she was jailed for child neglect amid mental health problems.Wales,"This video can not be played Mother ""lost everything"" to mental health A woman jailed for two years for neglecting her children believes it could have been avoided had she got the mental health support she needed. Her home was found to be knee-deep in rubbish, with cat and rodent droppings and no hot water or heating. TheCorston Report in 2007,externalsaid only high-risk women should be jailed. But a majority of Welsh women in prison are there for non-violent offences, while ministers have accepted short sentences are not generally beneficial. There are growing calls for assurances that the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) will fund at least one new women's centre in Wales, to give the courts more sentencing options. Dying in prison: Two women's stories Call for Wales to have a women's prison The MoJ said it wants to see fewer women serving short custodial sentences ""as evidence clearly shows that putting them into prison can do more harm than good for society"". 'I've lost everything' The mother, from south Wales, had suffered with depression for years but after an abusive relationship ended she was left isolated, struggling to cope alone and her mental health deteriorated. ""I hold my hands up, I did live like that and it was disgusting, but I also cleaned my act up, for the sake of making somewhere safe, happy and clean for [my children],"" said Louise, whose name has been changed to protect her children's identities. ""Louise"" says she has cleaned up her act and is getting help with her mental health ""I kept thinking to myself I know they can't live like this, but I physically could not pull myself out of it, to be able to sort everything else out. It still hurts now that I couldn't do it, it's something I'm very ashamed of."" In March 2018, she was given a two-year custodial sentence, which was later suspended by the Court of Appeal. By then she had already served 11 weeks in jail and had lost her council house. ""I've lost everything, I lost my house, all my possessions, I've self-harmed, I've cut myself to try and make myself feel nothing, just to go completely numb,"" she said. ""The help I'm getting now, if I'd got that four years ago I'd never have ended up in that situation."" In 2017, 87.4% of women given custodial sentences in Wales had committed non-violent offences - so offences other than violence, sexual offences, robbery, criminal damage, arson or possession of weapons; this figure compared to a rate of 74.7%  for men. A breakdown for 2016, shown above, shows a similar pattern. Between 2011 and 2016, the number of females given immediate custodial sentences in Wales increased by 18%. Around three quarters of all women in Wales sentenced to immediate custody were handed sentences of less than six months. Rhondda AM Leanne Wood, a former probation officer, said there needed to be as wide a number of sentencing options available as possible. ""I think we have to send fewer women to prison, generally, because when you look at the prison population you see people with chronic problems that need help and support,"" said the former Plaid Cymru leader. ""I accept some people need to be in a residential setting for their own safety - and perhaps for the safety of others -  but we're talking about a tiny number among the female offending population."" Women 'often ignored' in rehabilitation planning Some women prison terms 'unnecessary' Prof Kate Williams, from the Centre for Criminology at the University of South Wales, said judges need to be made more aware of the needs of women caught up in the criminal justice system. ""The punishment we typically give women is too harsh"", she said. ""Many of the problems that turn out to be criminal offending actually start because of issues they have to face and can't deal with, and we criminalise them for it, instead of trying to be a bit more understanding."" The number of females given immediate custodial sentences in Wales increased by 18% in the five years to 2016 A MoJ spokesperson said: ""We want to see fewer women serving short custodial sentences as evidence clearly shows that putting them into prison can do more harm than good for society, failing to cut the cycle of reoffending and often exacerbating already difficult family circumstances. ""Instead, we are shifting the focus to managing women in the community where they can access a wider range of support, for example helping them with substance misuse and mental health problems.""

UK 'still committed to migration target',"The government's target of reducing net migration to less than 100,000 a year has been left out of draft proposals for a new immigration system. But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said the government remained committed to the target. He said the aim was to get net migration down to ""sustainable"" levels. The final version of the much-delayed immigration plan, which aims to end free movement from the EU after Brexit, has yet to be agreed. Ministers had insisted it would be issued this week, before the Christmas break, but it is unclear if that will now happen as officials work round the clock to finalise the plans. UK firms 'fearful' for future migration system Immigration: Who should we let in after Brexit? UK migration steady despite EU arrivals dip The goal of cutting net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country - was introduced by David Cameron in 2011 and was a Conservative manifesto commitment at last year's general election. The BBC's Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said removing it from the immigration white paper would be a ""hugely symbolic step"". The government has never come close to meeting the target and has faced repeated calls to drop it. The number of EU citizens moving to the UK has fallen since Britain voted to leave the EU, but more people coming from elsewhere means the overall migration rate is unchanged and stands at 273,000 a year. Home Secretary Sajid Javid will reportedly use the immigration white paper to set out plans to cut net migration from the EU by as much as 80%. He wants to limit the number of low and medium-skilled workers coming to the UK from EU countries by saying they must earn at least Â£30,000 a year. But there will be no cap on the number of highly skilled workers, reports suggest. James Brokenshire: Government wants migration back to 1998 levels This will create a level playing field with immigration from outside the EU, the government says. But some businesses have warned of labour shortages, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark are arguing for the proposed Â£30,000 minimum salary for low-skilled workers to be reduced,according to The Daily Mail.,external By Political Reporter Brian Wheeler The Conservatives went into the 2010 general election with a pledge to return to the ""sustainable"" levels of net migration seen in the 1990s. David Cameron promised to meet the target ""no ifs, no buts"". But the idea has always had its critics. A country can only control how many people come in, not how many emigrate. And Mr Cameron only had limited control over those coming in anyway, because of EU free movement rules. But focusing on net migration did shift attention away from the far higher immigration figure - 630,000 in 2017 - which had previously dominated the headlines. Why did Cameron set migration target? Communities Secretary James Brokenshire refused to speculate on the contents of the draft white paper, which have been shown to the cabinet for the first time this week. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are committed to seeing net migration reduced to those sustainable numbers that we saw back before 1998 when it was less than 100,000."" He said the government had focused on that number ""because that is what is sustainable in the long-term"". Global employment consultancy Mercer has predicted a UK workforce shortage of 1.9 million by 2025, if the government remains committed to its 100,000 target and demand for labour continues to rise at the same rate as it has for the past 10 years. But the company claims there is an ""untapped"" workforce of 1.8 million UK-born workers, if firms started recruiting more workers aged over 50, women, and people with disabilities.

Cabinet considering no-deal Brexit plan,"The cabinet has decided to ""ramp up"" preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid uncertainty over the fate of Theresa May's proposed EU exit deal. It allocated to ministries Â£2bn set aside in case the UK leaves on 29 March without MPs having accepted any deal. Letters will be sent to 140,000 firms updating them on what they should do while 3,500 troops will be put on standby to help government departments. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said it amounted to ""psychological warfare"". With 101 days left until Brexit and many MPs still opposed to the government's withdrawal agreement, which MPs will vote on in mid-January, ministers met for a longer-than-normal two and a half hour meeting. Parliament Live: Rolling updates Brexit: A really simple guide They agreed that businesses should activate their own no deal contingency plans, as they think appropriate. Updated Revenue and Customs information packs will be sent to firms later this week, setting out what changes could be needed at the border. Consumers are being advised to familiarise themselves with advice published this summer, in areas ranging frombooking flightstousing credit cards, with more details promised in the coming weeks. Please upgrade your browser The Treasury said Â£480m of the Â£2bn of preparation funding would go to the Home Office, helping it to employ more Border Force officers and boost national security. Defra would receive Â£410m, allowing it to focus on ensuring the trade in fish, food products and chemicals remains uninterrupted. HMRC, which is being allocated Â£375m, plans to hire more than 3,000 new staff to handle increases in customs activities, as well as investing in new technology at borders. The next largest allocations will be Â£190m for the Department for Business and Â£128m for the Department for International Trade. Separately, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs that 3,500 military personnel, including logisticians and engineers as well as infantry units, were ready to be deployed if needed. About 10% of the force would be reservists who will receive their call up papers in the middle of January so that if needed they would be ready in March. In other developments: Theresa May is now thoughtto be in favour of giving MPs a vote on alternativesto her plans when they debate her Brexit deal The government'starget of reducing net migrationto less than 100,000 a year has been left out of draft proposals for a new immigration system A Labour motion of no confidence in Theresa May will not be tabled until January The Daily Telegraph published a letter by 53 business leaders,external, including ex-Sainsbury's boss Justin King and Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis, have called on the PM to ""take her deal to the British people"". Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the cabinet had agreed that ""preparing for a no deal will be an operational priority within government but our overall priority is to secure a deal"". This video can not be played James Brokenshire tells Today the government has been preparing for a no deal ""for some time"" He said no-deal planning ""needs to be much more of a priority for businesses"" and there would be a ""significant increase"" in the guidance issued to them over the next 14 weeks, as Brexit day approaches. E-mails will be sent out to 80,000 of those businesses most like to be affected over the next few days. In the autumn of 2017, The Treasury earmarked Â£3bn for no-deal planning between 2018 and 2020. In March, Chancellor Philip Hammond said half of that had been allocated to 20 government departments, with the Home Office, transport, the environment and business among the largest recipients. At Tuesday's cabinet meeting ministers approved the second tranche - plus an under-spend from the current year - to go to departments for the 2019/20 year, with the priority areas being borders, security and international trade. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already ordered full ""no deal"" planning across the National Health Service, he told the BBC's Newsnight on Monday. But Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, criticised UK ministers, who he said were ""glorifying"" the prospect of leaving without a comprehensive deal in the hope individual agreements could be reached in areas like transport and livestock movements.

And Labour said a no-deal exit was ""not viable"" and it would work with other parties to stop it. ""It is testament to the prime minister's failure in these negotiations that the government is now spending billions of pounds of taxpayers' money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that is rejected by Parliament and many of those sat around the Cabinet table,"" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. And the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for another referendum, said the government was ""attempting to scare"" MPs, businesses and the public with the threat of a no-deal. ""Theresa May is irresponsibly trying to run down the clock so that the only option is to support her discredited deal,"" Sir Vince Cable said.

The deal will only come into force if both the UK and European parliaments approve it. The BBC understands Mrs May is planning to use the Commons vote as a ""moment of reckoning"" for the Brexit process. Sources have told the BBC that Downing Street will not stand in the way of MPs who seek to amend the government's motion on the Brexit deal to put forward potential alternatives. The prime minister was previously thought to be against this idea. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to push for a further vote of no-confidence in the government as a whole. On Monday night, the Labour leader tabled a motion calling on MPs to declare they have no confidence in the prime minister because she failed to have a vote on her Brexit deal straight away. Reality Check: What is the government spending on Brexit preparations? Kuenssberg: Parliamentary shenanigans Q&A: The backstop Brexit: What could happen next? No 10 has refused to make time for the motion and Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed on Tuesday that there were under no obligation to do so. Other parties - the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - have called on Mr Corbyn to push for a no-confidence vote against the government as a whole. Unlike a vote aimed at the prime minister, the government would have to allow a vote on this motion and, if successful, it could force a general election. This video can not be played Could there be a second Brexit vote? Northern Ireland's DUP, whose votes the Conservative government has relied on in big votes since the June 2017 election, said they would not support Labour. Mrs May also appeared to have the support of pro-Brexit backbench critics who last week failed in a bid to oust her as Tory leader. One of them, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he would never vote against Mrs May or a Conservative government. He said on Tuesday evening that he had a ""civilised and courteous"" meeting with the PM, and that the government was ""prudent"" to engage in no-deal planning.

How EU does second referendums,"This video can not be played Could there be a second Brexit vote? Another week goes by, and there's more Brexit confusion, and heightened calls for a second referendum. Prime Minister Theresa May has warned such a vote would ""break faith with the British people"", but campaigners argue it may be the only way to solve the deadlock which is currently gripping Parliament. Is it right to ask voters to take a view on the same issue more than once? If so, what circumstances should be proffered as a reason? And do people really change their minds in a matter of months - with a slight adjustment of terms, or a little more information - or does it take years and a substantial shift in culture or demographics? A few countries in Europe have had that experience when a first referendum on a European Union issue didn't quite go the way the government of the day expected. So what did these countries do  - and can the UK learn anything from its neighbours? How could another Brexit referendum work? Ireland - unlike all other members of the EU - is legally obliged to put treaties to a vote before they can be implemented because they need to change their written constitution. But because EU treaties have to be unanimous, a ""no"" vote also means the treaty cannot take effect anywhere else, which throws a bit of a spanner in the works. What were they deciding? Irish voters have twice rejected EU treaties. In 2001, it was the Treaty of Nice - which amended the Maastricht Treaty and sought to prepare the institutions of the EU for its anticipated enlargement. Then, seven years later, it was the turn of the Lisbon Treaty, which was an attempt to streamline the EU. How did they vote? Just 35% turned out to vote on the Treaty of Nice in 2001, with 54% backing ""no"". In 2008, with the Lisbon Treaty, turnout was higher at 53%. However, the Irish once again rejected the change by 53.4% to 46.6%. What happened next In both cases, Ireland changed its mind. In October 2002, more than 62% voted to back the Treaty of Nice on a turnout of almost 50%. Changing the people's minds would literally come down to vigorous campaigning and an amendment which promised to keep Ireland out of any future common European defence force. The Lisbon Treaty was rejected in the 2008 vote It also contained a proviso that any further votes on the Nice treaty would go through a parliamentary vote rather than a referendum. And in 2009, just 16 months after the first attempt - with turnout just 5% higher - 67% of the country backed the Lisbon Treaty. EU leaders - desperate to keep the treaty alive - had returned to the drawing board, and added what were described as important safeguards by the Irish. Read more:Ireland and the EU - a special case What were they deciding? The French were given the vote on the draft EU constitution in 2005. How did they vote? Almost 55% rejected the proposed constitution when it went to the ballot box in May 2005, despite the country's leaders campaigning for the ""yes"" vote. What happened next? After voters in France and the Netherlands rejected the constitution, EU leaders returned to the drawing board and came up with the Lisbon Treaty. In many ways, it was similar to the constitution. However, instead of replacing the previous treaties, it was an amendment. Despite the similarities, and support for a second referendum, the French government decided against putting the treaty forward for a vote. Seven thoughts on a second EU referendum When is Brexit crunch time? How could another Brexit referendum work? Instead, they opted to put it to France's MPs and senators, who met in a special congress at Versailles in February 2008. This time, the vote passed easily, by 560 to 181, with a number of MPs abstaining. What were they deciding? Norwegians were asked back in 1972 whether they wanted to join the EU - then known as the European Economic Community. How did they vote? They rejected it, with 53.5% voting against joining. What happened next? It was another 22 years before the Norwegians were asked again whether or not they wanted to become an EU member. In theory, the country's demographic and the nature of the EU itself had changed in that time - potentially leaving space for a different answer. It wasn't to be. This time, 52.2% rejected membership. But, despite the tightening margin and polls which at points have suggested the country is becoming more pro-EU, there has been no third attempt to join. What were the Danes deciding? It seems in the case of the Danish, it could be a case of once bitten, twice shy when it comes to potentially divisive referendums. It goes back to 1992, when the Maastricht Treaty - which created the European Union and the single currency - was put to a vote in the northern European state. How did they vote? Just more than half - 50.7% - rejected the treaty, on a turnout of 83.1%. What happened next? A number of amendments were made, including exempting them from adopting the euro, and the referendum was held again. This time, with turnout more than 3% higher, 56.7% voted in favour of the treaty. More than a decade after the rejection - and then acceptance - of the Maastricht Treaty, Denmark watched as France and the Netherlands rejected the European constitution. So, it made a decision: rather than risk a No vote, no referendum was held at all on either the constitution, or the Lisbon treaty which followed. However, it should be noted they weren't the only ones to back out of the vote. Countries like the UK also backed out of a vote on the constitution, with - as mentioned above - only Ireland allowing a vote on the Lisbon Treaty. How could another Brexit referendum work?

'We were one bill away from disaster',"Cindy Toth dipped into an overdraft to pay for an emergency but, like millions of people in the UK, she then found it tough to climb back out. She said daily overdraft charges meant her family had nothing to spend after rent and grocery bills and were ""one bill from financial disaster"". Newly-announced plans on overdrafts would end this kind of charging. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants banks to charge a single interest rate for all types of overdraft. Banks would set a single rate for going into the red and customers would be able to compare banks for the best deal. The FCA, the City regulator, is also proposing a ban on any fixed fees linked to an overdraft. The body that represents UK banks, UK Finance, said it would consider the proposals carefully. One analyst has suggested the FCA's plans could hasten the end of ""free banking"". Young and in the red: Personal debt in five charts Millions miss bills as finances bite How debt kills Mrs Toth, who is married and in her 40s, said she had used her arranged overdraft as it was intended - to cover an unexpected cost which, in her case, was flights to the US for a funeral. However, she was then made redundant and the debt was never paid off. Each month the family would go up to Â£4,500 into the red. The crunch came when her bank - Barclays - switched from an overdraft interest rate to a daily fee for going overdrawn. She said that increased the typical monthly bill from Â£30 to Â£90. She said the extra charges meant she was worrying about other costs including buying school shoes for her son and paying a plumber's bill. ""It meant no family holidays, and no Christmas presents exchanged with my husband. It is mentally and emotionally difficult. You just feel that you are treading water the whole time."" Barclays has always said there are options for account holders in such a situation, but Mrs Toth said the bank's offer to switch the overdraft into a loan did not suit their financial plight. Eventually, the family came into some inheritance, immediately paid off the overdrafts, and it means this is the first Christmas for years that the couple will be giving each other Christmas gifts. There are arranged overdrafts, when current account holders borrow up to a limit agreed with, or offered by, the bank. About 19 million people use one each year. Some banks also have unarranged overdrafts, with extra or higher charges for going beyond this limit or going into the red without permission, used by 14 million people a year. Those aged 35 to 44 are most likely to have some form of overdraft, and about 10% of all 18 to 24-year-olds have exceeded their overdraft limit in the past 12 months. For customers, the charges and fees are difficult to compare - with a mix of interest rates, daily fees, or monthly fees among banks. Those costs could be high even with a small debt. For example, someone could be charged Â£5 a day for borrowing Â£100 overdraft. The majority of unarranged overdraft charges are paid by only 1.5% of customers. They pay about Â£450 a year in fees and charges, according to the FCA. On average, consumers in more deprived areas paid twice as much in charges for unarranged overdrafts than consumers living in less deprived areas, the FCA found. The overdraft system would be overhauled, in what the FCA calls the ""biggest intervention in the overdraft market for a generation"". Instead of arranged and unarranged overdrafts, the regulator is proposing a simple, single interest rate for customers going into an overdraft. There would no longer be any monthly or daily fees - like the ones charged to Mrs Toth. Under the plans, banks would have to advertise their overdraft rate as a single annual interest rate, or APR. They would also be encouraged to explain that cost in pounds and pence. A series of alerts and calculators would have to be offered to customers, and banks must identify anyone who looks as though they are getting into financial trouble and help them. Banks will still be able to refuse to make a payment if a customer does not have the funds to cover it, but any resulting fee for the customer must reflect that cost. The same is true of a letter sent to inform someone they are overdrawn - the bank can charge for the letter, but only Â£2 or so. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive, said the regulator's ""radical"" proposals would ""make overdrafts simpler, fairer, and easier to manage"", but UK Finance is opposed to ending the difference between the two types of overdraft. ""It is important however that individuals are still able to use unarranged overdrafts where appropriate. UK Finance members have been working with the regulator to explore new ways to better identify and support customers with repeat overdraft use,"" said Eric Leenders, from the trade body. Initially the cost of overdrafts compared to old arranged overdraft rates could be higher as banks take a hit on their income. The FCA, which wants the changes to come into force by December 2019, said it would expect banks to start competing on their overdraft rate in the longer term. That could push down costs, if customers switch banks. UK Finance said the personal current account market was already ""highly competitive"". Analyst Andrew Hagger, from Moneycomms, said that ""the end of free banking could become much more of a reality"" because of the FCA proposals, as banks could start charging a monthly fee to everyone with a current account. He said: ""It will be interesting to see how the banks react - will they charge sky high interest rates for overdrafts, instead of hiding behind complex tariffs or will they look to recoup lost revenue by charging monthly fees?"" However, Christopher Woolard, of the FCA, said the regulator expected free banking to continue as there were still major advantages for banks in doing so. A longer term challenge to free banking could come when major technology companies entered the sector. The FCA is no stranger to price caps. It is introducinga rule for so-called rent-to-own productsthat means, from April 2019, customers will pay no more in interest than the cost of the product itself. Campaigners have saida cap on the cost of payday loans, introduced by the FCA in 2015, should be a template for overdrafts. However, financial regulators have a chequered history when attempting to put a cap on overdraft charges. In 2009, the Supreme Court overturned earlier court rulings that allowed the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the fairness of charges for unauthorised overdrafts. In effect, this halted more than a million claims from bank customers for refunds of unarranged overdraft fees. The FCA said the new proposals were a more appropriate way to deal with the problems with overdraft. How much debt do UK households have?

'Major incident' as lorries topple on ferry,"This video can not be played Footage filmed inside the ferry shows several lorries had toppled like dominos A man caught up in a ""major incident"" on a ferry from Northern Ireland to Scotland has described how a ""big dip"" caused lorries to topple over. Emergency services were called out to Cairnryan at about 07:40 after severe weather hit the service from Larne.

Police said the port would be shut for some time. They said anyone planning on sailing should only travel ""if absolutely necessary"".

He said: ""We got on the ferry about half four and it was a wee bit rough and choppy coming along. ""About halfway across it sort of went into a big dip and came back out of it and that is when all the wrecking took place. ""After that the boat was sort of capsizing over a wee bit, leaning over a wee bit.""

Are too many women being jailed?,"This video can not be played Mother ""lost everything"" to mental health A woman jailed for two years for neglecting her children believes it could have been avoided had she got the mental health support she needed. Her home was found to be knee-deep in rubbish, with cat and rodent droppings and no hot water or heating. TheCorston Report in 2007,externalsaid only high-risk women should be jailed. But a majority of Welsh women in prison are there for non-violent offences, while ministers have accepted short sentences are not generally beneficial. There are growing calls for assurances that the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) will fund at least one new women's centre in Wales, to give the courts more sentencing options. Dying in prison: Two women's stories Call for Wales to have a women's prison The MoJ said it wants to see fewer women serving short custodial sentences ""as evidence clearly shows that putting them into prison can do more harm than good for society"". 'I've lost everything' The mother, from south Wales, had suffered with depression for years but after an abusive relationship ended she was left isolated, struggling to cope alone and her mental health deteriorated. ""I hold my hands up, I did live like that and it was disgusting, but I also cleaned my act up, for the sake of making somewhere safe, happy and clean for [my children],"" said Louise, whose name has been changed to protect her children's identities. ""Louise"" says she has cleaned up her act and is getting help with her mental health ""I kept thinking to myself I know they can't live like this, but I physically could not pull myself out of it, to be able to sort everything else out. It still hurts now that I couldn't do it, it's something I'm very ashamed of."" In March 2018, she was given a two-year custodial sentence, which was later suspended by the Court of Appeal. By then she had already served 11 weeks in jail and had lost her council house. ""I've lost everything, I lost my house, all my possessions, I've self-harmed, I've cut myself to try and make myself feel nothing, just to go completely numb,"" she said. ""The help I'm getting now, if I'd got that four years ago I'd never have ended up in that situation."" In 2017, 87.4% of women given custodial sentences in Wales had committed non-violent offences - so offences other than violence, sexual offences, robbery, criminal damage, arson or possession of weapons; this figure compared to a rate of 74.7%  for men. A breakdown for 2016, shown above, shows a similar pattern. Between 2011 and 2016, the number of females given immediate custodial sentences in Wales increased by 18%. Around three quarters of all women in Wales sentenced to immediate custody were handed sentences of less than six months. Rhondda AM Leanne Wood, a former probation officer, said there needed to be as wide a number of sentencing options available as possible. ""I think we have to send fewer women to prison, generally, because when you look at the prison population you see people with chronic problems that need help and support,"" said the former Plaid Cymru leader. ""I accept some people need to be in a residential setting for their own safety - and perhaps for the safety of others -  but we're talking about a tiny number among the female offending population."" Women 'often ignored' in rehabilitation planning Some women prison terms 'unnecessary' Prof Kate Williams, from the Centre for Criminology at the University of South Wales, said judges need to be made more aware of the needs of women caught up in the criminal justice system. ""The punishment we typically give women is too harsh"", she said. ""Many of the problems that turn out to be criminal offending actually start because of issues they have to face and can't deal with, and we criminalise them for it, instead of trying to be a bit more understanding."" The number of females given immediate custodial sentences in Wales increased by 18% in the five years to 2016 A MoJ spokesperson said: ""We want to see fewer women serving short custodial sentences as evidence clearly shows that putting them into prison can do more harm than good for society, failing to cut the cycle of reoffending and often exacerbating already difficult family circumstances. ""Instead, we are shifting the focus to managing women in the community where they can access a wider range of support, for example helping them with substance misuse and mental health problems.""

Energy plans may cut ÃÂ£45 a year from bills,"Energy regulator Ofgem is proposing to cut consumers' bills by Â£45 a year from 2021, largely by reducing the rate of returns to investors. Ofgem wants to set the returns at 4% - about 50% lower than under the previous price controls - to save Â£30 a year. The other Â£15 would come from November proposals to reform network charges. Ofgem's plans for revising the energy system would also help customers benefit from new technology such as electric vehicles and renewables. An Ofgem spokesman told the BBC: ""In essence, we are basically reducing the amount of money firms can earn for transporting electricity and gas to your home."" The regulator also wants to offer incentives for electric vehicle owners to be able to charge their cars outside the evening peak time - potentially with a smart charger while parked at work. And it wants to bring in a new system to make more efficient use of grid capacity, possibly by sharing it between different users. Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem executive director for systems and networks,told BBC Radio 4's Today programmethe plans were important because ""our energy system is changing"". He added: ""People in the future may well want to charge their electric cars and install solar panels on their houses and communities may even want to build their own wind farms. What we need is a system that supports this at least possible cost. ""Our job is to look after the long-term interests of consumers and strike a fair deal between their shareholders and those consumers. ""For example, if we have a system where the way we could connect electric cars is more flexible - that allows us to move demand, that means we have to build fewer wires, which means a lower investment overall."" Energy bills to be capped in new year Price cap will be good deal for customers, says Ofgem boss Ofgem orders energy firms to improve complaints handling The proposals produced a mixed response from groups associated with the industry National Grid said it was ""disappointed"" with the proposals. ""In order to deliver the major capital programme required across our networks in a rapidly-changing market, we need to ensure the regulatory framework also provides for fair returns to shareholders and enables us to continue to deliver world-class networks for consumers."" However, Citizens Advice was much happier with the plans. Its chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""Energy network companies have had it too good for too long. Ofgem's commitment to a tougher price control should curb the excess profits networks have been allowed to make. ""This is good news for people as this should result in lower bills.""

"Yemen ceasefire 'broken within minutes'A truce agreed at UN-brokered talks last week was violated almost immediately, officials say.Middle East","Pro-government forces and the Houthis (pictured) both say they are committed to the truce Fighting between Yemeni pro-government forces and Houthi rebels in the city of Hudaydah has reportedly subsided, after a ceasefire came into effect overnight. Skirmishes continued for several hours following the start of the UN-brokered truce at midnight (21:00 GMT), but locals now say it is relatively calm. UN envoy Martin Griffiths said the initiative seemed to be working so far. The battle for Hudaydah threatened the operation of its port, which is crucial to the delivery of aid supplies. Half of the war-torn country's population - 14 million people - are on the brink of famine and an estimated 85,000 children may have died from malnutrition. Why is there a war in Yemen? Why the battle for Hudaydah matters Can ceasefire deal bring peace? Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country, including the capital Sanaa, and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent, BBC News No-one expected the ceasefire to be smooth, simple, or straightforward. There is no trust between the warring sides. Both believe the other still wants a military solution. The key to this truce largely holding will be the UN's presence on the ground and its ability to enforce the gradual pull-out of all forces and put in place a new order. That is why Martin Griffiths has called for its ""swift"" deployment. Pressure from all the outside players in this war made this unexpected truce happen in a week of talks in Sweden. It is also essential if it is to hold. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, regarded as the architect of this war in Yemen, is said to be playing a key role in this shift from a military to a political push. But the risk of an all-out assault on Hudaydah and Yemen's descent into famine still looms, if it all fails. Millions of Yemenis are hoping against hope that it holds. The ceasefire covering the city of Hudaydah and the ports of Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Issa was first announced last week following talks in Sweden's capital, Stockholm. But it had to be delayed by several days because of fierce fighting. The Houthis, who control the city and ports, and Yemen's government, whose forces are deployed to the south and east, have said they are now committed to abiding by the truce. This video can not be played Yemen: Where children rummage through rubbish for food There were sporadic clashes along the front lines in Hudaydah city between 01:00 and 02:00 on Tuesday, with Yemeni officials accusing the Houthis of carrying out artillery strikes. However, residents said that by dawn the skirmishes had ended. ""The problem is that the forces have yet to disengage, and when they're close up to each other they are liable to respond to anything they see as a provocation or an alert,"" Mr Griffiths told the BBC. ""So we can expect some of this happening, but the pattern is a positive one."" Hudaydah is the main port for Yemen's shattered import-dependent economy A co-ordinator for MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res, Susana Borges, said hospitals it supported in Hudaydah were continuing to receive patients. The UN has warned that in a worst-case scenario, the battle for Hudaydah could cost up to 250,000 lives and cut off aid supplies to millions elsewhere. Its port is the principal lifeline for about two-thirds of Yemen's population, which is almost totally reliant on imports. Under the Stockholm Agreement,once the ceasefire takes effect a ""mutual redeployment of forces"" shall be carried out from the city and ports ""to agreed-upon locations outside"",external. Mr Griffiths said that the UN would convene, possibly on Wednesday, the first meeting of the Redeployment Co-ordination Committee, which will monitor implementation. It will include members of the warring parties and be chaired by the retired Dutch general, Patrick Cammaert. The first phase of the redeployment will see troops withdraw from the ports and critical parts of the city associated with humanitarian facilities within two weeks and the UN taking a ""leading role"". The full redeployment of all forces from the region should be completed within three weeks of the ceasefire entering into effect. Mr Griffiths said this would include complete disengagement from the main road from Hudaydah to the capital Sanaa, which is crucial for the delivery of humanitarian supplies to the wider population. The Stockholm Agreement should also see a prisoner swap and the facilitation of aid deliveries to the city of Taiz, which is besieged by the Houthis. At least 6,660 civilians have been killed, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1 million people.

"US poacher sentenced to watch BambiDavid Berry Jr, jailed for illegally killing deer, must watch the Disney film Bambi once a month.US & Canada","David Berry Jr must watch the film once a month every month he is in prison A poacher has been ordered to watch the Disney film Bambi repeatedly after he was convicted of illegally killing ""hundreds"" of deer. Missouri hunter David Berry Jr must view the film at least once a month during his year-long sentence. He was arrested in August along with two family members for killing the deer, taking their heads and leaving their bodies to rot, prosecutors said. It is reportedly one of the biggest poaching cases in Missouri history. On top of the jail sentence for the illegal deer hunting, Judge Robert George ordered Berry Jr to ""view the Walt Disney movie Bambi, with the first viewing being on or before December 23, 2018, and at least one such viewing each month thereafter,"" during his spell in prison. The 1942 cartoon about woodland creatures shows a hunter kill the mother of eponymous deer character Bambi. Prosecutors believed ""several hundred"" deer could have been killed A months-long investigation spanning several states led to the arrest of Berry Jr, his father David Berry Sr and his brother Kyle Berry,according to local newspaper the Springfield News-Leader,external. While the total number of deer taken illegally is unknown, Lawrence County's conservation agent Andy Barnes said it could be ""several hundred"". Berry Jr received a year-long sentence in Lawrence County prison after pleading guilt to illegally taking wildlife. He has also been sentenced to a 120-day term in Barton County prison for a firearms probation violation, and both he and his father had their hunting privileges revoked for life by the Missouri Conservation Commission.

Cameron 'advising PM',"David Cameron quit in the aftermath of the 2016 referendum, which he was instrumental in calling Theresa May has rejected reports she is taking advice from her predecessor David Cameron on what to do in event of a Brexit deadlock in Parliament. Sources have told the BBC the former PM has been in touch with Mrs May about giving the Commons a ""greater role"" if her proposed deal is vetoed by MPs. Some ministers want alternatives to her deal to be considered and voted upon. But Mrs May told MPs that the last time she had spoken to her predecessor was in the middle of November. Asked about it in the Commons by Lib Dem Layla Moran, the prime minister said she had spoken to Mr Cameron and another former prime minister ""as a matter of courtesy"" when the UK's Brexit agreement with the EU was finalised on 14 November. May sets January date for MPs' Brexit vote Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit vote: What could happen next? Mr Cameron was ""not advising"" her, she told MPs. However, the BBC understands the two exchanged a brief text message on Wednesday, when Mrs May survived a confidence vote of Conservative MPs. Mrs May has announced that MPs' vote on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, which was postponed last week, will now take place in the week of 14 January. She said she was focused on getting MPs' support for her agreement and there were ""no plans"" for MPs to be given the opportunity to express their views on possible alternatives. But the BBC understands Mr Cameron has spoken to the prime minister about the matter, and how a series of ""indicative votes"" on various different Brexit outcomes may be handled if her deal is rejected. In a rare public comment on the Brexit process last week, Mr Cameron, who campaigned to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum and quit after the public voted to leave, said he supported the prime minister but was ""worried"" by signs that Parliament was not willing to approve her deal. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - the deal sets out the terms of exit and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations between the UK and the EU. But it only comes into force if the UK and European Parliaments approve it. In a statement to MPs updating them on Thursday's talks with European leaders, Mrs May said holding another referendum on Europe, as some have suggested, would ""break faith with the British people"". The prime minister has signalled MPs will vote on the deal during the week of 14 January, after resuming debate the previous week. Labour and other opposition parties, as well as some Tory Brexiteers, say a decision is needed now, so alternative options can be considered if Mrs May's deal is rejected. But the BBC's Norman Smith said it was not clear how they could force a vote any earlier. Potential ""Plan B"" options include: pursuing differentNorwayorCanada-stylearrangements with the EU leaving on the basis of a""managed no deal"" delaying Brexit to restart negotiations holda fresh referendum The PM is coming under pressure from cabinet ministers to ""test the will of Parliament"" through a series of ""indicative"" non-binding votes - which would see MPs pass judgement on the options available in the hope of identifying the most popular and shaping the way forward. The most recent examples of this happening were a series of votes on proposed reforms to the House of Lords in 2003 and 2007 - when all the propositions were rejected. Please upgrade your browser Business Secretary Greg Clark told the BBC that he backed Mrs May's deal but if Parliament was implacably opposed, it should then be ""invited to say what it would agree with"". Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd made the same point, saying ""all options"" should remain on the table and if the deal was rejected ""let's think about how we test the will of Parliament to find out where the majority is"". This video can not be played Could there be a second Brexit vote? But International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who has previously backed the idea of MPs having a free vote (ie not being told how to vote by their party leaders) on the EU agreement, said the referendum showed people had decided they wanted to leave. ""We asked the people to decide, they decided... that means we can't come up with something else in Parliament,"" she said. Calls for another referendum have grown in recent weeks amid signs a majority of MPs are opposed both to the deal on the table, but also leaving the EU without any kind of agreement. Reality Check: How could new referendum work? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? 'Delay to Brexit' if UK wants new deal Dame Margaret Beckett, a former foreign secretary who is a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a fresh referendum, said the case was becoming ""overwhelming"" and was ""the best way forward for our country"". ""A new public vote would be different from the referendum in 2016 because we now know more about what Brexit means,"" she said. ""Any effort to force Brexit over the line without checking that it has the continued consent of the British people will only reinforce divisions."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Mrs May told MPs that another vote ""would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver"". She added: ""Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further divide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it."" The PM, who survived a vote of no confidence in her leadership by Conservative MPs last week, told MPs that she had made progress in allaying the concerns of MPs about the controversial ""backstop"" plan to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if no trade deal is reached. At last week's summit, she said the EU had been clear that there was ""no plot"" to trap the UK indefinitely in the backstop. The other 27 EU members, she added, were committed to using their best endeavours to begin talks on their future relationship with the UK immediately after the UK's exit and to try to conclude them by the end of 2020. Talks over obtaining further ""political and legal assurances"" were continuing, she said, although the EU has suggested that it had provided the necessary clarification and no further meetings were on the agenda. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said her deal was now ""dead in the water"" and the prime minister had ""utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes"".

Stroking babies 'provides pain relief'A study monitored the brain activity of babies when they had a blood test while being stroked.Health,"Gently stroking a baby reduces activity in their brain associated with painful experiences, a study has found. The study, by University of Oxford and Liverpool John Moores University, monitored the brain activity of 32 babies while they had blood tests. Half were stroked with a soft brush beforehand and they showed 40% less pain activity in their brain. Author Rebeccah Slater said: ""Touch seems to have analgesic potential without the risk of side-effects."" The study found that the optimal pain-reducing stroking speed was about 3cm (1in) per second. ""Parents intuitively stroke their babies at this optimal velocity,"" said Prof Slater. ""If we can better understand the neurobiological underpinnings of techniques like infant massage, we can improve the advice we give to parents on how to comfort their babies."" That speed of stroking activates a class of sensory neurons in the skin called C-tactile afferents, which have been previously been shown to reduce pain in adults. But it had been unclear whether babies had the same response or whether it developed over time. ""There was evidence to suggest that C-tactile afferents can be activated in babies and that slow, gentle touch can evoke changes in brain activity in infants,"" said Prof Slater. Prof Slater said the study, published inCurrent Biology,external, could explain anecdotal evidence of the soothing power of touch-based practices such as infant massage andkangaroo care, where premature babies are held against the skin to encourage parent-infant bonding and possibly reduce pain. ""Previous work has shown that touch may increase parental bonding, decrease stress for both the parents and the baby, and reduce the length of hospital stay,"" said Prof Slater. The study authors now plan to repeat their experiment in premature babies, whose sensory pathways are still developing. Caroline Lee-Davey, chief executive at the premature and sick baby charity Bliss welcomed the research. ""We already know that positive touch - such as skin-to-skin care - makes a real difference directly to babies in neonatal care and also helps parents to bond with their baby. ""This new research suggests that parental touch could also help to alleviate pain in infants and Bliss is delighted to be funding Oxford University to do more research specifically on reducing pain in premature babies through the use of parental touch, from the new year. ""Many people do not realise just how many medical procedures a baby in neonatal care goes through during their hospital stay. ""Anything that can reduce a baby's discomfort is a huge step forward in this underfunded area of research.""

Court frees woman jailed over childbirth,"Imelda Cortez spent more than 18 months in custody as she awaited trial A woman who was jailed for attempted murder under El Salvador's strict anti-abortion laws has been freed. Imelda Cortez, 20, says she became pregnant by her stepfather who sexually abused her for many years. Doctors suspected she had tried to perform an abortion after she gave birth to a baby girl in a latrine in April of last year. The child survived, but Ms Cortez was arrested and spent more than 18 months in custody as she awaited trial. Prosecutors argued that her failure to tell anyone about the pregnancy and seek medical help after giving birth amounted to attempted murder, which carries a possible 20-year sentence. But on Monday a court ruled that Ms Cortez, who was unaware that she was pregnant, had not tried to kill her child. El Salvador's total abortion ban 'lethal' El Salvador country profile Her lawyers said that to avoid a harsher sentence she had admitted to neglecting her newborn baby, an offence that carries a one-year jail term. But the court ultimately decided that she was not guilty of any crime and was free to go home. ""This sentence... represents hope for women who are still in prison and are also being tried for aggravated homicide,"" defence lawyer Ana Martinez told reporters following the verdict. Supporters of Ms Cortez celebrate following her release Ms Cortez was greeted outside the court in UsulutÃ¡n by cheering relatives and human rights activists bearing signs with messages of support. Prosecutors say her stepfather has been arrested and is awaiting trial. El Salvador is one of a handful of countries in the world where abortions are completely banned and carry heavy sentences. While the country is not alone in Latin America in having a total ban on abortions, it is particularly strict in the way it enforces it. Woman free after 15-year term for abortion Doctors have to inform the authorities if they think a woman has tried to end her pregnancy. If they fail to report such cases, they too could face long sentences in jail. The result is what human rights groups are calling a criminalisation of miscarriages and medical emergencies, with more than 100 people convicted of abortion-related crimes in El Salvador since 2000.

Stroking babies 'provides pain relief',"Gently stroking a baby reduces activity in their brain associated with painful experiences, a study has found. The study, by University of Oxford and Liverpool John Moores University, monitored the brain activity of 32 babies while they had blood tests. Half were stroked with a soft brush beforehand and they showed 40% less pain activity in their brain. Author Rebeccah Slater said: ""Touch seems to have analgesic potential without the risk of side-effects."" The study found that the optimal pain-reducing stroking speed was about 3cm (1in) per second. ""Parents intuitively stroke their babies at this optimal velocity,"" said Prof Slater. ""If we can better understand the neurobiological underpinnings of techniques like infant massage, we can improve the advice we give to parents on how to comfort their babies."" That speed of stroking activates a class of sensory neurons in the skin called C-tactile afferents, which have been previously been shown to reduce pain in adults. But it had been unclear whether babies had the same response or whether it developed over time. ""There was evidence to suggest that C-tactile afferents can be activated in babies and that slow, gentle touch can evoke changes in brain activity in infants,"" said Prof Slater. Prof Slater said the study, published inCurrent Biology,external, could explain anecdotal evidence of the soothing power of touch-based practices such as infant massage andkangaroo care, where premature babies are held against the skin to encourage parent-infant bonding and possibly reduce pain. ""Previous work has shown that touch may increase parental bonding, decrease stress for both the parents and the baby, and reduce the length of hospital stay,"" said Prof Slater. The study authors now plan to repeat their experiment in premature babies, whose sensory pathways are still developing. Caroline Lee-Davey, chief executive at the premature and sick baby charity Bliss welcomed the research. ""We already know that positive touch - such as skin-to-skin care - makes a real difference directly to babies in neonatal care and also helps parents to bond with their baby. ""This new research suggests that parental touch could also help to alleviate pain in infants and Bliss is delighted to be funding Oxford University to do more research specifically on reducing pain in premature babies through the use of parental touch, from the new year. ""Many people do not realise just how many medical procedures a baby in neonatal care goes through during their hospital stay. ""Anything that can reduce a baby's discomfort is a huge step forward in this underfunded area of research.""

US poacher sentenced to watch Bambi,"David Berry Jr must watch the film once a month every month he is in prison A poacher has been ordered to watch the Disney film Bambi repeatedly after he was convicted of illegally killing ""hundreds"" of deer. Missouri hunter David Berry Jr must view the film at least once a month during his year-long sentence. He was arrested in August along with two family members for killing the deer, taking their heads and leaving their bodies to rot, prosecutors said. It is reportedly one of the biggest poaching cases in Missouri history. On top of the jail sentence for the illegal deer hunting, Judge Robert George ordered Berry Jr to ""view the Walt Disney movie Bambi, with the first viewing being on or before December 23, 2018, and at least one such viewing each month thereafter,"" during his spell in prison. The 1942 cartoon about woodland creatures shows a hunter kill the mother of eponymous deer character Bambi. Prosecutors believed ""several hundred"" deer could have been killed A months-long investigation spanning several states led to the arrest of Berry Jr, his father David Berry Sr and his brother Kyle Berry,according to local newspaper the Springfield News-Leader,external. While the total number of deer taken illegally is unknown, Lawrence County's conservation agent Andy Barnes said it could be ""several hundred"". Berry Jr received a year-long sentence in Lawrence County prison after pleading guilt to illegally taking wildlife. He has also been sentenced to a 120-day term in Barton County prison for a firearms probation violation, and both he and his father had their hunting privileges revoked for life by the Missouri Conservation Commission.

Former CBS boss denied $120m exit pay,"Les Moonves, the former boss of CBS, will not receive a $120m (Â£95m) severance package after an inquiry into alleged sexual misconduct. The US broadcaster said that he misled the company over the allegations and failed to work with investigators, meaning it had grounds to fire him. Mr Moonves stepped down in September following fresh claims he had sexually harassed or assaulted six more women. He said that the accusations made in The New Yorker magazine were untrue. In a statement, CBS said Mr Moonves had displayed ""wilful and material misfeasance"" and failed to co-operate fully with the company's investigation into the allegations against him. It also said he had had violated company policy and was in breach of his employment contract and as a consequence he would not receive any severance payment from CBS. At the time of Mr Moonves' departure as chairman and chief executive at CBS, where he had worked for 23 years,the company said it had set $120m aside as a possible payment to him,externalpending an investigation. What has #MeToo actually changed? #MeToo founder: Campaign now 'unrecognisable' Rose McGowan: Life after #MeToo Actress and writer Illeana Douglas, known for her roles in the films Goodfellas and Cape Fear, was one of the first women to speak publicly about an alleged sexual assault by Mr Moonves. In the first of two articlesThe New Yorker published on Mr Moonves,external, Ms Douglas said: ""What happened to me was a sexual assault, and then I was fired for not participating."" Actress and writer Illeana Douglas was one of the first women to speak out publicly about an alleged sexual assault by Leslie Moonves The article also said there was a culture of harassment at CBS. Following an investigation by external law firms, the broadcaster said they had concluded ""that harassment and retaliation are not pervasive at CBS"". ""However, the investigators learned of past incidents of improper and unprofessional conduct, and concluded that the company's historical policies, practices and structures have not reflected a high institutional priority on preventing harassment and retaliation."" The 69-year-old was in charge of films and mini-series and then creative affairs at Lorimar Television in the late 1980s before becoming president At Lorimar, he oversaw shows such as Dallas, Knots Landing and Falcon Crest In 1993 he became president and chief executive of Warner Bros Television, when it merged with Lorimar During his time in charge, he oversaw the launch of hit series such as Friends and ER He moved to CBS in 1995 and played a part in its revival and some of its most successful shows, including The Big Bang Theory, NCIS and Survivor He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2013 CBS added: ""Employees also cited past incidents in which human resources and the company did not hold high performers accountable for their conduct and protect employees from retaliation.""

Energy plans may cut Â£45 a year from bills,"Energy regulator Ofgem is proposing to cut consumers' bills by Â£45 a year from 2021, largely by reducing the rate of returns to investors. Ofgem wants to set the returns at 4% - about 50% lower than under the previous price controls - to save Â£30 a year. The other Â£15 would come from November proposals to reform network charges. Ofgem's plans for revising the energy system would also help customers benefit from new technology such as electric vehicles and renewables. An Ofgem spokesman told the BBC: ""In essence, we are basically reducing the amount of money firms can earn for transporting electricity and gas to your home."" The regulator also wants to offer incentives for electric vehicle owners to be able to charge their cars outside the evening peak time - potentially with a smart charger while parked at work. And it wants to bring in a new system to make more efficient use of grid capacity, possibly by sharing it between different users. Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem executive director for systems and networks,told BBC Radio 4's Today programmethe plans were important because ""our energy system is changing"". He added: ""People in the future may well want to charge their electric cars and install solar panels on their houses and communities may even want to build their own wind farms. What we need is a system that supports this at least possible cost. ""Our job is to look after the long-term interests of consumers and strike a fair deal between their shareholders and those consumers. ""For example, if we have a system where the way we could connect electric cars is more flexible - that allows us to move demand, that means we have to build fewer wires, which means a lower investment overall."" Energy bills to be capped in new year Price cap will be good deal for customers, says Ofgem boss Ofgem orders energy firms to improve complaints handling The proposals produced a mixed response from groups associated with the industry National Grid said it was ""disappointed"" with the proposals. ""In order to deliver the major capital programme required across our networks in a rapidly-changing market, we need to ensure the regulatory framework also provides for fair returns to shareholders and enables us to continue to deliver world-class networks for consumers."" However, Citizens Advice was much happier with the plans. Its chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""Energy network companies have had it too good for too long. Ofgem's commitment to a tougher price control should curb the excess profits networks have been allowed to make. ""This is good news for people as this should result in lower bills.""

UK accountancy firms face major overhaul,"The UK's Big Four accountancy firms are facing a major shake-up under reforms proposed by the competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) wants to separate audit from consulting services, while also encouraging a wider choice of auditors. The review follows high-profile company collapses such as construction firm Carillion, which was audited by KPMG. The CMA said if its proposals ""are not far-reaching enough"", it ""will persist until the problems are addressed"". The regulator said that at present, the ""Big Four"" accountancy firms - Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC - conduct 97% of big companies' audits, while also providing them with other services. ""Companies choose their own auditors,"" said the CMA. ""As a result, we have seen too much evidence of them picking those with whom they have the best 'cultural fit' or 'chemistry', rather than those who offer the toughest scrutiny."" The CMA said ""robust reform"" was needed. Businesses should be audited by the most challenging firm - not the cheapest. Its three main recommendations are: A split between audit and advisory businesses, with separate management and accounts More accountability for those appointing auditors, with the aim of strengthening their independence A ""joint audit"" system, with a Big Four and a non-Big Four firm working together on an audit. The Financial Reporting Council, which regulates the accountancy sector, has also been under review and plans have been put forward to toughen up the regulation of major audit firms. The report, headed by Sir John Kingman, recommends that the FRC is replaced by a new Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority. He said: ""All in all, some of the FRC's critics overstate their case. Nevertheless, I have sympathy with the view that the FRC has tended, overall, to take too consensual an approach to its work. ""The FRC's approach to its own governance has also not been consistent with either its public importance, or its role in championing governance in the corporate world. We need to take the opportunity to make a fresh start."" CMA chairman Andrew Tyrie said: ""Addressing the deep-seated problems in the audit market is now long overdue. ""Most people will never read an auditor's opinion on a company's accounts. But tens of millions of people depend on robust and high-quality audits."" The CMA said its proposals would be open to public consultation until 21 January. ""These intractable problems may take some years to sort out,"" said Mr Tyrie. ""If it turns out that the proposals are not far-reaching enough, the CMA will persist until the problems are addressed."" PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte comprise what many people have described as an oligopoly. Competition authorities, a regulatory investigation and the government have all weighed in on the same day to try and restore faith in the firms paid for making sure that the financial information published by the companies that pay them can be trusted. In recent years, the fingerprints of big accounting firms have been found at the scene of many corporate scandals, including the collapse of Carillion, which was given a clean bill of financial health just months before it was liquidated. Veteran civil servant Sir John Kingman's report is recommending the existing professional oversight body be replaced. Competition authorities want to see the auditing work separated from other services, smaller firms to have a greater role in partnership with the ""Big Four"" and suggests a cap on any single auditors market share. Meanwhile, the government has asked the outgoing chairman of the London Stock Exchange to spearhead new attempts to improve the quality of information on which investors - including pension funds - rely. After waiting years for a review of a sector many think riven by conflicts of interest, three come along at once. Last month,KPMG said it would no longer do consultancy work for the UK's biggest companies if it was also auditing them, in order to ""remove even the perception of a possible conflict"" of interest. The FRCsaid the auditing work of the Big Four firms had worsened, adding that KMPG's audits in particular had shown ""an unacceptable deterioration"". KPMG said the CMA's proposals were ""constructive suggestions which seek to address challenges our industry faces and we ourselves have recognised"". The Government said it would now launch an independent review into the ""quality and effectiveness"" of the UK audit market, which it said will build on the findings by Sir John and the CMA. KPMG has been criticised by the Financial Reporting Council over its audit work It will be led by Donald Brydon, the outgoing chairman of the London Stock Exchange. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Audit companies need to learn the recent lessons from high profile audit failures and reform to regain public confidence, or they will be forced to do it."" Commenting on the CMA's proposals, David Sproul, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte, said: ""It's clear that trust and confidence in the role of the profession is not where it should be and we are supportive of change that enhances audit quality and maintains the competitive position of the UK as we prepare to leave the EU."" Kevin Ellis, chairman and senior partner of PwC UK, described at as ""a watershed moment"" for the audit sector. He said: ""The proposals will require careful and wide consultation in order to deliver practical remedies which serve the best interests of shareholders, companies and society at large.""

"Briton 'faces up to 15 years' in Bali jailPip Holmes, 45, says he was ""foolish"" for trying to get hold of cannabis oil to help his arthritis.UK","A British man says he could face up to 15 years in an Indonesian prison after being found with cannabis oil which he says he needed for medical reasons. Pip Holmes, from Cornwall, was arrested for drug smuggling when he went to collect a package containing the oil. The 45-year-old artist says he asked a friend to send it to him while he was living in Bali to help his arthritis. Indonesia has very strict anti-drugs laws and frequently arrests foreigners on drug-related charges. Mr Holmes says he was aware of the penalties and his actions were ""foolish and dumb"". He was detained on 3 December after going to pick up the package, sent from Thailand, which contained essential oil bottles with cannabis oil inside. After spending six days in a police cell, Mr Holmes was transferred to a police hospital rehabilitation facility as his lawyers argued he was a drug user - after he failed a drugs test - rather than a trafficker. However, he is still facing a drug trafficking charge and was paraded in front of the cameras last week for what he calls a ""very surreal and bizarre"" news conference. He sat alongside four other men accused of drug smuggling, which can carry the death penalty in Indonesia. Despite reports that Mr Holmes could be facing that punishment, he says the small quantity of drugs found on him means that is not the case. Pip Holmes (second from right) is put in front of the local media alongside other foreigners Speaking from the rehabilitation centre, where he is locked in a room and guarded by two men but has access to a phone, he told the BBC the press conference was ""really harrowing"". He said he doesn't feel like he is a criminal drug trafficker, but the Indonesian press are painting a picture of him along those lines. ""I just wanted to stand up and say I'm really not in this category, but the law is very different here and it's very harsh. ""It feels like a great injustice, but I'm not in the UK, I'm in Bali, so it's my own fault."" In the UK medicinal cannabis products can be legally prescribed to some patients afterrules were relaxed earlier this year- although access is very limited. The father of two, whose 11-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter live in the UK with his ex-wife, has had arthritis for eight years and says it was caused by years of practising Thai boxing. He says: ""Marijuana makes a considerable difference to the pain - it's not a leisure activity for me."" Mr Holmes is no stranger to travelling - he spent time in Canada earlier this year, while he has a tattoo studio in Thailand - and he arrived in Bali at the end of October planning to spend a couple of months surfing and painting. ""I knew what I was getting into,"" he says. ""I knew there were very strict laws but I chose to come here anyway because the surf is the best in the world."" Indonesian law does not recognise medical marijuana use. He says he is facing a sentence of between five to 15 years atKerobokan prison in Bali- a place Mr Holmes calls ""horrendous"" and ""terrifying"". The BBC has been unable to confirm with the Indonesian authorities what sentence he might face. However at his next court date, expected to be in January, Mr Holmes is hoping to be classed as a marijuana addict and be eligible for a rehabilitation sentence. He says although the police reported that he was found with 31g of medicinal THC oil, that weight included the bottles (28g). Anything smaller than 5g, he says, would make him eligible for a sentence of around 12 months in a rehabilitation facility instead. He says he needs to raise money to fight his case. Pip Holmes, at one of his exhibitions, will be auctioning off some of his paintings to raise money He says: ""I have no idea what is going to happen to me next. ""I'm afraid because I don't know how long it's going to be before I can hug my children again. They are the only thing keeping me going right now."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour makes no-confidence move against PM,"This video can not be played Theresa May announces Brexit vote date Jeremy Corbyn has tabled a motion of no confidence in Theresa May, after she said MPs would not vote on her Brexit deal until the week of 14 January. The PM had delayed the vote from last week, admitting she was set to lose. Labour leader Mr Corbyn said on Monday it was unacceptable for MPs to wait a month to vote, adding the PM had led the UK into a ""national crisis"". But No 10 sources told the BBC the government would not make time for the no-confidence vote. Ministers would not ""go along with silly political games"", they added. Brexit: A really simple guide Reality Check: How could new referendum work? Kuenssberg: Don't forget there is actually a deal Mr Corbyn tabled the motion calling on MPs to declare they have ""no confidence in the prime minister due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote straightaway"" on the Brexit deal. The motion focuses on Mrs May personally, rather than the government. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the motion could have been embarrassing for Mrs May, but as things stood, ministers would not allow time for it to be debated. She said No 10 had effectively ""batted the ball back to Labour to see if they have the guts"" to call for a vote of no confidence in the government as a whole. Unlike a vote targeting the PM, a motion of no confidence in the government could bring about an early general election if it is supported by a majority of MPs. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn wants MPs to get a Brexit deal vote before Christmas The SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens have tried to force Labour to bring about that situation, by trying to amend Mr Corbyn's motion. But Mr Corbyn said his aim in tabling the motion was to put pressure on her to have a vote on her Brexit deal this week. Mrs May's Brexit deal sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU - on 29 March 2019 - and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations between the UK and the EU. But the deal only comes into force if both parliaments approve it. Mrs May told MPs they would have the chance to vote on the deal she negotiated with Brussels in the third week of January. Mr Corbyn said by then a month would have been wasted since the original 11 December vote was postponed, with ""not a single word renegotiated and not a single reassurance given"". ""The deal is unchanged and is not going to change,"" he said. ""The House must get on with the vote and move on to consider the realistic alternatives."" However, Mr Corbyn came under fire from other opposition parties for limiting his no-confidence motion to the prime minister. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeontweeted,external: ""Labour tabling a motion just in the PM rather than in the entire government begs the question, which Tory do they want to see as PM?"" And Nigel Dodds, of Northern Ireland's DUP, which has propped up the Conservative government since June 2017, said: ""We are not interested in the parliamentary antics or play-acting of the Labour Party."" But Mr Corbyn told reporters late on Monday: ""We haven't failed to trigger any process. It's this government that is denying Parliament the right to vote on this process, that's why I tabled the motion."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: May taking shambolic government to new level Mrs May appeared to have the support of pro-Brexit backbench critics who last week failed in a bid to oust her as Tory leader. One of them, Steve Baker, said: ""Eurosceptic Conservatives are clear that we accept the democratic decision of our party to have confidence in Theresa May as PM. We will vote against Labour in any confidence motion."" In other Brexit-related news: The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford was granted an emergency debate on Brexit for Tuesday, having said Parliament needed to ""take control of the situation and find a solution"" TheresaMay rejected reports she was taking advicefrom predecessor David Cameron on what to do in the event of a Brexit deadlock in Parliament More than 60 MPs from various parties wrote to the PM urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit, saying it would do ""unnecessary economic damage"" to manufacturers Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney saidBrexit might have to be delayedif the UK submitted an ""entirely new"" withdrawal proposal In a Commons statement, Mrs May said MPs would resume the debate - halted last week - in the week of 7 January. The ""meaningful"" vote is due to take place the following week. This video can not be played PM on EU: ""There is no plot to keep us in backstop."" Mrs May told MPs: ""It is now only just over 14 weeks until the UK leaves the EU and I know many members of this House are concerned that we need to take a decision soon."" She said she had won fresh guarantees at last week's EU summit over measures to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and she hoped to secure additional ""political and legal assurances"" in the coming weeks. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Earlier on Monday, an EU spokesman said it had provided the ""clarifications"" requested on the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland border backstop and ""no further meetings were foreseen"". By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Keeping up? I don't blame if you if it all seems like procedural nonsense. And frankly, you might not be completely wrong. But what it suggests is that despite widespread frustration on all sides, Jeremy Corbyn is so far stopping short of taking a real shot at toppling May's administration, and is unlikely to do so unless, and until, he thinks he can win. For her part, Theresa May is unlikely to budge on her plan, unless and until she is forced to do so. To the immense irritation of both their supporters and their rivals, even though the Brexit clock is running down, neither of the main party leaders are willing to take the kind of radical move that might unblock the gridlock.

Cabinet to consider no-deal Brexit plan,"The cabinet has decided to ""ramp up"" preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid uncertainty over the fate of Theresa May's proposed EU exit deal. It allocated to ministries Â£2bn set aside in case the UK leaves on 29 March without MPs having accepted any deal. Letters will be sent to 140,000 firms updating them on what they should do while 3,500 troops will be put on standby to help government departments. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said it amounted to ""psychological warfare"". With 101 days left until Brexit and many MPs still opposed to the government's withdrawal agreement, which MPs will vote on in mid-January, ministers met for a longer-than-normal two and a half hour meeting. Parliament Live: Rolling updates Brexit: A really simple guide They agreed that businesses should activate their own no deal contingency plans, as they think appropriate. Updated Revenue and Customs information packs will be sent to firms later this week, setting out what changes could be needed at the border. Consumers are being advised to familiarise themselves with advice published this summer, in areas ranging frombooking flightstousing credit cards, with more details promised in the coming weeks. Please upgrade your browser The Treasury said Â£480m of the Â£2bn of preparation funding would go to the Home Office, helping it to employ more Border Force officers and boost national security. Defra would receive Â£410m, allowing it to focus on ensuring the trade in fish, food products and chemicals remains uninterrupted. HMRC, which is being allocated Â£375m, plans to hire more than 3,000 new staff to handle increases in customs activities, as well as investing in new technology at borders. The next largest allocations will be Â£190m for the Department for Business and Â£128m for the Department for International Trade. Separately, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs that 3,500 military personnel, including logisticians and engineers as well as infantry units, were ready to be deployed if needed. About 10% of the force would be reservists who will receive their call up papers in the middle of January so that if needed they would be ready in March. In other developments: Theresa May is now thoughtto be in favour of giving MPs a vote on alternativesto her plans when they debate her Brexit deal The government'starget of reducing net migrationto less than 100,000 a year has been left out of draft proposals for a new immigration system A Labour motion of no confidence in Theresa May will not be tabled until January The Daily Telegraph published a letter by 53 business leaders,external, including ex-Sainsbury's boss Justin King and Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis, have called on the PM to ""take her deal to the British people"". Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the cabinet had agreed that ""preparing for a no deal will be an operational priority within government but our overall priority is to secure a deal"". This video can not be played James Brokenshire tells Today the government has been preparing for a no deal ""for some time"" He said no-deal planning ""needs to be much more of a priority for businesses"" and there would be a ""significant increase"" in the guidance issued to them over the next 14 weeks, as Brexit day approaches. E-mails will be sent out to 80,000 of those businesses most like to be affected over the next few days. In the autumn of 2017, The Treasury earmarked Â£3bn for no-deal planning between 2018 and 2020. In March, Chancellor Philip Hammond said half of that had been allocated to 20 government departments, with the Home Office, transport, the environment and business among the largest recipients. At Tuesday's cabinet meeting ministers approved the second tranche - plus an under-spend from the current year - to go to departments for the 2019/20 year, with the priority areas being borders, security and international trade. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already ordered full ""no deal"" planning across the National Health Service, he told the BBC's Newsnight on Monday. But Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, criticised UK ministers, who he said were ""glorifying"" the prospect of leaving without a comprehensive deal in the hope individual agreements could be reached in areas like transport and livestock movements.

And Labour said a no-deal exit was ""not viable"" and it would work with other parties to stop it. ""It is testament to the prime minister's failure in these negotiations that the government is now spending billions of pounds of taxpayers' money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that is rejected by Parliament and many of those sat around the Cabinet table,"" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. And the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for another referendum, said the government was ""attempting to scare"" MPs, businesses and the public with the threat of a no-deal. ""Theresa May is irresponsibly trying to run down the clock so that the only option is to support her discredited deal,"" Sir Vince Cable said.

The deal will only come into force if both the UK and European parliaments approve it. The BBC understands Mrs May is planning to use the Commons vote as a ""moment of reckoning"" for the Brexit process. Sources have told the BBC that Downing Street will not stand in the way of MPs who seek to amend the government's motion on the Brexit deal to put forward potential alternatives. The prime minister was previously thought to be against this idea. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to push for a further vote of no-confidence in the government as a whole. On Monday night, the Labour leader tabled a motion calling on MPs to declare they have no confidence in the prime minister because she failed to have a vote on her Brexit deal straight away. Reality Check: What is the government spending on Brexit preparations? Kuenssberg: Parliamentary shenanigans Q&A: The backstop Brexit: What could happen next? No 10 has refused to make time for the motion and Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed on Tuesday that there were under no obligation to do so. Other parties - the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - have called on Mr Corbyn to push for a no-confidence vote against the government as a whole. Unlike a vote aimed at the prime minister, the government would have to allow a vote on this motion and, if successful, it could force a general election.

One of them, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he would never vote against Mrs May or a Conservative government. He said on Tuesday evening that he had a ""civilised and courteous"" meeting with the PM, and that the government was ""prudent"" to engage in no-deal planning.

Man jailed for murdering ex and her mum,"This video can not be played Solihull murders: CCTV footage shows moments before stabbings A man was jailed for life after admitting the ""brutal"" murders of his ex-partner and her mother. Khaola Saleem, 49, and Raneem Oudeh, 22, were fatally stabbed outside Mrs Saleem's home in Solihull on 27 August. Ms Oudeh married Janbaz Tarin, 21, in an Islamic ceremony, but broke up with him when she discovered he had a secret wife and children in Afghanistan. Tarin ""spent the day hunting"" down Ms Oudeh and her mother who were on the phone to police when he attacked. He went on the run after killing them and was arrested three days later. At Birmingham Crown Court Tarin, of Evelyn Road, Sparkhill, Birmingham, admitted murdering Ms Oudeh - a mother to a toddler - and her mother. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 32 years. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Saleem's sister Nour Norris said: ""The list of broken hearts goes on and on. That night this killer played god and he destroyed an entire family. ""Let us send a message that those who abuse and murder women will face justice."" Ms Oudeh's ex-partner Janbaz Tarin was charged with murder Mrs Justice Carr told Tarin his crimes had ""devastated"" the victims' family. She went on: ""When Mrs Saleem stepped in, no doubt in an attempt to protect her daughter, you stabbed her, whilst holding on to Raneem by one of her ankles and dragging her along."" The judge added: ""Your final act was to stab Raneem again, twice in the chest, before running away."" West Midlands Police said it was ""a brutal murder of two defenceless ladies by a man who had spent the day hunting them down"". The circumstances of the stabbing are being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Ms Oudeh and her mother were attacked at Mrs Saleem's Northdown Road home shortly after 00:30 BST and died at the scene. Post-mortem tests found they died from multiple stab wounds. Tarin and Ms Oudeh met at Solihull College and were married in an Islamic ceremony in 2016 but their marriage was not recognised in UK law. Ms Oudeh, who had a two-year-old son from a previous marriage, and mother-of-six Mrs Saleem were both born in Syria. Ms Oudeh had left Tarin in the weeks before the murders after learning about his other wife and children in Afghanistan. The women died outside Khaola Saleem's house in Northdown Road He was abusive towards Ms Oudeh during their relationship and after they split up he repeatedly hassled her. She then applied for a non-molestation order against him. Tarin flouted that court order and - in the hours leading up to the killings - Ms Oudeh made three calls to police. That night Tarin followed Mrs Saleem and her daughter to a shisha lounge before hunting them down elsewhere, police said. Det Ch Supt Mark Payne said police were in contact with Ms Oudeh from the shisha lounge and had been trying to reach her, but failed to catch up with her before Tarin did. Janbaz Tarin was arrested by police after three days on the run Ms Norris, who now cares for Ms Oudeh's son, said in the first six months of the year-long marriage her niece was ""hiding her misery"". She added: ""He used to threaten her many times - 'if you leave me, I will kill you and your family'. ""One day she said to me, Auntie, I feel my life's going to end."" Fearing for her safety Ms Oudeh went to stay with her mother, with whose help she took out the court order. In the shisha lounge there was a confrontation involving Tarin, Ms Oudeh and her mother. Tarin was swiftly ejected by staff after being overheard making threats to kill Ms Oudeh. Ms Oudeh took out the court order against Tarin with the help of her mother He left the bar, armed himself with a knife and drove to Mrs Saleem's home where he stabbed Ms Oudeh outside the front door and then attacked Mrs Saleem as she tried to save her daughter. Tarin was captured on CCTV running away and went into hiding, triggering a huge manhunt by West Midlands Police. Asked if she believed the police and authorities had failed to do enough to stop Tarin, Mrs Norris replied: ""Yes we do."" ""We do feel that and we feel there's a lot of women out there as well probably going through the same thing, who agree with us."" The judge described Ms Oudeh as ""intelligent"" and ""independent"" and had been ""working through college whilst also caring for her baby son"", who, the judge said, ""she adored"". She added Mrs Saleem was a ""wonderful woman"" who was ""well known in the community, working with the homeless, poor and needy"".
