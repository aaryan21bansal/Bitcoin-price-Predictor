Asia Argento denies sexual assault claims,"Asia Argento: ""No sex with Bennett"" Italian actress Asia Argento, a leader of the #MeToo movement, has strongly denied an allegation of sexual assault. Legal documents seen by the New York Times were reported to show she paid former co-star Jimmy Bennett $380,000 (Â£298,000) after he accused her of sexually assaulting him when he was 17. In a statement, she says: ""I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett"". The actress says she strongly denies the contents of the NYT article. Quoting documents exchanged between lawyers for Bennett and Argento, the paper details an incident alleged to have taken place in 2013 in a California hotel room when he had just turned 17 and she was 37. She is alleged to have performed oral sex before engaging in full intercourse with Bennett, a successful child actor and rock musician. The age of consent is 18 in California. Argento was one of the first to speak out against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women. She is said by the NYT to have arranged the payment for Bennett ""in the months that followed her revelations"" about Mr Weinstein,externalin October. The actress accuses Weinstein of sexual assault, which he denies. What has #MeToo actually changed? Has #MeToo divided women? The documents say the alleged encounter traumatised Bennett and threatened his mental health and career, according to the New York Times. A lawyer for the actor, who played Argento's young son in a 2004 film, is also quoted as saying his client decided to sue Ms Argento after seeing her present herself as a victim of sexual assault. She admits a payment but denies sex. The actress describes being ""deeply shocked and hurt by having read news that is absolutely false"". She states that the relationship was one of ""friendship only"" and that this ended after her involvement in the Weinstein revelations, when Bennett ""unexpectedly made an exorbitant request of money from me"". At the time Argento was romantically involved with celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, who killed himself in June. Bourdain, her statement says, wanted the matter to ""be handled privately and this was also what Bennett wanted"". Jimmy Bennett pictured in Hollywood in 2015 ""Anthony was afraid of the possible negative publicity that such person, whom he considered dangerous, could have brought upon us. ""We decided to deal compassionately with Bennett's demand for help and give it to him."" The sheriff's department in Los Angeles county, where the alleged assault took place, have said they are trying to contact the alleged victim. Most of the reaction came before Argento's rejection of the New York Times account. In a statement published by Vanity Fair, a lawyer for Mr Bennett said his client would not comment but would take the ""next 24 hours, or longer, to prepare his response"". Ben Brafman, a lawyer for Mr Weinstein, said the development revealed ""a stunning level of hypocrisy by Asia Argento"". ""What is perhaps most egregious is the timing, which suggests that at the very same time Argento was working on her own secret settlement for the alleged sexual abuse of a minor, she was positioning herself at the forefront of those condemning Mr Weinstein, despite the fact that her sexual relationship with Mr Weinstein was between two consenting adults which lasted for more than four years,"" the lawyer said. Mr Weinstein was charged in New York this year with sexually assaulting three unnamed women, which he denies. Tarana Burke, founder of the movement, said there was ""no model survivor"" and warned that the latest accusations would be used by some to discredit #MeToo. She tweeted that the movement was there for male victims as well as female. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Man posed as ghost of ex-fiancÃ©e's mum,"Roy Meadwell was trying to reconnect with his ex-fiancÃ©e A man who posed as his ex-fiancÃ©e's dead mother in a bid to win her back has been sentenced. Roy Meadwell, 51, from Yeovil, broke the terms of a restraining order when he sent Kay Wimbury a letter pretending to be the ghost of her mother. The letter told Ms Wimbury she had made a ""terrible mistake"" in rejecting Meadwell and added ""all you have to do is call him"", Exeter Crown Court heard. He was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for two years. Meadwell had been banned from contacting Ms Wimbury after assaulting her in December 2016. He was also banned from entering Cornwall - where she lived - by the restraining order, but visited the county on four occasions. In July 2017, he went to the Willow Moon psychic shop in Cornwall for a consultation, and took a leaflet which he included in the anonymous letter. The letter did not name Meadwell but spoke of ""the man who sacrificed everything for you"" and urged her ""all you have to do is to call him"". Another anonymous message, supposedly from a well wisher, but sent by Meadwell, said ""OMG, can't you see the greatness in this man"". Ms Wimbury told the jury she knew the letters came from Meadwell because they contained details of their life together that only he knew, including a reference to a Christmas ornament which she had been left by her mother, and fixed by Meadwell. Recorder Martin Meeke, QC, told Meadwell: ""This sentence is suspended for two years and it is designed to have the Sword of Damocles hanging over you for as long as I can. ""The restraining order is still in force and if you contact Kay Wimbury again you will go straight inside.""

EU residents will not be 'turfed out',"This video can not be played Dominic Raab is asked about what no Brexit deal would mean for EU nationals living in the UK The UK will ""move swiftly"" to safeguard the future of EU citizens in the event of no deal being agreed, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said. After talks in Brussels, he told the BBC the UK had a ""moral obligation"" to people and it was ""inconceivable"" they would be ""turfed out"". The EU, he said, must match the UK's ""ambition and pragmatism"" if the gaps between them were to be overcome. Counterpart Michel Barnier warned of a ""blame game"" over a no deal outcome. Mr Barnier said fundamental disagreements remained on future economic issues and the EU would not abandon its principles when it came to the integrity of the single market. The two sides have agreed that talks will continue without interruption to try to secure a deal in advance of the UK's departure on 29 March 2019. Mr Barnier indicated a deal may be pushed back until early November. Government to publish no-deal Brexit advice NHS 'not prepared' for no-deal Brexit In recent weeks there has been an increasing focus on the possibility of no deal being reached, and on Thursday the government is to publish a series of technical notices aimed at preparing for this scenario. Mr Raab dismissed what he said were ""hair-raising scare stories"", promising Thursday's documents would provide clarity. Asked whether the UK would guarantee the future of EU workers if there was no deal, Mr Raab said in the ""unlikely eventuality"" that this happened, the UK would ""move swiftly to secure their position"". ""We hugely value the contribution of EU citizens here in the UK and I am confident that in the unlikely eventuality that we don't have a deal, we will move swiftly to secure their position,"" he said. Dominic Raab and Michel Barnier will hold more talks next week ""It is inconceivable we would do anything other than make sure that they are legally in a position where they're secure to stay,"" he said, adding that ""we are talking about real people...and we have got a moral obligation"". He added: ""There's no question that we're going to see EU citizens turfed out. We've made that clear in the past. I've made that clear in the past, I'm happy to give that reassurance today."" Mr Raab told the BBC that the two sides needed to ""step up the ante"" and he would be returning to Brussels next week to ensure momentum was not lost. He said a ""workable solution"" was needed to address the concerns of communities on both sides of the Irish border. At a press conference earlier, the EU's negotiator said his goal was to strike a future partnership of ""unprecedented"" scope with the UK. But he warned progress on trade and economic co-operation lagged behind that on security and defence issues and said the EU would not compromise the integrity of the single market. Mr Barnier said the question of the Irish border must be ""de-dramatised"" with the onus on both sides to make clear ""which controls are needed where and how this should be done"". He added: ""Our challenge for the coming weeks is to try and define an ambitious partnership between the UK and the EU - a partnership that has no precedent. ""This partnership has to respect the single market and the foundations of the European project, and if this is well understood we can conclude the negotiations successfully.""

Manafort guilty of multiple fraud charges,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""I feel very badly for Paul Manafort"" Ex-Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort has been found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts. But the jury at his trial in Virginia failed to reach a verdict on 10 other charges and the judge declared a mistrial on those. It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department probe into alleged Russian election meddling. But none of the charges relate to collusion with Russia in the election. Responding to the charges, President Donald Trump said that Manafort's conviction was part of a ""witch hunt"" following the 2016 presidential election. Will Trump remain bulletproof? Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair What did we learn from Manafort trial? Manafort: The man who helped Trump win ""It's a very sad thing that happened,"" Mr Trump told reporters as he arrived at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday evening, adding that it had ""nothing to do with Russian collusion"". The verdict came in the same hour that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen admitted violating campaign finance laws in relation to hush money paid to Mr Trump's alleged mistresses. Trump 'directed' hush money, says Cohen Paul Manafort resigned as chair of President Trump's election campaign after two months Manafort, 69, was a key figure in Mr Trump's inner circle, but the president has since sought to distance himself from his former adviser. The jury came back on the fourth day of deliberations. The judge has given prosecutors until 29 August to decide whether to ask for a fresh trial on the charges the jury was deadlocked on. A lawyer for Manafort, Kevin Downing, said his client was ""disappointed"" with the verdict and was ""evaluating all of his options at this point"". A date for sentencing has yet to be set. Analysis by BBC's North America Editor Jon Sopel It was as though the verdicts had been synchronised by a Hollywood producer. Within two minutes of each other a federal courtroom in New York heard Michael Cohen plead guilty to eight charges concerning fraud and violating campaign finance laws, and in Alexandria in Virginia a federal court found Donald Trump's onetime campaign manager, Paul Manafort, guilty on eight counts of tax and banking fraud. And this all happened as Mr Trump flew to a rally in West Virginia. When he landed the president said he felt ""very sad"" for Mr Manafort. About Michael Cohen he said nothing. And that is instructive. Mr Manafort's crimes predate his association with Mr Trump, and is easy to deal with. But the guilty plea of Mr Cohen is altogether more toxic. In saying he broke campaign law in co-ordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office, he is stating in no uncertain terms that Mr Trump was a co-conspirator. That leaves a stain, but does it leave a scar? This president has shown an unerring ability to shake off scandals that would have sunk many others. Will his audience in West Virginia be appalled at Tuesday's courtroom drama, or enthused by a buoyant economy and a president who they believe is fighting for them? Probably the latter. But independents and traditional Republicans might be less impressed - and that could cause Mr Trump a whole heap of problems come the US midterm elections in November. Prosecutors presented evidence of Manafort's luxurious lifestyle - including photos of a $15,000 (Â£11,000) ostrich coat. Judge TS Ellis scolded the prosecution for spending too much time on Mr Manafort's wealth, saying it ""isn't a crime to have a lot of money"". But prosecutors had emphasised Manafort's extravagant spending was only possible because of his bank and tax fraud. This video can not be played Trump again denied there had been any collusion with Russia to get him elected He was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars. The prosecution's star witness was Manafort's former associate and fellow Trump campaign staffer Rick Gates. Gates has admitted embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from Mr Manafort while allegedly helping his boss commit tax crimes. The defence sought to undercut Gates' credibility by citing his ""secret life"", and noting that he had told so many lies he could not keep track of them all. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? The judge also said he had received death threats related to the Manafort case and was under US Marshal Service protection. He added that he would not release jurors' names due to safety concerns. Mr Manafort worked for Mr Trump's presidential campaign for five months in 2016, and he was in charge when Mr Trump clinched the Republican party nomination. Last October, Mr Manafort was charged by special counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed by the Department of Justice to investigate alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Virginia trial was not connected to the US president, but instead dealt with Mr Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely predating his role with the Trump campaign. The Ukrainian government found ledgers pledging more than $12m (Â£9.2m) in cash to Manafort for his advisory work with former President Viktor Yanukovych while he was in office, the New York Times reported. It was also alleged that Mr Manafort secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to aid Russian President Vladimir Putin's political goals in other parts of the former USSR. Mr Manafort denied that allegation. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Trump accused of directing hush money What did we learn from Manafort trial?

Danny Boyle pulls out of directing Bond 25,"Danny Boyle has dropped out of directing the next Bond film, blaming ""creative differences"". The Trainspotting director was to take the helm for the 25th outing in the franchise, with production due to begin at Pinewood Studios in early December. But a statement, posted on the official James Bond Twitter account, revealed on Tuesday that he had quit. It was announced by producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and current Bond star Daniel Craig. The as-yet untitled film - Craig's fifth time as Bond after Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre - had previously been given a release date of 25 October 2019 in the UK.

Oscar-winning director Boyle was set to reunite with the actor for the film, the pair having worked together on a short film - featuring 007 and the Queen - for the 2012 London Olympics. While it was to be Boyle's first Bond, Craig has previously said it will be his final appearance as 007. The most recent Bond film, Spectre, came out in 2015. What would Boyle bring to Bond? Boyle plays down 'national treasure' tag A Bond hint from 'Elba, Idris Elba' Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have worked with Craig on his previous four Bond films When it was announced in May after months of speculation that Boyle had been hired, Wilson and Broccoli, of EON Productions, said they were ""delighted"" to have the ""exceptionally talented"" director on board. Boyle was set to work alongside Trainspotting writer John Hodge, who was to create an original screenplay. It is not clear if he is still involved. A replacement for Boyle, who won the best director Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, has yet to be announced. It's not the first time creative differences have been blamed for a director's departure from a major franchise recently, withSolo losing both Phil Lord and Christopher Millermid-production last year. Ron Howard eventually took over. Film fans had their own theories for the reason behind Boyle's departure, withPaul Ferrer writing on Twitter,external: ""Usual 'creative differences' is he wanted to make his own movie but Bond producers wanted to do as they have done for the last 50+ years."" Writer and director J Elvis Weinstein had a different take on things, however. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But perhaps Boyle's departure should not be seen as that much of a surprise. Back in 2013,he told BBC Newshe ""wouldn't be the right kind of person"" to take on Bond. And, the previous year, when asked if he could direct a Bond filmhe replied: ""No, I'm not very good with huge amounts of money."" By Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent Daniel Craig in 2015's Spectre The 25th official Bond film was due to begin filming on 3 December. In movie production terms that's not much time at all. Particularly for a film that currently doesn't have a director. It does have a star. Including Daniel Craig's name in the announcement of Danny Boyle's departure is a clear signal that he's not going anywhere. But there's no mention of what's happening with that other crucial element - the script. The screenplay had originally been written by frequent Bond collaborators Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. Boyle coming on board for Bond 25 meant that that story was replaced with a script from his close friend John Hodge. If the film goes ahead with Hodge's script, then much of the planning of the last few months won't have been wasted. But if a different script is now being readied, that could potentially trigger a time-consuming rethink on everything from casting to sets and locations, which might end up delaying the December start date - which in turn could delay the planned release of the film. As far as directors are concerned, the Bond producers will be hoping to name a replacement quickly, but in the long term it's of course important to get the right person. Yann Demange and Blade Runner 2049's Denis Villeneuve are thought to have been in contention before Boyle was hired. Many fans would welcome the return of Sam Mendes, who directed the last two Bond movies. Christopher Nolan would also be a popular choice after his reinvention of Batman with the Dark Knight trilogy. As would Christopher McQuarrie, whose work on this summer's Mission Impossible: Fallout has been a hit with audiences and critics alike. But most importantly the director will need to be someone whose vision fits in with that of Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who keep fierce control of one of cinema's most famous franchises.

Two injured as shots fired at group,"Armed police attended the scene in Rayners Lane, near the underground station Two men have been found with bullet wounds in the garden of a west London home after a group of people was shot at near a Tube station. The shots were reportedly fired in Rayners Lane, Harrow, at about 17:00 BST after which a gunman fled the scene with an accomplice on a moped. More shots were then directed at the men on the moped, the Met Police said. Two men, aged 18 and 25, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder but later released under investigation. Officers from the Met Police's Trident Area and Gang Crime Command are investigating. The men who were shot, believed to be aged 18 and 24, are in hospital but their conditions are not thought to be life-threatening.

"Danny Boyle pulls out of directing Bond 25""Creative differences"" have been blamed for the decision, its producers and star Daniel Craig say.Entertainment & Arts","Danny Boyle has dropped out of directing the next Bond film, blaming ""creative differences"". The Trainspotting director was to take the helm for the 25th outing in the franchise, with production due to begin at Pinewood Studios in early December. But a statement, posted on the official James Bond Twitter account, revealed on Tuesday that he had quit. It was announced by producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and current Bond star Daniel Craig. The as-yet untitled film - Craig's fifth time as Bond after Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre - had previously been given a release date of 25 October 2019 in the UK.

Oscar-winning director Boyle was set to reunite with the actor for the film, the pair having worked together on a short film - featuring 007 and the Queen - for the 2012 London Olympics. While it was to be Boyle's first Bond, Craig has previously said it will be his final appearance as 007. The most recent Bond film, Spectre, came out in 2015. What would Boyle bring to Bond? Boyle plays down 'national treasure' tag A Bond hint from 'Elba, Idris Elba' Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have worked with Craig on his previous four Bond films When it was announced in May after months of speculation that Boyle had been hired, Wilson and Broccoli, of EON Productions, said they were ""delighted"" to have the ""exceptionally talented"" director on board. Boyle was set to work alongside Trainspotting writer John Hodge, who was to create an original screenplay. It is not clear if he is still involved. A replacement for Boyle, who won the best director Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, has yet to be announced. It's not the first time creative differences have been blamed for a director's departure from a major franchise recently, withSolo losing both Phil Lord and Christopher Millermid-production last year. Ron Howard eventually took over. Film fans had their own theories for the reason behind Boyle's departure, withPaul Ferrer writing on Twitter,external: ""Usual 'creative differences' is he wanted to make his own movie but Bond producers wanted to do as they have done for the last 50+ years."" Writer and director J Elvis Weinstein had a different take on things, however. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But perhaps Boyle's departure should not be seen as that much of a surprise. Back in 2013,he told BBC Newshe ""wouldn't be the right kind of person"" to take on Bond. And, the previous year, when asked if he could direct a Bond filmhe replied: ""No, I'm not very good with huge amounts of money."" By Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent Daniel Craig in 2015's Spectre The 25th official Bond film was due to begin filming on 3 December. In movie production terms that's not much time at all. Particularly for a film that currently doesn't have a director. It does have a star. Including Daniel Craig's name in the announcement of Danny Boyle's departure is a clear signal that he's not going anywhere. But there's no mention of what's happening with that other crucial element - the script. The screenplay had originally been written by frequent Bond collaborators Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. Boyle coming on board for Bond 25 meant that that story was replaced with a script from his close friend John Hodge. If the film goes ahead with Hodge's script, then much of the planning of the last few months won't have been wasted. But if a different script is now being readied, that could potentially trigger a time-consuming rethink on everything from casting to sets and locations, which might end up delaying the December start date - which in turn could delay the planned release of the film. As far as directors are concerned, the Bond producers will be hoping to name a replacement quickly, but in the long term it's of course important to get the right person. Yann Demange and Blade Runner 2049's Denis Villeneuve are thought to have been in contention before Boyle was hired. Many fans would welcome the return of Sam Mendes, who directed the last two Bond movies. Christopher Nolan would also be a popular choice after his reinvention of Batman with the Dark Knight trilogy. As would Christopher McQuarrie, whose work on this summer's Mission Impossible: Fallout has been a hit with audiences and critics alike. But most importantly the director will need to be someone whose vision fits in with that of Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who keep fierce control of one of cinema's most famous franchises.

Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer,"Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's once fiercely loyal lawyer, has struck a plea deal with prosecutors investigating possible campaign finance violations and tax fraud. Who is he anyway? When an FBI team raided Cohen's office in New York on 9 April, they arrived at a workspace fit for the silver screen. It's 30-odd floors up at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in a corner - but not very spacious - office at the Squire Patton Boggs law firm. Cohen's office is decked out with paraphernalia from his time at the Trump Organization and on Trump's presidential campaign, as well as from superhero movies - Thor's hammer, Captain America's shield. Also hard to miss - a nearly full-length impressionist-style painting of Cohen himself at the press secretary's podium in the White House briefing room. Cohen has remained in Trump's inner circle for more than a decade, during ups and downs at the Trump Organization and on the campaign. But as Cohen has been named a subject of a federal investigation in New York, his relations with Donald Trump have deteriorated. Cohen, 51, had prided himself in going above and beyond the line of duty as the president's personal lawyer. He considered himself Trump's protector. He'll do anything for him,telling Vanity Fair last September,externalhe'd ""take a bullet"" for the president. The day before the FBI raid, Cohentweeted,externala month-old story about him with a Joyce Maynard quote: ""A person who deserves my loyalty receives it"" followed by his own pledge: ""I will always protect our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA"". Cohen is the son of an immigrant who escaped a Nazi concentration camp in Poland. He grew up in Long Island, right outside of New York City, before attending American University in Washington and Cooley Law School in western Michigan. Trump defended Cohen in an unrelated meeting after the FBI raided his office and hotel Back in New York, Cohen worked at a law firm, married an Ukrainian immigrant, ran a successful taxi business and made a failed run for New York City Council, all before entering Trump's orbit. Cohen was introduced to Donald Trump by his son, Donald Jr, in 2006. Cohen's family had purchased a number of properties in the Trump World Tower near the United Nations, and Cohen had become the treasurer of the building's board. He had grown up idolising Trump, reading The Art of the Deal multiple times. So when Trump offered him a job after he had advised on a few legal matters, Cohen was shocked. Why the raid on Trump's lawyer is a big deal The porn star scandal Trump can't shake Fox host unmasked as Trump lawyer client He took the job, becoming executive vice president and special counsel at the Trump Organization in 2007. From then on, he was practically part of the family - close with Trump's adult children, regularly dining with them and their spouses. He was also an early fan of the idea of President Trump. In 2011, he helped launch a website, Should Trump Run?, to gauge public opinion. He was on board when Trump announced his candidacy in 2015. Cohen's been described as the president's ""pit bull"" and extension of Trump himself. He speaks with a thick Long Island accent and avoids alcohol much like his boss. Cohen is high energy, speaks assertively and has an affinity for Hermes belts and eccentric jackets. Cohen is not press shy. He prides himself on taking everyone's calls. When a CNN published a story about his role in covering up Donald Trump's alleged affair,externalwith adult film actress Stormy Daniels, he texted it to me. ""How do you feel about being called fixer?"" I asked him. ""Not insulted,"" he replied. Cohen chats with friends ahead of a hearing on the FBI raid But he's also visibly affected by what's written about him. In late 2017 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, Cohen was heard complaining about a recent story written about him. He called it ""fake news,"" saying the only news anyone should believe about him is what comes out of his own mouth. Well before the FBI raid, Cohen was named as a key figure in the alleged Russian effort to sway the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favour. The ""Steele Dossier"" - a report by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by research firm Fusion GPS to investigate Trump - specifically points to a trip Cohen allegedly made to Prague in late summer of 2016 to meet Kremlin representatives. Cohen has repeatedly denied the report or having ever been to the Czech Republic.He recently tweeted another denial,externalin light of a new report claiming Mueller has proofbacking up that element of the dossier,external. But it began to unravel for Cohen when the news broke of a hush money payment he made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels - who claims she had an affair with Trump before he was president. Since Special Counsel Robert Mueller began his investigation into possible campaign collusion with Russia, Trump had been advised by his other lawyers to keep his distance from Cohen. However - perhaps in a signal of loyalty - Trump had dinner with Cohen the night before Daniels' interview aired on CBS' 60 Minutes. The raid on Cohen's office and hotel in search of files related to the Daniels payment and other matters, however, was a surprise. Cohen was working out of the offices of a major New York law firm ""No-one saw this coming,"" a source familiar with Cohen's thinking on the matter said. Out of all the possible persons of interest to Mueller, Cohen has been closest to the president the longest - save the members of Trump's immediate family. He knows the most. And his legal troubles in New York come from a ""referral"" from the special counsel's office. The southern district of New York - where Cohen's case is being handled - is known for being aggressive. As the federal prosecutors reportedly considered charges against him, his loyalty to Mr Trump seemed to soften - he told ABC News that his top concern was his family. In the immediate aftermath of the FBI raid, Trump came to his friend's defence - both on Twitter, complaining of a witch hunt, and in person, calling Cohen a ""good man"". But his tone soon changed when Cohen's lawyer released audio of a conversation he had with Mr Trump about the Stormy payment. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There were also reports that Mr Cohen claimed Mr Trump knew in advance of the infamous Trump Tower meeting in 2016 where Russians met members of the campaign with the promise of offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's current lawyer, said Mr Cohen had ""lied all his life"". It means that while Trump could theoretically offer a presidential pardon to his former lawyer -as he recently did for Bush-era White House aide Scooter Libby- that now seems a remote possibility.

Ex-Trump lawyer in court for 'plea deal',"This video can not be played Michael Cohen leaves court as some of the charges against him are listed US President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty in a New York court to violating campaign finance laws. He said he had done so at the direction of ""the candidate"", for the ""principal purpose of influencing [the] election"". The admission was related to hush money paid to Mr Trump's alleged lovers. Mr Trump has not commented. In May, he admitted reimbursing Cohen for paying one of the women, having earlier denied any knowledge of it. Cohen, 51, admitted eight counts on Tuesday, including tax and bank fraud, in a plea deal with prosecutors which may see his prison sentence reduced from 65 years to five years and three months. Will Trump remain bulletproof? On the same day,a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafortof bank and tax fraud charges. The developments in the Cohen and Manafort cases have revived speculation that the president himself may face legal proceedings. Clearly referring to Mr Trump, Cohen said he had been directed by ""a candidate for federal office"" to break federal election laws. Cohen pleaded guilty to counts of tax evasion, making false statements to a financial institution, wilfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution and making a campaign contribution at the request of a candidate or campaign. Sentencing was set for 12 December and he was released on bail of $500,000 (Â£390,000). Who is Michael Cohen? This video can not be played Trump again denied there had been any collusion with Russia to get him elected Cohen's voice quavered as he answered routine questions from the judge. Asked whether he had consumed any alcohol or drugs before making his guilty plea, he told Judge William Pauley he had only had a glass of 12-year-old Glenlivet, a single-malt scotch, with dinner the night before. Nick Bryant, BBC News, in court This was the legal summer blockbuster that journalists had been waiting months for and, in terms of courtroom drama and potential political impact, the appearance of Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's one-time Mr Fix-it, didn't disappoint. It was his admission that he had knowingly broken campaign finance laws that was by far the most politically explosive. It was extraordinary to hear him tell the court that he had done so in co-ordination with, and at the direction of, the candidate. Though he did not mention his name - or those of the women in question - the candidate is, of course, his former boss, Mr Trump. Though Cohen has admitted guilt, he has not agreed as part of the plea agreement to co-operate with federal prosecutors, either in New York or those working on the investigation led by the special counsel Robert Mueller. He left court to chants of ""lock him up"" from a few of his fellow New Yorkers. Robert Khuzami, the deputy US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Cohen's crimes had been ""particularly significant"" because he was a trained lawyer. Cohen, he said, had failed over the past five years to report income on $1.3m from a taxi business, $100,000 from brokerage commissions and $200,000 from consultancy fees. He said Cohen had provided ""sham"" invoices to the campaign for legal fees that he allegedly provided last year. The prosecutor also said Cohen had sought reimbursement for his ""excessive campaign contribution"" by submitting the bogus invoices to the campaign. Porn star Stormy Daniels says she was paid $130,000 by Cohen just days before the 2016 election to keep quiet about an affair she says she had a decade earlier with Mr Trump. Cohen also recorded a conversation with Mr Trump two months before the election in which they discussed buying the rights to a kiss-and-tell story by former Playboy model Karen McDougal who says she had an affair with Mr Trump. McDougal apologises for 'Trump affair' Undisclosed payments to bury embarrassing stories about a political candidate can be treated as a violation of US campaign finance laws. The lawyer for Ms Daniels - who is suing both Mr Trump and Cohen for defamation - tweeted that the court developments had boosted her case against the president. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played CNN reporter asks Mr Trump about Michael Cohen back in July The people around Donald Trump Cohen worked at the Trump Organization for more than a decade and continued to serve as Mr Trump's personal lawyer and fixer after the election. The FBI seized a number of files in April from Cohen's office and a hotel room used by him in New York. They had conducted the raid reportedly following a tip-off from Robert Mueller's team. ""If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn't they be a crime for Donald Trump?"" Cohen's lawyer,  Lanny Davis, asked after Tuesday's proceedings. Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Mr Trump, told reporters that there had been ""no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president"" in the charges against Cohen. In any case, Mr Trump is unlikely to face criminal charges as long as he remains president, legal experts say. What is conceivable is that he could be sacked by Congress under the US constitution's provision for impeaching a president over ""high crimes and misdemeanours"". For that to happen, Mr Trump's opponents in the Democratic Party would have to win control of both houses. How easy is it to impeach a president? Even if they did well in the mid-term elections in November, they would almost certainly need to persuade members of Mr Trump's Republicans to change sides over the issue. No US president has ever been removed from office on the basis of impeachment. The chances of impeachment would increase dramatically were an ongoing investigation led by Robert Mueller to conclude that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to sway the 2016 election - a charge denied by Russia and described by Mr Trump as a ""witch hunt"". Cohen's lawyer said his client was keen to ""tell truth to power"" and that what he had to say was going to be of great interest to Mr Mueller. Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, Mr Trump said the Cohen and Manafort cases did not involve him and had ""nothing to do with Russian collusion"".

Pope's message ahead of Ireland visit,"The Pope has released a video message ahead of his trip to Ireland Pope Francis has expressed hope his visit to the Republic of Ireland will ""further the growth of unity and reconciliation"" among all Christians. In a video message to mark the start of the World Meeting of Families,external, he said he was ""excited at the thought of returning to Ireland"". Pope Francis' 36-hour visit begins on Saturday and coincides with the global gathering of the Catholic Church. Catholic cathedrals marked the launch by ringing bells on Tuesday evening. The World Meeting of Families,externalis held every three years, with thousands of people from across the world attending. It is the first time the event has been held in Ireland. In his message, the pontiff sent a ""warm word of greeting to all the Irish people"". ""Although the specific reason for my visit to Ireland is the World Meeting of Families, I would like to include all the members of the Irish family,"" he said. ""In a particular way, I pray that it may further the growth of unity and reconciliation among all Christ's followers, as a sign of that lasting peace which is God's dream for our whole human family.""

Facebook gives users trustworthiness score,"Facebook disputes the idea the score should be considered to be a reputation rating Facebook has confirmed that it has started scoring some of its members on a trustworthiness scale. The Washington Post revealed,externalthat the social network had developed the system over the past year. The tech firm says it has been developed to help handle reports of false news on its platform, but it has declined to reveal how the score is calculated or the limits of its use. Critics are concerned that users have no apparent way to obtain their rating. The BBC understands that at present only Facebook's misinformation team makes use of the measurement. The tech firm has, however, objected to the tool being described as a reputation rating. ""The idea that we have a centralised 'reputation' score for people that use Facebook is just plain wrong and the headline in the Washington Post is misleading,"" said a spokeswoman. ""What we're actually doing: We developed a process to protect against people indiscriminately flagging news as fake and attempting to game the system. ""The reason we do this is to make sure that our fight against misinformation is as effective as possible."" The Washington Post's report was based on an interview with Facebook executive Tessa Lyons about the platform's battle against ""fake news"". It reported that she said it had been developed to improve afact-checking scheme begun in 2016,external, in which posts that Facebook users flag as being false are sent to third-party organisations to decide if they should appear lower in people's news feeds. Facebook apologises for blocking Prager University's videos Hearing exposes Facebook's toothless 'fake news' policy Facebook will not remove fake news - but will 'demote' it To make the system more efficient, she explained, her team wanted to know which flaggers were themselves trustworthy. ""People often report things that they just disagree with,"" Ms Lyons explained, adding that the system  gave users a score between zero and one. The BBC understands that this is calculated in part by correlating the false news reports with the ultimate decisions of the independent fact-checkers. So, someone who makes a single complaint that is substantiated gets a higher score than someone who makes lots of complaints, only some of which are determined to be warranted. But the Washington Post said Ms Lyons had declined to say what other signals were being used to avoid tipping off bad actors about how to game the system. Facebook is far from being the first tech firm to privately score its users. Uber has long rated its customers according to the marks each driver gives them. But originally it required clients to email in requests to find out their count before it decided to make the information available via its app. Twitter's co-founder Ev Williamssaid in 2010 that it gave users,externala secret ""reputation score"" to help it recommend which members to follow. The Chinese state is also piloting a system in which citizens are given a ""social credit"" score based on a mix of their online and offline behaviour. Facebook used to mark ""disputed stories"" with a red icon but said the effort had backfired But one expert said that Facebook's use of an ""automated and opaque"" scoring system raised particular concerns. ""It's unsurprising that Facebook would want to assess the credibility of its users, considering how some of them are highly suspicious, gullible or out to deliberately misinform others,"" said Dr Bernie Hogan, from the Oxford Internet Institute. ""But consider the analogy of one's credit score. ""You can check your credit score for free in many countries - by contrast, Facebook's trustworthiness is unregulated and we have no way to know either what our score is or how to dispute it. ""Facebook is not a neutral actor and despite any diplomatic press materials to the contrary, it is intent on managing a population for profit."" Civil rights campaigners have also been critical. ""This is yet another example of Facebook using people's data in ways they would not expect their data to be used, which further undermines people's trust in Facebook,"" said Ailidh Callander, a solicitor at Privacy International. ""Facebook simply must learn some hard lessons, and start being transparent and accountable about how they use people's data to profile and take decisions."" It is not clear if the scoring system is applied to EU citizens. But Facebook needs to abide by the recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). ""Under new data protection laws, organisations providing services to people in the UK and the EU must be transparent with customers about how personal information is used and what is held about them,"" said a spokeswoman for the UK's Information Commissioner's Office. ""This would include the way data is processed behind the scenes, how they are profiled and the way algorithms work to drive that processing.""

"Video shows police officer hit girl, 14","This video can not be played Police had been called to reports of youths fighting A video has been posted on social media showing a 14-year-old girl being hit in the face by a male police officer. Police were called to reports of youths fighting on Peel Street, Accrington, at 17:45 BST on Monday. The teenager and a 52-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and two officers needed hospital treatment. Chief Constable Andy Rhodes said he had personally reviewed the footage and the officers had his full support. The Lancashire force said the officer used an ""open hand strike"" when the 14-year-old girl attempted to grab his Taser and radio. One officer suffered a bite wound to her arm and another a cut to his head, a police statement said. ""My officers have responded as a result of a concerned member of the public and have been met by a very hostile situation,"" the chief constable said. ""It is very easy to judge from the sidelines without the full facts when you've never been in a similar situation yourself."" The 52-year-old woman has received a police caution and the teenage girl has been interviewed and referred to the Youth Offending Team.

Star Wars actress breaks silence on abuse,"Tran played mechanic-turned-Resistance fighter Rose Tico in The Last Jedi Star Wars actress Kelly Marie Tran has broken her silence after a barrage of sexist and racist abuse led her to delete her social media in June. The actress is the daughter of Vietnamese refugees and the first lead woman of colour in the franchise. Writing in the New York Times,external, Ms Tran says the abuse revived feelings she experienced growing up. The article addresses her feelings of cultural shame, racial stereotypes and society's narrow definitions of beauty. ""Their words reinforced a narrative I had heard my whole life: that I was 'other', that I didn't belong, that I wasn't good enough, simply because I wasn't like them,"" Tran writes. ""I believed those words, those stories, carefully crafted by a society that was built to uphold the power of one type of person - one sex, one skin tone, one existence."" Tran also reveals she and her parents changed their first names after coming to the US so they would be easier for Americans to pronounce. The actress began to receive abuse after being cast as mechanic-turned-Resistance fighter Rose Tico in 2017's The Last Jedi. She writes that their comments ""awakened something deep inside me - a feeling I thought I had grown out of. The same feeling I had when at nine, I stopped speaking Vietnamese altogether because I was tired of hearing other kids mock me. "" Tran's co-stars have spoken up in her defence against abusive fans But the actress says she came to realise she had been brainwashed, and shared her hopes for the future. ""I want to live in a world where children of colour don't spend their entire adolescence wishing to be white. I want to live in a world where women are not subjected to scrutiny for their appearance, or their actions, or their general existence. ""I want to live in a world where people of all races, religions, socio-economic classes, sexual orientations, gender identities and abilities are seen as what they have always been: human beings."" The Last Jedi - the most divisive film ever? The film burdened with 'crazy' Asian expectations Boyega tells fans to stop harassing cast She ends the piece by listing her achievements and writing: ""You might know me as Kelly... My real name is Loan. And I am just getting started."" Tran deleted all of the posts on her Instagram page The honest opinion piece comes at a time of renewed discussion in the US about the importance of racial representation. Crazy Rich Asians topped the US box office on its debutand Netflix's new teen rom-com adaption To All the Boys I've Loved Before is being praised for keeping the novel's Asian-American lead. Fans online welcomed Tran's honesty in the New York Times piece on Tuesday. One social media user wrote: ""HIRE KELLY TRAN FOR EVERYTHING!!! AND USE HER REAL NAME!!!"" Another said: ""Immature misogynistic fan boys can't ruin Star Wars, as much as they'd like to try."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Tran is not the first Star Wars star to fall victim to cyberbullying. Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley also deleted her Instagram account temporarily in 2016, reportedly due to abuse she received. The Last Jedi's director Rian Johnson described some of the franchise's fans as ""manbabies"" for abusing Tran. A ""man-only"" fan edit of the film, which cut out female characters,was also mocked by Tran's co-stars Mark Hamill and John Boyega. Boyega has called on fans to stop abusing actors, tweeting: ""If you don't like Star Wars or the characters, understand that there are decisions makers [sic] and harassing the actors/actresses will do nothing.

Wallaby on loose after park escape,"The wallaby was last seen in its enclosure at Filey Bird Garden and Animal Park on Monday evening A wallaby is on the loose after escaping from an animal park just hours after its arrival. The 2ft (60cm) marsupial was one of two male Bennett's wallabies that arrived at Filey Bird Garden and Animal Park, in North Yorkshire, on Monday. Staff said it must have escaped some time between 19:30 BST on Monday and 07:00 Tuesday, despite an assurance the enclosure was ""wallaby-proof"". A manager said: ""We're baffled, a bit embarrassed and obviously concerned."" Animal manager Chris Holah added: ""He's only been with us one day and he's just gone.""

Sainsbury's evacuated as sinkhole opens,"The sinkhole opened in an alley close to Sainsbury's supermarket in Ripon on Tuesday morning A supermarket has been evacuated after a sinkhole opened up behind it. Firefighters are examining the hole after staff and customers were asked to leave Sainsbury's in Ripon when the ground gave way in an alley behind the building. Police and engineers were also called to the scene but there were no reports of injuries. The North Yorkshire city is known for the phenomenon of sinkholes in recent years. Yorkshire breaking news: Ram-raiders hit designer store for third time; Yorkshire chippy charms Chinese tourists Sainsbury's in Ripon's Market Place North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said on Twitter on Tuesday: ""Police and Fire and local authority Emergency Planning all currently investigating a report of a possible sinkhole opening in Ripon. Police said they were called to the store at 10:00 BST. In 2016, a 74-year-old woman described her lucky escape after she almost fell into a 30ft (9m) deep sinkhole which appeared in her back garden in Magdelen's Road. In November 2016,seven properties were evacuated in Magdalen's Roadwhen a 49ft (15m) by (49ft) 15m hole opened up behind a terrace of houses. Two years earlier, 400 yards away in Magdalen's Close, a house had to be demolished after a sinkhole formed. In November 2016 a sinkhole estimated to be about 6m (20ft) deep opened behind a row of houses in the city After the 2014 event, the British Geological Survey (BGS) said gypsum under the town had dissolved to form a maze-like cave system. It said in a report that sinkholes appeared in Ripon every two or three years in the 1980s and 1990s but there had not been any reported in the seven years before the 2014 event. The BGS said there were a number of possible triggering mechanisms, relating to action of water underground.

Police chief's Hillsborough charges dropped,"This video can not be played Sir Norman Bettison reacts to CPS decision A former chief inspector accused of trying to blame Liverpool fans for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster has had all charges against him dropped. Sir Norman Bettison, then of South Yorkshire Police, had faced four counts of misconduct in a public office. He was accused of telling lies about the ""culpability of fans"" and his role in the wake of the tragedy. Prosecutors said insufficient evidence meant there was no real prospect of securing a conviction. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said because of changes in the evidence of two witnesses, and the death of a third, it would discontinue the case. The decision was taken following a review of the evidence and was confirmed at a hearing at Preston Crown Court. The 96 people who lost their lives following the Hillsborough disaster Sir Norman was accused of untruthfully describing his role in the South Yorkshire Police response as ""peripheral"" in a 1998 comment to then chief inspector of constabulary Sir David O'Dowd when applying for the job of chief constable in Merseyside. He was also accused of lying to Merseyside Police Authority when he said he had never attempted to shift blame for the disaster ""on to the shoulders of Liverpool supporters"". The 62-year-old, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was alleged to have lied in a statement issued on 13 September 2012 following the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, when he said he had never offered any interpretation other than that the behaviour of Liverpool fans did not cause the disaster. He was also accused of misconduct over a statement released the following day in which he said he had never ""besmirched"" Liverpool fans. Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC told the court that since the defendant was charged in June of last year, the ""state of the evidence has changed"". She said one of the two witnesses the Crown relied on for three of the charges, relating to statements he allegedly made blaming Liverpool fans for the disaster, had since died and ""significant contradictions"" had come to light in the accounts given by the other witness. Ninety-six fans died following crushing at Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989 Ms Whitehouse said the CPS had a duty to review the evidence and reached the decision there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. She said the remaining charge related to Sir Norman's alleged use of the word, ""peripheral"" in describing his role in the South Yorkshire Police response when he applied for the job of Chief Constable of Merseyside Police in 1998, which had now been ""partly retracted"" by one witness. The prosecutor said all four of the counts were part of a ""narrative"" of a ""pattern of behaviour"" but because the other three counts had been dropped, the ""thread has been lost"". The court heard the prosecution relied on two witnesses, Mark Ellaby and a woman identified only as Mrs J. It was alleged by Mr Ellaby that, over a pint in a pub while on an MBA course together in 1989, Sir Norman said he had been appointed to a team, the role of which was to blame the fans. Paul Greaney QC, defending Sir Norman said it took ""repeated requests"" from the defence for the other students to be traced by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. When ""eventually"" they were, fifteen other students and a lecturer were contacted and ""not a single one"" recalled Sir Norman expressing any ""inappropriate view"" about Hillsborough. Speaking outside the court, Sir Norman said: ""The loss of loved ones who will never come home from Hillsborough is an enduring tragedy. ""Such a devastating loss is deserving of all of our sympathies and has always included mine. Nothing, over the last six years, has diminished my sympathy. ""My involvement in the events around Hillsborough has often been misrepresented, even in Parliament. ""Since then, I have been forced to deny, strenuously, that I was guilty of any wrongdoing in the aftermath of the disaster.  Today's outcome vindicates that position. ""Six years ago, I was driven from the job that had been my vocation for 40 years, and some commentators, who didn't really know anything about me or the facts, rushed to judgement and predetermined my guilt. ""Something I learned, though, early in my police service, is that no injustice was ever satisfactorily resolved through being unjust."" The lawyer acting for Sir Norman claimed there had been ""naked political interference"" in the investigation into his role following the Hillsborough disaster. Paul Greaney QC told the court there was a ""false understanding"" that Sir Norman took part in a cover-up, which had been fostered by political figures, including Maria Eagle MP, who claimed in parliament that Sir Norman had tried to deflect blame for the tragedy on to Liverpool fans. He said in court that ""political pressure"" had been put on the investigation, carried out by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The Hillsborough Family Support Group said: ""We have grave concerns about the handling of this case by the CPS and can confirm that we will be exercising our right to an independent review under the Right to Review scheme. ""It is our view that the wrong charge was brought in the first place and we will be using the review process to argue this point strongly. ""We know how our supporters will feel about this decision and, of course, we all share all of those feelings."" Speaking outside court, Steve Kelly, whose brother Michael died in the disaster, said: ""I'm absolutely devastated. I feel as if I've been beaten up this morning. ""I feel as though we are treading water a little bit."" In a joint statement, the metro mayors for Liverpool City Region and Greater Manchester, Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham, along with Merseyside MPs Maria Eagle, Alison McGovern and Derek Twigg said they were ""disappointed"" at the decision not to prosecute Sir Norman. They added: ""Our thoughts today are with the bereaved families and survivors of the Hillsborough disaster, still re-living that day and its aftermath almost 30 years on."" The office for Maria Eagle MP said she would not be putting out any further statement on Hillsborough. Five others, including David Duckenfield who is accused of manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 fans, are due to face trial next year. (clockwise from top left) David Duckenfield, Graham Mackrell, Peter Metcalf, Alan Foster and Donald Denton Mr Duckenfield was match commander at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium, when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush in the terrace pens. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused. Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell is charged with health and safety, and safety at sports grounds offences. Former solicitor Peter Metcalf and former police officers Donald Denton and Alan Foster are charged with perverting the course of justice. The ""right to review"" process gives those with a ""significant"" interest in the case three months to seek a review of the decision to discontinue the prosecution against Sir Norman.

New police rules for detainees on periods,"New guidelines for how police treat female detainees with their periods have been proposed by the Home Office. Ministers are consulting on plans to change codes of practice in England and Wales to ensure women in custody are treated with dignity. The review comes after a watchdog suggested earlier this year thatpolice were ""routinely ignoring"" the needs of women on their periods. The government said everyone in custody should have ""their needs respected"". The Independent Custody Visiting Association (ICVA) - which monitors the treatment of detainees - had warned that women were often held in police cells without access to hygienic sanitary protection or facilities for washing and changing. It said the treatment by police could be in breach of human rights and equality laws. Under the government proposals forces will be required to: Ask female detainees at the earliest opportunity if they are likely to require any sanitary products while in custody Make them aware these products will be provided free of charge Ensure all female detainees can speak to a female member of staff if requested Consider the dignity of menstruating detainees Policing minister Nick Hurd added: ""Our proposals should leave forces across the country in no doubt of their responsibilities towards women in custody."" Evidence gathered by the ICVA suggested the problem of sanitary provision was widespread across forces in England and Wales. ICVA chief executive Katie Kempen welcomed the consultation, adding that the proposals were ""a significant step forward in ensuring that the dignity of female detainees is upheld in police cells"". A National Police Chiefs' Council spokeswoman said it was working with the College of Policing and women's groups to ensure forces have the right guidance to help them meet the needs of women in custody. She added: ""We were concerned to hear a small number of women in police custody weren't able to access sanitary products.""

Formal apology for Windrush members,"The government has reviewed 11,800 Windrush generation cases Eighteen members of the Windrush generation who could have been wrongfully removed or detained are to get a formal apology. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said a review of 11,800 cases had identified the 18 as those ""most likely to have suffered detriment"". They are among 164 people who may have been wrongfully deported or detained. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the ""overdue"" apology was ""nowhere near good enough"". ""The government has still not got a final figure on how many of our fellow citizens were deported, forced into so-called 'voluntary removals' or detained as prisoners in their own country,"" she said. She also said it was an ""insult"" a compensation scheme being set up by the government is not yet running and called for a ""hardship fund"" to be ""set up immediately"". Who are the Windrush generation? In pictures: The pioneering Windrush generation How do you prove you've been living in the UK? The Windrush generationrefers to those who moved to the UK from Caribbean countriesbetween 1948 and 1971 but were not given proper documentation proving their indefinite right to remain. They said the lack of documentation had posed numerous problems, for example getting jobs, accessing healthcare or even remaining in the UK. In an update to the Home Affairs Committee,external, Mr Javid said the 18 people arrived in the UK before 1973 and stayed permanently but were ""unable to demonstrate their continuous residence here which led to them being removed or detained in an immigration removal centre or a reporting centre"". He said 11 voluntarily left the country, with some having been served with immigration enforcement papers informing them they had no right to be in the UK, while seven were subsequently released without being removed. Mr Javid said any of those who have left the UK will be helped to return. ""The experiences faced by some members of the Windrush generation are completely unacceptable and I am committed to righting the wrongs of the past,"" he said. ""I would like to personally apologise to those identified in our review and am committed to providing them with the support and compensation they deserve. ""We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again - which is why I have asked an independent adviser to look at what lessons we can learn from Windrush."" This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Mr Javid said the way all 164 individuals were treated and the ""degree of detriment"" varies considerably. Other than the 18 who are getting formal apologies, there were 72 cases where people were ""detained temporarily"" for between a few minutes and a few hours at the UK border before being allowed to enter the country. A further 74 ""appear to have left the UK"" for at least two years thereby losing their entitlement to indefinite leave to remain. The Home Office said they include people who were then either denied entry and removed at the border, or were removed or detained having overstayed. Amnesty International said apologising to ""just 18"" people was ""worrying"". Steve Valdez-Symonds, from the human rights group, said it ""brings into question whether the Home Office has a realistic grasp on all the people it has wrongly detained and removed following the exposure of its appalling treatment of the Windrush generation"". Labour MP David Lammy, whose parents were Windrush arrivals, said the 18 were a ""drop in the ocean"". ""The apology is crocodile tears and an insult to people still not given hardship fund, left jobless, homeless and unable to afford food,"" he said. The Windrush generation is named after the MV Empire Windrush Mr Javid also gave updated figures on the number of Windrush migrants whose status in the UK has been confirmed following the establishment of a taskforce in April. A total of 2,272 have received documents confirming their right to be in the UK, out of 6,507 people who had contacted a helpline and been referred for a call back. Those affected are named after the MV Empire Windrush, the ship which arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948, bringing workers from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other islands, as a response to post-war labour shortages in the UK. Many stayed in the UK for decades, setting up homes and starting families but the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for Windrush arrivals to prove they are in the UK legally.

Golden hello to relocated eagle chicks,"This video can not be played How far will these eagle chicks spread their wings? A long-awaited project to boost the population of golden eagles in the south of Scotland has taken off. Three young golden eagles have been released into the wild at a secret location in the Moffat Hills. They were moved from nests in the Highlands where the majority of the birds are usually found. The translocation project hopes to increase the number of golden eagles in parts of the country where they have become an increasingly rare sight. Fewer than five breeding pairs exist in the south of Scotland with none in England or Wales. The BBC was given exclusive access to see the young birds ahead of them taking flight for the first time in one of the most significant reintroduction projects ever under taken for a large predator. It is hoped people from the south of Scotland, northern England and even Wales will have the chance to see this iconic bird in the coming months and years. The birds have only been handled twice - when they were removed from their nests in the Highlands and when they were checked and tagged The eagle is measured and tagged before being released into the wild In the first of a series of groundbreaking translocations, conservationists working for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project have successfully transported three chicks.Â After being examined, measured and then fitted with a satellite transmitter to track them when they take to the skies, they were released into the Moffat Hills. The birds were only handled twice - once when they were removed under licence from their nests and when they were checked over and tagged before being released. The chicks were removed from nests of golden eagles in the Highlands The Â£1.3m project, hosted by the Southern Uplands Partnership, is now calling on volunteers across the south of Scotland to support project staff and Scottish Raptor Study Group members in monitoring and recording sightings of the birds. The chicks were named by local schoolchildren as Edward, Beaky and Emily.Â RSPB Scotland, Scottish Land & Estates, Forestry Commission Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage, and Buccleuch and the Southern Uplands Partnership, have been working together for more than 11 years to bring the project to fruition. For the next four years, the scheme will bring up to 10 young eagles south.Â Prior to the release of these latest chicks only two to four breeding pairs remained in the south of Scotland Prof Des Thomson, principal advisor for science and biodiversity with Scottish Heritage, told BBC Scotland: ""This is the icon of wild Scotland. We are on the threshold of giving something very exciting back to the south of Scotland. ""Scotland has just over 500 pairs, just two to four breeding pairs in the south of Scotland where they are really struggling. ""Young golden eagles are heavily persecuted. A third of them have been killed either through shooting or poisoning."" The settled chicks have been caught on hidden cameras thriving in their new environment He added: ""Down here in the south of Scotland we've been able to reassure ourselves persecution is not an issue. It's just a small fragmented population that needs this helping hand from us. ""We have been overwhelmed by the support we are getting from landowners and we are reassured these birds are going to be welcome."" The birds are so ""precious"", they will be monitored and supported long after their release. Each released golden eagle is satellite tagged to ensure the project team builds up as much information as they can on the ranging behaviour, survival, and health of the birds.Â Their range could take them from the hills of southern Scotland to the Lake District or even as far as Wales. The area the birds were released into was carefully selected to encourage them to settle Cat Barlow, project manager for the Golden Eagle Project, said: ""This is very significant. ""We are trying to boost the dwindling population and make sure that we are seeing a bird that should be here in the skies of the south of Scotland. ""This will be their first time out of the aviaries. They may fly a few metres, they may fly a hundred metres up the valley. We don't really know yet. ""But we've chosen a spot where there's lots of different sites where they can rest and perch - rocks for them to sit on, things like that. ""So hopefully they will fly out into the valley, find somewhere to settle, and in their own time get up into the skies and explore."" Sightings of the released birds show they are doing well Speaking about the project, Scotland's Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ""Golden eagles are one of Scotland's most impressive species and many people - myself included - will be excited by the increased opportunity to see these magnificent animals in the wild.

Football club offers free sanitary items,"Barnsley have been working with campaign group On The Ball Barnsley FC have been praised for offering free sanitary products at their stadium. The Tykes have been working with campaign group On The Ball to make sure all female toilets are stocked with free tampons and towels. Barnsley are one of six clubs to offer the items and have been praised for their progressive thinking. Hazel Potter, a visiting AFC Wimbledon supporter, tweeted that the gesture was ""bloomin' marvellous"". Yorkshire breaking news: Sir Norman Bettison will not be prosecuted over Hillsborough; Supermarket evacuated as sinkhole appears She said: ""It would be amazing if we could see this in every football club toilet and at other sporting and entertainment venues, public buildings and so on. ""All credit to the trailblazers like Barnsley for showing how things should be done."" On The Ball was set up by friends, Orlaith Duffy, Erin Slaven and Mikaela Mckinley, who got their club Celtic on board. Miss Duffy said they were inspired to take action because of period poverty, where women cannot afford sanitary products. She said: ""The fact that Celtic got on board with us straight away was brilliant but to have other clubs follow suit is really overwhelming for us. This is such an important issue."" Barnsley's chief executive Gauthier Ganaye said the club wanted to highlight On The Ball's work of tackling ""a taboo subject in a sporting environment"". He said: ""When you consider that toilet roll and other hygiene essentials aren't something you are required to pay for in public toilets, then you raise the question as to why a lady shouldn't have to pay for sanitary products."" Other clubs to introduce the measure include Tranmere Rovers, Queen of the South, Kilmarnock, Dundee United and Aberdeen. It is the second time in a week that the club has been praised for its actions Earlier this month, Barnsley were also praised after Mr Ganayewrote a supportive letter to a lifelong fan who openly discussed his depression and anxiety on social media. Mr Ganaye told Chris Ryder his ""office door is always open"" and the League One club would be ""returning the favour"" in support for his loyalty as a fan.

Chiles 'horrified' to learn alcohol intake,"This video can not be played Presenter Adrian Chiles speaks about alcohol after revealing he sometimes drank 100 units a week. Presenter Adrian Chiles has urged people to track their alcohol intake after revealing he sometimes drank 80 or 100 units a week. The BBC 5 live host said it was ""horrifying"" to add up his alcohol consumption, which was well over the recommended weekly 14 units. He was told by a doctor he ""can't carry on like this"" and his liver damage could cause cirrhosis or death. Chiles, 51, has tackled the issue of drinking in a new BBC documentary. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Chiles said: ""I was just staggered what I was putting away"". Six charts on how the British drink Your guide to alcohol drinking limits He said most of his drinking was ""completely mundane and harmless"", adding: ""I don't really get drunk, I don't misbehave, I don't drink during the day, I don't drink alone, I don't particularly stay up late. ""I just drink something every day. ""There are loads of us who just drink too much and I just wondered why I was so dependent on it in a small way, or is it a big way."" Chiles' comments have prompted many people to speak about their own drinking habits. Actress Linda Robson told ITV's Loose Women she thought ""maybe I could have been on the way to being an alcoholic"" when she used to drink a bottle of wine a night. She said: ""My big thing was because I didn't drink in the daytime then I didn't have a problem and I could make myself wait until that time every night so I obviously didn't have a problem. ""But I was still functioning, I was still coming into work."" Chiles - who sees himself as a social drinker and not an alcoholic - said he wanted to make the programme after being interested in people's ideas of what type of drinking counts as alcoholism. For the documentary, called Drinkers Like Us, the TV and radio broadcaster recorded how many units he was drinking. In an interviewwith the Times,,externalhe said on one morning he calculated that he had drunk more than 100 units in the previous week, whereas other times his weekly amount was 80 units. The NHS advises men and women not to drink more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of wine. Chiles said people like him - the ""constant drinkers, the toppers up"" - are ""the problem"". Excess drinkers 'can lose years of life' Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? Why is alcohol getting more expensive? Although his blood tests were completely normal, a scan showed he had mild to moderate fibrosis of the liver - a type of damage that includes scar tissue forming - and significant liver fat. The doctor told Chiles: ""You can't carry on like this. You're at risk of disease progression to cirrhosis, liver disease and failure - and death."" This video can not be played In his documentary, Chiles is warned by a doctor: ""You can't carry on like this."" Chiles said it might be easier to ""stop completely"" rather than moderating his drinking, which he said requires planning. He said: ""I think middle-aged 'supposedly moderate' drinkers need to take a look at ourselves. ""I encourage anyone, don't judge yourself, don't panic you're not going to drop dead, but go on an app like 'Drink Less' and measure what you're drinking, be honest with yourself for three weeks.""

Hetold the Radio Times,externalthat after first leaving the show he was ""self-medicating with alcohol"". Drinkers Like Us will be broadcast on BBC Two next Monday 27 August at 21:00 BST.

"Stray cat causes hospital infection scareThe Sun newspaper published pictures of ""Monty"" on a desk and in a stand-off with a rat.Surrey","Hospital bosses were said to be livid when they discovered ""Monty"" A cat caused an infection scare after it entered a hospital site and was ""found lying in a linen cupboard"" by bosses. Areport in The Sun,externalsaid a deep clean was ordered at Epsom Hospital after the cat's activities came to light. The paper published pictures of ""Monty"" on a desk and in a stand-off with a rat ""within hospital grounds"". But trust chiefs denied staff were keeping it as a pet and said the affected area had been decontaminated. The report in The Sun alleged staff bought the Burmese a basket, food and scratch pad and let him prowl around A&E. It said concerned hospital bosses ""went nuts"" when they discovered the cat and sacked a staff member after an investigation. The paper said that Monty's real owner, who lived nearby, was finally traced when he was found to have a microchip. Epsom and St Helier NHS trust said in a statement that the ""health and wellbeing of our patients"" was its first priority ""and that includes protecting people from the risk of infection"". It said that when it came to light an animal had entered one of its sites, it immediately launched an investigation. It added: ""In order to determine the facts of the matter, we needed to install additional CCTV cameras in a storage area of the hospital. ""As a result of the investigation, a member of contracted staff has since been dismissed for neglecting their duties whilst at work (including lying down for long periods when they should have been working), and we found evidence that the cat had been on site in this non-patient, storage area. This area has been decontaminated fully. ""We would like to assure all of our patients, visitors and local people that we have taken this matter very seriously."" Asked if there was a rodent problem on site, the trust said:  ""As with any institution of this size, and with buildings as old as ours, there are occasions when pests are observed on site. ""We take this very seriously, and employ pest control experts to help us manage this."" Infection control expert Professor Hugh Pennington said cats pose a low risk to humans. However, he added: ""You really can't have a pet wandering loose in a hospital."" He said norovirus - which causes vomiting and diarrhoea - would be ""top of my list of worries"" as the cat could carry the bug around the building on its feet.

Water ice 'detected on Moon's surface',"The distribution of surface water-ice at the Moon's south pole (left) and north pole (right) Scientists say they have definitive evidence for water-ice on the surface of the Moon. The ice deposits are found at both the north and south poles, and are likely to be ancient in origin. The result comes from an instrument on India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, which explored the Moon between 2008 and 2009. Details of the workhave been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).,external The distribution of the ice deposits is patchy. At the lunar south pole, most of the ice is concentrated in craters. At the northern pole, the water-ice is both more sparse and more widely spread. The Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument aboard Chandrayaan identified three specific signatures of water-ice at the lunar surface. M3 not only picked up the reflective properties one would expect from ice, but was able to directly measure the distinctive way its molecules absorb infrared light. This meant that it could differentiate between liquid water and vapour and solid ice. This picture of the Moon's south polar region was captured by Japan's Kaguya spacecraft Temperatures on the Moon can reach a searing 100C in daytime, which doesn't provide the best conditions for the survival of surface ice. But because the Moon is tilted on its axis by about 1.54 degrees, there are places at the lunar poles that never see daylight. Scientists estimate that temperatures in permanently shadowed craters at the Moon's poles do not rise above -157C (-250F). This would create an environment where deposits of water-ice could remain stable for long periods. The result supports previous indirect detections of surface ice at the Moon's south pole. However, those results could potentially be explained by other phenomena - such as unusually reflective lunar soil. If there's enough ice sitting at the surface - within the top few millimetres - the water might be accessible as a resource for future human missions to the Moon. It could potentially be turned into drinking water for the occupants of a lunar base, or ""split"" into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel. The split oxygen could also be used by astronauts for breathing. Surface water ice has also been found on other Solar System bodies, such asat the north pole of the planet Mercuryandon the dwarf planet Ceres.

Gut bug enzyme turns blood into type-O,"Scientists believe they have found a reliable way to transform donor blood into the universal type needed for safe, emergency blood transfusions. The discovery is enzymes from gut bacteria that can efficiently turn type-A human blood into type-O. Type-O blood is special because it can be donated to anyone without the risk of a bad mismatch reaction. The researchers, from the University of British Columbia, say clinical trials of the treatment could begin soon. The gut bug enzymes remove markers from the surface of the donor red blood cells present in type A but not in type O. Stripping them away means the recipient's immune system will think the donor type-A blood is type-O and will not attack it for being ""foreign"". Giving someone blood from the wrong group can be life-threatening. While type-O patients can receive only type-O red cell transfusions, type-O donations are compatible with all other ABO types. The four main blood groups in the ABO system are: O, A, B and AB Which group you belong to is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents In an emergency situation, there may not be time to do a full check to get a good match, which is why having enough type-O blood to use is so important for health services. About 7-8% of the UK population have type-O Rhesus-negative blood but demand for this special group accounts for about 13% of all hospital requests, according to NHS Blood and Transplant. Beth Johnson, 18, from Irlam, Lancashire, is a blood donor and her donation was used to help people injured on the night of the Manchester Arena attack, 22 May 2017. ""I am O-negative and know how rare and valuable this blood type is for the NHS,"" she said. ""I'm so glad my blood was potentially used to save the life of someone involved in something so horrific."" The idea of changing blood type with enzymes is not new - other scientists as well as the British Columbia team have been exploring it for some time. But researcher Stephen Withers, who is presenting his findings at the American Chemical Society's national meeting in Boston, said the gut enzymes represented the most promising treatment so far. He said: ""I am optimistic that we have a very interesting candidate to adjust donated blood to a common type. ""Of course, it will have to go through lots of clinical trials to make sure that it doesn't have any adverse consequences but it is looking very promising. ""It works in whole blood, so you could see this being put into the bag at the time of collection and just sitting there doing its job while this stuff is being stored."" In laboratory tests, the enzymes were able to completely convert blood type A to O. With the help of the Canadian Blood Service, the researchers now want to test more blood samples before trialling the treatment in the clinic. ""Obviously, the next stages are all about safety, making sure this doesn't cause any inadvertent effects,"" Mr Withers said.

Microsoft 'halts Russian political hack',"A Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear is accused of trying to disrupt the US midterm elections Russian attempts to launch cyber-attacks against US conservative groups have been thwarted, Microsoft says. The software companysaid Russian hackers had tried to steal data,externalfrom political organisations, including the International Republican Institute and the Hudson Institute think tanks. But they had been thwarted when its security staff had won control of six net domains mimicking their websites. Microsoft said the Fancy Bear hacking group had been behind the attacks. ""We're concerned that these and other attempts pose security threats to a broadening array of groups connected with both American political parties in the run-up to the 2018 elections,"" Microsoft said in its blog detailing its work. The thwarted attack was likely the start of a ""spear phishing"" campaign, said Microsoft. This would involve tricking people into visiting the mimicked domains allowing the Fancy Bear group to see and steal login information that people use. As well as the two think-tanks, the domains seized were associated with several Senate offices and services. One domain sought to mimic Microsoft's Office 365 online service. Hunt wants 'malign' Russia to face action Trump relaxes rules around cyber-attacks US accuses Russia of 'pervasive' meddling Russia has denied Microsoft's allegations that it targeted the right-wing think-tanks. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was ""unaware"" of any attempted interference by Russia-linked hackers in the US mid-term elections. ""[Our] reaction is traditional,"" he told the Interfax news agency. ""We are unaware what kind of hackers they refer to, we do not know what this interference entails."" BBC Monitoring reported him as adding: ""We do not understand whom exactly it concerns, what the evidence is and what such conclusions are based on. We have no such information."" He said: ""We hear confirmation from America that there was no meddling in the election."" TheNew York Times suggested,externalthat the two think tanks were targeted because they were former supporters of President Trump but were now foes who had called for more sanctions to be imposed on Russia. The International Republican Institute's directors include Senator John McCain and General HR McMaster who was replaced earlier this year as the White House national security adviser. IRI president Daniel Twining told the Times that the attacks were consistent with the ""campaign of meddling"" the Kremlin is known to have indulged in. Some of Fancy Bear's activities had previously been identified by the cyber-security company Crowdstrike In its blog, Microsoft president Brad Smith said it had grabbed dodgy domains 12 times in two years to shut down 84 websites associated with Fancy Bear. It said that, so far, it had no evidence that the domains had been used in any attacks. The domains could have been set up to help a future planned assault. Microsoft added that the attack activity seen around the domains ""mirrors"" what it saw in 2016 in the US and during the 2017 election in France. Microsoft's action comes soon after the US charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking computer networks used by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.

Businessman 'leaves ÃÂ£41m' to Oxfam,"Richard Cousins (centre) was killed in a plane crash along with his two sons, Edward (left) and William (right) A multi-millionaire catering boss has left a ""substantial amount"" of money to Oxfam after dying alongside his family in a plane crash. The Sun reports,externalthat Richard Cousins left Â£41m to the charity after he was killed with his fiancee, her daughter, and his two sons on New Year's Eve. The paper said his will specified the money should go to the charity because his two sons died with him. Oxfam told the BBC it had been left money by Mr Cousins, but not how much. A spokesman for the charity said they were ""extremely grateful"" for the bequest. In its last annual report for 2016-17, the charity received Â£19.8m in gifts left to it through wills. Tributes paid to seaplane crash family Seaplane crash family members 'drowned' Oxfam scandal: Thousands cancel donations Mr Cousins, 58, who was chief executive of Compass Group, died alongside his fiancee, magazine editor Emma Bowden, 48, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, and his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, in Sydney on New Year's Eve 2017. Australian pilot Gareth Morgan was also killed. All six died when the seaplane - which belonged to a firm running sightseeing tours - plunged into a river 30 miles (50km) north of the Australian city. An inquest in the UK found the family had died from a combination of multiple injuries and drowning, calling it a ""tragic accident"". Emma Bowden and her daughter Heather were also killed in the crash According to the Sun, a year before the incident, Mr Cousins had added a ""common tragedy clause"" to his will so that if he and his family were to die at the same time, his fortune would go to charity. After the accident, this meant Â£41m would go to Oxfam - although his two brothers would also receive Â£1m each, it reported. A common tragedy clause allows for a provision to be made for where your estate will go if all your immediate family die at the same time as you. Claire Davis, a partner at Howells Solicitors and director of Solicitors for the Elderly, said it was similar to ""catch all provisions"" made in many wills. ""If you are getting the correct advice, your solicitor will cover every eventuality,"" she said - even the unlikely event of your whole family dying. If you do not add this clause, or you do not have a will, the money will go through the rules of intestacy - working through a list of family members until someone alive inherits it. But if your relatives are already wealthy, or you do not get on, you may not want them to have it. In these cases, many people pick a charity. ""Each will is different because each person is different,"" said Ms Davis. ""But it sounds like Mr Cousins had good advice to prepare."" It comes as Oxfam is facing financial difficulty in the wake of allegations that itsstaff hired prostitutes while working in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Four employees were fired for ""gross misconduct"" and three others, including the country director Roland Van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to leave the charity. Mr Van Hauwermeiren denied paying for sex but admitted ""making mistakes"". Oxfam was accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into the allegations, and its chief executive, Mark Goldring, resigned. This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' After the scandal emerged earlier this year, thousands of people stopped making regular donations, and in June, Oxfam said it would be making Â£16m in cuts because of reduced funding.

UK and EU vow continuous Brexit talks,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab is asked about what no Brexit deal would mean for EU nationals living in the UK The UK will ""move swiftly"" to safeguard the future of EU citizens in the event of no deal being agreed, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said. After talks in Brussels, he told the BBC the UK had a ""moral obligation"" to people and it was ""inconceivable"" they would be ""turfed out"". The EU, he said, must match the UK's ""ambition and pragmatism"" if the gaps between them were to be overcome. Counterpart Michel Barnier warned of a ""blame game"" over a no deal outcome. Mr Barnier said fundamental disagreements remained on future economic issues and the EU would not abandon its principles when it came to the integrity of the single market. The two sides have agreed that talks will continue without interruption to try to secure a deal in advance of the UK's departure on 29 March 2019. Mr Barnier indicated a deal may be pushed back until early November. Government to publish no-deal Brexit advice NHS 'not prepared' for no-deal Brexit In recent weeks there has been an increasing focus on the possibility of no deal being reached, and on Thursday the government is to publish a series of technical notices aimed at preparing for this scenario. Mr Raab dismissed what he said were ""hair-raising scare stories"", promising Thursday's documents would provide clarity. Asked whether the UK would guarantee the future of EU workers if there was no deal, Mr Raab said in the ""unlikely eventuality"" that this happened, the UK would ""move swiftly to secure their position"". ""We hugely value the contribution of EU citizens here in the UK and I am confident that in the unlikely eventuality that we don't have a deal, we will move swiftly to secure their position,"" he said. Dominic Raab and Michel Barnier will hold more talks next week ""It is inconceivable we would do anything other than make sure that they are legally in a position where they're secure to stay,"" he said, adding that ""we are talking about real people...and we have got a moral obligation"". He added: ""There's no question that we're going to see EU citizens turfed out. We've made that clear in the past. I've made that clear in the past, I'm happy to give that reassurance today."" Mr Raab told the BBC that the two sides needed to ""step up the ante"" and he would be returning to Brussels next week to ensure momentum was not lost. He said a ""workable solution"" was needed to address the concerns of communities on both sides of the Irish border. At a press conference earlier, the EU's negotiator said his goal was to strike a future partnership of ""unprecedented"" scope with the UK. But he warned progress on trade and economic co-operation lagged behind that on security and defence issues and said the EU would not compromise the integrity of the single market. Mr Barnier said the question of the Irish border must be ""de-dramatised"" with the onus on both sides to make clear ""which controls are needed where and how this should be done"". He added: ""Our challenge for the coming weeks is to try and define an ambitious partnership between the UK and the EU - a partnership that has no precedent. ""This partnership has to respect the single market and the foundations of the European project, and if this is well understood we can conclude the negotiations successfully.""

Stray cat causes hospital infection scare,"Hospital bosses were said to be livid when they discovered ""Monty"" A cat caused an infection scare after it entered a hospital site and was ""found lying in a linen cupboard"" by bosses. Areport in The Sun,externalsaid a deep clean was ordered at Epsom Hospital after the cat's activities came to light. The paper published pictures of ""Monty"" on a desk and in a stand-off with a rat ""within hospital grounds"". But trust chiefs denied staff were keeping it as a pet and said the affected area had been decontaminated. The report in The Sun alleged staff bought the Burmese a basket, food and scratch pad and let him prowl around A&E. It said concerned hospital bosses ""went nuts"" when they discovered the cat and sacked a staff member after an investigation. The paper said that Monty's real owner, who lived nearby, was finally traced when he was found to have a microchip. Epsom and St Helier NHS trust said in a statement that the ""health and wellbeing of our patients"" was its first priority ""and that includes protecting people from the risk of infection"". It said that when it came to light an animal had entered one of its sites, it immediately launched an investigation. It added: ""In order to determine the facts of the matter, we needed to install additional CCTV cameras in a storage area of the hospital. ""As a result of the investigation, a member of contracted staff has since been dismissed for neglecting their duties whilst at work (including lying down for long periods when they should have been working), and we found evidence that the cat had been on site in this non-patient, storage area. This area has been decontaminated fully. ""We would like to assure all of our patients, visitors and local people that we have taken this matter very seriously."" Asked if there was a rodent problem on site, the trust said:  ""As with any institution of this size, and with buildings as old as ours, there are occasions when pests are observed on site. ""We take this very seriously, and employ pest control experts to help us manage this."" Infection control expert Professor Hugh Pennington said cats pose a low risk to humans. However, he added: ""You really can't have a pet wandering loose in a hospital."" He said norovirus - which causes vomiting and diarrhoea - would be ""top of my list of worries"" as the cat could carry the bug around the building on its feet. ""It would make it more difficult to control the infection. It's a very tough virus and you only need to ingest a small number of particles to fall ill,"" he said. ""That would be top of my list of worries as staff can get infected, wards have to be closed - that can be a major crisis for the NHS.""

Dan Osborne, Hardeep Singh Kohli and Jermaine Pennant are all in the current series But it's not just Rodrigo's behaviour that's caused controversy on this year's Celebrity Big Brother. Former Coronation Street actress Nicola Thorp criticised the inclusion of Hardeep Singh Kohli, Dan Osborne and Jermaine Pennant on the show  - as all three have previously been accused of inappropriate behaviour towards women. Hardeep wasdropped from the BBC's The One Show in 2009,externalfollowing a complaint of inappropriate behaviour from a female colleague. In 2015 a recording of Dan apparently threatening to stab his ex-partner if she slept with another man was shared by UK tabloids.He later said he was sorry for the incident.,external Jermaine wrote in his 2018 autobiography howPremier League footballers paid ""rent"",externalto each other if they slept with a woman that another footballer had had sex with - in a game based on Monopoly. Hardeep apologised over the 2009 incident ""We must stop celebrating and rewarding this behaviour,""wrote Nicola in a Twitter thread,externalabout Celebrity Big Brother. ""[Big Brother] has given both him [Hardeep] and Dan Osbourne a platform to attempt to redeem themselves in the public eye and to kick start their careers,"" she added. ""While women are still scared to report sexual harassment at work for fear of ruining their own careers, Hardeep is taking money for having done it."" The programme has also upset viewers with a task based on Donald Trump's promises to build a wall between the US and Mexico and the families who have been separated on the border.

Businessman 'leaves ÃÂ£41m' to OxfamThe charity received the cash after Richard Cousins and two sons died in a plane crash in Australia.,"Richard Cousins (centre) was killed in a plane crash along with his two sons, Edward (left) and William (right) A multi-millionaire catering boss has left a ""substantial amount"" of money to Oxfam after dying alongside his family in a plane crash. The Sun reports,externalthat Richard Cousins left Â£41m to the charity after he was killed with his fiancee, her daughter, and his two sons on New Year's Eve. The paper said his will specified the money should go to the charity because his two sons died with him. Oxfam told the BBC it had been left money by Mr Cousins, but not how much. A spokesman for the charity said they were ""extremely grateful"" for the bequest. In its last annual report for 2016-17, the charity received Â£19.8m in gifts left to it through wills. Tributes paid to seaplane crash family Seaplane crash family members 'drowned' Oxfam scandal: Thousands cancel donations Mr Cousins, 58, who was chief executive of Compass Group, died alongside his fiancee, magazine editor Emma Bowden, 48, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, and his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, in Sydney on New Year's Eve 2017. Australian pilot Gareth Morgan was also killed. All six died when the seaplane - which belonged to a firm running sightseeing tours - plunged into a river 30 miles (50km) north of the Australian city. An inquest in the UK found the family had died from a combination of multiple injuries and drowning, calling it a ""tragic accident"". Emma Bowden and her daughter Heather were also killed in the crash According to the Sun, a year before the incident, Mr Cousins had added a ""common tragedy clause"" to his will so that if he and his family were to die at the same time, his fortune would go to charity. After the accident, this meant Â£41m would go to Oxfam - although his two brothers would also receive Â£1m each, it reported. A common tragedy clause allows for a provision to be made for where your estate will go if all your immediate family die at the same time as you. Claire Davis, a partner at Howells Solicitors and director of Solicitors for the Elderly, said it was similar to ""catch all provisions"" made in many wills. ""If you are getting the correct advice, your solicitor will cover every eventuality,"" she said - even the unlikely event of your whole family dying. If you do not add this clause, or you do not have a will, the money will go through the rules of intestacy - working through a list of family members until someone alive inherits it. But if your relatives are already wealthy, or you do not get on, you may not want them to have it. In these cases, many people pick a charity. ""Each will is different because each person is different,"" said Ms Davis. ""But it sounds like Mr Cousins had good advice to prepare."" It comes as Oxfam is facing financial difficulty in the wake of allegations that itsstaff hired prostitutes while working in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Four employees were fired for ""gross misconduct"" and three others, including the country director Roland Van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to leave the charity. Mr Van Hauwermeiren denied paying for sex but admitted ""making mistakes"". Oxfam was accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into the allegations, and its chief executive, Mark Goldring, resigned. This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' After the scandal emerged earlier this year, thousands of people stopped making regular donations, and in June, Oxfam said it would be making Â£16m in cuts because of reduced funding.

Big prostate steam treatment NHS approved,"The NHS can start offering a new steam treatment for benign prostate enlargement, says the regulator, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The procedure is minimally invasive and can be done under local anaesthetic without an overnight hospital stay. It involves passing a small probe up the urethra to inject a puff of steam into the troublesome area. The steam kills off some of the enlarged tissue to ease symptoms. The dead cells are reabsorbed by the body. An enlarged prostate is common - affecting one in three men over the age of 50 - and forces the urethra (urine tube) to narrow, causing a variety of problems, including difficulty emptying the bladder. Drugs or an operation can help but NICE says men should now be offered another treatment option. The steam treatment, called Rezum, is an alternative to invasive surgery and is said to have fewer side-effects, such as impotence and incontinence. Patients may have to take antibiotics and have a urinary catheter for some days after the procedure. Some activities, including sexual intercourse, should be avoided for up to one month. It is the latest ofseveral minimally invasive proceduresfor the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is the medical term for an enlarged prostate gland - the gland located in the pelvis between the penis and the bladder It is not a cancer and it isn't usually a serious threat to health The cause is unclear but it is more common in older men Symptoms may be mild and not need treatment but for others they can be troublesome Prof Richard Hindley, a consultant urologist at Hampshire Hospitals, has been providing the treatment to some of his patients, with ""very good results"". ""The treatment involves a tiny water droplet being heated to 103C and then injected via the urethra into the prostate,"" he said. ""It can be performed quickly, with each procedure taking less than 20 minutes. ""The number of injections required is titrated according to the size of the gland."" Prof Kevin Harris from NICE, said: ""Approving this procedure gives men the chance to talk to their clinician about which is right for them.""

"Gut bug enzyme turns blood into type-OScientists hope their discovery could ease shortages of ""universal"" donor blood.Health","Scientists believe they have found a reliable way to transform donor blood into the universal type needed for safe, emergency blood transfusions. The discovery is enzymes from gut bacteria that can efficiently turn type-A human blood into type-O. Type-O blood is special because it can be donated to anyone without the risk of a bad mismatch reaction. The researchers, from the University of British Columbia, say clinical trials of the treatment could begin soon. The gut bug enzymes remove markers from the surface of the donor red blood cells present in type A but not in type O. Stripping them away means the recipient's immune system will think the donor type-A blood is type-O and will not attack it for being ""foreign"". Giving someone blood from the wrong group can be life-threatening. While type-O patients can receive only type-O red cell transfusions, type-O donations are compatible with all other ABO types. The four main blood groups in the ABO system are: O, A, B and AB Which group you belong to is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents In an emergency situation, there may not be time to do a full check to get a good match, which is why having enough type-O blood to use is so important for health services. About 7-8% of the UK population have type-O Rhesus-negative blood but demand for this special group accounts for about 13% of all hospital requests, according to NHS Blood and Transplant. Beth Johnson, 18, from Irlam, Lancashire, is a blood donor and her donation was used to help people injured on the night of the Manchester Arena attack, 22 May 2017. ""I am O-negative and know how rare and valuable this blood type is for the NHS,"" she said. ""I'm so glad my blood was potentially used to save the life of someone involved in something so horrific."" The idea of changing blood type with enzymes is not new - other scientists as well as the British Columbia team have been exploring it for some time. But researcher Stephen Withers, who is presenting his findings at the American Chemical Society's national meeting in Boston, said the gut enzymes represented the most promising treatment so far. He said: ""I am optimistic that we have a very interesting candidate to adjust donated blood to a common type. ""Of course, it will have to go through lots of clinical trials to make sure that it doesn't have any adverse consequences but it is looking very promising. ""It works in whole blood, so you could see this being put into the bag at the time of collection and just sitting there doing its job while this stuff is being stored."" In laboratory tests, the enzymes were able to completely convert blood type A to O. With the help of the Canadian Blood Service, the researchers now want to test more blood samples before trialling the treatment in the clinic. ""Obviously, the next stages are all about safety, making sure this doesn't cause any inadvertent effects,"" Mr Withers said.

Love Island 'puts off female firefighters',"Dany Cotton (left) with Theresa May on her visit to Grenfell Tower The head of the London Fire Brigade has criticised Love Island for reinforcing the cliche of firefighters as muscle-bound male sex objects. Commissioner Dany Cotton said ""offensive"" stereotypes discouraged young women from joining the service. She criticised the ITV2 show for ""rolling out every offensive cliche possible with their so-called 'fireman challenge'"". The brigade also criticised an advert for Harpic toilet cleaner. Ms Cotton - the first woman to hold the LFB's most senior position - said Love Island's fireman challenge ""reinforces the misconception that all firefighters are muscle-bound men"". ""No wonder so many young women are put off by that,"" she added. The fireman challenge required the male Love Island participants to strip to their underwear and pretend to save a woman from danger. Just 300 of the LFB's 5,000 operational firefighters - 6% - are women. Research by the brigade also cited a Harpic toilet cleaner ad in which a woman swoons over a brawny male firefighter. Ms Cotton argued that putting an end to ""lazy cliches"" would change the public's attitude and encourage more woman to join the fire service. BBC Reality Check Last year, 5.2% of firefighters in England were women. There were 1,838 female firefighters, compared to 33,782 male firefighters. The proportion of female fighters is slowly increasing. In 2007, 3.1% (1,384) of firefighters were women. By comparison, about a third of police officers in England and Wales are women - 10 times the proportion that are firefighters. Despite few women being front line firefighters, the majority of fire control staff (76%) and fire support staff (52.5%) are female. Ms Cotton said the Army and police had been ""enriched"" by more female representation and praised the way TV characters such as Jane Tennison from Prime Suspect had changed people's perception of women in the police force. ""It's time the fire and rescue service caught up,"" she said. Liz George, a watch manager for London Fire Brigade, said she felt ""infuriated"" when she watched Love Island's ""fireman challenge"" live on TV. ""Even saying 'fireman', emphasising its just a man that could do that role, is quite frustrating when I'm out doing that job every day,"" she said. Love Island has been attacked for rolling out ""every offensive cliche possible"" about firefighters Earlier this year, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) ran a consultation on a proposal that adverts ""must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence"". An ASA spokeswoman said: ""We've published evidence that shows gender stereotypes have the potential to cause harm because they limit how people's potential is considered by themselves and others - with costs to the individual, economy and society. ""We've already been taking action to ban ads which reinforce harmful stereotypes and we'll publish the results of our consultation around new rules for advertisers later this year.""

Government's July surplus at 18-year high,"The government's finances were in surplus by Â£2bn last month, the biggest surplus for July in 18 years, official figures show. The figure was up from a surplus of Â£1bn a year ago. At the same time, borrowing in the April-to-July period fell to its lowest level since 2002. Analysts said the reduction in borrowing should give Chancellor Philip Hammond extra money to play with in the Budget this autumn. Borrowing for the financial year so far has reached Â£12.8bn, Â£8.5bn less than in the same period in 2017,the Office for National Statistics said.,external Kamal Ahmed: Why is government borrowing falling? Public sector net debt, excluding public sector banks, was Â£1,777.5bn, equivalent to 84.3% of GDP. That is Â£17.5bn higher than a year earlier, but lower as a percentage of GDP than in 2017, when it was 86%. Andy Verity, economics correspondent July is usually a good month for the Exchequer. Because self-employed people make the second of two self-assessed tax payments in July, the chancellor tends to enjoy more money flowing in than flowing out in spending. But last month was the biggest surplus in 18 years. Since the start of the financial year, the public sector - government, local government and other publicly owned corporations - has only had to borrow Â£12.8bn to plug the gap between its income and its spending. That is the lowest borrowing since 2002 - enough to encourage opponents of austerity to question if it is still necessary. Those who want to keep austerity will point out that the debt - all the accumulated deficits of the past - is still very high by the standards of recent decades. And it's climbing. However, their opponents might retort, it's shrinking as a proportion of the economy. Other things being equal, that means it should be getting easier, not harder to manage. The public finances are prone to surpluses in July because of money coming in from self-assessed income tax returns. Last month, receipts from self-assessed income tax were Â£9bn, an increase of Â£1bn on July 2017. That is the highest level of July self-assessed income tax receipts since records began in 1999. Over the financial year to March 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces the official government forecasts, expects the public sector to borrow Â£37.1bn. That amounts to about one-quarter of what it borrowed in 2009-10, at the peak of the financial crisis. ""Public borrowing has remained on a sharp downward trend, creating scope for the chancellor to pause the fiscal consolidation next year and still meet his self-prescribed targets,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""If this trend persists, borrowing will total just Â£23.7bn this year, much less than the Â£37.1bn forecast by the OBR in the Spring Statement."" Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, was more cautious, pointing out that ""an undershoot of this magnitude is unlikely"". She added: ""The recent improvement has been partly due to temporary factors, such as the timing of gilt issuance and redemptions."" However, she said Mr Hammond ""should be able to deliver the extra funds for the NHS without compromising his fiscal target or having to find savings elsewhere"". A Treasury spokesman said great progress had been made repairing the public finances, but added: ""Government borrowing is down by three-quarters and debt is due to begin its first sustained fall in a generation, but we cannot be complacent."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The chancellor has passed on the deficit to his colleagues in other departments.... hard-pressed families and underpaid public sector workers have been made to pay for the price of Tory failure on the economy, with brutal cuts to social provision and relentless pay restraint.""

Javid apology for Windrush removals,"The government has reviewed 11,800 Windrush generation cases Eighteen members of the Windrush generation who could have been wrongfully removed or detained are to get a formal apology. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said a review of 11,800 cases had identified the 18 as those ""most likely to have suffered detriment"". They are among 164 people who may have been wrongfully deported or detained. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the ""overdue"" apology was ""nowhere near good enough"". ""The government has still not got a final figure on how many of our fellow citizens were deported, forced into so-called 'voluntary removals' or detained as prisoners in their own country,"" she said. She also said it was an ""insult"" a compensation scheme being set up by the government is not yet running and called for a ""hardship fund"" to be ""set up immediately"". Who are the Windrush generation? In pictures: The pioneering Windrush generation How do you prove you've been living in the UK? The Windrush generationrefers to those who moved to the UK from Caribbean countriesbetween 1948 and 1971 but were not given proper documentation proving their indefinite right to remain. They said the lack of documentation had posed numerous problems, for example getting jobs, accessing healthcare or even remaining in the UK. In an update to the Home Affairs Committee,external, Mr Javid said the 18 people arrived in the UK before 1973 and stayed permanently but were ""unable to demonstrate their continuous residence here which led to them being removed or detained in an immigration removal centre or a reporting centre"". He said 11 voluntarily left the country, with some having been served with immigration enforcement papers informing them they had no right to be in the UK, while seven were subsequently released without being removed. Mr Javid said any of those who have left the UK will be helped to return. ""The experiences faced by some members of the Windrush generation are completely unacceptable and I am committed to righting the wrongs of the past,"" he said. ""I would like to personally apologise to those identified in our review and am committed to providing them with the support and compensation they deserve. ""We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again - which is why I have asked an independent adviser to look at what lessons we can learn from Windrush."" This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Mr Javid said the way all 164 individuals were treated and the ""degree of detriment"" varies considerably. Other than the 18 who are getting formal apologies, there were 72 cases where people were ""detained temporarily"" for between a few minutes and a few hours at the UK border before being allowed to enter the country. A further 74 ""appear to have left the UK"" for at least two years thereby losing their entitlement to indefinite leave to remain. The Home Office said they include people who were then either denied entry and removed at the border, or were removed or detained having overstayed. Amnesty International said apologising to ""just 18"" people was ""worrying"". Steve Valdez-Symonds, from the human rights group, said it ""brings into question whether the Home Office has a realistic grasp on all the people it has wrongly detained and removed following the exposure of its appalling treatment of the Windrush generation"". Labour MP David Lammy, whose parents were Windrush arrivals, said the 18 were a ""drop in the ocean"". ""The apology is crocodile tears and an insult to people still not given hardship fund, left jobless, homeless and unable to afford food,"" he said. The Windrush generation is named after the MV Empire Windrush Mr Javid also gave updated figures on the number of Windrush migrants whose status in the UK has been confirmed following the establishment of a taskforce in April. A total of 2,272 have received documents confirming their right to be in the UK, out of 6,507 people who had contacted a helpline and been referred for a call back. Those affected are named after the MV Empire Windrush, the ship which arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948, bringing workers from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other islands, as a response to post-war labour shortages in the UK. Many stayed in the UK for decades, setting up homes and starting families but the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for Windrush arrivals to prove they are in the UK legally.

House of Fraser's main London store savedThe chain's new owners agree terms to keep the store on London's Oxford Street open.BusinessComments,"House of Fraser's flagship Oxford Street store will now stay open after the chain's new owner agreed revised terms with its landlord. The store had been due to close under a restructuring plan that House of Fraser announced in June. However, the department store group fell into administration earlier this month, and was bought by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. The deal is the first covering a House of Fraser store since the takeover. The store was one of the 31 earmarked for closure under the CVA restructuring deal that was first struck before Mr Ashley stepped in with his Â£90m rescue bid. His plan is to keep 80% of House of Fraser's 59 stores across the UK open. A spokesperson said they were working through the list on ""a store-by-store basis"". Mulberry shares collapse on profit warning House of Fraser owes big brands millions Ashley makes House of Fraser store promise Property giant CBRE, which is advising Sports Direct, said negotiations over the Oxford Street outlet had been conducted at ""great speed"". James Keany from CBRE said: ""This deal only happened because all parties realised it was better to keep the store open and fully operational. ""It was a real case of landlord and tenant genuinely working together and at great speed. Everyone was sensible about the terms of the transaction."" Mike Ashley's Sports Direct bought the chain just hours after it went into administration earlier this month. This means it is not legally obliged to pay suppliers money owed before its Â£90m buyout, as their debts were part of the administration. Mr Ashley has said he intends to turn the chain into the ""Harrods of the High Street"". On Monday,it was revealed more than 600 jobs were under threatat two House of Fraser warehouses which supply deliveries to stores and customers. The GMB union said 627 staff at the two warehouses were told on Friday that they were at risk of redundancy. XPO Logistics operates the sites, in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire. Last week, it stopped processing orders due to a payment dispute, forcing the retailer to cancel and refund all online orders. The company was thought to be owed Â£30.4m by House of Fraser when it fell into administration, according to administrator EY, but sources close to the the warehouse operator say it is owed around Â£12m. XPO Logistics is one of a number of suppliers that have been left out of pocket. In total, EY has estimated suppliers are owed Â£484m.

Madonna's 'self-indulgent' Aretha tribute,"This video can not be played Madonna paying tribute to Aretha Franklin Madonna has hit back at critics who claimed her tribute to Aretha Franklin at Monday's VMAs was self-indulgent. The singer posted on Instagram explaining that she had been asked to share ""any anecdotes I had in my career connected to Aretha Franklin"". In the post, Madonna went on to accuse people of having ""short attention spans"" and being ""quick to judge"". The 60-year old delivered a five-minute speech ending with her giving thanks to Franklin for ""empowering all of us"". But her speech at the awards ceremony in New York didn't go down well with some viewers who thought she spoke too much about herself and too little about the late Queen of Soul. Madonna said: ""I did not intend to do a tribute to her! That would be impossible in 2 minutes with all the noise and tinsel of an award show.

House of Fraser's main London store saved,"House of Fraser's flagship Oxford Street store will now stay open after the chain's new owner agreed revised terms with its landlord. The store had been due to close under a restructuring plan that House of Fraser announced in June. However, the department store group fell into administration earlier this month, and was bought by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. The deal is the first covering a House of Fraser store since the takeover. The store was one of the 31 earmarked for closure under the CVA restructuring deal that was first struck before Mr Ashley stepped in with his Â£90m rescue bid. His plan is to keep 80% of House of Fraser's 59 stores across the UK open. A spokesperson said they were working through the list on ""a store-by-store basis"". Mulberry shares collapse on profit warning House of Fraser owes big brands millions Ashley makes House of Fraser store promise Property giant CBRE, which is advising Sports Direct, said negotiations over the Oxford Street outlet had been conducted at ""great speed"". James Keany from CBRE said: ""This deal only happened because all parties realised it was better to keep the store open and fully operational. ""It was a real case of landlord and tenant genuinely working together and at great speed. Everyone was sensible about the terms of the transaction."" Mike Ashley's Sports Direct bought the chain just hours after it went into administration earlier this month. This means it is not legally obliged to pay suppliers money owed before its Â£90m buyout, as their debts were part of the administration. Mr Ashley has said he intends to turn the chain into the ""Harrods of the High Street"". On Monday,it was revealed more than 600 jobs were under threatat two House of Fraser warehouses which supply deliveries to stores and customers. The GMB union said 627 staff at the two warehouses were told on Friday that they were at risk of redundancy. XPO Logistics operates the sites, in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire. Last week, it stopped processing orders due to a payment dispute, forcing the retailer to cancel and refund all online orders. The company was thought to be owed Â£30.4m by House of Fraser when it fell into administration, according to administrator EY, but sources close to the the warehouse operator say it is owed around Â£12m. XPO Logistics is one of a number of suppliers that have been left out of pocket. In total, EY has estimated suppliers are owed Â£484m.

Hunt wants 'malign' Russia to face action,"This video can not be played The foreign secretary tells Today that the EU should match US sanctions against Russia Europe should impose further sanctions on Russia in response to its ""malign"" behaviour around the world, Jeremy Hunt has said on his first visit to the US as foreign secretary. He called on the EU to replicate Washington's ""comprehensive"" response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack. The US is set to ban Russian exports of security-sensitive goods following the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Europe must engage with Russia but be ""blunt"" about its actions, he said. Labour warned against new sanctions which it said would ""further ratchet up international tensions"". And Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov accused the UK of arrogance in trying to ""dictate"" the EU's policy towards Russia when it was on the verge of leaving the organisation. The Skripals were poisoned in Salisbury, Wiltshire, in March. The British government has accused Russia of being behind the attack, but Moscow denies involvement. In June, two people in nearby Amesbury fell ill after being exposed to the same nerve agent, Novichok. One of them - Dawn Sturgess, 44 - later died. Murder inquiry after Novichok woman dies Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? In a speech in Washington, Mr Hunt said Moscow must be aware that there is a ""serious price"" to be paid for repeated violations of the established rules of international conduct. He cited ""foreign attempts"" to manipulate elections as one of the reasons behind the decline in confidence in Western democratic systems. But he also said governments in Europe must do more to ""get their houses in order"" by addressing the causes of economic and social resentment associated with the growth of populism, such as the squeeze on living standards and concerns over immigration. Despite Mr Hunt's comments, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said there was ""no appetite"" among EU member states for further economic sanctions against Moscow, with some countries ""suspicious"" of action taken so far. Russia faces US sanctions over poisoning UK to expel 23 Russian diplomats During a three-day trip to the US, Mr Hunt - who succeeded Boris Johnson in July - will meet his counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as addressing the United Nations Security Council about the international fight against the Islamic State group and other Islamist terror groups. The visit comes as the US is set to ratchet up the pressure on Moscow over the poisoning of former Russian agent Mr Skripal and his daughter in the Wiltshire city in March. This video can not be played Newsnight: The night the Skripals were admitted to hospital The US State Department is expected to confirm its intention to proceed with a ban on defence exports and certain government financial assistance in response to the attack, which it has blamed on Moscow. US officials are also expected to warn that further sanctions - including wider curbs on exports and US bank credit to the Russian government - could be imposed after three months without assurances that Russia is no longer using chemical and biological weapons and is complying with inspection and verification procedures. The UK said it is highly likely that the Russian government, which has denied all involvement, was to blame for the attacks - which prompted a wave of expulsions of Russian diplomats from the UK and across Europe. Mr Hunt said the Salisbury attack was part of a pattern of behaviour from Russia, including the annexation of Crimea and its support for the Assad regime in Syria, which made the world ""more dangerous"". The US president, Donald Trump, was asked in an interview with Reuters whether he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia. ""I'm not considering it at all, no,"" he said. ""I would consider it if they do something that would be good for us. But I wouldn't consider it without that."" USA and Russia: What are sanctions? Mr Hunt called on the EU to ""ensure its sanctions against Russia are comprehensive and we truly stand shoulder to shoulder with the US"". ""That means calling out and responding to transgressions with one voice whenever they occur, from the streets of Salisbury to the fate of Crimea,"" he said. ""Those who do not share our values need to know that there will always be a serious price to pay if red lines are crossed - whether territorial incursions, the use of banned weapons or, increasingly, cyber-attacks"". Police have launched a murder inquiry after the death of Dawn Sturgess following her exposure to Novichok The Foreign Office said Mr Hunt wanted to ensure existing sanctions on associates of President Putin and state-backed entities were having their intended effect and to galvanise efforts to extend them where needed. But Labour's Barry Gardiner said the UK and its allies should be trying to ""normalise"" relations with Russia as Moscow's co-operation was needed to help resolve the conflict in Syria and deal with Iran. ""I think imposing new sanctions on Russia would further ratchet up international tensions,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""I don't think it's the right way to go."" In his speech at the US Institute of Peace, Mr Hunt warned of multiple economic and security threats to the international order and said the once ""rock-solid"" transatlantic alliance will be undermined if opponents are ""in any doubt about our red lines"". Arguments over the funding of Nato and global trade have soured relations between the US and Europe since Donald Trump's election in 2016. While accepting arguments of Russia's potential culpability for the Salisbury attacks, Mr Trump has nevertheless pressed for better relations with President Putin and cast doubt on evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.

Breaking|Breaking newsJavid apology for Windrush removalsSome 18 members of UK's Windrush generation who could have been wrongfully removed or detained to get formal apologyUK,"The government has reviewed 11,800 Windrush generation cases Eighteen members of the Windrush generation who could have been wrongfully removed or detained are to get a formal apology. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said a review of 11,800 cases had identified the 18 as those ""most likely to have suffered detriment"". They are among 164 people who may have been wrongfully deported or detained. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the ""overdue"" apology was ""nowhere near good enough"". ""The government has still not got a final figure on how many of our fellow citizens were deported, forced into so-called 'voluntary removals' or detained as prisoners in their own country,"" she said. She also said it was an ""insult"" a compensation scheme being set up by the government is not yet running and called for a ""hardship fund"" to be ""set up immediately"". Who are the Windrush generation? In pictures: The pioneering Windrush generation How do you prove you've been living in the UK? The Windrush generationrefers to those who moved to the UK from Caribbean countriesbetween 1948 and 1971 but were not given proper documentation proving their indefinite right to remain. They said the lack of documentation had posed numerous problems, for example getting jobs, accessing healthcare or even remaining in the UK. In an update to the Home Affairs Committee,external, Mr Javid said the 18 people arrived in the UK before 1973 and stayed permanently but were ""unable to demonstrate their continuous residence here which led to them being removed or detained in an immigration removal centre or a reporting centre"". He said 11 voluntarily left the country, with some having been served with immigration enforcement papers informing them they had no right to be in the UK, while seven were subsequently released without being removed. Mr Javid said any of those who have left the UK will be helped to return. ""The experiences faced by some members of the Windrush generation are completely unacceptable and I am committed to righting the wrongs of the past,"" he said. ""I would like to personally apologise to those identified in our review and am committed to providing them with the support and compensation they deserve. ""We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again - which is why I have asked an independent adviser to look at what lessons we can learn from Windrush."" This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Mr Javid said the way all 164 individuals were treated and the ""degree of detriment"" varies considerably. Other than the 18 who are getting formal apologies, there were 72 cases where people were ""detained temporarily"" for between a few minutes and a few hours at the UK border before being allowed to enter the country. A further 74 ""appear to have left the UK"" for at least two years thereby losing their entitlement to indefinite leave to remain. The Home Office said they include people who were then either denied entry and removed at the border, or were removed or detained having overstayed. Amnesty International said apologising to ""just 18"" people was ""worrying"". Steve Valdez-Symonds, from the human rights group, said it ""brings into question whether the Home Office has a realistic grasp on all the people it has wrongly detained and removed following the exposure of its appalling treatment of the Windrush generation"". Labour MP David Lammy, whose parents were Windrush arrivals, said the 18 were a ""drop in the ocean"". ""The apology is crocodile tears and an insult to people still not given hardship fund, left jobless, homeless and unable to afford food,"" he said. The Windrush generation is named after the MV Empire Windrush Mr Javid also gave updated figures on the number of Windrush migrants whose status in the UK has been confirmed following the establishment of a taskforce in April. A total of 2,272 have received documents confirming their right to be in the UK, out of 6,507 people who had contacted a helpline and been referred for a call back. Those affected are named after the MV Empire Windrush, the ship which arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948, bringing workers from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other islands, as a response to post-war labour shortages in the UK. Many stayed in the UK for decades, setting up homes and starting families but the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for Windrush arrivals to prove they are in the UK legally.

"Only 6% of people work 9 to 5, survey suggestsJust 6% of UK workers now work the traditional hours of 9am to 5pm, research suggests.Business","Traditional workplace hours of 9am to 5pm are now only the norm for a minority of workers, research suggests. Just 6% of people in the UK now work such hours, a YouGov survey found. Almost half of people worked flexibly with arrangements such as job sharing or compressed hours, allowing them to juggle other commitments, it found. Anna Whitehouse, a campaigner whose own flexible working request was refused by her employer, said there were still misconceptions about such arrangements. 9 to 5? Make it 8 till 4, actually... Male employees want flexible work too 'Many workers penalised' over flexi-time In her case, her employer refused her request for 15 minutes flexibility at the start and end of each day to enable her to drop off and pick up her children from nursery. ""They denied it because they said it would open the floodgates for other people to request the same thing."" Mrs Whitehouse, an author and blogger known as Mrs Pukka, said the refusal prompted her to resign and blog about the experience. ""My background is as a journalist so I just started writing. I'm not a campaigner or an activist, but I had a moment of frustration and went with it."" Since then she has started the Flex Appeal, aimed at convincing firms to trial flexible working and also to make people aware of their right to request flexible working. ""It's not about parents, it's about people. There's so much research out there showing working flexibly is better for mental health and for productivity,"" she said. Polling firm YouGov surveyed over 4,000 adults for the survey, which was commissioned by fast-food chain McDonald's. Every employee in the UK has the statutory right to request flexible working after 26 weeks of employment. Requests should be in writing, stating the date of the request and whether any previous application has been made and the date of that application. Requests and appeals must be considered and decided upon within three months of the receipt of the request. Employers must have a sound business reason for rejecting any request. Employees can only make one request in any 12-month period. Can your job be as flexible as this? Is flexible working biased against non-parents? How to ask the boss for flexible working The study found most full-time workers would like to start work at 8am and finish by 4pm, hours chosen by 37% of those surveyed. The second most popular choice was 7am to 3pm, chosen by 21% of those surveyed. It found flexibility was important to people of all ages and life stages, including parents and students, for example. Those who did work flexibly said it improved their motivation and encouraged them to stay in a job for longer. Peter Cheese, chief executive of HR industry body the CIPD, said organisations willing to offer flexible working would attract a higher number of applicants. But he said more firms needed to step up: ""Uptake of flexible working is still low and most jobs are not advertised as being open to different working arrangements,"" he said. 9 to 5?

Women 'denied Caesarean choice',"This video can not be played 'I had a haemorrhage after being denied Caesarean' Women at 75% of UK maternity units are being denied their right to choose a Caesarean, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told. NICE guidance says women should be allowed to opt for a planned Caesarean even if it is not for medical reasons. Of the 146 trusts that shared their policies with the Birthrights charity:,external26% fully complied with the guidelines, 15% refused all elective Caesareans. The government said women should be given the right options as appropriate. Under the guidelines, women requesting a Caesarean with no other medical reason ""should be offered appropriate discussion and support - but ultimately, if they are making an informed choice, a Caesarean should be offered"". They also state that if one obstetrician is unwilling to perform an elective Caesarean, the woman should be referred to another who will. Birthrights, the human rights in childbirth charity, used a Freedom of Information request to ask 153 trusts providing maternity care how they applied the guidance. Of the 146 that replied: 26% fully complied with the guidelines 47% partially complied 15% refused maternal requests outright 12% did not seem to have a clear position This video can not be played ""I had to fight for my C-section while in labour"" One woman whose request was denied was Lucie Tidman, 32. When she gave birth to her first child, six years ago, she had a serious haemorrhage and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). During her second pregnancy, she asked for a Caesarean, to avoid any more trauma, but was told it was not possible. She had another haemorrhage and her baby went to neo-natal intensive care. ""She had to have rescue breaths and my other half saw her come out purple,"" she said. ""She got taken one way and I got taken to theatre. It was horrific."" Lucie's baby was treated in neo-natal intensive care earlier this year Ms Tidman said the consultant she had met had not listened to her concerns. ""He was just going on the fact of 'this is your second birth, there's no reason why it should happen again'. But he didn't look into why we were anxious about it."" This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? Caesarean sections are when a baby is delivered by making a surgical cut into the abdomen and womb. They fall into three categories: elective - at the mother's request planned - usually for medical reasons, such as the baby is either in the wrong position or very large emergency - usually because of complications during labour More than a quarter of all babies born in England are now delivered by either elective or emergency Caesarean. Mental health professionals agreed that cases like Ms Tidman's needed to be taken more seriously. Consultant perinatal psychiatrist Rebecca Moore said: ""For some, non-mental-health-based colleagues, perhaps there's a perception about anxiety, or a misunderstanding about how severe anxiety can be for some women, so women are often denied Caesareans perhaps because there's a lack of understanding about how unwell they actually are."" Birthrights said it handled more requests for support from women unable to access a Caesarean section than any other issue. It said the reasons women gave for wanting Caesareans included previous traumatic births, mental ill-health, childhood sexual abuse, or having made an informed decision after examining the evidence. The Birthrights charity said some women were being told they could not have a Caesarean due to cost Its chief executive, Rebecca Schiller, said women faced a lot of confusion over whether a Caesarean would be granted, with decisions varying between trusts and even within trusts depending on which doctor or midwife they saw. ""Some women say they have had cost quoted at them - 'You can't have a Caesarean because it will cost too much,' the trust might be fined, that the clinical commissioning groups themselves won't fund those requests - but there doesn't seem to be one reason,"" she said. The charity said it had been told trusts had even been telling women they would not be allowed to elect a Caesarean, either when they had been being booked on to maternity care or in a letter before they had even been spoken to. It costs about Â£700 more to have a Caesarean, compared with a vaginal delivery. Prof Baskaran Thilaganathan, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ""I don't think there is any circumstance under which, if you feel a woman has been informed, understands her choices and chooses to, that you could deny her the right to that."" Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives said: ""Women must be given the information to explore their views and feelings about Caesarean birth, to enable them to come to an informed decision about their preferred type of birth. ""This information should reflect the individual woman's current and previous medical, obstetric and psychological history."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""It is vital that women feel informed and supported in making safe choices around childbirth and we expect doctors and other NHS staff to work closely with mums-to-be to make sure they are given the right options where appropriate."" The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, where Ms Tidman gave birth, said it practised evidence-based care with respect to Caesarean sections. ""If a woman requests a Caesarean section when there is no clinical indication, we follow the guidelines... but only after thorough exploration of all the issues,"" a spokesman said.

Trump relaxes rules around cyber-attacks,"The previous rules required multi-agency sign-off President Trump has signed an order relaxing rules around the use of cyber-weapons,the Wall Street Journal reports.,external It is a reversal of guidelines, drawn up under President Obama, which required a large number of federal agencies to be involved in any decision to launch a cyber-attack. Specific details of what the new rules will be are classified information. One official said the US was taking ""an offensive step forward"". The US administration is under pressure to deal with cyber-threats, amid growing concerns that state-sponsored hacks could hit critical infrastructure. Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, told the BBC: ""We are in a era when certain governments are acting aggressively in cyber-space, and that is rightly condemned by governments such as that in the US. ""To respond in kind is not necessarily the way to de-escalate the situation."" He added: ""You wouldn't allow a pre-emptive physical attack without thorough analysis and approval at the highest levels, so why would cyber-attacks be any different?"" Hacking the US mid-terms? It's child's play US warns of supply chain cyber-attacks US imposes new Russia sanctions over cyber-attacks The rules for using cyber-weapons set out by President Obama involved multi-agency sign-off, but were criticised by some law-makers as being too bureaucratic.

UK can be exporting superpower - Fox,"Britain can be a ""21st Century exporting superpower"", Liam Fox is expected to say in a speech detailing the government's post-Brexit ambitions. The international trade secretary will say he wants exports as a proportion of UK GDP to rise from 30% to 35%. Last year exports of goods and services rose to a record high of Â£620 billion. The Federation of Small Businesses praised the aspiration - but said more financial incentives, such as grants and ""export vouchers"", were needed. Mike Cherry from the FSB said small companies could use the vouchers to invest in things such as translation services or market research. The government's UK Export Finance department - which offers financial help to exporters - already has the capacityto support Â£50bn of exports,external. Analysis by BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed Exports from the UK areat a record high,external- boosted by the weakness in the value of the pound and stronger global growth than expected. Yes, there are uncertainties around Brexit - and if there is ""no deal"" the economic effects could be dramatic and negative. But many businesses report full order books, as British companies that do export, particularly outside the EU, find plenty of willing customers. The government now says it wants to build on that success - admitting that although Britain does ""punch above its weight"" in export markets it also punches below its potential. Some 400,000 firms that could export goods and services have no international presence. In a speech setting out the government's export strategy, Mr Fox will say the UK should ""set its sights high"" as it leaves the EU. He is expected to tell a business audience in London that UK firms are ""superbly placed to capitalise on the rapid changes in the global economic environment"". Minister for trade and export promotion, Baroness Rona Fairhead, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she understood businesses wanted ""stability and certainty"" in the short term and there were concerns about establishing a trade deal with the EU. But she said the government also needed to focus on the long-term future of UK companies - and that was in exports. ""Research shows that businesses that export actually are healthier, make more profit, employ more people and in fact are more sustainable,"" she said. ""Our message to small family businesses is take the plunge, we will provide support to you because you are more likely have a flourishing business that you can pass on to your generations."" What does Made in Britain mean for Brexit? The challenges ahead for a UK/US trade deal after Brexit But shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said an export strategy couldn't be based on ""one-off arms sales"". ""After record trade deficit figures, staff cuts in trade promotion and delays to tradeshow funding for business, the government is finally publishing an export strategy - some two years after the trade department was established,"" he said. ""Our businesses need a strong future export relationship with the EU. The Tory export strategy has thus far been based on controversial one-off arms sales."" He said a Labour government would deliver a customs union with ""our most important trade partners"". Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI (Confederation of British Industry), said the strategy was ""a timely signal"" that the government was committed to improving the UK's competitiveness. ""The CBI strongly supports the ambition to make exports 35% of GDP, which will put the UK out in front of many of our international competitors,"" she said. ""We estimate that in every region of the country there are around 10% of businesses that could export, but don't, and we look forward to working alongside the government to support and inspire them to seize the opportunity.""

"Only 6% of people work 9 to 5, survey suggests","Traditional workplace hours of 9am to 5pm are now only the norm for a minority of workers, research suggests. Just 6% of people in the UK now work such hours, a YouGov survey found. Almost half of people worked flexibly with arrangements such as job sharing or compressed hours, allowing them to juggle other commitments, it found. Anna Whitehouse, a campaigner whose own flexible working request was refused by her employer, said there were still misconceptions about such arrangements. 9 to 5? Make it 8 till 4, actually... Male employees want flexible work too 'Many workers penalised' over flexi-time In her case, her employer refused her request for 15 minutes flexibility at the start and end of each day to enable her to drop off and pick up her children from nursery. ""They denied it because they said it would open the floodgates for other people to request the same thing."" Mrs Whitehouse, an author and blogger known as Mrs Pukka, said the refusal prompted her to resign and blog about the experience. ""My background is as a journalist so I just started writing. I'm not a campaigner or an activist, but I had a moment of frustration and went with it."" Since then she has started the Flex Appeal, aimed at convincing firms to trial flexible working and also to make people aware of their right to request flexible working. ""It's not about parents, it's about people. There's so much research out there showing working flexibly is better for mental health and for productivity,"" she said. Polling firm YouGov surveyed over 4,000 adults for the survey, which was commissioned by fast-food chain McDonald's. Every employee in the UK has the statutory right to request flexible working after 26 weeks of employment. Requests should be in writing, stating the date of the request and whether any previous application has been made and the date of that application. Requests and appeals must be considered and decided upon within three months of the receipt of the request. Employers must have a sound business reason for rejecting any request. Employees can only make one request in any 12-month period. Can your job be as flexible as this? Is flexible working biased against non-parents? How to ask the boss for flexible working The study found most full-time workers would like to start work at 8am and finish by 4pm, hours chosen by 37% of those surveyed. The second most popular choice was 7am to 3pm, chosen by 21% of those surveyed. It found flexibility was important to people of all ages and life stages, including parents and students, for example. Those who did work flexibly said it improved their motivation and encouraged them to stay in a job for longer. Peter Cheese, chief executive of HR industry body the CIPD, said organisations willing to offer flexible working would attract a higher number of applicants. But he said more firms needed to step up: ""Uptake of flexible working is still low and most jobs are not advertised as being open to different working arrangements,"" he said. 9 to 5?

"Big prostate steam treatment NHS approvedNHS hospitals can start offering it to men with benign prostate enlargement, says regulator.Health","The NHS can start offering a new steam treatment for benign prostate enlargement, says the regulator, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The procedure is minimally invasive and can be done under local anaesthetic without an overnight hospital stay. It involves passing a small probe up the urethra to inject a puff of steam into the troublesome area. The steam kills off some of the enlarged tissue to ease symptoms. The dead cells are reabsorbed by the body. An enlarged prostate is common - affecting one in three men over the age of 50 - and forces the urethra (urine tube) to narrow, causing a variety of problems, including difficulty emptying the bladder. Drugs or an operation can help but NICE says men should now be offered another treatment option. The steam treatment, called Rezum, is an alternative to invasive surgery and is said to have fewer side-effects, such as impotence and incontinence. Patients may have to take antibiotics and have a urinary catheter for some days after the procedure. Some activities, including sexual intercourse, should be avoided for up to one month. It is the latest ofseveral minimally invasive proceduresfor the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is the medical term for an enlarged prostate gland - the gland located in the pelvis between the penis and the bladder It is not a cancer and it isn't usually a serious threat to health The cause is unclear but it is more common in older men Symptoms may be mild and not need treatment but for others they can be troublesome Prof Richard Hindley, a consultant urologist at Hampshire Hospitals, has been providing the treatment to some of his patients, with ""very good results"". ""The treatment involves a tiny water droplet being heated to 103C and then injected via the urethra into the prostate,"" he said. ""It can be performed quickly, with each procedure taking less than 20 minutes. ""The number of injections required is titrated according to the size of the gland."" Prof Kevin Harris from NICE, said: ""Approving this procedure gives men the chance to talk to their clinician about which is right for them.""

Trump fears 'perjury trap' in Mueller probeThe US president also suggested he could take over the investigation into alleged Russian meddling.US & Canada,"President Trump has repeatedly referred to the Mueller investigation as a ""witch hunt"" US President Donald Trump has said he is worried he might face perjury charges if he gives statements under oath to the investigation into Russia's alleged role in his election victory. He told Reuters news agency he feared any discrepancies between his account and others could be used against him. Mr Trump also suggested he could take over the investigation run by special counsel Robert Mueller, but said he'd decided to stay out of it. He has called the inquiry a witch hunt. Russia also strongly denies claims it interfered in the 2016 election, which saw Mr Trump defeat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. In the Reuters interview, Mr Trump expressed concern that any statement he made to investigators could be compared with that of others,externalwho have testified, such as former FBI chief James Comey, and that any discrepancies could be used against him. Who's who in Trump-Russia drama? All you need to know about Trump Russia story He was echoing previous concerns by his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who said Mr Trump could be ""trapped into perjury"". ""So if I say something and he (Comey) says something, and it's my word against his, and he's best friends with Mueller, so Mueller might say: 'Well, I believe Comey,' and even if I'm telling the truth, that makes me a liar. That's no good,"" President Trump said. Mr Trump also asserted that he could, if he wanted to, intervene in the investigation, but added that he had chosen not to do so for now. ""I've decided to stay out. Now I don't have to stay out. I can go in, and I could do whatever - I could run it if I want. But I decided to stay out,"" he said. ""I'm totally allowed to be involved if I wanted to be. So far, I haven't chosen to be involved. I'll stay out."" In an interview with NBC on Sunday, Mr Giuliani was asked whether the Trump team was stalling about a possible testimony at the Mueller inquiry. Lawyer Rudy Giuliani was widely ridiculed for suggesting ""truth isn't truth"" Mr Giuliani said: ""I'm not going to be rushed into having him testify so he can be trapped into perjury."" He added: ""When you tell me that he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth."" NBC host Chuck Todd countered,external: ""Truth is truth."" Mr Giuliani responded by saying: ""Truth isn't truth."" That comment was widely mocked on social media. Special counsel Mueller is investigating whether President Trump's campaign team colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the presidential election. In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had used a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media in an attempt to turn the election against Mrs Clinton. Thirty-two people have now been indicted, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team and 25 Russians. The president's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is the first person to go on trial as a result of Mr Mueller's investigation. However, the charges are not related to the US election but instead to tax evasion and money-laundering stemming from his political consultancy work in Ukraine. The jury in his case is in its fourth day of deliberation to reach a verdict. 'Alternative facts' or falsehoods? Who's who in Russia drama?

Eleven hikers killed in Italy flash flood,"This video can not be played Helicopter rescue saves hiker trapped by flash floods At least 10 hikers were killed and others have been rescued after flash flooding in southern Italy. They were walking in a gorge in a national park in the Calabria region when they were hit by a torrent swollen by heavy rain. Officials say 23 people have been rescued. An eight-year-old girl was airlifted to hospital with hypothermia. Italy's environment minister said he was ""99.9% sure"" no more people were missing. Three hikers in their early twenties were found safe, Italian media report. An earlier death toll was revised down from 11, due to confusion caused by ""overlapping reports"", according to officials. Carlo Tansi, head of civil protection, told reporters that when the hikers were hit by the water they were ""catapulted out like bullets"" and were washed down the valley for about 3km (two miles). ""The Raganello Gorge is narrow and tall, it can get up to 1km (3,200ft) high,"" he said. ""The gorge filled up with water in a really short time.""

Public finances see Â£2bn surplus in July,"The government's finances were in surplus by Â£2bn last month, the biggest surplus for July in 18 years, official figures show. The figure was up from a surplus of Â£1bn a year ago. At the same time, borrowing in the April-to-July period fell to its lowest level since 2002. Analysts said the reduction in borrowing should give Chancellor Philip Hammond extra money to play with in the Budget this autumn. Borrowing for the financial year so far has reached Â£12.8bn, Â£8.5bn less than in the same period in 2017,the Office for National Statistics said.,external Kamal Ahmed: Why is government borrowing falling? Public sector net debt, excluding public sector banks, was Â£1,777.5bn, equivalent to 84.3% of GDP. That is Â£17.5bn higher than a year earlier, but lower as a percentage of GDP than in 2017, when it was 86%. Andy Verity, economics correspondent July is usually a good month for the Exchequer. Because self-employed people make the second of two self-assessed tax payments in July, the chancellor tends to enjoy more money flowing in than flowing out in spending. But last month was the biggest surplus in 18 years. Since the start of the financial year, the public sector - government, local government and other publicly owned corporations - has only had to borrow Â£12.8bn to plug the gap between its income and its spending. That is the lowest borrowing since 2002 - enough to encourage opponents of austerity to question if it is still necessary. Those who want to keep austerity will point out that the debt - all the accumulated deficits of the past - is still very high by the standards of recent decades. And it's climbing. However, their opponents might retort, it's shrinking as a proportion of the economy. Other things being equal, that means it should be getting easier, not harder to manage. The public finances are prone to surpluses in July because of money coming in from self-assessed income tax returns. Last month, receipts from self-assessed income tax were Â£9bn, an increase of Â£1bn on July 2017. That is the highest level of July self-assessed income tax receipts since records began in 1999. Over the financial year to March 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces the official government forecasts, expects the public sector to borrow Â£37.1bn. That amounts to about one-quarter of what it borrowed in 2009-10, at the peak of the financial crisis. ""Public borrowing has remained on a sharp downward trend, creating scope for the chancellor to pause the fiscal consolidation next year and still meet his self-prescribed targets,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""If this trend persists, borrowing will total just Â£23.7bn this year, much less than the Â£37.1bn forecast by the OBR in the Spring Statement."" Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, was more cautious, pointing out that ""an undershoot of this magnitude is unlikely"". She added: ""The recent improvement has been partly due to temporary factors, such as the timing of gilt issuance and redemptions."" However, she said Mr Hammond ""should be able to deliver the extra funds for the NHS without compromising his fiscal target or having to find savings elsewhere"". A Treasury spokesman said great progress had been made repairing the public finances, but added: ""Government borrowing is down by three-quarters and debt is due to begin its first sustained fall in a generation, but we cannot be complacent."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The chancellor has passed on the deficit to his colleagues in other departments.... hard-pressed families and underpaid public sector workers have been made to pay for the price of Tory failure on the economy, with brutal cuts to social provision and relentless pay restraint.""

Challenges for UK's top diplomat,"Such is the continuity of the British state that Boris Johnson had hardly left the Foreign Office before his successor, Jeremy Hunt, was being ushered in to meet senior officials and get his feet under the table. He was even introduced to Palmerston, the office cat named after the former prime minister and statesman who built the grand Foreign Office buildings in King Charles Street that Mr Hunt will now occupy. In other countries, there are appointment procedures and parliamentary hearings. Here, the prime minister can play musical chairs with her ministers with the brutal stroke of pen and patronage. Thus is a politician with no known foreign policy experience thrust into the great office of secretary of state for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The question now is what will he do with it? Mr Hunt is by definition inexperienced, so there will be time spent getting up to speed. When John Major was made foreign secretary by Margaret Thatcher in July 1989, he had the rare luxury of being able to spend the summer reading himself in while on holiday at a colleague's home in Spain. Mr Hunt has already met Palmerston, the Foreign Office's resident cat Of course, he held the job for only a few months but never has a new foreign secretary been so well briefed. It is a privilege that will be denied Mr Hunt. On Tuesday, he is attending the western Balkans summit in London where Britain is looking to bring stability to the region and show its continued commitment to European security after Brexit - not an easy subject for one's first day in the office. On Wednesday, Mr Hunt is expected to go to Brussels for the Nato summit where Donald Trump will push for Britain and other European nations to spend more on their defence. If the president threatens to reduce the US defence commitment in Europe or even refuse to support countries not spending the Nato target of 2% of their national output on defence, how might Mr Hunt think Britain should respond? Then, on Thursday, the foreign secretary will be part of the team playing host to the US president as he visits Britain. How does Mr Hunt think Britain should respond to Mr Trump's trade tariffs on EU steel and punitive sanctions on British banks trading with Iran? Mr Hunt is expected to attend the upcoming Nato summit And then, early next week, Mr Trump will move on to Helsinki to meet President Putin. If the US makes concessions to Moscow, how should Mr Hunt respond so soon after the death of a UK national at the hands of a suspected Russian nerve agent attack? All that in just the new foreign secretary's first week. Mr Hunt's greatest challenge, though, will be to lift his head above these day-to-day events and crises to look to the horizon. He will have to craft a longer term strategy for Britain's foreign policy. The government has an approach called ""global Britain"". But this has long been criticised as a slogan without a policy. Jeremy Hunt replaces Boris Johnson as foreign secretary What did Boris Johnson achieve as foreign secretary? Mr Hunt now has an opportunity to think, to consult, to consider and begin to sketch out a vision of what role Britain should play in the world in five, 10 years' time. What is the UK's approach to an increasingly independent-minded and less transatlantic United States, to a Europe beset with political instability, and to the rising powers of China and India? What should Britain's policy be to Syria, Yemen, and North Korea? How should it respond to the growing challenge of migration from sub-Saharan Africa in coming decades? In his first words in post, Mr Hunt acknowledged the scale of the task before him, talking of the need to project a strong, confident Britain on the international stage. ""This is a time when the world is looking at us as a country wondering what type of country we're going to be in a post-Brexit world,"" he said. ""And what I want to say to them is that Britain is going to be a dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country and will be a strong and confident voice in the world."" Note that phrase ""dependable ally"". Some foreign politicians and diplomats struggled to trust Boris Johnson, sometimes not sure when he was speaking for himself or his government. The former head of the Foreign Office, Lord Ricketts, said: ""Jeremy Hunt should make it his priority to give Britain back a respected voice in the world and an influence on at least some of the major issues."" Mr Hunt will face the challenge of implementing the Foreign Office's vision of a ""global Britain"" In recent months, the Foreign Office has had some successes: persuading 28 countries to expel more than 150 Russian diplomats after the poisoning of Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and convincing the international community to give weapons inspectors greater powers to say who was responsible for using chemical nerve agents in Syria. Mr Hunt's task now will be to give his diplomats new leadership, deciding the issues and regions where he thinks that he - and they - can make a difference. That will require not just choosing priorities but also providing an overarching narrative of what the Foreign Office - and Britain more generally - can and should do in the world. Unlike his predecessor, Mr Hunt comes to the job with little baggage. He is seen by officials as a clean slate: bright, competent and ambitious. One said: ""He will be a gaffe-free zone."" He is also a political survivor, one of only three members of David Cameron's first cabinet that are still around the table. But perhaps his greatest advantage as foreign secretary is that he is trusted by Prime Minister Theresa May and Number 10. When it comes to getting the ear of foreign politicians and diplomats, that is a powerful thing to have.

Trump fears 'perjury trap' in Mueller probe,"President Trump has repeatedly referred to the Mueller investigation as a ""witch hunt"" US President Donald Trump has said he is worried he might face perjury charges if he gives statements under oath to the investigation into Russia's alleged role in his election victory. He told Reuters news agency he feared any discrepancies between his account and others could be used against him. Mr Trump also suggested he could take over the investigation run by special counsel Robert Mueller, but said he'd decided to stay out of it. He has called the inquiry a witch hunt. Russia also strongly denies claims it interfered in the 2016 election, which saw Mr Trump defeat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. In the Reuters interview, Mr Trump expressed concern that any statement he made to investigators could be compared with that of others,externalwho have testified, such as former FBI chief James Comey, and that any discrepancies could be used against him. Who's who in Trump-Russia drama? All you need to know about Trump Russia story He was echoing previous concerns by his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who said Mr Trump could be ""trapped into perjury"". ""So if I say something and he (Comey) says something, and it's my word against his, and he's best friends with Mueller, so Mueller might say: 'Well, I believe Comey,' and even if I'm telling the truth, that makes me a liar. That's no good,"" President Trump said. Mr Trump also asserted that he could, if he wanted to, intervene in the investigation, but added that he had chosen not to do so for now. ""I've decided to stay out. Now I don't have to stay out. I can go in, and I could do whatever - I could run it if I want. But I decided to stay out,"" he said. ""I'm totally allowed to be involved if I wanted to be. So far, I haven't chosen to be involved. I'll stay out."" In an interview with NBC on Sunday, Mr Giuliani was asked whether the Trump team was stalling about a possible testimony at the Mueller inquiry. Lawyer Rudy Giuliani was widely ridiculed for suggesting ""truth isn't truth"" Mr Giuliani said: ""I'm not going to be rushed into having him testify so he can be trapped into perjury."" He added: ""When you tell me that he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth."" NBC host Chuck Todd countered,external: ""Truth is truth."" Mr Giuliani responded by saying: ""Truth isn't truth."" That comment was widely mocked on social media. Special counsel Mueller is investigating whether President Trump's campaign team colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the presidential election. In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had used a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media in an attempt to turn the election against Mrs Clinton. Thirty-two people have now been indicted, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team and 25 Russians. The president's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is the first person to go on trial as a result of Mr Mueller's investigation. However, the charges are not related to the US election but instead to tax evasion and money-laundering stemming from his political consultancy work in Ukraine. The jury in his case is in its fourth day of deliberation to reach a verdict. 'Alternative facts' or falsehoods? Who's who in Russia drama?

Joe Xuereb, 27, of Greenwich, appeared at Bromley Magistrates' Court earlier and was also charged with possession of an offensive weapon - a claw hammer. Mr Xuereb was arrested in Sidcup following a media appeal. Ania Gos and her mother remain in a critical condition, police said. Ms Gos's mother was visiting from Poland when she was attacked, according to neighbours. Neither woman is said to have known Mr Xuereb.

Venezuelans flee to Brazil despite attacks,"Venezuelans were queuing to cross in to Brazil The number of Venezuelans entering Brazil is rising, officials say, despite Saturday's attacks on makeshift migrant border camps. A Brazilian army spokesman said about 900 Venezuelans were expected in the state of Roraima on Monday, a steep rise in the daily average. The numbers of people trying to flee Venezuela's economic collapse are stoking regional tensions. There is fresh uncertainty following the issuing of new banknotes. Banks and shops are due to reopen on Tuesday after a public holiday on Monday, when the left-wing government lopped five zeros off the bolÃ­var and anchored it to a new virtual currency called the petro. Venezuelan bolivar - what can it buy you? Venezuelans confused as Maduro's economic plan starts How did we get here? The government says the move is needed to tackle runaway inflation, but critics say it could lead to even more chaos. Opposition groups have called for strikes and protests on Tuesday. Extra security forces have been sent to the border with Venezuela following violence near the town of Pacaraima on Saturday. The Roraima state government has asked the Supreme Court to temporarily halt the entry of migrants from Venezuela, saying social services were being overwhelmed. However, Brazilian Security Minister Sergio Etchegoyen said closing the border was ""unthinkable, because it is illegal"". He said the presence of military police at the border had improved the situation. ""There's tension, but there's no conflict,"" he added. Brazil has sent more security forces to quell any unrest in Pacaraima Many of those crossing into Brazil say they are hungry and don't have access to medical services in Venezuela. The army said that on Sunday about 800 Venezuelan migrants arrived in Roraima, about 300 more than the average number crossing every day for almost a year. In Pacaraima on Saturday, several migrant encampments were attacked by angry residents following reports that a local restaurant owner had been badly beaten by Venezuelans. Hundreds of migrants fled back across the border and gangs of men burned their camps and their belongings. Reports on Monday said many had since crossed back into Brazil. There has been growing animosity towards the numbers of Venezuelans entering Roraima in recent months. By Julia Carneiro, BBC News, Pacaraima There is no visible sign of Saturday's violence in Pacaraima. The city is quiet, the streets are clean. Firefighters have washed away the ashes from where Venezuelans had been living, their tents and belongings burned by protesters. Many Venezuelans have left - but more keep coming. On Monday, residents organised a ""peace motorcade"" to try to dispel the idea of intolerance. They said Venezuelans were welcome, but violence was not. But as soon as I started speaking to Venezuelans about what had happened, Brazilians jumped in to say they were lying. The row exposes the underlying tension that has been building up in Pacaraima. Other countries in the region including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru say they are struggling to deal with the influx of Venezuelan migrants. Hundreds of thousands have made the journey into Colombia and Ecuador and many are heading further south for Peru or Chile. On Saturday, Ecuador introduced new entry restrictions that left hundreds of migrants stranded on the Colombian side of the border. From Saturday, only Venezuelans with valid passports were allowed to cross from Colombia in Ecuador Amid the confusion, some desperate Venezuelans defied the new rules and entered via unguarded crossings but correspondents say they now face fines for having accessed the country illegally. Over the past three years about 3,000 Venezuelans have entered Colombia every day and the country has granted temporary residence to more than 800,000. Peru says that last week alone, 20,000 Venezuelans entered the country. The International Monetary Fund had predicted that inflation in Venezuela could reach one million per cent this year.  According to a recent study by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, prices have been doubling every 26 days on average. From Monday, new banknotes denominated in ""sovereign bolivars"" are legal tender. But as it was declared a public holiday, attention is now focused on how shops and banks react when the drastic measures come into effect on Tuesday. The move is effectively a redenomination. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro cut five zeros off the old currency - the ""strong bolÃ­var"" - and gave it its new name. Eight new banknotes and two new coins are being put into circulation. The new notes will have a value of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 sovereign bolivars. Most old bolivar notes will continue to circulate ""for a time"", Venezuelan Central Bank President Calixto Ortega announced. Only the lowest current notes, worth less than 1,000 strong bolivars, will be phased out straight away. The government hopes that its new economic plan will not only curb the country's hyperinflation but also put an end to the ""economic war"" which it says has been waged against it by ""imperialist forces"". This video can not be played How to get by in Venezuela, when money is in short supply It says the introduction of the new currency is accompanied by key measures which will help Venezuela's battered economy recover. Among them are: Raising the minimum wage to 34 times its previous level from 1 September Anchoring the sovereign bolivar to the petro, a virtual currency the government says is linked to Venezuela's oil reserves Curbing Venezuela's generous fuel subsidies for those not in possession of a ""Fatherland ID"" Raising VAT by 4% to 16% President Madurotweeted [in Spanish] that his government would ""dismantle neoliberal capitalism's perverse war to install a virtuous, balanced, sustainable, healthy and productive economic system"",external. But economists have been warning that the new measures do not address the root causes of inflation in Venezuela and that the printing of new notes could exacerbate inflation rather than curb it. They say the rise in the minimum wage will only drive inflation up faster. Some analysts estimate that the benefits of the new currency could be wiped out by hyperinflation ""within months"".

Liam Fox: UK can be 'exporting superpower',"Britain can be a ""21st Century exporting superpower"", Liam Fox is expected to say in a speech detailing the government's post-Brexit ambitions. The international trade secretary will say he wants exports as a proportion of UK GDP to rise from 30% to 35%. Last year exports of goods and services rose to a record high of Â£620 billion. The Federation of Small Businesses praised the aspiration - but said more financial incentives, such as grants and ""export vouchers"", were needed. Mike Cherry from the FSB said small companies could use the vouchers to invest in things such as translation services or market research. The government's UK Export Finance department - which offers financial help to exporters - already has the capacityto support Â£50bn of exports,external. Analysis by BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed Exports from the UK areat a record high,external- boosted by the weakness in the value of the pound and stronger global growth than expected. Yes, there are uncertainties around Brexit - and if there is ""no deal"" the economic effects could be dramatic and negative. But many businesses report full order books, as British companies that do export, particularly outside the EU, find plenty of willing customers. The government now says it wants to build on that success - admitting that although Britain does ""punch above its weight"" in export markets it also punches below its potential. Some 400,000 firms that could export goods and services have no international presence. In a speech setting out the government's export strategy, Mr Fox will say the UK should ""set its sights high"" as it leaves the EU. He is expected to tell a business audience in London that UK firms are ""superbly placed to capitalise on the rapid changes in the global economic environment"". Minister for trade and export promotion, Baroness Rona Fairhead, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she understood businesses wanted ""stability and certainty"" in the short term and there were concerns about establishing a trade deal with the EU. But she said the government also needed to focus on the long-term future of UK companies - and that was in exports. ""Research shows that businesses that export actually are healthier, make more profit, employ more people and in fact are more sustainable,"" she said. ""Our message to small family businesses is take the plunge, we will provide support to you because you are more likely have a flourishing business that you can pass on to your generations."" What does Made in Britain mean for Brexit? The challenges ahead for a UK/US trade deal after Brexit But shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said an export strategy couldn't be based on ""one-off arms sales"". ""After record trade deficit figures, staff cuts in trade promotion and delays to tradeshow funding for business, the government is finally publishing an export strategy - some two years after the trade department was established,"" he said. ""Our businesses need a strong future export relationship with the EU. The Tory export strategy has thus far been based on controversial one-off arms sales."" He said a Labour government would deliver a customs union with ""our most important trade partners"". Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI (Confederation of British Industry), said the strategy was ""a timely signal"" that the government was committed to improving the UK's competitiveness. ""The CBI strongly supports the ambition to make exports 35% of GDP, which will put the UK out in front of many of our international competitors,"" she said. ""We estimate that in every region of the country there are around 10% of businesses that could export, but don't, and we look forward to working alongside the government to support and inspire them to seize the opportunity.""

Ten hikers killed in Italy flash flood,"This video can not be played Helicopter rescue saves hiker trapped by flash floods At least 10 hikers were killed and others have been rescued after flash flooding in southern Italy. They were walking in a gorge in a national park in the Calabria region when they were hit by a torrent swollen by heavy rain. Officials say 23 people have been rescued. An eight-year-old girl was airlifted to hospital with hypothermia. Italy's environment minister said he was ""99.9% sure"" no more people were missing. Three hikers in their early twenties were found safe, Italian media report. An earlier death toll was revised down from 11, due to confusion caused by ""overlapping reports"", according to officials. Carlo Tansi, head of civil protection, told reporters that when the hikers were hit by the water they were ""catapulted out like bullets"" and were washed down the valley for about 3km (two miles). ""The Raganello Gorge is narrow and tall, it can get up to 1km (3,200ft) high,"" he said. ""The gorge filled up with water in a really short time."" The nationalities of the hikers were not immediately known, although the Corriere della Sera newspaper said one of the injured was Dutch and had suffered a broken pelvis.

Australia PM survives leadership challenge,"Malcolm Turnbull made the decision to call a vote to end speculation Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has appealed for unity after surviving a challenge to his leadership from a senior government colleague. Mr Turnbull had called the surprise vote himself in a bid to resolve speculation that his leadership was under threat. In a party room ballot in Canberra on Tuesday, he defeated Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. The prime minister won the vote 48-35, Liberal Party MPs said. Following the result, he told colleagues: ""It's really important that we put our differences behind us and get on with the job of looking after Australians."" Speculation over Mr Turnbull's future as party leader had escalated in the past few days. He faced a revolt from conservative MPs over a key climate change policy. That led to himabandoning the plans on Monday in an attempt to blunt conflict within his government. The PM has also been under long-term pressure due to a series of bad polls and a by-election loss in Queensland. Turnbull fails own popularity yardstick Polling has suggested the government will suffer a heavy loss in the next general election, which will be held before May next year. In a bid to clear the air, Mr Turnbull called for a snap vote on the leadership in a party meeting. Mr Dutton, a leading figure from the party's conservative wing, was nominated as challenger, confirming media reports that he had been gathering support. Who is Peter Dutton? Peter Dutton (R) has stepped down as Home Affairs Minister Mr Turnbull said he had invited him to remain in his role, but Mr Dutton resigned his cabinet position and will return to the back bench. Jay Savage, BBC News Australia online editor Mr Turnbull may have prevailed but his margin - just 13 votes - will hardly bring him confidence. Many expect it will only embolden Mr Dutton to challenge again. Now unconstrained by cabinet loyalty, he will have greater freedom. But regardless of who is leader, the government is laying bare its disunity - and that most suits Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten. Mr Turnbull said he did not ""bear any grudge against Peter Dutton"". ""My job is to do everything we can to make sure we are united and work together,"" he said. ""That is why it is very important that today the Liberal Party room has confirmed our leadership of the party."" Mr Dutton said he accepted the result and would support Mr Turnbull, but did not rule out making another challenge. ""I want to make sure that I can support the party and make sure we win the next election,"" he told reporters. Deputy leader Julie Bishop said the result showed an ""overwhelming vote of support"" for the sitting leader. Australian politics over the past decade has been marked by a series of leadership coups, with three sitting prime ministers deposed by party rivals. Not a single leader in recent times has succeeded in serving a full three-year term as prime minister. Australia: Coup capital of the democratic world Cartoon: Planet of Forbidden Prime Ministers How it all went wrong for Tony Abbott Under the Australian system, as in the UK, the prime minister is not directly elected by voters but is the leader of the party or coalition that can command a majority in parliament. Mr Turnbull himself became prime minister in 2015 after ousting Tony Abbott in a leadership challenge. The preceding Labor government also saw two prime ministers, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, oust each other in turn.

Only 6% of people work 9am - 5pm,"Traditional workplace hours of 9am to 5pm are now only the norm for a minority of workers, research suggests. Just 6% of people in the UK now work such hours, a YouGov survey found. Almost half of people worked flexibly with arrangements such as job sharing or compressed hours, allowing them to juggle other commitments, it found. Anna Whitehouse, a campaigner whose own flexible working request was refused by her employer, said there were still misconceptions about such arrangements. 9 to 5? Make it 8 till 4, actually... Male employees want flexible work too 'Many workers penalised' over flexi-time In her case, her employer refused her request for 15 minutes flexibility at the start and end of each day to enable her to drop off and pick up her children from nursery. ""They denied it because they said it would open the floodgates for other people to request the same thing."" Mrs Whitehouse, an author and blogger known as Mrs Pukka, said the refusal prompted her to resign and blog about the experience. ""My background is as a journalist so I just started writing. I'm not a campaigner or an activist, but I had a moment of frustration and went with it."" Since then she has started the Flex Appeal, aimed at convincing firms to trial flexible working and also to make people aware of their right to request flexible working. ""It's not about parents, it's about people. There's so much research out there showing working flexibly is better for mental health and for productivity,"" she said. Polling firm YouGov surveyed over 4,000 adults for the survey, which was commissioned by fast-food chain McDonald's. Every employee in the UK has the statutory right to request flexible working after 26 weeks of employment. Requests should be in writing, stating the date of the request and whether any previous application has been made and the date of that application. Requests and appeals must be considered and decided upon within three months of the receipt of the request. Employers must have a sound business reason for rejecting any request. Employees can only make one request in any 12-month period. Can your job be as flexible as this? Is flexible working biased against non-parents? How to ask the boss for flexible working The study found most full-time workers would like to start work at 8am and finish by 4pm, hours chosen by 37% of those surveyed. The second most popular choice was 7am to 3pm, chosen by 21% of those surveyed. It found flexibility was important to people of all ages and life stages, including parents and students, for example. Those who did work flexibly said it improved their motivation and encouraged them to stay in a job for longer. Peter Cheese, chief executive of HR industry body the CIPD, said organisations willing to offer flexible working would attract a higher number of applicants. But he said more firms needed to step up: ""Uptake of flexible working is still low and most jobs are not advertised as being open to different working arrangements,"" he said. 9 to 5?

Asia Argento 'accused of sexual assault',"Asia Argento was one of the first women to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault A leading figure in the #MeToo movement has reportedly been accused of sexual assault involving a minor. Italian actress Asia Argento was one of the first to speak out against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. Legal documents (not seen by the BBC) show she paid a former co-star $380,000 (Â£298,000) after he alleged she had assaulted him in a hotel room in 2013, the New York Times reports. A lawyer for Ms Argento declined to comment on the allegations. The sheriff's department in Los Angeles county, where the alleged assault took place in 2013, have said they are trying to contact the alleged victim. Ms Argento's accuser, Jimmy Bennett, was 17 at the time. The age of consent in California is 18. Ms Argento would have been 37 at the time of the alleged encounter. Jimmy Bennett pictured in Hollywood in 2015 She is said by the New York Times to have arranged the payment for Mr Bennett ""in the months that followed her revelations"" about Mr Weinstein,externalin October A lawyer for Mr Weinstein said the development had revealed ""a stunning level of hypocrisy by Asia Argento"". What has #MeToo actually changed? Has #MeToo divided women? The documents say the encounter traumatised Mr Bennett and threatened his mental health and career, according to the New York Times. A lawyer for the actor, who played Ms Argento's young son in a 2004 film, is also quoted as saying his client decided to sue Ms Argento after seeing her present herself as a victim of sexual assault. In the documents seen by the paper, the actress's lawyer says the money was given to Mr Bennett to help him, and that it was Ms Argento who had been preyed upon. In a statement published by Vanity Fair, a lawyer for Mr Bennett said his client would not comment but would take the ""next 24 hours, or longer, to prepare his response"". Ben Brafman, a lawyer for Mr Weinstein, said the development revealed ""a stunning level of hypocrisy by Asia Argento"". ""What is perhaps most egregious is the timing, which suggests that at the very same time Argento was working on her own secret settlement for the alleged sexual abuse of a minor, she was positioning herself at the forefront of those condemning Mr. Weinstein, despite the fact that her sexual relationship with Mr. Weinstein was between two consenting adults which lasted for more than four years,"" the lawyer said. Mr Weinstein was charged in New York this year with sexually assaulting three unnamed women, which he denies. More than 70 women, including Ms Argento, have accused him of sexual misconduct. Tarana Burke, founder of the movement, said there was ""no model survivor"" and warned that the latest accusations would be used by some to discredit #MeToo. The movement, she tweeted, was there for male victims as well as female. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tears and joy as Korean families reunite,"This video can not be played Emotional reunion for mother and son Dozens of families from North and South Korea have held emotional reunions as relatives met for the first time in at least 65 years. A group of mostly elderly South Koreans travelled to a tourist resort in the North for the event, the first such reunion for three years. The Korean War of 1950-1953 left the peninsula divided and people on the northern side were unable to leave. The South Koreans were chosen by lottery - the oldest of them is 101. These brief meetings are likely to be the last and only time many will see each other. The younger siblings of Cho Sun-do, 89, left, had travelled from South Korea to meet her Eighty-six-year-old Cho Hye-do and her brother Cho Do-jae, 75, were reunited with their older sister Cho Sun-do, who is 89 and lives in North Korea. ""I remember how beautiful you were,"" Cho Hye-do told her big sister. ""I finally get to meet you after living for so long,"" replied the older woman. There are 83 North Koreans and 89 from the South taking part. A hundred people had been selected by each side, but some dropped out after realising the relatives they had hoped to see were no longer alive. Lee Keum-seom, 92, travelled to meet her North Korean son Lee Sung-chul, who she hadn't seen since he was four Lee Keum-seom, aged 92, saw her son for the first since the end of the war. She said she lost track of her little boy, then aged four, and her husband in the panic of trying to flee. ""I never imagined this day would come,"" she told AFP. ""I didn't even know if he was alive or not."" Sisters Kim Gyong-sil, 72, and Kim Gyong-yong, 71, wore traditional dress to meet their 99-year-old mother, Han Shin-ja. She had travelled from the South to see them. Over the years, at times of relative calm, the two Koreas have arranged for selected groups to visit each other. There have been 20 such events in the past 18 years. Past reunions between brothers and sisters, parents and children and husbands and wiveshave been extremely emotional experiences. North Korea crisis in 300 words Ordinary North Koreans dare to speak out But as those who have been separated grow old, time is running out. Already, most of the reunions were not between immediate family members. This time, only seven of the participants were due to be reunited with immediate family like parents or children while the rest will be meeting with close relatives like cousins. The South Koreans travelled by bus over the heavily guarded border to the Mount Kumgang tourist resort on Monday. They are due to spend three days in North Korea but only be with their relatives for a few hours each day - in total, only 11 hours. Most of their visit will be heavily supervised. Many brought gifts like clothes, medicine and food for their relatives in the much poorer North. ""I've prepared for him some household medicine including digester and headache pills, nutritional supplements as well as some daily necessaries,"" Lee Soo-nam, 76, who was due to meet his older brother, told Reuters news agency. Many of those divided by the war are now very old Several doctors and nurses travelled with the group to set up an emergency medical centre for the elderly participants. Millions of people were separated by the war. For the tens of thousands still alive in the South who have not been selected for the reunions there are other ways they can contact their relatives. Organisations like the Inter-Korea Separated Family Association or the Korea Red Cross have in the past organised virtual reunions as well as face-to-face. Divided families can exchange letters, have live video meetings or family reunions in third countries, if someone ended up living outside the Koreas. In those cases, the South Korean government covers the travel and accommodation expense. Some separated families also take a private route to contact their families in the North through Chinese brokers. Unofficial reunions can cost about $1,500 (Â£1,170), but the process can be faster and is less dependent on the political climate between North and South. The event, which is facilitated by the Red Cross, is the outcome ofa historic meeting between North Korea's Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the border in April. The two leaders met a second time in May, where they agreed to resume family reunions, and are expected to meet again in the coming weeks. South Korea has also taken an active role in trying to broker talks between Pyongyang and Washington. In June, Kim Jong-un met US President Donald Trumpin Singapore where they pledged to work towards denuclearisation, although there are doubts over how genuine the North is in its commitment.

Love Island cliche 'puts off female firefighters',"Dany Cotton (left) with Theresa May on her visit to Grenfell Tower The head of the London Fire Brigade has criticised Love Island for reinforcing the cliche of firefighters as muscle-bound male sex objects. Commissioner Dany Cotton said ""offensive"" stereotypes discouraged young women from joining the service. She criticised the ITV2 show for ""rolling out every offensive cliche possible with their so-called 'fireman challenge'"". The brigade also criticised an advert for Harpic toilet cleaner. Ms Cotton - the first woman to hold the LFB's most senior position - said Love Island's fireman challenge ""reinforces the misconception that all firefighters are muscle-bound men"". ""No wonder so many young women are put off by that,"" she added. The fireman challenge required the male Love Island participants to strip to their underwear and pretend to save a woman from danger. Just 300 of the LFB's 5,000 operational firefighters - 6% - are women. Research by the brigade also cited a Harpic toilet cleaner ad in which a woman swoons over a brawny male firefighter. Ms Cotton argued that putting an end to ""lazy cliches"" would change the public's attitude and encourage more woman to join the fire service. BBC Reality Check Last year, 5.2% of firefighters in England were women. There were 1,838 female firefighters, compared to 33,782 male firefighters. The proportion of female fighters is slowly increasing. In 2007, 3.1% (1,384) of firefighters were women. By comparison, about a third of police officers in England and Wales are women - 10 times the proportion that are firefighters. Despite few women being front line firefighters, the majority of fire control staff (76%) and fire support staff (52.5%) are female. Ms Cotton said the Army and police had been ""enriched"" by more female representation and praised the way TV characters such as Jane Tennison from Prime Suspect had changed people's perception of women in the police force. ""It's time the fire and rescue service caught up,"" she said. Liz George, a watch manager for London Fire Brigade, said she felt ""infuriated"" when she watched Love Island's ""fireman challenge"" live on TV. ""Even saying 'fireman', emphasising its just a man that could do that role, is quite frustrating when I'm out doing that job every day,"" she said. Love Island has been attacked for rolling out ""every offensive cliche possible"" about firefighters Earlier this year, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) ran a consultation on a proposal that adverts ""must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence"". An ASA spokeswoman said: ""We've published evidence that shows gender stereotypes have the potential to cause harm because they limit how people's potential is considered by themselves and others - with costs to the individual, economy and society. ""We've already been taking action to ban ads which reinforce harmful stereotypes and we'll publish the results of our consultation around new rules for advertisers later this year.""

"NHS 'not prepared' for no-deal BrexitLeaving the EU without a deal would make it harder to stop the spread of diseases, NHS boss is told.UK Politics","The group representing hospitals and ambulance services in England has warned of a lack of ""contingency planning"" to deal with the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the health service. In a leaked email to NHS England boss Simon Stevens, NHS Providers says leaving the EU without agreement would immediately be a real risk to services. The group warns it would make it harder to stop the spread of diseases. NHS England said preparing for every possible Brexit outcome was a priority. The Department of Health said it was confident of reaching a Brexit deal that benefits the NHS but was preparing for ""the unlikely event of no-deal"", to prevent disruption to patients. It comes as Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab holds the latest round of negotiations with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier. NHS plans 'extensively' for no-deal Brexit Reality Check: What would 'no deal' Brexit mean for food and medicine? The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 and the two sides are currently negotiating the terms of its exit and its future relations in a whole range of issues. NHS Providers - which represents acute, ambulance, community and mental health services within the health service - has expressed concern about what it says is a lack of engagement with ministers in the email, seen by the BBC. It has called for NHS England and NHS Improvement - which oversees NHS trusts and providers - to convene a group of trust leaders as a matter of urgency. In an email sent to NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, also copied in to Mr Raab and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, it calls for a co-ordinated response to confront the challenges that would be presented by a no deal. Chief executive of NHS Providers Chris Hopson writes that there has been ""no formal communication"" to trusts from either NHS England or NHS Improvement on this issue. Without national planning and coordination ""there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices"", Mr Hopson says. He adds that ""disease control coordination could also suffer"". NHS to stockpile drugs for no deal Brexit At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Mark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust, said ""a large degree of chaos"" was ""implicit"" in a no-deal Brexit and, without a transitional agreement with the EU, it was difficult to predict the impact on supply of medicines. ""There's obviously been talk of stockpiling. There's been talk in some cases of chartered flights to bring over supplies that maybe don't have such a long shelf-life. And although that's drastic action, it's probably quite justified,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. An NHS England spokeswoman said the health service was working with government, planning for different post-Brexit scenarios. ""We will be working with our colleagues and partners across the NHS to ensure plans are well progressed, and will provide the NHS with the support it needs,"" she said. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who supports the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said the NHS letter was a ""stark and urgent warning of the impact of a hard Brexit or no deal and of non-existent planning"". Another supporter of the campaign, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, said another referendum would be like seeking ""informed consent"" from a patient before a major operation. A series of technical notices - including advice for businesses, citizens and public bodies about a no-deal scenario - will be made public over the next month or so. Downing Street has described the advice due on Thursday as ""sensible, proportionate, and part of a common sense approach to ensure stability, whatever the outcome of talks"". On the same day, Mr Raab will make a speech in Westminster to outline the government's plans for the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal. The UK is seeking ""associate membership"" of the European Medicines Agency, which evaluates and supervises medicines and helps national authorities authorise the sale of drugs across the EU's single market.
