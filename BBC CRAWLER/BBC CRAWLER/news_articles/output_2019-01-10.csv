Ashley votes Debenhams bosses off board,"Sergio Bucher joined Debenhams from Amazon The chief executive of Debenhams has been voted off the retailer's board, but will remain in his role, the troubled retailer has said. Two major shareholders, Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, and Landmark Group, voted against Mr Bucher's re-election. The board said it had ""full confidence"" in plans put in place by Mr Bucher and the management to reshape the business. Chairman Sir Ian Cheshire was also voted off the board and will step down. The vote, at the company's annual general meeting, came just hours after the embattled retailerreported a sharp fall in sales during the crucial Christmas trading period. Sales fell 5.7% in the 18 weeks to 5 January. Like many High Street retailers Debenhams has been hit by a shift to online shopping and rising costs. Last year it issued three profit warnings. It is closing up to 50 of its stores and is seeking new finance. The board said,externalMr Bucher was not re-elected to the board ""principally as a result of the votes of the same two major shareholders"" who voted against Sir Ian - that is, Sports Direct and Landmark Group. However it added: ""Of the votes cast... Sergio received 44.15% votes in favour of his re-election. Excluding those two shareholders, the vote for Sergio to continue on the board was approximately 99.6% in favour."" Debenhams board said it was ""mindful of its responsibilities to all shareholders and has full confidence in Sergio and in the management's plan to boost the business. As a result, it added, the board and Mr Bucher had agreed that he should continue as chief ""reporting to the board"". However, Sir Ian had ""concluded it is no longer possible for him to remain chairman of Debenhams,"" it said. Sir Ian had been on the Debenhams board for two years. Terry Duddy, Debenhams' senior independent director, has been appointed interim chairman. He said: ""I recognise that individual shareholders have wished to register their dissatisfaction. ""I am looking forward to working with Sergio. My first task is to meet with shareholders so that I understand any concerns that they may have."" Mr Ashley, who founded Sports Direct, has been taking an increased interest in Debenhams. Sports Direct already owns nearly 30% of the shares in the department store chain and has offered a further Â£40m investment. Debenhams rejected his offer, but said all options remain open. Earlier on Thursday Mr Bucher said there had been fewer customers visiting the company's stores. He confirmed that Debenhams was in talks with its lenders about its Â£520m credit line. Those talks were ""constructive"", he said.

'Military' anti-drone kit for all airports,"All major UK airports now have or will soon have military grade anti-drone equipment, the government says. It comes after the military were called in to help when drone sightings caused delays for around an hour at Heathrow on Tuesday. And drone sightings at Gatwick caused major disruption affecting 140,000 passengers before Christmas. Earlier, the defence secretary said it would ""not be right"" to ask the RAF to respond to similar incidents in future. Gavin Williamson said all commercial airports needed to invest in anti-drone technology. Ministers are also working on ensuring the technology is installed at other critical infrastructure such as prisons, power stations and military sites. British Airways aeroplanes were among those to be grounded at Heathrow on Tuesday night. Official figures show 120 near misses between drones and aircraft were reported over the last year - a twenty-fold increase on the six incidents recorded in 2014. Speaking on a visit to RAF Marham, Norfolk, Mr Williamson said: ""I think that everyone would be expecting all airports to be having this detection, and deterrence effect also, at all commercial airports in the future. ""It is a logical thing for them to be investing [in]."" Military-grade anti-drone equipment has already been installed at airports across the UK. A system which can detect, track and ground the devices has been installed on the roof of Gatwick's South Terminal following last month's chaos. How can a drone cause so much chaos? New powers to tackle illegal drone use Gatwick said last weekthat it had spent Â£5m to prevent future attacks. Heathrow also confirmed it would be buying systems to guard against drones. Andit was announced this weekthat police would be given new powers to tackle the illegal use of drones. The Heathrow and Gatwick incidents raised questions about how UK airports deal with drones - an issue which has been raised repeatedly by the aviation industry. Defence Minister Gavin Williamson issued today's warning shortly after declaring Britain's first nine F-35B Lightning II fighter jets ready for combat. The US-built jets, which cost Â£92m each, are expected to revive Britain's ability to launch sea-borne operations from aircraft carriers. The planes can reach speeds of 1,200mph and can land vertically, similar to the Harrier jump jets. A combat-ready F-35B, seen here with Spear, Asraam and Meteor missiles in the foreground. Mr Williamson said: ""Our nation is moving into a new era outside the EU, and our huge achievements in air capability make our commitment to a role on the world stage clear to both our allies and our enemies. ""The incredible F-35 jets are ready for operations, a transformed Typhoon has the power to dominate the skies into the 2040s and we continue to look even further into an ambitious future.""

Yellow vests knock out 60% of speed cameras,"This speed camera in Nice, photographed in December, is one example of the damage Members of the ""yellow vests"" protest movement have vandalised almost 60% of France's entire speed camera network, the interior minister has said. Christophe Castaner said the wilful damage was a threat to road safety and put lives in danger. The protest movement began over fuel tax increases, and saw motorists block roads and motorway toll booths. Some protesters feel speed cameras are solely a revenue-generating measure which takes money from the poor. The BBC's Hugh Schofield, in Paris, said evidence of the vandalism is visible to anyone driving around France, with radar cameras covered in paint or black tape to stop them working. But the extent of the damage - now believed to affect more than half of all 3,200 speed cameras in the country's network - was unknown until Mr Castaner's statement on Thursday. He said the devices had been ""neutralised, attacked, or destroyed"" by members of the protest movement. The yellow vests movement, orgilets jaunesin French, is named after the high-visibility vests that every driver in the country must keep in their vehicle. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Les gilets jaunes: The full story Speed limits in France were already controversial after the government lowered the limit on many main roads from 90km/h to 80km/h (50mph) early last year. Protesters angry about the increase in fuel taxes complained of the rising costs of a commute for those priced out of living in urban centres - and turned their ire on other costs such as toll roads and speed cameras. This plastic-motorbike combination was spotted in Corsica on 2 December While the number of people attending weekend protests has dropped since the government made some small concessions, the conflict between the popular movement and the government remains a daily topic of debate in France. Just this week,the prime minister announced a crackdown on unsanctioned protests, whilea former boxer filmed punching police officershas divided public opinion, with some claiming he was defending other protesters from police. And on Tuesday,the person picked to lead the country's planned ""great debate"" on the issues resignedover her â¬14,666 monthly salary (Â£13,200; $16,800).

JLR workers 'tense' after cuts announced,"JLR will first invite voluntary redundancies and early retirements to cut 4,500 jobs The atmosphere at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is said to be ""very tense"" following the announcement that 4,500 jobs will be cut. Staff were informed that the firm, which employs 40,000 people in the UK, needed to cut costs. The firm isfacing reduced sales in China and a slump in demand for diesel carswhile executives have also complained about uncertainty caused by Brexit. An engineer, who wished to remain anonymous but is based at the Whitley plant near Coventry, said he was ""unsure"" whether his job was safe and communications from management had been ""cryptic"". ""It's not clear what's going on,"" he said. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands JLR has said most of the roles lost will be office-based as it seeks to simplify its management structure. ""I've got a young child, so I could really do with not losing my job right now,"" the worker said. He began working for JLR two years ago after moving to Coventry and said he fears a ""last in, first out"" policy. ""I'm fighting for my job,"" he said. ""It's not worth the risk for me to take voluntary redundancy. ""A lot of people are wanting to stay here long term. It's very tense."" John Nollett fears the cuts could have a major effect on businesses in the West Midlands It's not just workers who are concerned. Suppliers to JLR are also concerned about the firm's ""uncertain"" future. ""If they're cutting down on important jobs like the design functions and things like that, where is the future of the business going,"" said John Nollett, managing director of metal supplier Pressmark Pressings, in Atherstone, Warwickshire. What's gone wrong in the UK car market? Jaguar Land Rover's diesel dependency Is Land Rover's off-road heyday over? ""It's difficult to predict but it could have a major effect throughout the whole of the industry and it's disappointing that it's focussed here in the West Midlands."" Employee Debra Hammond, who also works at Pressmark, said the cuts were going to have a ""knock-on effect"". ""If they're going to cut down on the work, then we're going to lose work. So the future doesn't look that great at the moment for any of us."" Debra Hammond said the future ""doesn't look great"" for suppliers Others were more optimistic. A caller to BBC Coventry & Warwickshire, Michelle, whose husband Steve has worked at the Whitley plant for 36 years, said they had seen job cuts in the past but the firm had recovered. ""We've been through this a number of times,"" she said. ""This comes and goes every five to 10 years so we're quite used to it now."" ""You get it with any big company, they take on when they're being successful and you know it's not going to last forever."" ""We're not worried. I don't think a firm like that will go under, it's just one of those things."" The job cuts will mostly affect office roles rather than workers on the factory floor There was also optimism outside the i54 plant near Wolverhampton as workers started their shifts. JLR has said it plans to invest in more electric engine technology at the plant. One contractor, who preferred not to be named, told the BBC:  ""I think it's going to be alright. ""I don't think it'll affect me,"" he said. ""I think that most of us won't have anything to worry about, fingers crossed."" West Midlands Metropolitan Mayor Andy Street also expressed optimism, saying on Twitter he was ""confident JLR will be a critical part of our region's future success"".

Hungry children 'eating from school bins',"Siobhan Collingwood said children are arriving at school with empty lunchboxes Children are arriving at a school so hungry they are searching the bins for food, its head teacher has said. A cross-party group of MPs has called on the government to appoint a Minister for Hunger to deal with ""food insecurity"" especially among children. Siobhan Collingwood, head teacher of the school in Morecambe, Lancashire, said one in 10 of its pupils came from families using foodbanks. ""Unfortunately I've got the faces behind the statistics,"" she added. The Environmental Audit Committee highlighted 2017 Unicef figures showing 19% of children under 15 in the UK live with adults who struggle to buy food. The government said the number of children living in workless households is at a record low. MPs have called on the government to appoint a Minister for Hunger Ms Collingwood said there were currently 35 children at her school whose families are supported by foodbanks, adding: ""It's probably higher because they are the ones we know about."" ""When children are food deprived it alters their behaviour and they do become quite food obsessed, so we have some children who will be stealing fruit cores from the bins,"" she added. ""We have children who have nothing in their lunch boxes and children who are just fixated upon food."" MPs want hunger minister role introduced Fighting holiday hunger in Birkenhead Poor pupils 'filling pockets with food' The head teacher said it was ""heartbreaking"" and added that parents had been ""arriving at school literally bursting into tears telling me they have no means of feeding their children"". Ms Collingwood said she had noticed more problems since the introduction of Universal Credit. ""Families are coming in telling me they are routinely loaning food to each other, my day-to-day experience is telling me this is a growing problem."" A Department of Work and Pensions spokeswoman said that, since 2010, one million people had been lifted out of absolute poverty - including 300,000 children. She added: ""We already provide support through free school meals and our Healthy Start Vouchers.""

Prolific egg smuggler jailed again,"Egg smuggler Jeffrey Lendrum has a long history of similar offences A prolific smuggler caught entering the UK with protected birds' eggs strapped to his chest has been jailed for three years and one month. Jeffrey Lendrum, 56, of Cliftonville Road, Northampton, was stopped at Heathrow Airport in June last year after arriving from South Africa. He pleaded guilty to four offences on the second day of his trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court. The court heard Lendrum has a long history of egg smuggling. On 26 June, heÂ arrived in LondonÂ from Johannesburg carrying eggs from endangered birds of prey, including vultures, eagles, hawks and kites, worth up to Â£100,000,the Telegraph reported,external. Lendrum had strapped the illicit cargo to his body in a sling underneath a heavy coat, the court was told. Lendrum has been described as a ""wildlife criminal"" The prosecution was able to prove that Lendrum knowingly smuggled the eggs for commercial gain by trying to evade customs, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Lendrum was jailed for 18 months in 2010 after he wascaught at Birmingham Airportwith egg boxes strapped to his chest. He had taken 14 eggs from peregrine falcon nests in south Wales and tried to smuggle them out of the UK. Police described him at the time as ""the highest level of wildlife criminal"". In October 2015, Lendrum was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in Sao Paolo after he was again found carrying rare falcon eggs.He fled Brazilafter he was released on bail. Remi Ogunfowora, of the CPS, said: ""We worked with our partners in the National Crime Agency to ensure this prolific bird egg smuggler faced appropriate charges. ""We hope the sentence passed deters others from becoming involved in the damaging trade around rare and endangered wildlife."" Notorious egg thief on the run.

Two-child universal credit cap to be eased,"Amber Rudd will make her first major welfare speech on Friday About 15,000 families no longer face having their benefits capped after the government performed another U-turn over its flagship universal credit. The work and pensions secretary has ditched plans to extend a benefits cap on families of more than two children. Amber Rudd said those with children born before the system began in 2017 would remain exempt, as she aimed to ensure it was ""compassionate and fair"". The Child Poverty Action Group said the decision was ""fantastically good news"". However, the group is still calling for the two-child cap to be scrapped for all other families. Labour said the change ""does not go far enough"". Reality Check: What's the problem with universal credit? Single mums win universal credit challenge Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Will the changes help you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Ms Rudd alsoconfirmed she would again delay asking MPsto authorise the transfer of three million people from the old benefits system. Instead, the government will run a pilot involving 10,000 people going through the universal credit process. This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said Ms Rudd also remains under pressure to shorten a five-week wait before new universal credit claims are paid. He added that Ms Rudd may ask the Treasury for more money to implement further modifications, once the pilot scheme is completed. Ms Rudd's changes only protect families with children born before April 2017. For families where the third child is born after April 2017, the changes have no effect and the impacts the chart is showing still hold Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm making a number of changes to our welfare system to make sure that it delivers on the intent which is to be a safety net and also to be a compassionate and fair system helping people into work."" Ahead of a speech on Friday announcing the changes, she also signalled a benefit freeze introduced in 2016 might not be renewed when it comes to an end next year. ""It was the right policy at the time... I look forward to it coming off,"" she told Sky News. Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits and merging them into one payment: income support income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance housing benefit child tax credit working tax credit It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler, and is being introduced in stages across the UK. Confirming she would delay asking MPs to authorise the transfer of three million people from the old benefits system, she told Today: ""We have listened to people. We know they want more individual assistance either with getting payments more regularly or having payments made direct to landlords."" ""These elements, which could help universal credit work more helpfully for individuals receiving it, are what I'm going to be changing."" She also said she wanted to ensure that the main carer in a household would be the primary recipient of universal credit. On the two-child limit, she will say in her speech later that it was ""not right"" for it to apply to those who had their children before the cap was announced. ""These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only system in place,"" she will say. The""child element"" of universal credit varies,,externalbut is worth at least Â£231.67 a child per month. Ms Rudd, who became work and pensions secretary in November, accepted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system after taking expert guidance. Her predecessor Esther McVey had already announced changes to ensure claimants were given more time to switch to the benefit and would not have to wait so long for their money. The system had been the target of complaints that it was forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution. This video can not be played Struggling with universal credit in Hartlepool Ms Rudd will defend the introduction of the benefit by saying: ""Universal credit is working for the vast majority of people. ""As a nation, I believe we all want a decent safety net: if you're facing a difficult moment in life, the state should be there to help you. ""But it is vital that people are supported by this safety net, not trapped beneath it."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the government should abandon the two-child limit in its entirety. ""Universal credit is clearly failing and the government should stop the roll out now,"" she said. Former Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, said: ""I strongly welcome the secretary of state's decision not to press ahead with what could have been the cruellest benefit cut in history. ""At the eleventh hour, she has prevented thousands of children from being plunged into poverty by an unjustifiable retrospective policy."" By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This speech is billed as a reset of universal credit, a clear acknowledgment from Amber Rudd that further tinkering with the troubled reform will no longer do. The last two budgets have seen billions spent trying to reduce the problems that have become ever-more obvious, from increasing use of food banks to private landlords refusing to take people on universal credit. But this speech demonstrates that Amber Rudd believes a more fundamental assessment of the benefit is needed. That makes her the first work and pensions secretary since Iain Duncan Smith to try to take responsibility for welfare reform rather than simply managing the existing system. She will need to convince the Treasury in particular to back her judgement. Single mums win universal credit challenge How are universal credit rules changing?

Model defends role at farm trade show,"Melissa Sharp (right) said ""Barbie bombshell"" criticism was ""disgusting"" A model has brushed off criticism that her appearance at an agricultural machinery show was ""outdated"". At the Lamma show in Birmingham,agricultural firm Agrifac encouraged visitors,externalto get selfies with glamorous trade show models at their stand. One of the women, Melissa Sharp, said she had a ""great time"" - adding that her role at the event was ""harmless"". However some objected, includingestate manager David Hill, who told the BBCit felt ""like a backward step"". Speaking to Radio 4's Farming Today Mr Hill, who was not at the event, said: ""A lot of women are wanting to be recognised for their contribution to the industry and want to be taken seriously in a previously male-dominated industry."" 'Grid kids' to replace F1 'grid girls' Which sports still use 'walk-on girls'? During the exhibition Agrifac tweeted pictures of the women posing in front of agricultural machinery and with competition winners. Karen Carter chaired her local Young Farmers club in Devon and is a volunteer for theFarming Community Network,external. She said she was ""disappointed"" when she saw the images from the show. ""It is 2019 - it is frustrating we are still having these conversations. ""I have nothing against the girls. The point is this sort of practice is outdated,"" she said. Carol Lishman, director of the agricultural manufacturers Martin Lishman, tweeted: ""Embarrassing photo and not great for encouraging women in this industry, disappointing this is still happening."" Kate Lord, a farm park manager from Gloucestershire, said it was ""an insult to women"" who work in the industry. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""People referring to us as blonde Barbie bombshells with no brain cells is disgusting,"" she added. Another Twitter user congratulated Agrifac on their promotion: ""Provides a talking point, gets your brand noticed and it's harmless fun."" The women were hired by Agrifac from Fan Xperience, a promotions company. Managing Director Zoe Rutherford praised her employees: ""These women are professionals who did a really good job and got a positive reaction from the people who were there. ""The negativity from people, many of whom weren't at the event, has been really unfortunate."" She added: ""It is inappropriate for women to be told they are wearing the wrong thing. Women should be allowed to wear what they want to wear."" It is not the first time the use of models at trade shows has been criticised. Last year, the Gambling Commission condemnedthe use of women in swimsuits working at the ICE Totally Gaming event. Meanwhile, Formula 1 made the decision to scrapgrid girls, while the Professional Darts Corporation saidit would no longer use walk-on girls. Agrifac have been contacted for comment. The organiser of the LAMMA show, AgriBriefing, said: ""Our terms and conditions are specific that our exhibitors must ensure that nothing on their stand should objectify their staff (be they men or women), and that clothing should be appropriate for a business event. ""When the clothing of some of the promotional staff on one stand was brought to our attention at the end of the first day we raised this directly with the standholder. ""Following further discussions, the activities on the stand were altered and it has been agreed with that standholder that such activity and clothing will not be repeated at future events.""

"Don't lie on a bomb, Dutch warned","The Dutch public have been warned it is ""strictly ill-advised to lie down on a bomb"", after a man did just that for about three hours. The man came across an unexploded World War Two device while gardening in the town of Venlo on Wednesday. When it started whistling he covered it with his body, apparently trying to limit the damage. Nearby residents were evacuated and the device proved harmless. The man was treated for symptoms of hypothermia. The device was variously described as a grenade or a shell. Security services spokeswoman Veronique Klaassen told AFP news agency the man had covered the device with sand but when it started whistling he put his body over it. She said he dared not move and rang emergency services on his mobile phone. Ms Klaassen told AFP it appeared the defence ministry bomb disposal team must have come from some distance away as it did not arrive until about 01:00 on Thursday (midnight GMT) to free the man from his ""delicate position"". Surrounding areas were evacuated, affecting more than 100 people, but it transpired that the device no longer had any explosive material and they were allowed to return to their homes. What caused the whistling remains a mystery. The man was taken to hospital suffering from the extreme winter cold. Ms Klaassen said: ""It is strictly ill-advised to lie down on a bomb. The best thing to do if you come across an explosive device is keep your distance and call the police.""

MPs continue Brexit debate,"MPs continue debate on the governmentâs Brexit deal They will vote on whether to approve the deal next Tuesday MPs usually debate private members' bills on a Friday Richard Morris, Sophie Morris and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says the PM should strike 29 March as Brexit day from UK law if her deal is voted down. House of CommonsParliament With the completion of the debate on Brexit, the Commons adjourns until next week. On Monday, the Brexit debate continues after questions and any urgent questions or statements. Then, on Tuesday, it's the final day of debate followed by the big vote on whether or not Parliament approves the agreement reached between the UK and EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says that the government ""has made it clear"" that EU citizens rights will be protected whether or not the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He says he thinks that he agrees with Julia Lopez, who said that people will no longer trust politicians if Brexit is not delivered. He urges Labour MPs to ""stop playing games"" and reminds them that leave-voting Labour members will ""never forgive them"" if they try to stop Brexit. He adds that there will be no limit on the number of international students who can study in the UK. He concludes by saying that ""we are now in the final stages"" of leaving an organisation which ""has been central to our national life for 46 years"". ""Let us rise to the moment,"" he finishes. With that, the Commons moves on to the adjournment debate. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says that maybe it's the flu she's suffering, but the debate seems to have a remarkable air of ""deja vu"" about it. She says that the prime minister is ""running around Europe obtaining invisible concessions on Brexit"" and she says there is ""nothing new"" to this document that has changed since 5 December. ""This deal jeopardises all the co-operation we've come to rely with the EU,"" she states. She says that the deal ""cedes control to Europe"" on many areas of UK law. ""Nothing has been achieved from five weeks of delay,"" she adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Mike Gapes says it was the Labour government of Tony Blair which made ""such an impact"" on the development of the European Union. In 1975 he says he was putting out anti-Common Market leaflets the day before a Cambridge final exam, ""the Labour Party is in a bizarre position...we are going for a sensible Brexit,"" but he adds, ""there is no such thing as a jobs first Brexit, it is entirely about mitigating the damage"". He says he doesn't believe that any government would be able to negotiate anything different to what has been proposed. He'll be voting to stay in the European Union if the Commons gets the chance, he adds. 'Rebelling with a heavy heart' Conservative Michael Tomlinson says his constituents have been saying for ""a number of months"" that they just want ""to get on with it"". He adds that the proposal ""does not get on with it"". He says that it is not ""taking back control"". He states that while the UK will not be subject to the CJEU, it will still have ""leverage"" in the UK, and he describes the court as ""highly political"". ""The proposal threatens the integrity"" of the UK, he continues. ""I have never rebelled against the government...and I do so with a heavy heart, but with a clear head,"" he adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Julia Lopez says that the political class ""could soon find itself despised"" if it does not do what has been requested in the referendum. The agreement will lead to another ""two years"" of ""discord and indecision"" from warring factions. The UK will ""have given up all our negotiating leverage"", she adds. Labour's Martin Whitfield says ""the big problem is"" that there is no plan for where the country is going. ""Once upon a time were told we'd hold all the cards, and it would be easy,"" he states. He says that ""there is no disrespect in re-evaluating"" a decision when the facts become known. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Another Conservative MP Peter Heaton-Jones says he will also be supporting the prime minister's deal, saying it best represents the desire of the people he represents. He says he and his constituents want to ""get on with it"". Labour's Thangam Debbonaire says she wants an immigration system that Remain and Leave voters can trust. She says she does not believe anyone will be satisfied with the government's proposed immigration system. ""I want to talk about immigration,"" she says. ""I want to see an improved response to refugees...but I don't think I've come across anyone who thinks our current system is working well."" EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Mike Penning says he will not ""Vote for anything that doesn't protect the union"". He calls on the PM to return to the EU to ""sort the backstop out"". Next is Labour MP Ian Murray, who says there are 77 days to go and ""the stakes could not be higher"". He calls on the government to rule out a no-deal scenario. He says the prime minister has united Leavers and Remainers against the deal, by sticking to the red lines she set down. He calls for a 'People's Vote' on the deal. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative Kemi Badenoch says she will be supporting the prime minister's deal. She says the guarantees it gives on citizens' rights are important, and asks how MPs could vote against the deal, opening the possibility of no-deal and therefore the loss of citizens' rights. Labour MP Stephen Pound says he was ""seduced"" by Margaret Thatcher and voted to join the European Union. He says the EU set global standards for decency, human rights, freedom and environmental legislation. If we leave the EU on 29 March this year, we must make sure our European brothers and sisters know that we will work with them. ""We will not stop being Europeans,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative James Duddridge says in voting against the deal he feels he is representing his constituents. Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick says the issue has become toxic, as shown by what has been happening outside and inside Parliament this week. Conservative MP Anna Soubry wassubjected to abusefrom protesters as she did broadcast interviews this week, and other MPs have been on the receiving end of abuse and harassment. He says he is talking himself into talking Theresa May's deal, because of the danger of a no-deal.

Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to stop a no-deal Brexit by backing another referendum. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Rosindell says that his constituents voted 70% to leave, and that nothing has changed their minds. ""I truly believe that our nation is up for this,"" he says. Labour's Matt Western says he ""cannot vote for any deal that will lead to people being worse off"". He says that Parliament is ""seeing the work of an autocratic tendency"" in the prime minister, ""this is not a debate, it is neither leadership,"" he states, referring to how Mrs May says that it is either her deal or no deal. But Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to ""stop people committing national suicide"". EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says that she was elected to try to stop Brexit. She says she is regularly stopped in the street by constituents who tell her they ""want an end to this mess"". ""We have to be honest with them,"" she says. ""Brexit isn't going to solve"" any of the issues that caused people to vote for it. ""Poll after poll shows that the will of the people has changed since 2016,"" she says, adding that there was breaking of electoral law. ""People should be allowed to change their mind,"" she adds. She says that MPs must ask themselves if this new deal is better than the deal we already have from the EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir David Amess says he is ""heartily sick of the word Brexit"" and is ""less than pleased"" on how the UK has gone about trying to leave the EU. ""There are a number of reasons why I cannot support this agreement,"" one of them being ""because it threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom"", he says. Labour's Jo Stevens says she will be voting against the deal with the ""overwhelming support"" of her constituents. She says that in the past month nothing has changed, like over the past two years of negotiations. ""The referendum was drenched in illegality by the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns,"" she adds. The result of the referendum does not apply ""in perpetuity"", she says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Mark Francois says that anyone who would call Remain-supporting MP Sir Nicholas Soames ""a traitor"" ""has clearly never met him"". Anyone who calls him that should ""go away and shut up"", he says. He states that he has been ""fairly consistent"" on European matters during his parliamentary career, in speaking against the EU. He says that the ""political declaration"" is ""legally completely meaningless"", and he adds that it is the ""legal equivalent of 'I promise I will respect you in the morning'"". He adds that he is ""utterly determined to vote against"" the deal. Having just been through ""considerable austerity"" it is wrong to pay Â£39bn to the EU for a deal with ""no guarantees"", he states. The UK is also not ""taking back control of our laws"" as the UK still has to ""obey EU laws"" but has lost the ability to influence them, under the deal, he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Luciana Berger says that few of the debates in the Commons have ever had ""such an impact"" on all constituents across the country. She accuses the prime minister of presenting a ""false choice"" of no deal or May's deal. ""It is beyond reproach that this [no deal] option has not been ruled out,"" she criticises the government for spending money on no deal preparations. Constituents will no longer be covered by EU Health Insurance Cards when they go abroad, she states. The NHS ""will suffer as we are are unable to properly recruit from EU countries"", she adds. A no-deal Brexit would ""isolate and hobble Britain's universities"", she says. There are 1.4m young people who are eligible to vote today who weren't before, 74% of her constituents wants a People's Vote, she states. Â© 2025 BBC.

Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics?,"""We're going to get smashed"" - one government insider's apocalyptic prediction about one of the most important votes in recent political history, the big night next Tuesday when MPs give their verdict on the government and the EU's compromise. As things stand, MPs are on course to kybosh Theresa May's long-argued-over Brexit deal, with a very heavy defeat. Dozens of her own backbenchers have said publicly they will vote against it. The opposition parties are adamant they will say ""no"" too. The Tories' supposed partners in government, the DUP, are deeply dug-in to opposing the agreement, for reasons we've discussed plenty of times here. Japan PM: World against no-deal Brexit May calls union leaders over Brexit deal Corbyn calls for election over Brexit And although there are whispers of compromises that might peel off a few rebels here and there and a handful of switchers - like her former policy chief George Freemanwho revealed his change of heart,externalin the Commons and will now back her - there is nothing on the horizon that looks like shifting big numbers. The draft script for Tuesday's drama, therefore, outlines a heavy and embarrassing defeat for the prime minister on her central policy, with nothing and no-one seeming to come to her rescue. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe met Theresa May for talks on Thursday But there are at least two factors that could change the dynamics, quite separate to the chorus of warnings about no deal from members of the Cabinet and outside voices like theJapanese leader Shinzo Abe. First off, with any rebellion it's not a bad rule of thumb to suggest that many of those who have made loud complaints may, in the end, prove to be less brave than they at first appear. It is not unusual for cantankerous politicians to be proven to have had rather a lot of mouth - and rather threadbare trousers. One senior Brexiteer told me they reckoned they had around 40 or 50 critics solid and certain to vote to reject the deal, far fewer than the hundred or so publicly opposed. Parliament seems in such uproar that perhaps the numbers will be as high as the most dire warnings suggest. But don't be surprised when MPs actually have to make a final decision and go through the division lobbies with their deadly rivals, if the scale of the defeat looks rather different. Casting a vote, especially one so vital, is very, very different to criticising a policy. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Second, we're not exactly short these days of twists in Parliamentary drama. And there could be another one next Tuesday. Other tweaks, amendments, might be suggested by MPs, and voted on first. The way this place works, if any of those ideas are approved, that would change what's on the table - maybe a little, maybe a lot. That means, despite the months of rows about the precise terms of the agreement, there might not be a vote on Theresa May's deal in its original form. This could be something relatively minor, although important to some MPs, like the increased environmental protections the PM has discussed with Labour MPs. Or, much bigger, an amendment that kills the deal off altogether. Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Brexit and the timetable for a 'Plan B' Still with me? Politically, what happens with the other ideas backbenchers put forward, before the expected vote on the deal as it stands, might matter enormously. That's because a defeat on the plan as amended, might be much smaller than a defeat on the deal with no changes. For Theresa May's authority, losing by a few dozen, is very different to losing by way over 100. That might, in turn, make it seem much more credible for the prime minister to have another go at getting it through. Will Hilary Benn's amendment go to the vote? And it also will matter who the main architects of the defeat appear to be. Government sources warning of being ""smashed"" in the Commons suggest the best outcome for them is, perversely, losing on an amendment, therefore avoiding a straightforward and overwhelming ""no"" to their deal. Some Brexiteers and some in government believe that that the Labour MP Hilary Benn's suggested change - that would reject the deal, and rule out no deal - could be voted through by MPs, because of support from former Remainers. And a narrow defeat at the hands of Remainers would be a totally different political beast to a heavy, heavy defeat at the hands of Brexiteers in their own party. One well-known member of the Conservative Eurosceptic group the ERG joked: ""We may not even end up being the bad guys - we might not have to rebel."" It's possible that Hilary Benn will pull that particular amendment, with talk of a different ""no deal"" amendment being put forward. And one senior Labour figure suggested the party would do almost anything to make sure that there is a clear vote on the prime minister's proposal and that Parliamentary shenanigans don't get in the way of the Commons giving a definite view, (they expect a total kicking), of Theresa May's plan. But as we head into these next few vital days, the point is that the serious games in the Commons are far from over. And what happens this time next week will be affected by precisely how Tuesday night plays out. In the wake of the likely defeat, Theresa May might make an emergency dash to Brussels, could pivot to a ""plan B"" or a series of emergency cross-party talks. But the actual numbers, the atmosphere once the tellers have actually counted the votes and who walks through which lobby will still shape what she does next.

Honda six-day Brexit shutdown,"Honda employs about 3,400 people at its Swindon plant Honda UK has said it will shut down its Swindon factory for six days in April as part of its preparations for any disruption caused post-Brexit. The Japanese-owned car giant said the move was to ensure it could adjust to ""all possible outcomes caused by logistics and border issues"". The firm said it would help in recovering lost production if shipments of parts were held up at borders. Honda employs about 3,400 people at its Swindon plant. In a statement, the company said: ""We are planning six non-production days in April 2019. This is to facilitate production recovery activity following any delays at borders on parts. ""These contingency provisions have been put in place to best mitigate the risk of disruption to production operations at the Swindon factory."" Meanwhile, Japanese car giant Toyota said it had ""no contingency for no deal"". A Toyota spokesperson said: ""We need a deal. We will have peak production in March because we have a new model, the Corolla. ""There is no planned production stop. No deal is not an option for us. We operate lean manufacturing and hold hours of inventory at the plant."" The spokesperson added that the firm could ""increase this by hours or perhaps a few days but there is no contingency that can offset no deal and production lines would start or stop"". Last year, the senior vice-president of Honda Europe warned that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would cost his company tens of millions of pounds. Ian Howells told the BBC that quitting the bloc without an agreement would affect the carmaker's competitiveness in Europe. He said the Japanese firm was preparing for a no-deal outcome, but had not discussed relocating its Swindon plant. The firm builds its Civic model in the UK for the global market.

May seeks union chief backing,"Mrs May said the deal was in the national interest at a press conference on Thursday Theresa May has spoken to the leaders of two of the biggest unions in the UK as she continues to try to build support for her Brexit deal. The PM spoke to Unite's Len McCluskey and the GMB's Tim Roache by phone on Thursday in what her spokesman described as ""constructive"" calls. He said Mrs May was undertaking ""widespread engagement"" about the deal. Mr Roache said he was glad the PM had ""finally picked up the phone"" but that her deal was not ""good enough"". ""If the deal genuinely did the job for GMB members, our union would support it, but it doesn't,"" he said. ""It's clear more time is required, we need to extend Article 50 and ultimately give the final say on Brexit to the public."" Laura Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics? Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn calls for election over Brexit World against no-deal Brexit - Japan PM Mrs May also spoke to John Allan, president of the CBI business lobby group, as MPs continue to debate the EU withdrawal agreement her government has negotiated with the EU, ahead of next Tuesday's vote. She has also met some Labour MPs as she continues efforts to build support for the deal, which more than 100 of her own MPs have said they will oppose. Asked if she was still ruling out Labour's policy of a permanent customs union with the EU, after talking to the party's MPs and union leaders, she her deal would deliver an ""ambitious"" trading arrangements with the EU and allow the UK to strike trade deals around the world. At a press conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, she said her deal was in the national interest ""because it's a good deal and therefore I hope that it will get wide support across the whole of Parliament"". Speaking alongside Mrs May in Downing Street, Mr Abe said  his country was in ""total support"" of Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement and wanted to ""invest more into your country and to enjoy further economic growth with the UK"". ""That is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the whole wish of the whole world,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

It has emerged that the government is considering backing an amendment from Labour Leave supporter John Mann, giving extra protections to workers and the environment, in a bid to win support. A number of Labour MPs in Leave-supporting constituencies back Mr Mann's amendment, which the MP said would open up the opportunity for other improvements to the prime minister's deal. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for an election over Brexit A spokesman for the prime minister said it was something they would ""consider very seriously"", adding that the government had ""a long standing commitment to strong labour protections"". Mr Mann told BBC News his amendment would make it more likely for him to back the deal, but admitted it didn't mean other Labour MPs would be ""rushing"" to do the same. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party did not ""accept or endorse"" what was on offer in the proposed amendment. He said it has already been ""quite clearly and emphatically rejected"" by leading trade unions. By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason The prime minister is hitting the phones - and the people on the other end are not regular recipients of telephonic greetings from Downing Street. So what's happening? Theresa May is reaching out. Her proposed Brexit deal needs friends, and if that means phoning people who wouldn't count as such politically, then so be it. The response from the trades unions has been less than gushing.  One source told me they amounted to ""eleventh hour, ten minute calls."" But, at the very least, it means Mrs May can say she is listening. Even if those on the other end of the line don't like what they are hearing. Greener UK - a group of 14 environmental organisations working on Brexit, including the RSPB and the Woodland Trust - said the aim of Mr Mann's amendment was ""commendable"", but it was not enough ""to prevent a weakening of environmental protections or standards"". Meanwhile, during the second of five days of debate on the deal, Conservative MP George Freeman has told MPs he will now vote for it, having previously said he could not support it. He said it ""wasn't perfect"" and he hoped there would be more concessions. Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Brexit and the timetable for a 'Plan B' But he added: ""I will, with a heavy heart on Tuesday, vote for this deal because we are now in the dying stages and no-deal is unconscionable. But I beg colleagues to ask their front benches to work together across the house in pursuit of something we can all be proud of."" The government has lost two Brexit votes in two days. The first defeatlimits the government's financial powersin the event of a no-deal departure. The second forces the PM to announcenew plans within three daysif her deal fails in the Commons. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP which has helped the government win votes since June 2017, haswarned the PM her deal is ""already dead"". In a sign that the party has not been swayed by the government's promise togive the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto,externalover any new EU regulations introduced under the terms of the proposed backstop arrangement, she accused Mrs May of ""wasting time"". Senior Conservatives have continued to express opposition to the withdrawal agreement and declaration on future relations, negotiated by Mrs May in November. The Labour Party will oppose Mrs May's deal next week, and push for a vote of no confidence if it is rejected by MPs, as Mr Corbyn believes that a general election is the most democratic way of breaking the Brexit deadlock. The DUP says it will support the government in any confidence vote if the Brexit deal is rejected, making a defeat less likely.

But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

Trump stands by Mexico wall claim,"This video can not be played Just why has the US government partially shut down? US President Donald Trump has renewed a threat to declare a national emergency to fund the construction of a wall on the Mexican border. A row with Democrats over funding the wall has left the government partially shut down for 20 days, leaving some 800,000 federal employees unpaid. On Saturday, the shutdown becomes the longest in US history. Mr Trump says the wall, a key campaign pledge, is needed to tackle a security crisis of illegal immigration. The Democrats say the wall is an ""immorality"" and a waste of taxpayers' money. Where do we go from here? US shutdown leaves websites insecure President Trump has refused to sign legislation to fund and reopen the government if it does not include $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) for the wall. He issued the threat on a visit on Thursday to a border patrol station in McAllen, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. He said that if Congress did not approve funding for the wall, he would ""probably... I would almost say definitely"" declare a national emergency to bypass lawmakers. Mr Trump visited the US-Mexico border in Mission, Texas, on Thursday ""I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,"" he said. In a later interview with Fox News, he doubled down, declaring: ""If we don't make a deal with Congress, most likely I will do that. ""I would actually say I would. I can't imagine any reason why not, because I'm allowed to do it."" ""The law is 100 percent on my side,"" he said. Mr Trump would have the right to undertake such a construction project in times of war and national emergency, usually allocating funds from the department of defence. But bypassing Congress would be hugely controversial, sparking allegations of the overuse of executive powers and it would almost certainly face huge legal challenges. How much of Trump's wall has been built? What border politicians think of Trump's wall How much has shutdown hit US economy? Some US media reports suggest the White House is considering diverting some of the $13.9bn (Â£10.9bn) allocated last year by Congress for disaster relief in such areas as Puerto Rico, Texas and California to pay for the wall. NBC News reported on Thursday thatMr Trump had been briefed on such a plan,externalbut the White House denied it. Analysts say the national emergency move would provide political cover to reopen government while allowing Mr Trump to argue he has done all he can to fulfil his campaign promise. The BBC's David Willis in Washington says that, with no further talks with the Democrats planned, this now seems the most likely option for the president. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, said there was no other pathway forward. He was speaking at McAllen station, behind a display of weapons and cash said to have been seized by the border patrol. He was joined by border patrol agents, and relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall ""If we don't have a barrier... you're not going to be able to solve this problem,"" he said, adding that people faced ""hard work"", ""gruelling problems"" and ""a lot of death"" without it. Mr Trump added: ""They say a wall is medieval... There are some things that work."" The president said in a national address on Tuesday the wall was needed to stem a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border"", involving ""thousands of illegal immigrants"". He pointed to illegal drug supplies, people trafficking and criminal acts by illegal immigrants in the US. The Democrats say the wall is ""ineffective"" and ""unnecessary"" and an expensive bill to taxpayers that the president had said Mexico would foot. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Trump said he never meant that Mexico would make a one-time payment for the wall. Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? ""When I said Mexico would pay for the wall in front of thousands and thousands of people... obviously I never meant Mexico would write a cheque,"" he said. Mr Trump alongside a display of weapons, drugs and cash reportedly seized by US border patrol However, this is contradicted byan archived campaign memo,externalfrom 2016, where Mr Trump outlined how he planned to ""compel Mexico to make a one-time payment"" of $5-10bn (Â£4bn-Â£8bn) for the wall. Mr Trump said on Thursday that, instead of a direct payment, Mexico would be ""paying for the wall indirectly, many, many times over"", under a new trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada. Economists have disputed this and critics say that any savings incurred due to the deal would go directly to private businesses rather than flow into US Treasury. Partial shutdowns occur when Congress cannot agree a budget by a certain deadline or the president refuses to sign it. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US Fourteen ways the US shutdown is hurting This shutdown, which began on 22 December, has closed 25% of the government. Of the 800,000 federal employees affected, about 350,000 are furloughed - a kind of temporary lay off - and the rest are working without pay. This video can not be played US shutdown: 'My son wants to sell art to pay our bills' The first pay day since the shutdown falls on Friday and will pass without workers getting salaries. They include prison guards, airport security screening staff, and members of the FBI. Some affected federal workers who spoke to the BBC said they had resorted to a number of measures, including taking other jobs, racking up credit card bills, tapping into savings or taking on loans at high interest rates to pay their bills. Thousands have also applied for unemployment benefits.

"Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts","This video can not be played Chief executive Ralf Speth says Jaguar Land Rover is ""facing unprecedented disruption"" Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it is cutting 4,500 jobs, with the substantial majority coming from its 40,000 strong UK workforce. Most will be in office roles as the company wants to simplify its management structure. The cuts come on top of last year's 1,500 job losses. JLR is facing several challenges, including a slump in demand for diesel cars and a sales slowdown in China. The firm has also complained about uncertainty caused by Brexit. The firm, which is owned by Indian conglomerate Tata, made a Â£90m pre-tax loss in the three months to September 30, a major reversal from the Â£385m profit of the previous year. ""We are taking decisive action to help deliver long-term growth, in the face of multiple geopolitical and regulatory disruptions as well as technology challenges facing the automotive industry,"" said JLR's chief executive, Ralf Speth. JLR workers 'tense' after cuts announced JLR, the UK's biggest vehicle maker, says it will be making further investment in electrification, with electric drive units to be produced at Wolverhampton and a new battery assembly centre to be established at Hams Hall, Birmingham. It comes as JLR revealed various annual and December 2018 sales figures: Total Jaguar Land Rover retail sales in 2018 came to 592,708 vehicles, down 4.6% compared with 2017.  Retail sales for December were 52,160, down 6.4% year-on-year, primarily due to slowdown in China. The introduction of the Jaguar E-Pace and I-Pace led to Jaguar's best ever annual sales results in 2018, up 1.2% to 180,833.  And December was a strong month, with sales of 16,165, up 7.2%. But sales of Land Rover models fell by 6.9% to 411,875 as market conditions in China and Europe deteriorated. Sales slumped by 11.4% in December to 35,995. Unite, the country's largest manufacturing union, said it would be pressing the car maker to safeguard its members' jobs. ""Britain's car workers have been caught in the crosshairs of the government's botched handling of Brexit, mounting economic uncertainty and ministers' demonisation of diesel, which along with the threat of a no deal Brexit, is damaging consumer confidence,"" Unite national officer Des Quinn said. ""Government ministers need to wake up and start doing more to support UK's car workers."" JLR plans a voluntary redundancy scheme, to help manage the latest round of job cuts. Are you a Jaguar Land Rover employee? Will you be affected by the job cuts? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Jaguar Land Rover has been saying for more than a year that Brexit uncertainty would eventually take its toll on the perception of the UK as a stable and competitive base for global manufacturing. In July last year, the company said it needed more certainty around Brexit in order to continue investing in its UK operations and warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit would cost the company more than Â£1.2bn in profit each year. If, as expected, the UK bears the brunt, or the entirety, of JLR's global cost-cutting, JLR may well say it tried to warn us. Another massive flashing red light is a collapse in sales in its biggest market - China. And JLR is also one of the most heavily exposed car makers to continuing consumer confusion about the wisdom of buying a diesel car in the aftermath of the VW emissions scandal. Ninety percent of its vehicles are diesel-powered, although it has been investing in new electric and hybrid vehicles. What's gone wrong at Jaguar Land Rover? UK car sales see biggest fall since financial crisis China car sales fall for the first time in 20 years The layoffs come amid what industry insiders have called a ""perfect storm"". That includes a slowdown in Chinese sales, a slump in diesel sales and concerns about UK competitiveness post-Brexit. China has been the company's biggest and most profitable market. But sales there have fallen nearly 50% in recent months as cautious Chinese consumers have been holding back on big ticket purchases. The relationship between JLR and its Chinese sales network have also been strained as dealers have demanded better terms and promotional incentives. The issues at JLR have arisen as Ford is also looking to cut back on itsworkforce numbers in Europe. Recently JLR announced it would move all production of the Land Rover Discovery to a new plant in Slovakia with plans to hire up to 3,000 workers. In China it has hired 4,000 workers since 2014. Here in the UK, JLR's Castle Bromwich factory makes the Jaguar XE, XF and F-type models, while the Solihull facility produces the Jaguar F-Pace, Land Rover Discovery and Range Rover models. The company's Ryton and Halewood facilities manufacture the Jaguar XE SV Project 8, Range Rover SV CoupÃ©, Land Rover Discovery Sport and Range Rover Evoque models. As well as its UK manufacturing centres, JLR also has facilities in Brazil, Austria, Slovakia, India and China.

US to 'expel every Iranian boot' from Syria,"Mike Pompeo gave the US commitment during a visit to Egypt The US will work with allies to ""expel every last Iranian boot"" from Syria, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says. Mr Pompeo warned there would be no US reconstruction aid for areas controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad until Iran and its proxies had left. He also criticised ex-President Barack Obama's Middle East policy, saying he had made ""dire misjudgements"". Mr Pompeo was speaking in Cairo three weeks after President Donald Trump said US troops were pulling out of Syria. The announcement had shocked US allies and sparked strong criticism in Washington. War-weary Syrians in Manbij wait to learn fate Trump rewrites US-Syria policy After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Mr Pompeo, who has been seeking to reassure allies following Mr Trump's surprise announcement, said: ""America will not retreat until the terror fight is over. We will labour tirelessly alongside you to defeat Isis [the Islamic State group], al-Qaeda and other jihadists that threaten our security and yours."" He said that the US was a ""force for good"" in the Middle East, adding: ""Where America retreats, chaos follows."" Iran, alongside Russia, has been supporting the Syrian government in the Syrian civil war, providing arms, military advisers, and reportedly combat troops. The US is deeply suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East and views it as a destabilising force in the region. It is also an ally of Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of Iran's foes. On Thursday, Mr Pompeo said: ""We will not ease our campaign to stop Iran's malevolent influence and actions against this region and the world."" He added that American sanctions against Iran were ""the strongest in history and will keep getting tougher"". Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif mocked Mr Pompeo's speech, saying that wherever the US interferes, ""chaos, repression and resentment follow"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Pompeo did not directly name Mr Trump's predecessor. However, he referred frequently to a key speech Mr Obama gave in Cairo in 2009, where he had called for ""a new beginning"" for the US and the Middle East. Mr Pompeo said: ""In this very city, another American stood before you. He told you that radical Islamist terrorism does not stem from ideology... He told you that the United States and the Muslim world needed 'a new beginning.' The results of these misjudgements have been dire."" ""We were timid about asserting ourselves when the times - and our partners - demanded it,"" he said. The Trump administration has been critical of Mr Obama's decision to strike a deal to limit Iran's nuclear activities, and had accused him of being too soft on Islamist terrorism, and a poor ally to Israel. National Security Action, a think tank involving many of Mr Obama's former policy advisers,external, criticised Mr Pompeo's speech. ""That this administration feels the need, nearly a decade later, to take pot-shots at an effort to identify common ground between the Arab world and the West speaks not only to the Trump administration's pettiness, but also to its lack of a strategic vision,"" it said in a statement ""Together with the broader administration he represents, Pompeo sees Islam as an enemy, human rights as a side concern, and autocrats worthy of embrace,"" the group added. Analysis by Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington Mike Pompeo framed his speech as the anti-Obama policy - a return to a strong US that wasn't afraid to help its friends and be more proactive as ""a force for good"". He accused the former president of underestimating the viciousness and tenacity of Islamist extremism and said his timid approach to the Middle East had both emboldened Iran and contributed to the rise of Islamic State militants. His argument ignored the fact that Mr Obama's Cairo speech was trying to repair damage with the Muslim world wrought by the wars of George W Bush. Nor did it signal a new interventionism: Mr Pompeo insisted President Trump was committed to fully dismantling Islamic State despite his decision to pull US troops out of Syria, but wanted partners play a bigger role. And unlike his Republican predecessor Condoleezza Rice, who also took a turn at the Cairo podium, he made barely a mention of democracy. In essence his speech was a clear declaration that the Trump administration's top priority would be to counter Iran, as well as protect Israel, and suggested that would be the benchmark for judging America's still largely authoritarian Arab allies. The US, along with Turkey, Gulf Arab states, and Jordan, has been supporting some rebel groups. Some 2,000 US military personnel are reported to be in Syria, and have been involved in fighting Islamic State militants. Syria war: Who's fighting whom? In December, Mr Trump said he was withdrawing all remaining troops because IS had been ""defeated"", adding ""they're all coming back and they're coming back now"". The announcement shocked allies and several US defence officials, includingDefence Secretary James Mattis, resigned shortly afterwards. Since then, US officials have appeared to row back slightly on the decision. Mr Trump said the troops would be pulled out ""slowly"", while National Security Adviser John Bolton said the withdrawal would depend on certain conditions. Analysts have described the administration's Syria policy as ""messy"",externaland confusing for allies. Why Trump's love affair with generals turned sour Pentagon chief of staff Kevin Sweeney resigns Mr Pompeo's Thursday speech appeared to be an attempt to reassure partners, while also reiterating Mr Trump's decision to pull out troops. ""President Trump has made the decision to bring our troops home from Syria... but this isn't a change of mission. We remain committed to the complete dismantling of the Isis [IS] threat,"" he said. Other stops in Mr Pompeo's Middle East tour will include Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE.

Man who drove car into nightclub jailed,"This video can not be played CCTV of car being driven into busy nightclub A man who drove his car down a crowded alley and on to a nightclub dancefloor has been jailed for 28 years. Mohammed Abdul, 21, injured staff and revellers at Blake's in Gravesend after being ""humiliated"" when he was thrown out by bouncers for being too drunk. He made threats to kill the door staff before returning in his Suzuki Vitara 10 minutes later. Abdul, of Deptford, south-east London, was convicted at Maidstone Crown Court of two counts of attempted murder. Eight people were injured in the attack on 17 March, including Katie Wells, 18, who was left with a fractured pelvis, and cameraman Pierre Jermaine Joseph who had a fractured shinbone. Eight people were injured in the attack at Blake's nightclub Sentencing Abdul, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described the club as a ""scene of carnage"". She said his victims could have easily been killed and the injuries to Ms Wells could render her infertile. ""You have robbed that young lady of future choices and have also had a profound impact on her psychological health. ""Your motive was selfish and pathetic, it was revenge at being thrown out for being drunk. ""Your action led to panic and distress among dozens of people."" Mohammed Abdul was drunk and had been using drugs at the time of the attack Jurors heard Abdul was drunk at the time, after consuming up to 15 vodkas and tequila shots. He had also smoked at least five cannabis joints that night and said he felt ""humiliated"" when he was ejected from the club. Abdul said he only intended to ""make a nuisance of himself to get his own back on the door staff"". The attack, described in court as a determined and deliberate attempt to kill, was captured on CCTV. Footage from inside the club showed Abdul driving past bouncers and down an alleyway packed with clubbers before stopping and accelerating on to the dancefloor in a marquee connected to the venue. One man could be seen spread-eagled on the bonnet, while others were fleeing for safety as security guards appeared in pursuit of the car. The Suzuki could then be seen reversing, its registration plate hanging off at an angle, as people staggered to their feet. Abdul made threats to kill the door staff before returning in his Suzuki Vitara Abdul, who only had a provisional licence for the car, was also disqualified from driving for 16 years. He had denied trying to kill anyone but admitted two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Det Sgt Alastair Worton said many of the injured people were still recovering. He added: ""Abdul's actions that night were beyond deplorable, from his inappropriate behaviour which led to him being ejected from Blake's, right through to driving at innocent people who were only looking for a good night.""

'Military' anti-drone kit for all airportsAirports are warned not to expect the RAF to help with delays caused by drones in future.UK,"All major UK airports now have or will soon have military grade anti-drone equipment, the government says. It comes after the military were called in to help when drone sightings caused delays for around an hour at Heathrow on Tuesday. And drone sightings at Gatwick caused major disruption affecting 140,000 passengers before Christmas. Earlier, the defence secretary said it would ""not be right"" to ask the RAF to respond to similar incidents in future. Gavin Williamson said all commercial airports needed to invest in anti-drone technology. Ministers are also working on ensuring the technology is installed at other critical infrastructure such as prisons, power stations and military sites. British Airways aeroplanes were among those to be grounded at Heathrow on Tuesday night. Official figures show 120 near misses between drones and aircraft were reported over the last year - a twenty-fold increase on the six incidents recorded in 2014. Speaking on a visit to RAF Marham, Norfolk, Mr Williamson said: ""I think that everyone would be expecting all airports to be having this detection, and deterrence effect also, at all commercial airports in the future. ""It is a logical thing for them to be investing [in]."" Military-grade anti-drone equipment has already been installed at airports across the UK. A system which can detect, track and ground the devices has been installed on the roof of Gatwick's South Terminal following last month's chaos. How can a drone cause so much chaos? New powers to tackle illegal drone use Gatwick said last weekthat it had spent Â£5m to prevent future attacks. Heathrow also confirmed it would be buying systems to guard against drones. Andit was announced this weekthat police would be given new powers to tackle the illegal use of drones. The Heathrow and Gatwick incidents raised questions about how UK airports deal with drones - an issue which has been raised repeatedly by the aviation industry. Defence Minister Gavin Williamson issued today's warning shortly after declaring Britain's first nine F-35B Lightning II fighter jets ready for combat. The US-built jets, which cost Â£92m each, are expected to revive Britain's ability to launch sea-borne operations from aircraft carriers. The planes can reach speeds of 1,200mph and can land vertically, similar to the Harrier jump jets. A combat-ready F-35B, seen here with Spear, Asraam and Meteor missiles in the foreground. Mr Williamson said: ""Our nation is moving into a new era outside the EU, and our huge achievements in air capability make our commitment to a role on the world stage clear to both our allies and our enemies. ""The incredible F-35 jets are ready for operations, a transformed Typhoon has the power to dominate the skies into the 2040s and we continue to look even further into an ambitious future.""

"Refunds after 'spectacularly bad' pantoGood performance? Oh no it isn't - pantomime fans are offered refunds after ""awful"" production.Wiltshire","The venue provided promotional images of the production which featured actors that did not appear in the Chippenham panto A venue that put on a ""spectacularly bad"" pantomime has offered a refund to all customers who paid to see it. Jack and the Beanstalk at Chippenham's Neeld Community and Arts Centre was billed as boasting a ""sparkling set and glittering costumes"". But one disgruntled punter said: ""There were only three people, no scenery, they couldn't sing or dance."" The town council, which runs the venue, said it ""was not the standard of show the Neeld is used to presenting"". The company behind the show, OOOH ARRR Productions, said there had been a ""booking error"" and it had received a ""handful of complaints"" but had agreed a full refund with the venue. The show ran from 27-29 December, and was sold out, with standard tickets priced at Â£7.00. Posting on the 158-seat venue's Facebook page, ticket-buyer Natalie Uff described the panto as ""awful"". ""At one point they were talking to voices in the wings as they ran out of people,"" she said. Another panto fan, Tereza Cleverley, said: ""It was spectacularly bad. It felt as if two of the cast members had been pulled in at the last minute and it was their first live show."" And John Snell said he was ""mortified"" by the standard of the production. The Chippenham show was promoted using photos taken from a previous production with a different cast. The panto was advertised using promotional photos from a previous show which featured actors that did not appear in the Chippenham production In a statement,external, the town council said ""we pride ourselves in providing high quality shows for Chippenham"" but the ""images provided by the company for promotional purposes did not reflect the show they brought to us"". ""We had been assured by the theatre production company there would be a cast of six professional actors with industry standard staging,"" it added. In a statement,externalon its Facebook page, OOOH ARRR Productions said the ""disappointment and confusion"" was the result of a ""booking error"" which saw the original ""six person production"" replaced. ""There were conversations with the venue that involved replacing it with the three person cast due to it potentially not selling well,"" the spokesperson said. ""The other members of our staff were only made aware of this issue following the first performance.""

Bercow Brexit ruling 'extremely concerning',"This video can not be played Bercow: I require no lessons or lectures on how to be Speaker John Bercow has been accused of ""unilaterally changing"" parliamentary rules in the wake of a row over a government Brexit defeat in Parliament. Critics of the Commons Speaker say he broke with precedent and ignored the advice of officials when he approved a vote on the PM's ""Plan B"" response, which ministers lost by 11 votes. Mr Bercow said he had made an ""honest judgement"" in the interests of MPs. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said his actions were ""extremely concerning"". But Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg defended the Speaker as ""a House of Commons champion"" - despite disagreeing with his decision - and said the amendment itself was ""completely irrelevant [and] unimportant"". On Thursday, Mr Bercow remained defiant in the face of more criticism from Mrs Leadsom during business questions, as she again accused him of ""arbitrarily changing the rules"" for the amendment. The Speaker told the Commons he required ""no lessons or lectures"" on how to do his job, and that he would carry on with his duties ""no matter how much abuse I get"". Who is John Bercow? How Bercow's ruling could change Brexit Fresh Brexit setback for May in MPs' vote How voters want Brexit to be sorted out There were angry scenes in the Commons on Wednesday when Mr Bercow agreed to allow a vote on an amendment to a government motion tabled by Brexit rebel Dominic Grieve. The vote was ultimately lost by the government, meaning ministers will have to come up with revised plans within three days, rather than the three weeks previously agreed in law, if Mrs May's EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week.

Ministers argued that the business motion, tabled by the government, was not amendable and said the Speaker was breaking with long-standing precedent in saying it was. Mrs Leadsom was among MPs to challenge the basis of his ruling and ask for clarification in a series of points of order after Prime Minister's Questions. She later told ITV's Peston programme that it had set ""a very damaging precedent"" for the conduct of business in the House and the passage of future legislation. ""I am extremely concerned about the decision that was taken today,"" she said. This video can not be played Bercow: ""Anti-Brexit sticker belongs to my wife"" ""What happened today was that the Speaker, instead of being the guardian of the rules, decided to unilaterally change the rules... It doesn't just damage me, it damages all of Parliament."" Mrs Leadsom said Mr Bercow's future was a matter for him but asked if she was questioning his impartiality, she said she had the ""greatest regard"" for the office of Speaker. Earlier in the chamber, ex-minister Crispin Blunt said Mr Bercow had served nine years in the job but questions now had to be asked whether he remained a ""neutral referee of our affairs"". But Mr Rees-Mogg said he was a ""great admirer"" of the Speaker, even though he believed the decision ""could make parliamentary business extraordinarily difficult"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I happen to think on this occasion Mr Speaker came to the wrong interpretation, but that doesn't mean I think he is not a fair speaker and a good speaker. ""I do think... that the speaker's interpretation was eccentric, but I don't think it is part of a plot or undermines his standing or any of those things."" Mr Bercow rejected calls to publish the advice he had received from his clerks. In making his ruling, he argued that if Parliament was always bound by precedent ""nothing would change and things do change"". He was ""not setting himself up against the government but championing the rights of the House of Commons"", adding that if people wanted to vote against the amendment they could. The BBC's parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said it was a ""massive ruling"", made reportedly against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler. He said it drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit. Since being elected as Speaker in 2009, he has angered many Tory MPs for his handling of business and treatment of MPs, but he also has many admirers, particularly on the Labour benches, who believe he has transformed the way Parliament holds the executive to account. He sat as Conservative MP for Buckingham from 1997 but, in line with tradition, quit the party and sits as an independent since becoming Speaker. He has said he voted Remain in the 2016 referendum but insisted he was impartial as Speaker.

May seeks backing from union chiefs,"Mrs May said the deal was in the national interest at a press conference on Thursday Theresa May has spoken to the leaders of two of the biggest unions in the UK as she continues to try to build support for her Brexit deal. The PM spoke to Unite's Len McCluskey and the GMB's Tim Roache by phone on Thursday in what her spokesman described as ""constructive"" calls. He said Mrs May was undertaking ""widespread engagement"" about the deal. Mr Roache said he was glad the PM had ""finally picked up the phone"" but that her deal was not ""good enough"". ""If the deal genuinely did the job for GMB members, our union would support it, but it doesn't,"" he said. ""It's clear more time is required, we need to extend Article 50 and ultimately give the final say on Brexit to the public."" Laura Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics? Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn calls for election over Brexit World against no-deal Brexit - Japan PM Mrs May also spoke to John Allan, president of the CBI business lobby group, as MPs continue to debate the EU withdrawal agreement her government has negotiated with the EU, ahead of next Tuesday's vote. She has also met some Labour MPs as she continues efforts to build support for the deal, which more than 100 of her own MPs have said they will oppose. Asked if she was still ruling out Labour's policy of a permanent customs union with the EU, after talking to the party's MPs and union leaders, she her deal would deliver an ""ambitious"" trading arrangements with the EU and allow the UK to strike trade deals around the world. At a press conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, she said her deal was in the national interest ""because it's a good deal and therefore I hope that it will get wide support across the whole of Parliament"". Speaking alongside Mrs May in Downing Street, Mr Abe said  his country was in ""total support"" of Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement and wanted to ""invest more into your country and to enjoy further economic growth with the UK"". ""That is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the whole wish of the whole world,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

It has emerged that the government is considering backing an amendment from Labour Leave supporter John Mann, giving extra protections to workers and the environment, in a bid to win support. A number of Labour MPs in Leave-supporting constituencies back Mr Mann's amendment, which the MP said would open up the opportunity for other improvements to the prime minister's deal. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for an election over Brexit A spokesman for the prime minister said it was something they would ""consider very seriously"", adding that the government had ""a long standing commitment to strong labour protections"". Mr Mann told BBC News his amendment would make it more likely for him to back the deal, but admitted it didn't mean other Labour MPs would be ""rushing"" to do the same. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party did not ""accept or endorse"" what was on offer in the proposed amendment. He said it has already been ""quite clearly and emphatically rejected"" by leading trade unions. By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason The prime minister is hitting the phones - and the people on the other end are not regular recipients of telephonic greetings from Downing Street. So what's happening? Theresa May is reaching out. Her proposed Brexit deal needs friends, and if that means phoning people who wouldn't count as such politically, then so be it. The response from the trades unions has been less than gushing.  One source told me they amounted to ""eleventh hour, ten minute calls."" But, at the very least, it means Mrs May can say she is listening. Even if those on the other end of the line don't like what they are hearing. Greener UK - a group of 14 environmental organisations working on Brexit, including the RSPB and the Woodland Trust - said the aim of Mr Mann's amendment was ""commendable"", but it was not enough ""to prevent a weakening of environmental protections or standards"". Meanwhile, during the second of five days of debate on the deal, Conservative MP George Freeman has told MPs he will now vote for it, having previously said he could not support it. He said it ""wasn't perfect"" and he hoped there would be more concessions. Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Brexit and the timetable for a 'Plan B' But he added: ""I will, with a heavy heart on Tuesday, vote for this deal because we are now in the dying stages and no-deal is unconscionable. But I beg colleagues to ask their front benches to work together across the house in pursuit of something we can all be proud of."" The government has lost two Brexit votes in two days. The first defeatlimits the government's financial powersin the event of a no-deal departure. The second forces the PM to announcenew plans within three daysif her deal fails in the Commons. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP which has helped the government win votes since June 2017, haswarned the PM her deal is ""already dead"". In a sign that the party has not been swayed by the government's promise togive the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto,externalover any new EU regulations introduced under the terms of the proposed backstop arrangement, she accused Mrs May of ""wasting time"". Senior Conservatives have continued to express opposition to the withdrawal agreement and declaration on future relations, negotiated by Mrs May in November. The Labour Party will oppose Mrs May's deal next week, and push for a vote of no confidence if it is rejected by MPs, as Mr Corbyn believes that a general election is the most democratic way of breaking the Brexit deadlock. The DUP says it will support the government in any confidence vote if the Brexit deal is rejected, making a defeat less likely. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

World against no-deal Brexit - Japan PM,"Mr Abe was speaking during a visit to London The ""whole world"" wants the UK to avoid a no-deal Brexit, Japan's PM has claimed, after talks with Theresa May. Shinzo Abe pledged ""total support"" for the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU, which faces a crunch vote in the Commons on Tuesday. Mrs May has been speaking to Labour MPs and union leaders in a bid to try to get her deal through the Commons, where scores of her own MPs oppose it. It comes as Honda UK announced a six-day post Brexit shut down. The Japanese-owned car giant said the move was to ensure it could adjust to ""all possible outcomes caused by logistics and border issues"". Laura Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics? May calls union chiefs over Brexit deal Honda plans six-day shutdown post-Brexit Mrs May said leaving the EU provided ""an unprecedented opportunity"" for the countries to strengthen relations. She and Mr Abe pledged to build on the trade agreement between Japan and the EU to secure an ""ambitious bilateral arrangement"" between Japan and the UK after Brexit. Mr Abe said: ""It is the strong will of Japan to further develop this strong partnership with the UK, to invest more into your country and to enjoy further economic growth with the UK. ""That is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the whole wish of the whole world. ""Japan is in total support of the draft withdrawal agreement worked out between the EU and Prime Minister May, which provides for a transition to ensure legal stability for businesses that have invested into this country.""

The UK is set to leave the European Union on 29 March. The withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU - covering things like the ""divorce bill"", expat citizens' rights and a 20-month transition period - will only come into force if MPs back it in a vote. A no-deal Brexit would see the UK leave without a withdrawal agreement and start trading with the EU on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, an outcome favoured by some Brexiteers. The deal negotiated between the UK and EU looks set to be rejected by MPs next Tuesday, with 110 Conservative MPs having said they will oppose it, Labour set to vote against it and Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn calling for a general election ""at the earliest opportunity"" - should it be voted down. ""A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all,"" he said. ""We're going to get smashed"" - one government insider's apocalyptic prediction about one of the most important votes in recent political history. As things stand, MPs are on course to kybosh Theresa May's long-argued-over Brexit deal, with a very heavy defeat. Dozens of her own backbenchers have said publicly they will vote against it. The opposition parties are adamant they will say ""no"" too. Read more from Laura Mrs May has been speaking to some Labour MPs and the leaders of two of the UK's biggest trade unions, Len McCluskey of Unite and Tim Roache of the GMB, in a bid to try to build support for the deal. It has emerged that the government is considering backing an amendment from Labour Leave supporter John Mann, giving extra protections to workers and the environment, in a bid to win support. Speaking alongside Prime Minister Abe, Mrs May repeated her call to MPs to support her plan in next Tuesday's crunch vote, saying: ""The only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal and to agree a deal, and the deal that is on the table...the EU has made clear, is the only deal."" Corbyn calls for election over Brexit Japan to scrap UK beef and lamb ban She said the deal allowed for a ""more ambitious trading arrangement between the European Union and the United Kingdom than they have entered into with any other third country"" which would also allow the UK to ""strike good trade deals on our own with countries around the world, like Japan"". Labour MP Martin Whitfield, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for another referendum, said: ""It is humiliating for the prime minster to be told to her face that the whole world wants to avoid a no-deal scenario, yet she still refuses to rule it out. ""Countries across the globe are looking at Britain in despair. Japan, like our other allies, understands the folly of a no-deal Brexit. Why doesn't Theresa May?"" Meanwhile, during the second of five days of debate on the deal, Conservative MP George Freeman has told MPs he will now vote for it ""with a heavy heart"", having previously said he could not support it. He said it ""wasn't perfect"" but he would back it because ""we are now in the dying stages and no deal is unconscionable"". Trade between the UK and Japan hit Â£28bn last year, and Japanese companies already employ 150,000 people in the UK. During their meeting in Downing Street, Mrs May and Mr Abe also discussed a number of joint projects, including research around conditions such as dementia and heart failure, the increasing use of big data and artificial intelligence, and environmentally friendly growth. They also made commitments on security - such as the UK deploying the Royal Navy warship HMS Montrose to the region to enforce sanctions against North Korea. And as part of a cultural exchange, the National Gallery will send a major exhibition to Japan, including the Sunflowers painting by Vincent Van Gogh.

Corbyn urges election over Brexit,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for a general election: âThis political chaos cannot go on."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has stepped up calls for a general election ""at the earliest opportunity"" to ""break the deadlock"" over Brexit. In a speech, he said a new government would have a fresh mandate to negotiate a better withdrawal deal with the EU. He told Theresa May: ""If you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide."" The Conservatives said Labour did not have a plan for Brexit and were ""playing politics"". Live: MPs debate Brexit Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum May seeks support of Labour MPs for deal Mr Corbyn has resisted growing calls from within his own party to get behind another EU referendum, insisting an election is still his top priority if Theresa May's Brexit deal is rejected by MPs next week. The UK is set to leave the European Union on 29 March. The withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU - covering things like trade, expat citizens' rights and setting up a 20-month transition period - will only come into force if MPs back it in a vote. Labour is set to vote against Mrs May's deal next Tuesday and if, as widely expected, it is defeated, they are expected to start moves to trigger a general election. Asked if this would happen immediately, Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""table a motion of no confidence in the government at the moment we judge it to have the best chance of success"". If a majority of MPs back a no confidence motion, the government will get 14 days to try and win another confidence vote - if it can't do that, a general election will be held. Mr Corbyn said: ""Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own. So members across the House should vote with us to break the deadlock."" Theresa May has met Leave-supporting Labour MPs Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which is also against Mrs May's deal, has said it will back her in any confidence vote. As debate on the Brexit deal resumed in the House of Commons for the second of five days, it emerged that some of Mr Corbyn's Leave-supporting backbench MPs have been speaking to Theresa May about backing her deal if she can guarantee environmental standards and rights for workers. But Mr Corbyn said Labour did not ""endorse or accept"" a reported offer from the government to adopt an amendment to protect workplace and environmental rights. ""It's already been quite clearly and emphatically rejected by the TUC and leading trade unions. They say it simply doesn't guarantee the protections that we are seeking."" Theresa May has, meanwhile, reached out to union leaders to seek their backing for her deal, it has emerged. The prime minister made telephone calls to Len McCluskey, general secretary of Labour's biggest financial backer Unite, and GMB leader Tim Roache. Mr Roache said: ""As you would expect, I was very clear about GMB's position - the deal on the table isn't good enough and non-binding assurances on workers' rights won't cut it."" Labour MPs on the anti-Brexit side of the party are calling on Mr Corbyn to get behind the campaign for a new EU referendum - something polls suggest is supported by the majority of Labour members. Mr Corbyn has said his preferred option is to trigger a general election and, having won it, seek to delay Brexit in order to negotiate a better deal with Brussels, which he says would see the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU and with a close relationship with the single market. This policy, together with a ""radical"" Labour government would kick start economic growth, and ""allow a renaissance in our manufacturing sector, which will create good, secure jobs and help restore pride and prosperity to parts of our country that have been ignored for too long"", he argued. If Labour is not able to get a general election, Mr Corbyn said all options were ""on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote"". Asked if a fresh referendum would be in Labour's election manifesto, he said: ""Our policy would be to negotiate urgently with the EU as and when we take office, but clearly a general election must come first in order to do that. If you feel like you ought to know more about Brexit... Our chatbot answers the top five questions,external A really simple guide What we know about how voters want it sorted out ""Policy-making is made by the Labour Party in a democratic form and that policy will be put together and put into a manifesto in any election that's coming up."" He said he understood the concerns of younger voters, who polls suggest overwhelmingly backed another referendum on staying in the EU, but he also understood those who had voted to leave the EU and he wanted to bring the country together. In a speech to Labour activists at an electrical products manufacturer in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, Mr Corbyn said Theresa May would forfeit the right to govern if she cannot get her Brexit deal through the Commons. ""A government that cannot get its business through the Commons is no government at all. It has lost its mandate so must go to the country to seek another."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Mr Corbyn vowed to heal the divide between Leave and Remain voters, saying the ""real divide"" in the UK was between the ""many"" who ""do the work, create the wealth and pay taxes"" and the ""few"" who ""set the rules, reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes"". He said: ""The real solution is to transform Britain to work in the interests of the vast majority, by challenging the entrenched power of a privileged elite. ""That is how we can help to heal the referendum's deep divisions."" The government has lost two Brexit votes in two days. The first defeatlimits the government's financial powersin the event of a no-deal departure. The second forces the PM to announcenew plans within three daysif her deal fails in the Commons. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis, said: ""Labour simply do not have a plan for Brexit. Instead they are arguing in public about whether to frustrate the decision of the British people and rerun the referendum."" The cross-party People's Vote campaign for another referendum, which is backed by about 30 Labour MPs, also criticised Mr Corbyn's speech. Campaign supporter and Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said: ""Many Labour MPs, not to mention the party's voters and members, will be horrified by the prospect that their party leader is still proposing to fight the next election as a supporter of Brexit."" Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards, another People's Vote supporter, said: ""An election in which both Labour and Conservative Brexit policies are almost indistinguishable will solve nothing.""

Honda plans six-day shutdown,"Honda employs about 3,400 people at its Swindon plant Honda UK has said it will shut down its Swindon factory for six days in April as part of its preparations for any disruption caused post-Brexit. The Japanese-owned car giant said the move was to ensure it could adjust to ""all possible outcomes caused by logistics and border issues"". The firm said it would help in recovering lost production if shipments of parts were held up at borders. Honda employs about 3,400 people at its Swindon plant. In a statement, the company said: ""We are planning six non-production days in April 2019. This is to facilitate production recovery activity following any delays at borders on parts. ""These contingency provisions have been put in place to best mitigate the risk of disruption to production operations at the Swindon factory."" Meanwhile, Japanese car giant Toyota said it had ""no contingency for no deal"". A Toyota spokesperson said: ""We need a deal. We will have peak production in March because we have a new model, the Corolla. ""There is no planned production stop. No deal is not an option for us. We operate lean manufacturing and hold hours of inventory at the plant."" The spokesperson added that the firm could ""increase this by hours or perhaps a few days but there is no contingency that can offset no deal and production lines would start or stop"". Last year, the senior vice-president of Honda Europe warned that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would cost his company tens of millions of pounds. Ian Howells told the BBC that quitting the bloc without an agreement would affect the carmaker's competitiveness in Europe. He said the Japanese firm was preparing for a no-deal outcome, but had not discussed relocating its Swindon plant. The firm builds its Civic model in the UK for the global market.

"PM's plan is dead, says Foster","Arlene Foster said she does not believe NI is heading towards a ""disastrous no-deal situation"" Theresa May is still not listening to critics of her Brexit deal and is putting a plan to Parliament that is already ""dead"", Arlene Foster has said. The DUP leader said proposals to give Stormont a say over new EU rules if the border backstop took effect after Brexit added nothing. Sinn FÃ©in president, Mary Lou McDonald, said ""there must be no veto afforded to any party by anybody"". At Westminster, MPs are debating the withdrawal agreement with the EU. The Irish border backstop is the insurance policy to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, if another solution is not found through a wider UK-EU trade deal. Ministers defeated over no-deal Brexit Is the EU about to rescue Theresa May? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told the BBC the government's plans amounted to giving the NI Assembly a ""veto"". However,his official written statement to Parliament,externaldoes not contain the word ""veto"". Mrs Foster said the DUP's opposition to the backstop remained firm. ""We would prefer if the backstop disappeared, what we've been presented with is a narrative and doesn't add anything,"" Mrs Foster told BBC Newsline. She accused the prime minister of continuing to ""waste time"" and said it was disappointing it had taken other parties at Westminster so long to start calling for an alternative to the government's withdrawal agreement. ""We told Theresa May to stop wasting time last November, she is still not listening and she is going to put a plan to Parliament that is dead,"" she said. This video can not be played Why doesnât Northern Ireland have a government? Mrs Foster said the DUP had put an alternative forward last year, to remove the backstop and work towards a different deal - but the prime minister is sticking by her plan. Sinn FÃ©in has urged the EU and Irish government not to ""blink"" when it comes to fully defending the backstop. The party's leadership, Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill, were speaking after meeting EU officials. Michelle O'Neill said the DUP ""will not be allowed to further put into jeopardy the rights of citizens here"" Mrs McDonald said she had been given a ""strong commitment"" from Brussels that the backstop in the withdrawal agreement would be protected. She added that as the Brexit negotiations approach the final stage, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar needed to ""hold firm and not panic"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Ms O'Neill's message to EU officials and the Irish government was: ""Don't blink, there can be no weakening of the backstop."" Leo Varadkar was asked about the new proposals during a visit to Ethiopia The Irish government has said it could not support the government's latest proposals for Northern Ireland. Mr Varadkar told reporters on a visit to Ethiopia: ""I don't think we can have a situation whereby the Northern Ireland executive or assembly has a veto power because that would essentially give one of the two communities veto power over the other."" The Irish government has repeatedly said it will not allow the withdrawal agreement to be renegotiated, but would seek to offer the UK government political reassurances. Mrs Foster said: ""No-one wants throw Ireland under the bus, but what we want to see is a deal that is good for the whole of the UK and protects the union."" The backstop is a position of last resort to maintain a soft border on the island of Ireland. It would involve Northern Ireland staying in large parts of the EU single market, unless and until a long-term deal emerged that kept the border as open as it is now. The proposals, published on Wednesday,,externalinclude: Before the backstop would come into effect, the assembly would have to be consulted, with its views brought before Parliament ahead of a vote at Westminster The assembly would approve any new single market regulations for Northern Ireland introduced by the EU - updates to existing rules would automatically apply No divergence in rules applied in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK Commitment to a role for the executive on the committees which would manage and oversee the backstop. BBC News NI's business editor John Campbell said the proposals appear to fall short of an outright veto as they do not specify that the assembly must give agreement before the UK government acts. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The EU-UK agreement, known as the withdrawal agreement and signed in November, laid out the procedure for any new EU rules being introduced after the backstop is triggered. The EU would inform the UK about the new rule and a joint EU-UK committee would discuss its implication for backstop within six weeks. Please upgrade your browser The committee either agrees to add the new rule to the backstop or if agreement isn't reached will ""examine all further possibilities to maintain the good functioning"" the backstop. If there is deadlock - no agreement ""within a reasonable time"" - the EU is entitled to ""take appropriate remedial measures"". The UK is now proposing that its position would be heavily influenced by the assembly. A vote on the draft withdrawal agreement is scheduled to take place in the House of Commons on Tuesday, after the original vote was cancelled on 11 December. Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs and it is highly unlikely the withdrawal agreement will be approved by Parliament if they vote against it. The DUP has repeatedly said it is opposed to the backstop and the withdrawal agreement is worse than a no-deal Brexit. Mrs May has been seeking extra written assurances from European leaders to try and gain the support of the DUP and many Conservative MPs who oppose her deal.

Refunds after 'spectacularly bad' panto,"The venue provided promotional images of the production which featured actors that did not appear in the Chippenham panto A venue that put on a ""spectacularly bad"" pantomime has offered a refund to all customers who paid to see it. Jack and the Beanstalk at Chippenham's Neeld Community and Arts Centre was billed as boasting a ""sparkling set and glittering costumes"". But one disgruntled punter said: ""There were only three people, no scenery, they couldn't sing or dance."" The town council, which runs the venue, said it ""was not the standard of show the Neeld is used to presenting"". The company behind the show, OOOH ARRR Productions, said there had been a ""booking error"" and it had received a ""handful of complaints"" but had agreed a full refund with the venue. The show ran from 27-29 December, and was sold out, with standard tickets priced at Â£7.00. Posting on the 158-seat venue's Facebook page, ticket-buyer Natalie Uff described the panto as ""awful"". ""At one point they were talking to voices in the wings as they ran out of people,"" she said. Another panto fan, Tereza Cleverley, said: ""It was spectacularly bad. It felt as if two of the cast members had been pulled in at the last minute and it was their first live show."" And John Snell said he was ""mortified"" by the standard of the production. The Chippenham show was promoted using photos taken from a previous production with a different cast. The panto was advertised using promotional photos from a previous show which featured actors that did not appear in the Chippenham production In a statement,external, the town council said ""we pride ourselves in providing high quality shows for Chippenham"" but the ""images provided by the company for promotional purposes did not reflect the show they brought to us"". ""We had been assured by the theatre production company there would be a cast of six professional actors with industry standard staging,"" it added. In a statement,externalon its Facebook page, OOOH ARRR Productions said the ""disappointment and confusion"" was the result of a ""booking error"" which saw the original ""six person production"" replaced. ""There were conversations with the venue that involved replacing it with the three person cast due to it potentially not selling well,"" the spokesperson said. ""The other members of our staff were only made aware of this issue following the first performance."" The company apologised for the ""disappointment experienced as a result of this booking error"" and added the person ""responsible for this error"" had left the company.

Corbyn calls for election over Brexit,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for a general election: âThis political chaos cannot go on."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has stepped up calls for a general election ""at the earliest opportunity"" to ""break the deadlock"" over Brexit.

If a majority of MPs back a no confidence motion, the government will get 14 days to try and win another confidence vote - if it can't do that, a general election will be held. Mr Corbyn said: ""Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own. So members across the House should vote with us to break the deadlock."" Theresa May has met Leave-supporting Labour MPs Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which is also against Mrs May's deal, has said it will back her in any confidence vote. As debate on the Brexit deal resumed in the House of Commons for the second of five days, it emerged that some of Mr Corbyn's Leave-supporting backbench MPs have been speaking to Theresa May about backing her deal if she can guarantee environmental standards and rights for workers. But Mr Corbyn said Labour did not ""endorse or accept"" a reported offer from the government to adopt an amendment to protect workplace and environmental rights. ""It's already been quite clearly and emphatically rejected by the TUC and leading trade unions. They say it simply doesn't guarantee the protections that we are seeking."" Theresa May has, meanwhile, reached out to union leaders to seek their backing for her deal, it has emerged. The prime minister made telephone calls to Len McCluskey, general secretary of Labour's biggest financial backer Unite, and GMB leader Tim Roache. Mr Roache said: ""As you would expect, I was very clear about GMB's position - the deal on the table isn't good enough and non-binding assurances on workers' rights won't cut it."" Labour MPs on the anti-Brexit side of the party are calling on Mr Corbyn to get behind the campaign for a new EU referendum - something polls suggest is supported by the majority of Labour members. Mr Corbyn has said his preferred option is to trigger a general election and, having won it, seek to delay Brexit in order to negotiate a better deal with Brussels, which he says would see the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU and with a close relationship with the single market. This policy, together with a ""radical"" Labour government would kick start economic growth, and ""allow a renaissance in our manufacturing sector, which will create good, secure jobs and help restore pride and prosperity to parts of our country that have been ignored for too long"", he argued. If Labour is not able to get a general election, Mr Corbyn said all options were ""on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote"". Asked if a fresh referendum would be in Labour's election manifesto, he said: ""Our policy would be to negotiate urgently with the EU as and when we take office, but clearly a general election must come first in order to do that. If you feel like you ought to know more about Brexit... Our chatbot answers the top five questions,external A really simple guide What we know about how voters want it sorted out ""Policy-making is made by the Labour Party in a democratic form and that policy will be put together and put into a manifesto in any election that's coming up."" He said he understood the concerns of younger voters, who polls suggest overwhelmingly backed another referendum on staying in the EU, but he also understood those who had voted to leave the EU and he wanted to bring the country together. In a speech to Labour activists at an electrical products manufacturer in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, Mr Corbyn said Theresa May would forfeit the right to govern if she cannot get her Brexit deal through the Commons. ""A government that cannot get its business through the Commons is no government at all. It has lost its mandate so must go to the country to seek another."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Mr Corbyn vowed to heal the divide between Leave and Remain voters, saying the ""real divide"" in the UK was between the ""many"" who ""do the work, create the wealth and pay taxes"" and the ""few"" who ""set the rules, reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes"". He said: ""The real solution is to transform Britain to work in the interests of the vast majority, by challenging the entrenched power of a privileged elite. ""That is how we can help to heal the referendum's deep divisions."" The government has lost two Brexit votes in two days. The first defeatlimits the government's financial powersin the event of a no-deal departure. The second forces the PM to announcenew plans within three daysif her deal fails in the Commons. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis, said: ""Labour simply do not have a plan for Brexit. Instead they are arguing in public about whether to frustrate the decision of the British people and rerun the referendum."" The cross-party People's Vote campaign for another referendum, which is backed by about 30 Labour MPs, also criticised Mr Corbyn's speech. Campaign supporter and Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said: ""Many Labour MPs, not to mention the party's voters and members, will be horrified by the prospect that their party leader is still proposing to fight the next election as a supporter of Brexit."" Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards, another People's Vote supporter, said: ""An election in which both Labour and Conservative Brexit policies are almost indistinguishable will solve nothing.""

Corbyn: This chaos cannot go on,"Mrs May said the deal was in the national interest at a press conference on Thursday Theresa May has spoken to the leaders of two of the biggest unions in the UK as she continues to try to build support for her Brexit deal. The PM spoke to Unite's Len McCluskey and the GMB's Tim Roache by phone on Thursday in what her spokesman described as ""constructive"" calls. He said Mrs May was undertaking ""widespread engagement"" about the deal. Mr Roache said he was glad the PM had ""finally picked up the phone"" but that her deal was not ""good enough"". ""If the deal genuinely did the job for GMB members, our union would support it, but it doesn't,"" he said. ""It's clear more time is required, we need to extend Article 50 and ultimately give the final say on Brexit to the public."" Laura Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics? Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn calls for election over Brexit World against no-deal Brexit - Japan PM Mrs May also spoke to John Allan, president of the CBI business lobby group, as MPs continue to debate the EU withdrawal agreement her government has negotiated with the EU, ahead of next Tuesday's vote. She has also met some Labour MPs as she continues efforts to build support for the deal, which more than 100 of her own MPs have said they will oppose. Asked if she was still ruling out Labour's policy of a permanent customs union with the EU, after talking to the party's MPs and union leaders, she her deal would deliver an ""ambitious"" trading arrangements with the EU and allow the UK to strike trade deals around the world. At a press conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, she said her deal was in the national interest ""because it's a good deal and therefore I hope that it will get wide support across the whole of Parliament"". Speaking alongside Mrs May in Downing Street, Mr Abe said  his country was in ""total support"" of Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement and wanted to ""invest more into your country and to enjoy further economic growth with the UK"". ""That is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the whole wish of the whole world,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

It has emerged that the government is considering backing an amendment from Labour Leave supporter John Mann, giving extra protections to workers and the environment, in a bid to win support. A number of Labour MPs in Leave-supporting constituencies back Mr Mann's amendment, which the MP said would open up the opportunity for other improvements to the prime minister's deal. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for an election over Brexit A spokesman for the prime minister said it was something they would ""consider very seriously"", adding that the government had ""a long standing commitment to strong labour protections"". Mr Mann told BBC News his amendment would make it more likely for him to back the deal, but admitted it didn't mean other Labour MPs would be ""rushing"" to do the same. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party did not ""accept or endorse"" what was on offer in the proposed amendment. He said it has already been ""quite clearly and emphatically rejected"" by leading trade unions. By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason The prime minister is hitting the phones - and the people on the other end are not regular recipients of telephonic greetings from Downing Street. So what's happening? Theresa May is reaching out. Her proposed Brexit deal needs friends, and if that means phoning people who wouldn't count as such politically, then so be it. The response from the trades unions has been less than gushing.  One source told me they amounted to ""eleventh hour, ten minute calls."" But, at the very least, it means Mrs May can say she is listening. Even if those on the other end of the line don't like what they are hearing. Greener UK - a group of 14 environmental organisations working on Brexit, including the RSPB and the Woodland Trust - said the aim of Mr Mann's amendment was ""commendable"", but it was not enough ""to prevent a weakening of environmental protections or standards"". Meanwhile, during the second of five days of debate on the deal, Conservative MP George Freeman has told MPs he will now vote for it, having previously said he could not support it. He said it ""wasn't perfect"" and he hoped there would be more concessions. Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Brexit and the timetable for a 'Plan B' But he added: ""I will, with a heavy heart on Tuesday, vote for this deal because we are now in the dying stages and no-deal is unconscionable. But I beg colleagues to ask their front benches to work together across the house in pursuit of something we can all be proud of."" The government has lost two Brexit votes in two days. The first defeatlimits the government's financial powersin the event of a no-deal departure. The second forces the PM to announcenew plans within three daysif her deal fails in the Commons. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP which has helped the government win votes since June 2017, haswarned the PM her deal is ""already dead"". In a sign that the party has not been swayed by the government's promise togive the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto,externalover any new EU regulations introduced under the terms of the proposed backstop arrangement, she accused Mrs May of ""wasting time"". Senior Conservatives have continued to express opposition to the withdrawal agreement and declaration on future relations, negotiated by Mrs May in November. The Labour Party will oppose Mrs May's deal next week, and push for a vote of no confidence if it is rejected by MPs, as Mr Corbyn believes that a general election is the most democratic way of breaking the Brexit deadlock. The DUP says it will support the government in any confidence vote if the Brexit deal is rejected, making a defeat less likely. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal.

Is it time for a Minister for Hunger?,"The MPs are concerned about the impact of hunger on children A group of MPs want the government to introduce a Minister for Hunger to respond to a growth in food insecurity in the UK - especially among children. The Environmental Audit Committee highlighted 2017 Unicef figures showing 19% of children under 15 in the UK live with adults who struggle to buy food. It says ministers have failed to recognise and respond to the problem. The government says the number of children living in workless households is at a record low. But MPs say the number of people without reliable access to affordable, nutritious food is ""significant and growing"", with the unemployed, sick or those with children most likely to be affected. The committee wants to see the appointment of a new minister with ""responsibility and accountability for combating hunger and food insecurity within the UK"". The job would involve exploring the scale, causes and impact of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and implementing strategies to improve the situation. Jo Millner works at a food bank but also struggles to feed her own family ""It's all very well having a Minister for Hunger but they need someone who is normal,"" says Jo Millner, who lives in York with her husband and 6-year-old-son. She volunteers at a food bank and community hub, and her husband works full-time in two jobs, but they still struggle to feed their family. ""[The government] don't have a clue what's happening on the ground. They don't see people crying their eyes out because they can't afford to buy a bag of pasta,"" she says. After paying their mortgage, Jo, 43, says there's often no money left for food and the family relies on food banks and support from her mother to survive. ""We pretty much live on pasta and rice,"" she says. ""We can't afford much fresh fruit and veg apart from what we get at the food bank. What we do get goes to our son because he needs to grow up healthy."" She says most of the people her food bank helps are working - but many are on insecure contracts or only working a few hours a week. ""The government wants people in work but then you are penalised for being in work and lose your benefits,"" she says. ""I'm working with a woman at the moment who has just gone from a 22-hour contract to a 30-hour contract and she's actually worse off because now she doesn't get school meals paid for."" ""We need to get all the different ministers to work together to tackle poverty,"" she adds. ""The whole system is broken."" The committee's report also suggests a close relationship between hunger and obesity. ""Insufficient access to food may lead to risk-averse purchasing habits and prioritisation of low-priced, filling foods with long shelf lives - which are often nutrient poor but calorie-rich,"" the report says. A spokeswoman for the Department of Work and Pensions said that, since 2010, one million people had been lifted out of absolute poverty - including 300,000 children. ""Household incomes have never been higher and the number of children living in workless households is at a record low, but we know there's more to do ensure that every family has access to nutritious, healthy food,"" she said. ""We already provide support through free school meals and ourHealthy Start Vouchers."",external Poor pupils 'filling pockets with food' Holiday hunger cash a 'great first step' Fighting holiday hunger in Birkenhead But Labour MP Mary Creagh, who is chairwoman of the committee, said more children were growing up in homes where parents do not have enough money to put food on the table. ""The combination of high living costs, stagnating wages and often, the roll-out of Universal Credit and the wider benefits system, means that levels of hunger in Britain are some of the highest across Europe. ""We found that nearly one in five children under 15 are living in a food insecure home - a scandal which cannot be allowed to continue."" Ms Creagh said urgent action was needed. ""This can only be addressed by setting clear UK-wide targets and by appointing a Minister for Hunger to deliver them."" Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which runs more than 420 food banks across the UK, welcomed the idea of a hunger minister. ""It's time for the government to take concrete steps towards a UK where everyone has enough money for food,"" she said. ""Although food bank volunteers are providing vital support to those in crisis, no charity can replace people having enough money for the basics. ""To end hunger, we need to understand the true scale of the challenge, and work across government to ensure everyone is anchored from being swept into poverty.""

Lady Gaga breaks her silence on R Kelly,"R Kelly and Lady Gaga performed together at the 2013 American Music Awards Lady Gaga has apologised for working with embattled R&B star R Kelly, and vowed to remove their duet, Do What U Want, from streaming services. It comes after the broadcast of a new documentary about Kelly, which detailed allegations of sexual and physical abuse against women and underage girls, spanning several decades. Gaga called the stories ""horrifying"" and ""indefensible"", adding: ""I stand behind these women 1000%"". Kelly has denied all the allegations. His lawyer also dismissed the documentary as ""another round of stories"" being used to ""fill reality TV time"". But film-maker Dream Hampton said the film depicted how Kelly had ""built an ecosystem around his predation,external"", after almost three decades of ""preying on young and vulnerable women"". Lady Gaga is a longtime advocate for victims of sexual abuse and, in 2014, revealed she had been sexually assaulted at the age of 19 Gaga had been under pressure to comment on the allegations against Kelly ever since she collaborated with him on 2013's Do What U Want (With My Body). The song was controversial from the outset. Stories about Kelly's personal life had already been widely reported and, in 2008, he stood trial on charges of making a sex tape with an under-age female. He was found not guilty. At apress conference in Japan in 2013,external, Gaga defended the collaboration, saying: ""R Kelly and I have sometimes had very untrue things written about us, so in a way this was a bond between us."" But calls for her to condemn Kelly resurfaced last week, after it emerged she had allegedly declined to be interviewed for the Lifetime documentary. The history of allegations against R Kelly Jay-Z and Gaga 'turned down' R Kelly doc R Kelly denies sex allegations in song The star, who is a vocal advocate for victims of sexual abuse, broke her silence on 10 January byposting a long statement on social media.,external ""I stand behind these women 1000%, believe them, know they are suffering and in pain, and feel strongly that their voices should be heard and taken seriously,"" she wrote. ""As a victim of sexual assault myself, I made both the song and the video at a dark time in my life. ""My intention was to create something extremely defiant and provocative because I was angry and still hadn't processed the trauma that had occurred in my own life. The song is called Do What U Want (With My Body), I think it's clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time. ""If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self I'd tell her to go through the therapy I have since then, so that I could understand the confused post-traumatic state that I was in - or if therapy was not available to me or anyone in my situation - to seek help, and speak as openly and honestly as possible about what we've been through."" She concluded: ""I'm sorry, both my for my poor judgement when I was young, and for not speaking out sooner"". Chance The Rapper and John Legend have also condemned R Kelly Gaga is not the only celebrity to distance herself from Kelly. Chance The Rapper issued a statement on Sunday, apologising for collaborating with the singer on the 2015 track Somewhere in Paradise. ""Any of us who ever ignored the R Kelly stories, or ever believed he was being set up/attacked by the system (as black men often are) were doing so at the detriment of black women and girls,""he wrote,external. ""I apologise to all of his survivors for working with him and for taking this long to speak out."" Rappers Meek Mill and 6lack and actresses Jada Pinkett Smith and Kerry Washington also criticised the star while John Legend, one of the few celebrities to appear in the film, said the decision to take part had been an easy one. ""It didn't feel risky at all,"" tweeted Legend. ""I believe these women."" The series is due to be broadcast in the UK onCrime And Investigation UK,external, from Tuesday, 5 February. Meanwhile, the documentary has prompted fresh investigations into R Kelly in Chicago and Atlanta. At a press conference on Tuesday, Chicago state attorney Kimberly Foxx urged anyone with information to come forward. ""There's nothing that can be done to investigate these allegations without the cooperation of both victims and witnesses. We cannot seek justice without you."" Foxx called Surviving R Kelly ""deeply, deeply disturbing,"" adding that after the series aired, she had received calls from two families concerned about their interactions with Kelly. Meanwhile, a lawyer representing the parents of Joycelyn Savage, who appeared in the documentary, said investigators in Atlanta had contacted them on Monday. Kelly has vigorously denied any claims against him, even releasing a song where he sings: ""I'm so falsely accused"". The 52-year-old appeared to shrug off the mounting pressure on him on Wednesday, with an unscheduled performance at Chicago's V75 nightclub. While there, Kelly was surrounded by fans singing along to his music. At one point he announced: ""It's my [expletive] birthday and I don't give an [expletive] what's going on."" Meanwhile, Gaga fans have started a campaign to get her to replace the R Kelly version of Do What U Want with a remix that substitutes him for Christina Aguilera. Allow Twitter content?

Outcry after DR Congo winner revealed,"Mr Tshisekedi is the son of the late veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi Opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi has won DR Congo's presidential election, electoral officials say. The announcement, made overnight, sparked accusations of an ""electoral coup"" from runner-up Martin Fayulu. The Catholic Church said that the result did not match data collected by its election monitors. The ruling party, whose candidate finished third, has not yet contested the result, prompting allegations of a power-sharing deal with Mr Tshisekedi. It is an accusation Mr Tshisekedi's team denies. If confirmed, Mr Tshisekedi will be the first opposition challenger to win since the DR Congo gained independence in 1960. Current President Joseph Kabila is stepping down after 18 years in office. Africa Live: Follow the latest updates The divisive aftermath of Tshisekedi's victory Church observers question DR Congo results Tshisekedi steps out of his father's shadow The capital Kinshasa and other key cities appeared calm on Thursday, but fears remain that the announcement of the result could trigger unrest. UN chief Antonio Guterres appealed for all parties to refrain from violence. In the early hours of Thursday the head of DR Congo's National Electoral Commission (Ceni), Corneille Nangaa, said Mr Tshisekedi had received 38.5% of the vote in the 30 December election and had been ""provisionally declared the elected president"". The full results were, with turnout reportedly 48%: Felix Tshisekedi - 7 million votes Martin Fayulu - 6.4 million votes Emmanuel Shadary - 4.4 million votes The result can still be challenged. Mr Tshisekedi vowed to be ""the president of all DR Congolese"", saying: ""No-one could have imagined such a scenario whereby an opposition candidate would emerge victorious."" He struck a conciliatory tone with Mr Kabila when addressing supporters at his Union for Democracy and Social Progress party headquarters in Kinshasa. ""I pay tribute to President Joseph Kabila and today we should no longer see him as an adversary, but rather, a partner in democratic change in our country,"" he said. A spokesman for Mr Shadary, who had been Mr Kabila's hand-picked candidate and was expected to win, accepted the defeat, saying ""the Congolese people have chosen and democracy has triumphed"". Martin Fayulu said the results had ""nothing to do with the truth"" Mr Fayulu's supporters say this backs their suspicion Mr Tshisekedi has cut a power-sharing deal with Mr Kabila. Mr Tshisekedi's spokesman, Louis d'Or Ngalamulume, said there was ""never any deal"". The BBC's Africa editor, Fergal Keane, says Mr Tshisekedi is seen by many as the opposition candidate least objectionable to President Kabila and that it is perhaps significant that neither Mr Kabila nor his party have so far voiced any objection to the result. Mr Fayulu, a former oil tycoon, said the results had ""nothing to do with the truth"". ""The Congolese people will never accept such a fraud,"" he told the BBC, adding: ""Felix Tshisekedi never got 7 million votes. Where did he get them from?"" He said the electoral commission and ruling party had made up the figures to give Mr Tshisekedi -  their ""protÃ©gÃ©"" - victory. The influential Catholic Church, which posted 40,000 observers to monitor the election, issued a statement on Thursday saying the result given by the electoral commission did not correspond with its own findings. The statement mentions no-one by name and urges all parties to observe their civic duty and refrain from violence. Our correspondent, Fergal Keane, says the Church may now be publicly doubting the results but it will be very wary of any public demonstrations. Earlier, French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian told CNews: ""We must have clarity on these results, which are the opposite to what we expected."" Former colonial power Belgium has also expressed doubts about the result. Analysis by Fergal Keane, BBC News, in Kinshasa Given the deeply polarised nature of politics here, any result was going to leave a divisive aftermath. Whether Mr Tshisekedi has the intention or the capacity to challenge the powerful hold Mr Kabila enjoys over the army, security services and key ministries will determine whether politics has really entered a new era.  He has already spoken of working with Mr Kabila to ensure the success of democracy. For Mr Fayulu there are difficulties, too. How does he decide to react? The most likely route for the moment is to try to challenge the result within the 10-day period parties are allowed under the law. Given the closeness of the vote, his supporters will point to claims of irregularities in several areas. Significantly the Church and civil society have called on citizens to avoid becoming involved in violence - a recognition of the dangers involved in street protests while facing security forces with a reputation for heavy-handedness.

Meghan made patron of National Theatre,"Meghan has also become patron of a women's charity The Duchess of Sussex has been made the patron of the National Theatre as well as three other organisations. Meghan's first sole royal patronages will also champion education, women's employment and animal welfare. The duchess, who is a former actress, has taken on honorary roles with Mayhew, Smart Works, and the Association of Commonwealth Universities, Kensington Palace said. A royal patronage can help promote the profile of good causes. Why do charities want a royal patron? The duchess has already met women who have benefited from Smart Works, a charity which helps long-term unemployed and vulnerable women get back into work. Meghan visited the Smart Works charity just after her patronage was announced Mayhew is an animal welfare charity set up in 1886 which helps cats and dogs through community initiatives and veterinary care. It also works with homelessness charities in London to make sure people and their dogs can be kept together The National Theatre (NT) aims to make world-class theatre for everyone. The NT's learning and participation programmes support young people's creativity across the UK Smart Works provides high-quality clothes and one-to-one interview preparation to unemployed women. They can be referred from jobcentres, prisons, care homes, homeless shelters, work programmes, and mental health charities The Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) describes itself as the world's first and oldest international university network. It supports the development of higher education across the Commonwealth Buckingham Palace said,externalthat ""patronages generally reflect the interests of the member of the Royal Family involved"". The duchess helped pick out jewellery for women at Smart Works Meghan Markle made her name as an actress, campaigner and blogger before marrying Prince Harry in May 2018. She is best known for playing lawyer Rachel Zane in US TV drama Suits. She started campaigning for gender equality at an early age, writing to the then US first lady, Hillary Clinton, at the age of 11, lamenting a washing-up liquid's TV ad strapline: ""Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans."" Within a month, manufacturers Procter and Gamble had changed the word ""women"" to ""people"". Kensington Palace said in a statement: ""The duchess is delighted to become patron of both national and grassroots organisations that are part of the fabric of the UK, and is very much looking forward to working with them to bring wider public attention to their causes."" The Queen passed on two patronages - the National Theatre and the ACU - to the duchess. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lord Ashdown died aged 77 in December after a short illness. He was diagnosed with bladder cancer in October. The former Yeovil MP's funeral, held in his home village of Norton-sub-Hamdon, was attended by family, friends and former prime minister Sir John Major. Hundreds of people watched the service on TV screens in the village hall. Paddy Ashdown led the Liberal Democrats between 1988 and 1999 before standing down from Parliament in 2001 to become the United Nations' high representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The funeral was attended by close friends and family Christened Jeremy, he was given the nickname Paddy when he went to school in England after spending his childhood years in Northern Ireland. ""Locally, you wouldn't get away with any other name,"" the Rev Peter Thomas told about 40 mourners at St Mary's Church. ""God also knew him as Paddy, not Jeremy, and probably didn't call him Lord,"" he joked. Obituary: Paddy Ashdown Ex-Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown dies aged 77 Lord Ashdown was 'simply Paddy' One of the speakers at the service, Myles Wickstead, said Lord Ashdown ""espoused the values of openness and tolerance, and he found them in this village which he loved"". ""He was never happier than when at the Lord Nelson on a Friday night, indulging in a mixture of arguments, fun, gossip, banter and, of course, drink. ""Our community and our country now are poorer that Paddy has gone,"" he added. After his death, politicians from all parties paid tribute to him, with Prime Minister Theresa May saying he ""served his country with passion and distinction"".

Jackson estate attacks 'lurid' documentary,"Jackson died in 2009 at the age of 50 Michael Jackson's estate has criticised a documentary alleging the late pop star sexually abused children. Leaving Neverland will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this month and includes interviews with two alleged victims of Jackson. Representatives for Jackson's estate have responded in a statement. ""This is yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson,"" it said. Fans gathered at Jackson's former Neverland home after his death Two men who appear in the film say they were aged seven and 10 when Jackson befriended them and their families. Now in their 30s, they allege they were sexually abused by the late singer. Police raided Jackson's Neverland Ranch in California - referenced in the film's title - in 2003 while investigating allegations Jackson had molested a 13-year-old boy. The case went to trial and Jackson wasacquitted of all charges in 2005,external. The synopsis for the documentary reads: ""Through gut-wrenching interviews with the now-adult men and their families, Leaving Neverland crafts a portrait of sustained exploitation and deception, documenting the power of celebrity that allowed a revered figure to infiltrate the lives of starstruck children and their parents."" The two-part film is directed by Dan Reed, who is also behind documentaries including The Valley, Terror in Mumbai and The Paedophile Hunter. It will debut atSundance,externalin Utah on 25 and 26 January and will be shown on Channel 4 in Spring 2019. The film is a co-production between Channel 4, HBO and Reed, and will be shown in two two-hour broadcasts on consecutive nights in the UK. Channel 4 told the BBC the film had ""been in the pipeline for a few years"". Jackson died on 25 June 2009 aged 50 after receiving a lethal dose of the anaesthetic propofol.

Girl given life sentence over party murder,"Conner Cowper was attacked in a flat in Holytown, North Lanarkshire A 17-year-old girl who murdered a teenage boy at a party has been detained for life. The teenager was pregnant when she stabbed 18-year-old Conner Cowper in the neck in a flat in Holytown, North Lanarkshire, last April. The girl, who was high on cocaine and alcohol at the time, has since given birth while on remand. At the High Court in Edinburgh,judge Lord Arthurson ordered the girl to serve at least 16 years,externalin custody. He told her: ""Your attack upon him was deliberate, brutal, unprovoked and entirely murderous, and this murder was committed by you at the age of 17 when you were still a child, while you were under the influence of cocaine and alcohol."" The trial heard claims that Conner had ""fancied"" the girl but she kissed another young man that night. The Crown claimed she ""loved being the centre of attention"" and was trying to play the two men off against each other. The street in Holytown was sealed off by police But the girl, who is thought to be one of Scotland's youngest female murderers, exploded when Conner branded her a ""stupid wee girl"". The teenager, who was expelled from school aged 11, grabbed a knife and stabbed him before fleeing the scene. The jury heard the catastrophic puncture wound was 4in (11cm) deep. She wasconvicted at Glasgow High Courtlast month but sentence had been deferred to obtain reports about her character. Lord Arthurson had been told by defence advocate Tony Graham QC the girl had acknowledged that her actions had caused ""devastation"" and deprived Conner's family of their loved one. But the judge said he had doubts about whether this was correct. Conner Cowper died after being stabbed in the neck with a knife He added: ""I have been told that not only do you feel regret but you also expressed empathy towards the victim. ""However, as the presiding judge at your trial I saw nothing of that. Your demeanour was flat and disinterested and you didn't give out any significant appearance of empathy. ""You are a highly dangerous and unstable individual. The attack on Conner was deliberate, brutal, entirely unprovoked and entirely murderous."" Lord Arthurson told her the penalty for her crime was fixed by law. He added: ""It was a deliberate, brutal and entirely murderous attack."" During the trial last year the girl denied murder and claimed she stabbed Conner because she feared he was going to hit her. She also claimed to have been affected by a previous abusive relationship at the time of the fatal assault. The court heard how the girl had only known Conner through Facebook before the party and told jurors he was a ""nice person"". But the court heard how she left him to die while fellow party goers tried to save his life. Officers found her nearby ""laughing"". The trial heard how she later asked an officer: ""Can I have my knife back? It is good for cutting onions.""

Exploding rebel drone kills Yemen soldiers,"This video can not be played Drone explodes above a podium where officials were watching a military parade at al-Anad base in Yemen. A drone attack on a Yemeni government base by the rebel Houthi movement has reportedly killed six soldiers. The drone exploded above a podium at al-Anad base, in the southern province of Lahj, where high-ranking officers and officials were watching a parade. Medics said army deputy chief of staff Gen Saleh al-Zindani and Lahj governor Ahmed al-Turki were among those hurt. A Houthi-run TV channel said the rebels had targeted personnel from the Saudi-led coalition backing the government. The attack threatens to derail UN peace efforts, which last month saw both sides agree to a ceasefire around the lifeline Red Sea port of Hudaydah, which is crucial to the delivery of aid supplies. Soldiers scrambled to carry wounded comrades to military vehicles A Houthi military source told Al-Masirah TV that Thursday's attack targeted ""invaders"",external- an apparent reference to coalition personnel - and ""mercenaries"" at al-Anad, which which is about 60km (40 miles) north of the second city of Aden. It was carried out after ""careful monitoring of gatherings and movements"" at the base, he added. What will the new year hold for Yemen? Why is there a war in Yemen? Video footage of the incident showed the drone approaching the parade ground rapidly and at low altitude before exploding above the covered VIP podium. ""It was a very strong explosion and we could feel the pressure,""local journalist Nabil al-Qaiti, who was at the parade, told the Associated Press,external. ""The drone was packed with explosives,"" he added. Medics at the Ibn Khaldoun hospital in the nearby city of Houta told AFP news agency that six soldiers were killed and 12 people were injured in the attack. They said the wounded include Gen Zindani, Mr Turki, intelligence chief Brig-Gen Mohammed Saleh Tamah, and senior army commander Fadel Hasan. Chief of staff Gen Abdullah al-Nakhi was also at the base when the drone struck, but there are conflicting reports about whether he was hurt. It was not immediately clear if any coalition military officials were present. Medics said the army's deputy chief of staff and the governor of Lahj province were wounded Later, Houthi military spokesman Gen Yehia Sari announced that a new kind of drone had been used. The Qasef-2K, he added, was designed to blow up about 20m (65ft) off the ground, sending shrapnel towards a target. Saudi-owned TV channels described the drone as ""Iranian made"". Iran has denied supplying weapons to the rebels. But a UN panel of experts said last year thatthe Houthis' Qasef-1 drone was ""virtually identical in design, dimensions, and capability"" to Iran's Ababil-T drone,external. Yemeni Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani tweeted that ""the crime of targeting the base will not go unanswered"". The attack, he added, showed the Houthis did ""not believe in the language of peace"" and ""only understand the language of weapons"". Saudi-owned TV channels described the drone as Iranian made, without offering evidence The attack comes a day after the UN special envoy to Yemen said the warring parties had largely stuck to the ceasefire around Hudaydah. However, Martin Griffiths told the UN Security Council that ""substantial progress"" was needed before further talks could be held on ending the war. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. At least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the fighting, according to the UN. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. Yemen rebels 'stealing food from hungry' What will the new year hold for Yemen?

John Lewis staff bonus in doubt,"This video can not be played Sir Charlie Mayfield John Lewis says sales in the seven-week Christmas period were 1.4% higher than for the same period last year. However, that may not be enough to secure a bonus for its 83,000 staff this year, the firm said. John Lewis' structure is unique. It is owned by its staff, known as partners. It says it will think carefully about whether to give staff their traditional share in March. If it decides not to, it would mark the first time since 1953 the partners had gone without. Typically in profitable years, staff at the 350 Waitrose and 51 John Lewis stores receive a share of these. In the very best years, these bonuses can add the equivalent of a few months' worth of pay. Christmas retail winners and losers Both Waitrose and John Lewis saw sales rise. Gross like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of store opening and closures, at its Waitrose supermarkets, were Â£1.05bn, up 0.3% on last year. The John Lewis department stores themselves saw sales of Â£1.1bn, up 1% on last year. Waitrose's online sales over the Christmas period were particularly strong, increasing by 12.8%. John Lewis sales were boosted by last-minute Christmas Eve purchases Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, outlined the challenges facing shopkeepers: ""Two main factors are affecting the retail sector - oversupply of physical space and relatively weak consumer demand. ""Despite this, we had a positive Christmas trading period, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of partners in our business."" He said full-year profits would be ""substantially"" lower this year. Sir Charlie told the BBC: ""Every year the board looks at what we can afford to pay in bonus in March. What we've said is because of the steps we've taken we've got a strong financial position and we can afford to pay a bonus. The question is whether it's prudent to do so and of course that's a judgement about what's coming and the uncertainty in the market and this year of course there's quite a lot of that. So we just have to look at that sensibly. ""In our business, it's owned by the people who work in it, we live within our means and we have to take account of what's coming up even if it's uncertain and we can't quite judge it perfectly."" The partnership also said that Black Friday, which has become one of the most important trading days of the year, contributed to the biggest sales week in its history. John Lewis said at the start of January that the week running up to Christmas itself saw sales rise by 11% on the previous Christmas. John Lewis reported very strong sales on Christmas Eve itself - which was included in the last week of trading - as customers bought last-minute gifts.

Christmas sales slide at Debenhams and M&S,"Debenhams has reported a sharp fall in sales during the crucial Christmas trading period. Debenhams said customers had been seeking discounts and left their shopping late. It said sales fell 5.7% in the 18 weeks to 5 January. Marks and Spencer also reported a fall in sales over Christmas, down 2.2%. Tesco said sales were up, as did John Lewis.But John Lewis warnedthat staff might not receive bonuses for the first time since 1953. Much of the focus is on Debenhams, which is closing 50 stores. The department store chain, which employs around 25,000, said it had been cutting prices over the Christmas period and that might eat into profits in the first-half of the year. Christmas retail winners and losers Sergio Bucher, chief executive of Debenhams, said there had been fewer customers coming into his company's stores. He confirmed that Debenhams is in talks with its lenders about its Â£520m credit line. Those talks were ""constructive"", he said. The British Retail Consortium hassaid retail sales were flat in December, as UK businesses experienced their worst Christmas in a decade. A number of other retailers have released trading statements: Marks & Spencer saw its sales dropover the Christmas holiday period. Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, were down 2.2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. Food sales fell 2.1% and its clothing and home sales division slid 2.4%. Tesco appeared to buck the gloomy trend. It said trading over the Christmas period had been ""strong"". The company, which is the UK's biggest supermarket chain, said its like-for-like sales over Christmas in the core UK area were up 2.2% in the six weeks to 5 January. John Lewis said sales in the seven-weekChristmas period were 1.4% higher than for the same period last year. However, that may not be enough to secure a bonus for its staff this year, the firm added. Halfords issued a profits warning after sales fell 1.7% for the 14 weeks to 4 January. The cycling and car maintenance company blamed mild winter weather in November and December, plus weak consumer confidence. Sales at discount retailer B&M fell 1.6% in the 13 weeks to 29 December after a ""disappointing"" November. This video can not be played Shoppers in Nottingham reveal whether they spent more or less this Christmas Debenhams reported that like-for-like sales, which strip out changes to stores, over the 18 weeks to 5 January fell 5.7%. In the shorter trading period, the six weeks to 5 January, like-for-like sales  were down 3.4%. The founder of Sports Direct Mike Ashley has been taking an increased interest in the struggling retailer. Sports Direct already owns a near 30% stake in Debenhams and has offered a further Â£40m investment. Debenhams rebuffed his approach, but said all options remain open. In the meantime, Debenhams will postpone the possible sale of other parts of its business, including its successful operations in Denmark. But the company did not rule out a Company Voluntary Arrangement, under which it could close more stores, cut rent bills and reorganise its debts. By Dominic O'Connell, business presenter, Today Programme While we all get excited about the Christmas sales figures, they are not the whole story. All the companies reporting have spoken about a tough trading environment with widespread discounting, which means turning sales into profits will be difficult - and that those that did not join the race for sales too enthusiastically may be better off in the long-term. M&S may not have shot the lights out when it comes to sales growth, but it said it saw no reason to change its full-year profits forecast. John Lewis, however warned that profits this year would not be as good as last, and that it might not pay out its traditional annual bonus to its staff. The last time it did not pay out was in 1953. And Debenhams said it was in talks with its lenders, and was looking to bring ""new sources of funding"".  It did not say where that money would come from, but it has already shunned an offer of support from Mike Ashley. The Christmas trading period has simply reinforced what we already knew about the health of the High Street - that trading is tough, that those with decent online operations enjoy some degree of protection from that tough trading environment, and that the great High Street shakeout that has already claimed Maplins, Toys R Us and others may have only just begun. In October, when Debenhams published full-year results,it reported a record annual lossand said it would close up to 50 of its 165 branches. Some of its remaining stores are being refitted to boost trading. Nine stores so far have been revamped, with Stevenage the best performer among them, the firm said. This video can not be played Why shopping on the High Street needs to become an 'experience' Mr Bucher said the improvement in the redesigned stores demonstrated his attempt to turn around the business was making progress. ""We have worked hard to deliver the best possible outcome in very uncertain times for retailers. We responded to a significant increase in promotional activity in the market, particularly in key seasonal categories, in order to remain competitive for our customers,"" he said. Online sales rose 6% in the six-week Christmas trading period, after what Debenhams described as ""slow start to the season"". It said this meant there had been two-year online growth of over 20%.

"PM's plan 'dead', says Foster","Arlene Foster said she does not believe NI is heading towards a ""disastrous no-deal situation"" Theresa May is still not listening to critics of her Brexit deal and is putting a plan to Parliament that is already ""dead"", Arlene Foster has said. The DUP leader said proposals to give Stormont a say over new EU rules if the border backstop took effect after Brexit added nothing. Sinn FÃ©in president, Mary Lou McDonald, said ""there must be no veto afforded to any party by anybody"". At Westminster, MPs are debating the withdrawal agreement with the EU. The Irish border backstop is the insurance policy to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, if another solution is not found through a wider UK-EU trade deal. Ministers defeated over no-deal Brexit Is the EU about to rescue Theresa May? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told the BBC the government's plans amounted to giving the NI Assembly a ""veto"". However,his official written statement to Parliament,externaldoes not contain the word ""veto"". Mrs Foster said the DUP's opposition to the backstop remained firm. ""We would prefer if the backstop disappeared, what we've been presented with is a narrative and doesn't add anything,"" Mrs Foster told BBC Newsline. She accused the prime minister of continuing to ""waste time"" and said it was disappointing it had taken other parties at Westminster so long to start calling for an alternative to the government's withdrawal agreement. ""We told Theresa May to stop wasting time last November, she is still not listening and she is going to put a plan to Parliament that is dead,"" she said. This video can not be played Why doesnât Northern Ireland have a government? Mrs Foster said the DUP had put an alternative forward last year, to remove the backstop and work towards a different deal - but the prime minister is sticking by her plan. Sinn FÃ©in has urged the EU and Irish government not to ""blink"" when it comes to fully defending the backstop. The party's leadership, Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill, were speaking after meeting EU officials. Michelle O'Neill said the DUP ""will not be allowed to further put into jeopardy the rights of citizens here"" Mrs McDonald said she had been given a ""strong commitment"" from Brussels that the backstop in the withdrawal agreement would be protected. She added that as the Brexit negotiations approach the final stage, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar needed to ""hold firm and not panic"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Ms O'Neill's message to EU officials and the Irish government was: ""Don't blink, there can be no weakening of the backstop."" Leo Varadkar was asked about the new proposals during a visit to Ethiopia The Irish government has said it could not support the government's latest proposals for Northern Ireland. Mr Varadkar told reporters on a visit to Ethiopia: ""I don't think we can have a situation whereby the Northern Ireland executive or assembly has a veto power because that would essentially give one of the two communities veto power over the other."" The Irish government has repeatedly said it will not allow the withdrawal agreement to be renegotiated, but would seek to offer the UK government political reassurances. Mrs Foster said: ""No-one wants throw Ireland under the bus, but what we want to see is a deal that is good for the whole of the UK and protects the union."" The backstop is a position of last resort to maintain a soft border on the island of Ireland. It would involve Northern Ireland staying in large parts of the EU single market, unless and until a long-term deal emerged that kept the border as open as it is now. The proposals, published on Wednesday,,externalinclude: Before the backstop would come into effect, the assembly would have to be consulted, with its views brought before Parliament ahead of a vote at Westminster The assembly would approve any new single market regulations for Northern Ireland introduced by the EU - updates to existing rules would automatically apply No divergence in rules applied in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK Commitment to a role for the executive on the committees which would manage and oversee the backstop. BBC News NI's business editor John Campbell said the proposals appear to fall short of an outright veto as they do not specify that the assembly must give agreement before the UK government acts. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The EU-UK agreement, known as the withdrawal agreement and signed in November, laid out the procedure for any new EU rules being introduced after the backstop is triggered. The EU would inform the UK about the new rule and a joint EU-UK committee would discuss its implication for backstop within six weeks. Please upgrade your browser The committee either agrees to add the new rule to the backstop or if agreement isn't reached will ""examine all further possibilities to maintain the good functioning"" the backstop. If there is deadlock - no agreement ""within a reasonable time"" - the EU is entitled to ""take appropriate remedial measures"". The UK is now proposing that its position would be heavily influenced by the assembly. A vote on the draft withdrawal agreement is scheduled to take place in the House of Commons on Tuesday, after the original vote was cancelled on 11 December. Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs and it is highly unlikely the withdrawal agreement will be approved by Parliament if they vote against it. The DUP has repeatedly said it is opposed to the backstop and the withdrawal agreement is worse than a no-deal Brexit. Mrs May has been seeking extra written assurances from European leaders to try and gain the support of the DUP and many Conservative MPs who oppose her deal.

"Jaguar Land Rover to cut up to 5,000 jobs","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will today announce it is cutting up to 5,000 jobs from its 40,000 strong UK workforce. Management, marketing and administrative roles are expected to be hardest hit, but some production staff may also be affected. The layoffs are part of a Â£2.5bn cost-cutting plan amid what industry insiders have called a ""perfect storm"". They mean a downturn in Chinese sales, a slump in diesel sales and concerns about UK competitiveness post-Brexit. JLR is particularly exposed to the first two of these factors. JLR has seen its employee numbers soar as its revenues have expanded. China is the company's biggest and hitherto most profitable market. But sales in China have fallen nearly 50% in recent months as cautious Chinese consumers have been holding back on big ticket purchases amid global trade tensions. The relationship between JLR and its Chinese sales network have also been strained as dealers demand better terms and promotional incentives. What's gone wrong at Jaguar Land Rover? UK car sales see biggest fall since financial crisis China car sales fall for the first time in 20 years The issues at JLR have arisen as Ford is also looking to cut back on itsworkforce numbers in Europe. Are you a Jaguar Land Rover employee? Will you be affected by the job cuts? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. JLR is also one of the most heavily-exposed car makers to ongoing consumer confusion about the wisdom of buying a diesel car in the aftermath of the VW emissions scandal. Ninety per cent of its vehicles are diesel-powered, although it has been investing in new electric and hybrid vehicles. Today's job losses come on top of cuts made last year. In Solihull, 1,000 agency workers were laid off in 2017. At Halewood in Merseyside, 180 agency staff were cut. In Castle Bromwich, 1,000 employees were put on a three day week for the last three months of 2018. Meanwhile, Jaguar has been increasing headcount elsewhere in the world. In China it has hired 4,000 workers since 2014. Most recently it announced it would move all production of the Land Rover Discovery to a new plant in Slovakia with plans to hire up to 3,000 workers. Unions are keen to examine whether JLR's international plants will continue to see additional investment at the expense of the UK. They are also concerned that the company is not permanently reducing its UK production capacity in the face of what could prove to be short-term headwinds. The company has sounded some of the most urgent warnings among UK manufacturers about the damage that Brexit uncertainty was doing to investment in the UK. In July last year, the company said it needed more certainty around Brexit in order to continue investing in its UK operations and warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit would cost the company more than Â£1.2bn in profit each year. Most commentators have concluded that the chance of a no-deal Brexit have increased with the governor of the Bank of England recently describing the probability as ""uncomfortably high"". Of all JLR's problems, the biggest flashing red light is a collapse in sales in its biggest market - China. But the company has been saying for more than a year that Brexit uncertainty would eventually take its toll on the perception of the UK as a stable and competitive base for global manufacturing. If, as expected, the UK bears the brunt, or the entirety, of JLR's global cost-cutting, JLR may well say it tried to warn us.

'Bye-bye' - Trump exits shutdown talks,"This video can not be played US shutdown: ""My son wants to sell art to pay our bills"" President Donald Trump has walked out of a meeting with Democratic leaders as negotiations broke down on the 19th day of a partial US government shutdown. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer stuck by their refusal to fund his US-Mexico border wall, prompting Mr Trump to call the meeting ""a total waste of time"". Democrats again accused the president of throwing a ""temper tantrum"". The first payday since the shutdown began is due on Friday for 800,000 federal workers, who will go unpaid. Where do we go from here? Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Mr Trump has demanded $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) to build a steel barrier, which would deliver on a key campaign pledge. But Democrats - who control the House of Representatives - have refused to back the funding. It was certainly brief, at only 14 minutes. The president hosted the Democratic leaders in the Situation Room, the conference centre in the West Wing basement. Mr Trump posed a direct question to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about whether she would fund the wall. His tweet following the meeting reflected the outcome of that - he said ""bye-bye"" and left: This video can not be played Trump v Democrats on the border wall and government shutdown Mr Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, confirmed the exchange, saying: ""He [Mr Trump] asked Speaker Pelosi, 'Will you agree to my wall?' She said No. ""And he just got up and said, 'Then we have nothing to discuss,' and he just walked out. Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn't get his way."" Mr Schumer reportedly asked Mr Trump: ""You are using people as leverage; why won't you open the government and stop hurting people?"" A White House official told the New York Times Mr Trump had said: ""I am trying to do the right thing for the country. This isn't about politics."" Mr Schumer also said Mr Trump had ""slammed the table"" - prompting an angry response from the president denying it and insisting he had been polite. Allow Twitter content?

Kevin McCarthy, Republican leader in the House of Representatives, said he found the Democrats' behaviour ""embarrassing"". On Tuesday, Mr Trump delivered his first televised Oval Office address to the nation, where he described the border as a humanitarian and security crisis. The Democrats called the president's claims a fake threat. Mr Trump is going to the border on Thursday. He will visit a border patrol station in McAllen, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. He will get an update on security at what is the busiest section of the border for illegal crossings. Republican leaders and Mr Trump insist the party is ""totally unified"" behind him, and most of the party appear to back his uncompromising stance.

Mr Trump still has the option of declaring a national emergency on the issue, opening up defence department funding for the wall. But this would be hugely controversial and would prompt a lengthy legal battle. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US The Democrats are refusing to budge, believing the public mostly blame Mr Trump for the shutdown. A new opinion poll suggests just over half of Americans (51%) blame President Trump, although 77% of Republican voters back his demand for wall funding. Partial shutdowns occur when Congress cannot agree a budget by a certain deadline or the president refuses to sign it. Fourteen ways the US shutdown is hurting This shutdown, which began on 22 December, has affected 25% of the government and some 800,000 federal employees. About 350,000 of them are furloughed - a kind of temporary lay off - the rest are continuing to work without pay. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall The first pay day since the shutdown falls on Friday and will pass without workers getting salaries. After past shutdowns, workers have generally been refunded with back pay, although that does not apply to those working for third-party contractors. The refunds are also not automatic - Congress must approve the measure. Some affected federal workers who spoke to the BBC said they had resorted to a number of measures, including taking other jobs, racking up credit card bills, tapping into savings or taking on loans at high interest rates to pay their bills. Thousands have also applied for unemployment benefits. The Office of Personnel Management, which oversees federal workers, has urged them to reach out to creditors and landlords for a deferral or reduction of payments. This weekend the shutdown will become the longest in US history.

May woos Labour MPs' on deal,"Mrs May said the deal was in the national interest at a press conference on Thursday Theresa May has spoken to the leaders of two of the biggest unions in the UK as she continues to try to build support for her Brexit deal. The PM spoke to Unite's Len McCluskey and the GMB's Tim Roache by phone on Thursday in what her spokesman described as ""constructive"" calls. He said Mrs May was undertaking ""widespread engagement"" about the deal. Mr Roache said he was glad the PM had ""finally picked up the phone"" but that her deal was not ""good enough"". ""If the deal genuinely did the job for GMB members, our union would support it, but it doesn't,"" he said. ""It's clear more time is required, we need to extend Article 50 and ultimately give the final say on Brexit to the public."" Laura Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics? Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn calls for election over Brexit World against no-deal Brexit - Japan PM Mrs May also spoke to John Allan, president of the CBI business lobby group, as MPs continue to debate the EU withdrawal agreement her government has negotiated with the EU, ahead of next Tuesday's vote. She has also met some Labour MPs as she continues efforts to build support for the deal, which more than 100 of her own MPs have said they will oppose. Asked if she was still ruling out Labour's policy of a permanent customs union with the EU, after talking to the party's MPs and union leaders, she her deal would deliver an ""ambitious"" trading arrangements with the EU and allow the UK to strike trade deals around the world. At a press conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, she said her deal was in the national interest ""because it's a good deal and therefore I hope that it will get wide support across the whole of Parliament"". Speaking alongside Mrs May in Downing Street, Mr Abe said  his country was in ""total support"" of Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement and wanted to ""invest more into your country and to enjoy further economic growth with the UK"". ""That is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the whole wish of the whole world,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

It has emerged that the government is considering backing an amendment from Labour Leave supporter John Mann, giving extra protections to workers and the environment, in a bid to win support. A number of Labour MPs in Leave-supporting constituencies back Mr Mann's amendment, which the MP said would open up the opportunity for other improvements to the prime minister's deal. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for an election over Brexit A spokesman for the prime minister said it was something they would ""consider very seriously"", adding that the government had ""a long standing commitment to strong labour protections"". Mr Mann told BBC News his amendment would make it more likely for him to back the deal, but admitted it didn't mean other Labour MPs would be ""rushing"" to do the same. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party did not ""accept or endorse"" what was on offer in the proposed amendment. He said it has already been ""quite clearly and emphatically rejected"" by leading trade unions. By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason The prime minister is hitting the phones - and the people on the other end are not regular recipients of telephonic greetings from Downing Street. So what's happening? Theresa May is reaching out. Her proposed Brexit deal needs friends, and if that means phoning people who wouldn't count as such politically, then so be it. The response from the trades unions has been less than gushing.  One source told me they amounted to ""eleventh hour, ten minute calls."" But, at the very least, it means Mrs May can say she is listening. Even if those on the other end of the line don't like what they are hearing. Greener UK - a group of 14 environmental organisations working on Brexit, including the RSPB and the Woodland Trust - said the aim of Mr Mann's amendment was ""commendable"", but it was not enough ""to prevent a weakening of environmental protections or standards"". Meanwhile, during the second of five days of debate on the deal, Conservative MP George Freeman has told MPs he will now vote for it, having previously said he could not support it. He said it ""wasn't perfect"" and he hoped there would be more concessions. Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Brexit and the timetable for a 'Plan B' But he added: ""I will, with a heavy heart on Tuesday, vote for this deal because we are now in the dying stages and no-deal is unconscionable. But I beg colleagues to ask their front benches to work together across the house in pursuit of something we can all be proud of."" The government has lost two Brexit votes in two days. The first defeatlimits the government's financial powersin the event of a no-deal departure. The second forces the PM to announcenew plans within three daysif her deal fails in the Commons. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP which has helped the government win votes since June 2017, haswarned the PM her deal is ""already dead"". In a sign that the party has not been swayed by the government's promise togive the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto,externalover any new EU regulations introduced under the terms of the proposed backstop arrangement, she accused Mrs May of ""wasting time"". Senior Conservatives have continued to express opposition to the withdrawal agreement and declaration on future relations, negotiated by Mrs May in November. The Labour Party will oppose Mrs May's deal next week, and push for a vote of no confidence if it is rejected by MPs, as Mr Corbyn believes that a general election is the most democratic way of breaking the Brexit deadlock. The DUP says it will support the government in any confidence vote if the Brexit deal is rejected, making a defeat less likely. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"Alexa and Google Assistant carve up CESAmerica, China and tech's next stepVideoVideoThe lightsaber you can strike with forceVideoVideoLG's see-through and vibrating OLED TVs","Alexa and Google Assistant aren't clamouring to be heard, they're clamouring to be spoken to At CES, there's no shortage of gadgets to talk to. Smart TVs, cars, pianos - and even a toilet - these are just some examples of devices that come with voice-activated helpers. No matter who makes the hardware, the virtual aide linked to or packaged inside is likely to be one of two: either Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant. ForShadeCraft,external, the maker of a new device that lets garden parasols be controlled by voice, Alexa was simply more straight-forward to build in. ""It was much easier and simpler to integrate,"" explains chief executive Armen Gharabegian. ""But we have been testing Google voice as well."" At last, a parasol you can talk to Users can ask Alexa to open or close the sunshades mechanically, or play music via Bloom's speakers. But ShadeCraft wants to integrate Alexa completely, so that the parasol behaves just like an Amazon Echo smart speaker. Voice commands such as ordering Amazon products or asking what the weather will be like could then be done from the patio as well as the living room. Amazon has made it hassle-free to add Alexa to products, byoffering the assistant on a single chip,external- the Alexa Connect Kit. It has been available for a few months now, but at CES Googlejust announced their equivalent tool with a strikingly,externalsimilar name - Google Assistant Connect. However, any product using that chip will have to wirelessly connect to a Google smart device, which will process voice data. Roland has showcased a digital piano that also houses Alexa Still, in time, Bloom customers may be able to choose to talk to Google Assistant instead of Alexa. ""I think that we are perfectly positioned to be the extension of the AI hub outdoors,"" said Mr Gharabegian. More from CES 2019: The expanding door that fights parcel thieves LG's see-through and vibrating OLED TVs IBM's hourly weather reports will cover entire Earth The benefit of this would be to give users access to the particular functionality offered by different virtual helpers. Google Assistant, for example, tends to be better at answering queries about the wider world than Alexa. It also has exclusive access to some of the search firm's other products, letting users control Chromecast audio streams or display YouTube and Google Maps on devices with screens. Alexa, by contrast, is more widely supported by third-party products and has more apps. Another firm that thinks its customers may be best at deciding how to interact verbally with its devices is Sonos. It has shown off a prototype smart speaker that allows users to select either Alexa or Google Assistant, though it isn't possible to activate them both at the same time. Part of the problem is that interacting with multiple virtual helpers through one device could get confusing. ""Say an alarm goes off on the speaker,""writes Dieter Bohn at tech site The Verge,external. ""You might not know whether it was Alexa or Google that set it off, and you'd be stuck guessing which one to ask to stop while it beeps."" Google Assistant is also on a mission to conquer your home However, in time, people may well become accustomed to using both assistants interchangeably, and even others like Apple's Siri or Samsung's Bixby, depending on what they want to do. ""[Consumers] will be entrenched in one of those ecosystems and so the manufacturer of appliances is not going to want to lose sales to consumers who prefer one of them,"" says Ross Rubin at market analystsReticle Research,external. But for now the land grab is everything, which is why executives at Amazon must be feeling pleased with Alexa's progress. Amazon is estimated to have41% of the global smart speaker market,externalwhile Google comes in second, taking 28%. Alexa's dominance is visible across a wide range of other products too. ""Alexa had made the first-mover advantage and for a few years, that was the dominant integration technology at CES,"" explains Mr Rubin. ""Google has stepped up its presence year after year."" There are signs everywhere at CES that Alexa is still top dog in the voice assistant space Some, though, remain sceptical that voice assistants add much value to most products. ""They're putting Alexa in everything and I'm getting a little bit tired of it,"" one user-interface specialist from a major car-maker told the BBC at CES. ""If I want to open my toilet why should I tell Alexa to open my toilet instead of opening it myself?"" The specialist, who wishes to remain anonymous, noted how the ""sheer force"" of Amazon's marketing was particularly noticeable at the tech trade show this year. One other CES attendee concurred, tweeting:,external""To say that Amazon Alexa is everywhere at CES in Las Vegas would be an understatement."" Mr Rubin thinks that there are certain gadgets where the benefit of hands-free control does make sense. Take kitchen appliances, for instance. Instead of trying to finger a recipe book or smartphone with - literally - butter fingers, you can ask a voice assistant to call out the directions or repeat something if you need to hear it again. Google and Amazon have both deployed small armies of promoters to answer questions about their products The hands-free use case applies to Focals - a new range of stylish smart glasses made byToronto-based firm North,external. Focals project a colour display into the wearer's eyeball by bouncing it off the lens to create a hologram-like visual in the right eye. This is used to relay text messages or directions to a place, for instance. ""The result that you get is a small transparent display that sits about an arm's length in front of you,"" says spokesman Alexander Ingram. With Alexa and a speaker on board, there's another option - just listen to the information instead. North received investment from Amazon and so has built Alexa into Focals - but Mr Ingram says there are no plans to keep the glasses as an Alexa-only product. ""By being able to take these assistants out of the home and into the world, that just opens up a huge range of new applications,"" he said. North's Focals smart glasses are designed to look just like normal glasses There is another way to bring voice activation to a product without having to rely on one of the tech giants' assistants. Snips,externallets firms build their own voice tools that run solely on the devices they were intended for. So, if you want to make a coffee machine that simply responds to a handful of crucial commands, it would be an option. What's more, by not relying on Amazon's or Google's servers, users would not need to bother connecting their new coffee machine to the cloud before asking it for a cappuccino. And that avoids the risk of a cyber-security scandal or other privacy issue. ""This kind of information should stay in your home, it should not go elsewhere, to a server on the opposite side of the world,"" said the firm's vice president of product, Sebastien Maury.

"America, China and tech's next stepVideoVideoThe lightsaber you can strike with forceVideoVideoLG's see-through and vibrating OLED TVs","Huawei may not have any keynote speakers at CES, but the Chinese tech giant is still very much present In a corner of the Las Vegas Convention Center, a row of Huawei Mate 20 smartphones are lined up, sparkling, for CES delegates to try out. It's a typical scene at the trade show but one made slightly surreal by the fact that few Americans will likely ever own these phones. Right now, US networks don't offer any Huawei smartphones, because US security services are worried they could be used for Chinese surveillance. And yet, Huawei has still decided to promote itself at CES in some force - at a time when the company's chief financial officer faces possible extradition to the US over accusations of bank fraud. And in a climate where US-China trade relations are at boiling point. ""It makes business sense for them to come here,"" says Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES. ""Because they can meet their buyers from all around the world. So they want to be here."" But Mr Shapiro may be putting on a bit of a brave face. There are significant indications that some of the best-known Chinese companies have, for this year at least, taken a step back from America's premier tech event. Shenzhen-based ZTE, which had been at CES every year since 2011, was nowhere to be found at this year's show, despite being originally listed as an exhibitor. It has offered no explanation as to why, but last year Donald Trump signed an order that said ZTE equipment must not be used by the US government, or any company that wants to do public work. US-China trade relations are currently experiencing a rough patch While Huawei does have a large stand, no executives are in attendance - a contrast to last year when Richard Yu, one of the firm's most senior figures,was a keynote speaker. This year, not a single Chinese company executive is expected to speak at the show. More broadly, the CTA says it's too early to know whether the precise number of exhibitors from China is up or down on last year, until it carries out its audit of attendees. It did tell the BBC, however, that in terms of physical floor space, the amount of room taken up by Chinese companies is roughly the same as 2018 - approximately 13-14% of the entire show. The likes of Alibaba, JD.com, Lenovo and DJI are all in prime locations. Earlier this month, a shockwave ripped through the technology industry:Apple announced that its revenues would be significantly lowerwhen it reports its next quarterly earnings. Chief executive Tim Cook blamed China's economic volatility, and suggested looming US-China trade tariffs are already having an effect. Most analysts predict Apple will not be alone in reporting signs of strain. After all, fewer iPhones sold means fewer iPhones made in China. The complex tangle of supply chains and components sourced from all over the world in some respects makes the notion of an ""American"" or ""Chinese"" phone rather absurd. It's why all technology companies are looking very closely at the outcome of talks between Washington and Beijing. If the two sides are unable to strike a deal by 1 March, the tariffs will be in place. If that happens, the business world will be reassuring itself that a change in leadership might repair the damage. ""I have to say the [Trump] administration's part of the current tensions,"" says Frank Gillet, an analyst with Forrester Research. ""So, if that administration changes then we're going to have a reset."" More from CES 2019: Amazon and Google voice assistants carve up CES The expanding door that fights parcel thieves LG's see-through and vibrating OLED TVs Even if the trade dispute dissipates, what isn't going anywhere is the growing atmosphere of suspicion between these two global superpowers over how they use their new technology. This is coming to a head now because of the significant progress made by the Chinese tech industry over the past decade. It has shaken off its reputation as just a source of cheap, high-quality manufacturing, or as an irritating imitator of Western creativity. Huawei took ""Made in China"" and made it ""Designed in China"". High-quality, genuine innovation and a price point that often came in significantly below comparable efforts from Apple. Chinese smartphone makers have become increasingly competitive, with Xiaomi for example offering a 5G-ready device This has disrupted the smartphone world order. Huawei is currently second only to Samsung when it comes to global smartphone sales. Other Chinese brands like ZTE and Xiaomi are also selling well. Smartphones are just the start. One of the next major innovations is the mass adoption of 5G, a technology that should offer 20 times the download speeds of 4G mobile networks. To get there will require vast amounts of new networking infrastructure - and Huawei has positioned itself as a dominant - if not the dominant - supplier of equipment worldwide. ""Huawei is the only true supplier in 5G,"" says Huawei's security spokesman, Andy Purdy. ""Everyone is else is playing catch-up."" The US government has blocked the use of Huawei's 5G equipment in the country, and has reportedly urged other allies to do the same. Other Chinese firms are subject to bans as well. Huawei feels the move is anti-competitive. ""From the beginning of 2018 there's been a global drumbeat of hostility by the United States government against Huawei,"" Mr Purdy argues. He adds that current political posturing is preventing progress from being made. Some Chinese manufacturers feel the Trump administration is harming their business ""It's clear to us that whatever real cyber-security concerns exist regarding products, they can be addressed. But we have to have the conversations to address them."" Mr Purdy argues that globally many countries have embraced Huawei's technology - including the UK, which utilise Huawei products across So will the US ever be fully open to China's business? It's a question that is becoming harder to answer as China graduates into what is now a hub of innovation that is surpassing the progress of the West in profound ways. When so much of the future is about how we capture and crunch personal data, breakthrough moments in technology - which we look for at CES - are less tangible. The next big thing may not be a product, but a philosophy. What's more important to a prosperous society: innovation or liberty? ""The Chinese attitude towards privacy is actually helping them advance much more quickly,"" Mr Shapiro says. ""I would defend our European and American approach on liberty and individual rights. But I also think it has to be balanced against the need for innovation and competition.""

Murdered boy in London 'for new start',"Jaden Moodie ""seemed like a really respectable, polite young man"" A teenager who was murdered in north London had moved to the capital for ""a new start"", a youth worker has said. Jaden Moodie, 14, was stabbed to death by attackers who knocked him off a moped in Bickley Road, Leyton, on Tuesday in what police believe was a targeted attack. Police found a car they believe was involved in his murder on Wednesday. Marcellus Baz, who is behind a youth project called Switch Up, said Jaden had his ""life mapped out"". No arrests have been made over Jaden's murder, the Met Police said. The teenager and his mother had recently moved to London from Nottingham to be closer to some of his family. Mr Baz said he met Jaden briefly after spotting him and his friends on a street in Nottingham regarded as a ""hotspot for antisocial behaviour and knife crime"". He said the teenager said ""I'd love to but I'm moving to London"" when he was offered the chance to get involved in a long-term youth programme. Jaden Moodie was struck by a vehicle while on a moped and stabbed to death Mr Baz said Jaden ""seemed like a really respectable, polite young man that had his life mapped out"". ""He wanted to go down the construction, painting and decorating route. He looked like he was going to have a new start in London and do something amazing."" Mr Baz said it was ""really distressing"" that this type of violence was ""starting to become normalised"" and called for better support for young people and people who have suffered a trauma. ""Losing Jaden might lead to all kinds of things such as these young people having aggressive outbursts, self-medicating, or self-harming,"" he said. His view was echoed by MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy, who told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Communities like mine are crying out for help and support."" She said she had been ""getting up in parliament and begging and pleading with ministers to focus on this and give us the resources"". In a statement published online,,externalHeathcote School and Science College in Chingford, where Jaden attended, said it was offering support to pupils and staff ""during this difficult time"". Redhill Academy in Arnold, Nottingham where the teenager was a student before moving to London, said it was ""shocked and saddened to hear the news of Jaden's tragic death"". ""Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this very difficult time,"" headmaster Neil Matthews added.

Yemen soldiers killed in drone attack,"This video can not be played Drone explodes above a podium where officials were watching a military parade at al-Anad base in Yemen. A drone attack on a Yemeni government base by the rebel Houthi movement has reportedly killed six soldiers. The drone exploded above a podium at al-Anad base, in the southern province of Lahj, where high-ranking officers and officials were watching a parade. Medics said army deputy chief of staff Gen Saleh al-Zindani and Lahj governor Ahmed al-Turki were among those hurt. A Houthi-run TV channel said the rebels had targeted personnel from the Saudi-led coalition backing the government. The attack threatens to derail UN peace efforts, which last month saw both sides agree to a ceasefire around the lifeline Red Sea port of Hudaydah, which is crucial to the delivery of aid supplies. Soldiers scrambled to carry wounded comrades to military vehicles A Houthi military source told Al-Masirah TV that Thursday's attack targeted ""invaders"",external- an apparent reference to coalition personnel - and ""mercenaries"" at al-Anad, which which is about 60km (40 miles) north of the second city of Aden. It was carried out after ""careful monitoring of gatherings and movements"" at the base, he added. What will the new year hold for Yemen? Why is there a war in Yemen? Video footage of the incident showed the drone approaching the parade ground rapidly and at low altitude before exploding above the covered VIP podium. ""It was a very strong explosion and we could feel the pressure,""local journalist Nabil al-Qaiti, who was at the parade, told the Associated Press,external. ""The drone was packed with explosives,"" he added. Medics at the Ibn Khaldoun hospital in the nearby city of Houta told AFP news agency that six soldiers were killed and 12 people were injured in the attack. They said the wounded include Gen Zindani, Mr Turki, intelligence chief Brig-Gen Mohammed Saleh Tamah, and senior army commander Fadel Hasan. Chief of staff Gen Abdullah al-Nakhi was also at the base when the drone struck, but there are conflicting reports about whether he was hurt. It was not immediately clear if any coalition military officials were present. Medics said the army's deputy chief of staff and the governor of Lahj province were wounded Later, Houthi military spokesman Gen Yehia Sari announced that a new kind of drone had been used. The Qasef-2K, he added, was designed to blow up about 20m (65ft) off the ground, sending shrapnel towards a target. Saudi-owned TV channels described the drone as ""Iranian made"". Iran has denied supplying weapons to the rebels. But a UN panel of experts said last year thatthe Houthis' Qasef-1 drone was ""virtually identical in design, dimensions, and capability"" to Iran's Ababil-T drone,external. Yemeni Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani tweeted that ""the crime of targeting the base will not go unanswered"". The attack, he added, showed the Houthis did ""not believe in the language of peace"" and ""only understand the language of weapons"". Saudi-owned TV channels described the drone as Iranian made, without offering evidence The attack comes a day after the UN special envoy to Yemen said the warring parties had largely stuck to the ceasefire around Hudaydah. However, Martin Griffiths told the UN Security Council that ""substantial progress"" was needed before further talks could be held on ending the war. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. At least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the fighting, according to the UN. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. Yemen rebels 'stealing food from hungry' What will the new year hold for Yemen?

Judge dismisses Judd's Weinstein lawsuit,"Ashley Judd can still proceed with her claim that Harvey Weinstein tried to sabotage her career A sexual harassment claim brought by actress Ashley Judd against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been dismissed by a court in California. But the judge said she could still pursue a defamation claim that Mr Weinstein sabotaged her career. Mr Weinstein has been accused by more than 75 women of varying degrees of sexual misconduct going back decades - allegations he denies. He has been charged with five counts of sexual abuse, including rape. The disgraced producer - who denies the charges, which were brought by two women - will stand trial in New York later this year. Where does the Weinstein case go from here? How the Weinstein scandal unfolded Who has accused Weinstein of what? Ashley Judd was one of Mr Weinstein's original accusers. Her sexual harassment lawsuit was re-filed following a change in California state law after her initial claim was rejected by Judge Gutierrez in a Los Angeles federal court last September. She alleges she rejected unwanted advances from him and he then tried to wreck her career. But in a statement late on Wednesday, Judge Gutierrez said the law that deals with sexual misconduct claims in professional relationships, which was revised to include directors and producers, could not be applied retrospectively to Ms Judd's case. This video can not be played Judd: I was not frightened of Weinstein However, Ms Judd's claim that the Oscar-winning producer ""blackballed"" her after she refused his advances would still be heard, Judge Gutierrez said. That part of her lawsuit states that ""Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms Judd's reputation and limit her ability to find work"". In 2017, Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson said he had been considering Ms Judd for a role in the 2002 film but that she was ""blacklisted"" following conversations with the Weinstein Company. He said that Mr Weinstein had warned him that the actress was a ""nightmare"" to work with. Mr Weinstein, however, said he had no role in Mr Jackson's casting and denied trying to derail Ms Judd's career. Ms Judd's lawyer Theodore Boutrous said of Wednesday's court ruling that it would not prevent her ""moving forward on multiple claims"". ""While we respectfully disagree with the Court's decision as to the one claim it ruled on today, we look forward to pursuing the three claims for relief that the Court has already ruled can move forward,"" he added. Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Phyllis Kupferstein, welcomed the judge's decision. ""We have said from the beginning that this claim was unjustified, and we are pleased that the court saw it as we did,"" she said in a statement, adding: ""We believe that we will ultimately prevail on her [Ms Judd's] remaining claims.""

May seeks support of Labour MPs for deal,"Mrs May said the deal was in the national interest at a press conference on Thursday Theresa May has spoken to the leaders of two of the biggest unions in the UK as she continues to try to build support for her Brexit deal. The PM spoke to Unite's Len McCluskey and the GMB's Tim Roache by phone on Thursday in what her spokesman described as ""constructive"" calls. He said Mrs May was undertaking ""widespread engagement"" about the deal. Mr Roache said he was glad the PM had ""finally picked up the phone"" but that her deal was not ""good enough"". ""If the deal genuinely did the job for GMB members, our union would support it, but it doesn't,"" he said. ""It's clear more time is required, we need to extend Article 50 and ultimately give the final say on Brexit to the public."" Laura Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics? Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn calls for election over Brexit World against no-deal Brexit - Japan PM Mrs May also spoke to John Allan, president of the CBI business lobby group, as MPs continue to debate the EU withdrawal agreement her government has negotiated with the EU, ahead of next Tuesday's vote. She has also met some Labour MPs as she continues efforts to build support for the deal, which more than 100 of her own MPs have said they will oppose. Asked if she was still ruling out Labour's policy of a permanent customs union with the EU, after talking to the party's MPs and union leaders, she her deal would deliver an ""ambitious"" trading arrangements with the EU and allow the UK to strike trade deals around the world. At a press conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, she said her deal was in the national interest ""because it's a good deal and therefore I hope that it will get wide support across the whole of Parliament"". Speaking alongside Mrs May in Downing Street, Mr Abe said  his country was in ""total support"" of Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement and wanted to ""invest more into your country and to enjoy further economic growth with the UK"". ""That is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the whole wish of the whole world,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

It has emerged that the government is considering backing an amendment from Labour Leave supporter John Mann, giving extra protections to workers and the environment, in a bid to win support. A number of Labour MPs in Leave-supporting constituencies back Mr Mann's amendment, which the MP said would open up the opportunity for other improvements to the prime minister's deal. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for an election over Brexit A spokesman for the prime minister said it was something they would ""consider very seriously"", adding that the government had ""a long standing commitment to strong labour protections"". Mr Mann told BBC News his amendment would make it more likely for him to back the deal, but admitted it didn't mean other Labour MPs would be ""rushing"" to do the same. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party did not ""accept or endorse"" what was on offer in the proposed amendment. He said it has already been ""quite clearly and emphatically rejected"" by leading trade unions. By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason The prime minister is hitting the phones - and the people on the other end are not regular recipients of telephonic greetings from Downing Street. So what's happening? Theresa May is reaching out. Her proposed Brexit deal needs friends, and if that means phoning people who wouldn't count as such politically, then so be it. The response from the trades unions has been less than gushing.  One source told me they amounted to ""eleventh hour, ten minute calls."" But, at the very least, it means Mrs May can say she is listening. Even if those on the other end of the line don't like what they are hearing. Greener UK - a group of 14 environmental organisations working on Brexit, including the RSPB and the Woodland Trust - said the aim of Mr Mann's amendment was ""commendable"", but it was not enough ""to prevent a weakening of environmental protections or standards"". Meanwhile, during the second of five days of debate on the deal, Conservative MP George Freeman has told MPs he will now vote for it, having previously said he could not support it. He said it ""wasn't perfect"" and he hoped there would be more concessions. Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Brexit and the timetable for a 'Plan B' But he added: ""I will, with a heavy heart on Tuesday, vote for this deal because we are now in the dying stages and no-deal is unconscionable. But I beg colleagues to ask their front benches to work together across the house in pursuit of something we can all be proud of."" The government has lost two Brexit votes in two days. The first defeatlimits the government's financial powersin the event of a no-deal departure. The second forces the PM to announcenew plans within three daysif her deal fails in the Commons. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP which has helped the government win votes since June 2017, haswarned the PM her deal is ""already dead"". In a sign that the party has not been swayed by the government's promise togive the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto,externalover any new EU regulations introduced under the terms of the proposed backstop arrangement, she accused Mrs May of ""wasting time"". Senior Conservatives have continued to express opposition to the withdrawal agreement and declaration on future relations, negotiated by Mrs May in November. The Labour Party will oppose Mrs May's deal next week, and push for a vote of no confidence if it is rejected by MPs, as Mr Corbyn believes that a general election is the most democratic way of breaking the Brexit deadlock. The DUP says it will support the government in any confidence vote if the Brexit deal is rejected, making a defeat less likely. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

Fresh defeat for May by MPs,"The government lost by 11 votes Rebel Conservative MPs have joined forces with Labour to inflict a fresh blow on Theresa May's government in a Commons Brexit vote. It means the government will have to come up with revised plans within three days if Mrs May's EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week. It could also open the door to alternatives, such as a referendum. No 10 said Mrs May's deal was in the national interest but if MPs disagreed, the government would ""respond quickly"". The setback for the PM came as MPs started five days of debate on the withdrawal agreement with the EU, and the framework for future relations, ahead of the meaningful vote next Tuesday. The government was expecting to have 21 days to come up with a ""plan B"" for Brexit if, as widely expected, Mrs May's deal is voted down. How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Bercow Brexit ruling 'extremely concerning' Brexit: A really simple guide But MPs backed calls for it to respond within three working Parliamentary days, a deadline likely to fall on Monday 21 January. Theresa May lost by 11 votes, with 297 MPs siding with the government and 308 against. Among those voting against were 17 Conservatives, including former ministers Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah and Jo Johnson who want to see another referendum to decide whether the UK should leave or not.

Former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who led the rebellion, said he hoped for a ""serious dialogue"" between government and Parliament on alternatives to Mrs May's deal to avert a possible crisis. He told ITV's Peston that it would be up to Mrs May to decide what she wanted to do if her deal was rejected, but MPs would be able to vote on any motion she put forward within seven days. While the PM would have the right to say she wanted the Commons to re-consider her deal, he said MPs could amend the motion, telling her in effect ""we want you to do something else"". Fellow rebel Sarah Wollaston said she and other MPs opposed to a no-deal exit were engaged in a ""guerrilla campaign"" to show that it would never get the consent of Parliament. This video can not be played Bercow: ""Anti-Brexit sticker belongs to my wife"" By BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy The new Grieve amendment, now passed by MPs, means that in the event the PM loses next week, the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a ""managed no-deal"" to a further referendum, via a ""Norway option"" or a reheated version of the current deal, could be on the table. If a majority could be found for anything, it would not have the force of law - but it would at least indicate a policy which had the support of MPs. This is, in short, a massive ruling by the Speaker, made, apparently, against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler. I don't want to delve too deeply into the arcana of Business of the House motions only amendable by ministers of the Crown, but this drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit. Read Mark's full blog But Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who favours leaving without a withdrawal agreement, said it would not stop the UK exiting on 29 March. ""It merely requires a motion to be tabled not even debated,"" he said. And prisons minister Rory Stewart, who backs the PM's deal, said requiring Mrs May to restart complex negotiations with the EU and come back with changes in three days, was ""unreasonable"". He said Mr Grieve was ""trying to provide more support for what he wants, which is a second referendum"". Downing Street said it would consider the repercussions of Wednesday's defeat but its intention had always been to ""provide certainty"" as soon as possible. Labour has said it will table a motion of no confidence in the government if Mrs May's deal is voted down. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament had to ""take control of what happens next"" and suggested delaying the date of the UK's exit beyond 29 March might be ""inevitable"". He warned the UK's options were narrowing given the need to avoid, at all costs, a no-deal exit which he claimed was ""simply not viable for practical reasons"". Allow Twitter content?

Commons Speaker John Bercow faced an angry backlash from some Conservative MPs over his decision to allow MPs to vote on the issue. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal.

The MPs claim Mr Bercow broke Commons rules and ignored the advice of his own clerks. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom was among MPs to challenge his ruling in a series of points of order after Prime Minister's Questions. They argued that the business motion, tabled by the government, was not amendable and said the Speaker was breaking with precedent. Mr Bercow said he had made an ""honest judgement"" after consulting his clerks but rejected calls from Ms Leadsom to publish the advice he had received. He insisted he was ""not setting himself up against the government but championing the rights of the House of Commons"", adding that if people wanted to vote against the amendment they could. But a number of Tory MPs said the decision cast doubt on Mr Bercow's impartiality, with Crispin Blunt questioning whether he remained a ""neutral referee of our affairs"". The Commons defeat was the second in the space of 24 hours for the government on Brexit. On Tuesday, MPs, headed by former Tory ministers Mr Grieve and Oliver Letwin, defied the government on an amendment aimed at making it more difficult to leave the EU without a deal. The clashes in the Commons came as the PM, who cancelled a vote on her deal last month at the last minute to avoid a humiliating defeat, launched a fresh push to convince MPs. She is hopingnew proposals on Northern Ireland,externalwill change enough MPs' minds to save the deal. Stormont EU 'veto' proposals published Under the plans, the Northern Ireland Assembly would have a say on new EU rules if the backstop plan to prevent physical checks on the Irish border comes into force after Brexit. But the Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, have already rejected the so-called ""Stormont lock"" plans as ""cosmetic"" and ""meaningless"". Ministers have also accepted calls for MPs to be able to vote next year on alternatives to activating the backstop, such as extending the proposed 21-month transition period.

Corbyn urged to back referendum,"Twenty four hours before Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn makes a speech on Brexit, some of his own activists have been pressing for a more robust stance. The party's current policy is to oppose Theresa May's deal, then call for an election - and only if that doesn't happen should other options be considered. These would include (but are not limited to) what the party calls a ""public vote"" on Brexit. But some members are becoming more vocal in demanding the leadership speed up calls for a new referendum. Fresh Brexit setback for May in MPs' vote Ministers defeated over no-deal Brexit Corbyn urged to call no-confidence vote Labour's international policy commission - which consists of shadow cabinet members, trade unionists and rank and file activists - discussed Brexit for two hours on Wednesday afternoon. The commission doesn't have the power to change policy but it heard party activists' concerns. I understand more than 5,000 Labour members posted submissions to it. I have sifted through some of these - and here is a flavour. A party member called Margo Sheridan declares: ""It's now crunch time - a large majority of Labour members now want a new referendum."" If that doesn't happen, she says: ""It would break my heart to leave the Labour party after 42 years, but I would have no other choice."" A councillor, Andrew Prenter, says he is ""in despair over the leadership's strategy on Brexit"". And an activist called John Newham says: 'Given the likelihood of parliament being unable to agree on the PM's deal, Labour should seize the initiative and propose a second referendum."" Many more contributions are in a similar vein. Labour sources point out that only around 1% of Labour's mass membership have made these views known to the policy commission. Labour MP Chuka Umunna with members of the cross-party People's Vote campaign And we certainly should not assume that all of the despairing comments are spontaneous. The People's Vote campaign has been encouraging its Labour members to press the party leadership to support a new referendum. These campaigners are often dismissed by those close to Jeremy Corbyn as ""centrists"" or ""Blairites"". But some on the Left - who otherwise strongly support Mr Corbyn's leadership - say fellow activists are feeling disheartened by the reluctance of the leadership to call for a new referendum. Michael Chessum, from left-wing campaign group Another Europe Is Possible. told me: ""Labour's leadership has to understand that I as a left-wing activist, and other left-wing activists in Momentum, are very worried about the threat to the Corbyn project if Corbyn spins so far away from his members. ""I think there is pain for Labour whatever direction we go now,  but we have to go back to the people and if Corbyn does that, it will save the entire situation."" Michael Chessum expects about 200 of Labour's local constituency parties to debate Brexit policy this month. His group wants to see both a fresh referendum and a defence of the free movement of people. Polling suggests strong support for a referendum amongst rank and file Labour members, but other opinions are available. The left-wing Campaign for Labour Party Democracy is circulating a counter-motion for discussion amongst Labour's local parties. This is supportive of the leadership position, which prioritises an election over a public vote. And sources say at Wednesday's policy commission meeting, consideration was given to the views of those members who had expressed concerns about moving quickly to support a new referendum and those who wanted to make clear that the result of the 2016 vote was being respected. There was also vocal support for the ""sequencing"" of any response to the government on Brexit - in other words pressing for an election before any other options were considered. And there was praise for the leadership's decision not to table a confidence vote before Christmas, instead waiting until the prime minister puts her deal to a Commons vote. Nonetheless, there have been tensions at the top of the party over when exactly to press a vote of no confidence in the government. Supporters of a new referendum had been pushing for this to be done swiftly as they expect it, and calls for a general election, to fail. They could then push for the party to campaign for a public vote. This video can not be played Labour's Jon Ashworth: ""We're not enabling Brexit. This country had a referendum"" For obvious reasons, opponents of a new referendum - and some shadow cabinet members want to avoid this at all costs - haven't been keen to move so swiftly. As things stand, I am told it's likely that the two positions will be reconciled. As parliament today has, in effect, asked for the prime minister to come back with a Plan B within just three working days of her deal going down to defeat, then this seems to be emerging as the favoured time for a confidence vote. Kate Hoey believes Mr Corbyn will resist calls for another referendum Labour MP Kate Hoey - who campaigned to leave the EU - has known Jeremy Corbyn for years. She believes that even if Labour's confidence vote fails to bring about an election, her party leader won't rush to embrace a new referendum. She told me: ""I think Jeremy will resist the call for a second referendum unless there is absolutely no other option. ""And those of us on the Leave side will always say there are lots of options."" Party insiders tell me not to expect a dramatic change in policy from the Labour leader in Thursday's speech.

Judge dismisses Judd's Weinstein lawsuitActress Ashley Judd's sexual harassment case against the Hollywood mogul is rejected by a court.US & Canada,"Ashley Judd can still proceed with her claim that Harvey Weinstein tried to sabotage her career A sexual harassment claim brought by actress Ashley Judd against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been dismissed by a court in California. But the judge said she could still pursue a defamation claim that Mr Weinstein sabotaged her career. Mr Weinstein has been accused by more than 75 women of varying degrees of sexual misconduct going back decades - allegations he denies. He has been charged with five counts of sexual abuse, including rape. The disgraced producer - who denies the charges, which were brought by two women - will stand trial in New York later this year. Where does the Weinstein case go from here? How the Weinstein scandal unfolded Who has accused Weinstein of what? Ashley Judd was one of Mr Weinstein's original accusers. Her sexual harassment lawsuit was re-filed following a change in California state law after her initial claim was rejected by Judge Gutierrez in a Los Angeles federal court last September. She alleges she rejected unwanted advances from him and he then tried to wreck her career. But in a statement late on Wednesday, Judge Gutierrez said the law that deals with sexual misconduct claims in professional relationships, which was revised to include directors and producers, could not be applied retrospectively to Ms Judd's case. This video can not be played Judd: I was not frightened of Weinstein However, Ms Judd's claim that the Oscar-winning producer ""blackballed"" her after she refused his advances would still be heard, Judge Gutierrez said. That part of her lawsuit states that ""Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms Judd's reputation and limit her ability to find work"". In 2017, Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson said he had been considering Ms Judd for a role in the 2002 film but that she was ""blacklisted"" following conversations with the Weinstein Company. He said that Mr Weinstein had warned him that the actress was a ""nightmare"" to work with. Mr Weinstein, however, said he had no role in Mr Jackson's casting and denied trying to derail Ms Judd's career. Ms Judd's lawyer Theodore Boutrous said of Wednesday's court ruling that it would not prevent her ""moving forward on multiple claims"". ""While we respectfully disagree with the Court's decision as to the one claim it ruled on today, we look forward to pursuing the three claims for relief that the Court has already ruled can move forward,"" he added. Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Phyllis Kupferstein, welcomed the judge's decision. ""We have said from the beginning that this claim was unjustified, and we are pleased that the court saw it as we did,"" she said in a statement, adding: ""We believe that we will ultimately prevail on her [Ms Judd's] remaining claims.""

Driver quizzed as 27 'migrants' found in lorry,"Those on board were medically assessed and transferred to immigration officials for interview A lorry driver is being quizzed after police stopped a vehicle on the M6 with 27 suspected migrants, including four who claim to be under 18, in the back. Staffordshire Police arrested the man, 42, on suspicion of ""facilitating the illegal entry"" of people into the UK. Officers had received reports ""lives may be at risk"" in the wagon, which was stopped near Stoke-on-Trent. Staffordshire County Council said they are working to support four people who said they are under the age of 18. It is understood all 27 people were medically assessed and transferred to immigration officials for interview. Council leader Philip Atkins said: ""We have a duty to look after these young people and our priority is to ensure they are safe and well and treated appropriately for their age while they are assessed."" Police said the driver remains in custody and Immigration Enforcement are now running the investigation. A police spokeswoman added: ""The vehicle was stopped after reports were received that lives may have been at risk. ""The driver of the vehicle, a 42-year-old man of no fixed address, was arrested on suspicion of facilitating the illegal entry of persons unknown to the UK."" The Home Office said the group were comprised of Eritrean, Ethiopian and Sudanese nationals. Part of the motorway had been closed from about 16:00 GMT - causing lengthy tailbacks on Wednesday - as police searched vehicles near Keele services. The lorry was stopped on the northbound carriageway between junctions 15 and 16 at about 17:45 GMT. Among those caught up in huge tailbacks werehundreds of Burton Albion supporterswho had been travelling to their team's Carabao Cup semi-final against Manchester City, which they lost 9-0. Driver Danny Ellis said he had seen 30 to 40 police cars pass him on the northbound side of the motorway, and said three or four lorries had been stopped and searched. ""We were told for safety to get back in our cars and lock them,"" he said. ""We were told a lot of people escaped and ran from the back of these lorries."" People wrapped in foil blankets were seen on the hard shoulder surrounded by police The 30-year-old telecoms worker said he had seen men on the ground being treated by paramedics. Another eyewitness told BBC Radio Stoke he had seen police stopping lorries. Latest news from the West Midlands He said: ""They pulled a white trailer up on the side and they were shouting 'are they in here?' ""The driver opened the vehicle and I just watched 15 of them come out."" Police said a number of people had fled but were eventually detained, with none reporting serious injuries. Traffic cameras showed long tailbacks forming on the motorway A West Midlands Ambulance spokesman said: ""Three paramedic officers, a BASICS emergency doctor and two ambulance crews were responded. ""A total of 27 occupants from a vehicle which was stopped by the police received medical assessments on scene by ambulance staff. All were in a stable condition and didn't require hospital treatment. All 27 patients were discharged on scene and left in the care of the police."" Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker said: ""We were acting on information where there was real concern for people in distress and therefore it was necessary for us to take immediate and appropriate action."" He apologised to motorists for disruption on the motorway, which Highways England said was not fully reopened until about 22:00 GMT.

Jackson estate attacks 'lurid' documentaryNew documentary Leaving Neverland features two men who allege they were sexually abused by the star.Entertainment & Arts,"Jackson died in 2009 at the age of 50 Michael Jackson's estate has criticised a documentary alleging the late pop star sexually abused children. Leaving Neverland will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this month and includes interviews with two alleged victims of Jackson. Representatives for Jackson's estate have responded in a statement. ""This is yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson,"" it said. Fans gathered at Jackson's former Neverland home after his death Two men who appear in the film say they were aged seven and 10 when Jackson befriended them and their families. Now in their 30s, they allege they were sexually abused by the late singer. Police raided Jackson's Neverland Ranch in California - referenced in the film's title - in 2003 while investigating allegations Jackson had molested a 13-year-old boy. The case went to trial and Jackson wasacquitted of all charges in 2005,external. The synopsis for the documentary reads: ""Through gut-wrenching interviews with the now-adult men and their families, Leaving Neverland crafts a portrait of sustained exploitation and deception, documenting the power of celebrity that allowed a revered figure to infiltrate the lives of starstruck children and their parents."" The two-part film is directed by Dan Reed, who is also behind documentaries including The Valley, Terror in Mumbai and The Paedophile Hunter. It will debut atSundance,externalin Utah on 25 and 26 January and will be shown on Channel 4 in Spring 2019. The film is a co-production between Channel 4, HBO and Reed, and will be shown in two two-hour broadcasts on consecutive nights in the UK. Channel 4 told the BBC the film had ""been in the pipeline for a few years"". Jackson died on 25 June 2009 aged 50 after receiving a lethal dose of the anaesthetic propofol.

John Lewis staff bonus in doubtRetailer sees Christmas sales rise but says it may not pay a staff bonus for the first time since 1953.Business,"This video can not be played Sir Charlie Mayfield John Lewis says sales in the seven-week Christmas period were 1.4% higher than for the same period last year. However, that may not be enough to secure a bonus for its 83,000 staff this year, the firm said. John Lewis' structure is unique. It is owned by its staff, known as partners. It says it will think carefully about whether to give staff their traditional share in March. If it decides not to, it would mark the first time since 1953 the partners had gone without. Typically in profitable years, staff at the 350 Waitrose and 51 John Lewis stores receive a share of these. In the very best years, these bonuses can add the equivalent of a few months' worth of pay. Christmas retail winners and losers Both Waitrose and John Lewis saw sales rise. Gross like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of store opening and closures, at its Waitrose supermarkets, were Â£1.05bn, up 0.3% on last year. The John Lewis department stores themselves saw sales of Â£1.1bn, up 1% on last year. Waitrose's online sales over the Christmas period were particularly strong, increasing by 12.8%. John Lewis sales were boosted by last-minute Christmas Eve purchases Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, outlined the challenges facing shopkeepers: ""Two main factors are affecting the retail sector - oversupply of physical space and relatively weak consumer demand. ""Despite this, we had a positive Christmas trading period, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of partners in our business."" He said full-year profits would be ""substantially"" lower this year. Sir Charlie told the BBC: ""Every year the board looks at what we can afford to pay in bonus in March. What we've said is because of the steps we've taken we've got a strong financial position and we can afford to pay a bonus. The question is whether it's prudent to do so and of course that's a judgement about what's coming and the uncertainty in the market and this year of course there's quite a lot of that. So we just have to look at that sensibly. ""In our business, it's owned by the people who work in it, we live within our means and we have to take account of what's coming up even if it's uncertain and we can't quite judge it perfectly."" The partnership also said that Black Friday, which has become one of the most important trading days of the year, contributed to the biggest sales week in its history. John Lewis said at the start of January that the week running up to Christmas itself saw sales rise by 11% on the previous Christmas. John Lewis reported very strong sales on Christmas Eve itself - which was included in the last week of trading - as customers bought last-minute gifts.

Stranded seals wreak havoc in Canada,"More than 40 seals have become stranded in the town of Roddickton-Bide Arm in Newfoundland Dozens of seals have become stranded in a Canadian town, blocking traffic and the entrances to homes and businesses. Two of the animals in Roddickton-Bide Arm, Newfoundland, died after being struck by a car. There are concerns others will starve to death. It is against Canadian law to interfere with marine mammals such as seals. The creatures became stranded after nearby waters suddenly froze over last week, preventing their return to the ocean. Experts say the speed at which the bay froze over may have disorientated the animals and caused them to move inland instead of towards open waters. Images posted on social media show the seals stranded on roads and large banks of snow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Donors pay debts of jailed Aboriginal women,"Experts say the law disproportionately affects indigenous Australians Campaigners in Australia have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help free Aboriginal women jailed for being unable to pay fines. Western Australia is the nation's only state that regularly jails people for unpaid fines, often on minor crimes. Experts note the law disproportionately affects indigenous Australians, as well as poor and vulnerable people. The state government says it plans reforms this year that will make it harder for people to be jailed. In the meantime, campaigners have begun fundraising to pay for fines incurred by Aboriginal women, raising almost A$200,000 (Â£110,000; $143,000) since Saturday. A government report in 2016 noted that Aboriginal women were the most likely to be imprisoned,externalfor unpaid fines, due to high levels of disadvantage. ""These are cases of very poor Aboriginal women, mothers living on the streets, in shelters,"" said Debbie Kilroy, from advocacy group Sisters Inside. ""They live below the poverty line so they can't afford to pay off a fine."" Australia fails indigenous equality targets The 'mind-blowing' struggle for a treaty Aboriginal mums face high murder rate Ms Kilroy said they had helped free one woman on Wednesday who had been serving a 12-day jail stint because she could not pay A$2,300 in vehicle-related fines. The woman had previously been living in her car, the campaigner said. Across all demographics, fewer than 10 people per month on average last year were jailed solely for unpaid fines in Western Australia, according to the state's Department of Justice. That is a significant drop from 2010-2015, when more than 800 people were imprisoned each year,according to the independent Human Rights Law Centre.,external The reductions followed a backlash over the death of a 22-year-old Aboriginal woman in 2014, who had been placed in custody over an unpaid fine. However, Ms Kilroy asserted that she was aware of 2,400 current outstanding warrants for unpaid fines across the state. It is hoping to help clear the debts of at least 100 Aboriginal women who are either in jail, or facing incarceration due to such warrants. The group has already settled three warrants this week using the donations. ""It has raised my hope in humanity in terms of people caring about Aboriginal women, who are the most marginalised in our country,"" Ms Kilroy told the BBC. The state government, elected in 2017, has said that by July it will change the law to allow only a magistrate to order jail time for unpaid fines. Currently, warrants can be issued by a fine enforcement agency. The proposed change would ensure that imprisonment for unpaid fines ""is truly a last resort"", said a spokesman for state Attorney-General John Quigley. ""This is something the government is committed to addressing effectively,"" the spokesman said. Last year,the Australian government's annual report card on reducing indigenous disadvantage found improvement in only three of seven key benchmarks.

Car sales see biggest fall since 2008,"This video can not be played Mike Hawes, chief executive, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders UK car sales last year saw the biggest annual fall since the financial crisis,according to the industry trade body,external. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said 2.36 million new cars were registered in 2018 down 6.8% on the previous year, the biggest drop since an 11% fall in 2008. Diesel sales sank by 30% on worries over possible tougher restrictions. However, the move away from diesel cars contributed to a 3% rise in the average emissions of CO2 by new cars last year. Diesel cars typically produce less CO2 than petrol vehicles. A customer switch towards bigger cars, in particular SUVs, also contributed to greater average CO2 emissions. While diesel cars produce less CO2 than petrol cars, they produce higher levels of nitrogen oxides or NOx, which are associated with breathing difficulties. The SMMT blamed last year's fall in cars sales - the second consecutive year that the market has declined - on uncertainty over Brexit and a shortage in supply of some vehicles due to a new emissions testing scheme. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes described those challenges as ""something of perfect storm"" for the industry. Are diesel cars a health hazard? What's going wrong at Jaguar Land Rover? Economy slows as car sales fall ""What we have been seeing over the last couple of years is a decline in business and consumer confidence, especially the confidence to buy big ticket items like a new car,"" he said. With sales of almost 96,000 the Ford Fiesta was the best selling car in the UK last year, the SMMT said. The Volkswagen Golf was next, with sales of almost 65,000. The boss of the SMMT says the industry has been facing a ""perfect storm"" - but the real typhoon may lie ahead. So far the decline in car sales has been largely due to a fairly catastrophic fall in demand for diesels. Put simply, the public perception is that diesel engines are dirty - leading headline-hungry politicians to talk up the prospect of bans and other restrictions. And who will buy a car if they think they won't be allowed to use it? The industry insists modern diesels are cleaner than their predecessors - but persuading policymakers to support a diesel sales drive currently looks like an uphill struggle. However, the real storm could erupt on 29 March. The SMMT says a no deal Brexit would be a ""disaster"" for the industry - because manufacturers need parts to be where they are needed, exactly when they are needed. New border controls and formalities would make those operations ""virtually impossible"". Despite the dramatic decline in sales of diesel cars, Mr Hawes thinks those types of cars have a future. ""For many consumers diesel is still the right choice. It offers better fuel economy and generally about 20% improvement on CO2 emissions. ""There are no specific bans on diesel and the newer diesels are actually exempt from any of the additional restrictions that are being put in place,"" he told the BBC. Analyst Ian Gilmartin, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said the figures were no surprise, as it had been known for months that sales were falling. ""It's not time to panic and worth remembering that in absolute terms, sales are still way ahead of the nadir we hit at the start of the decade. Manufacturers and retailers are making positive steps to try to innovate and adapt to the changing landscape, in particular through the development of new alternatively fuelled models. ""But they can't do it all on their own - they need support from the government to encourage more new vehicle purchases and allow the industry to thrive this year,"" he said.

WhatÃ¢ÂÂs going wrong at Jaguar Land Rover?,"Reports of a New Year jobs cull at Jaguar Land Rover (JRL) underline the scale of the challenge facing Britain's biggest carmaker. JLR has not confirmed the stories, which first appeared in the Financial Times. But, then again, it hasn't denied them either. According to JLR, speculation that up to 5,000 jobs may be at risk is just that - ""media speculation"". However, the company has already announced a Â£2.5bn restructuring plan called Project Charge and Project Accelerate. And as David Bailey, motor industry specialist at Aston Business School, says: ""I can't see how they'd make Â£2.5bn of savings without laying off workers."" Signs of trouble have been brewing all year. JLR made a pre-tax loss of Â£90m for the three months to end of September, compared to a profit for the same quarter in 2017. The firm's Solihull plant, where it makes Range Rover and Jaguar models, was closed for a two-week shutdown due to ""fluctuating demand"". That followed a move to a three-day week at JLR's Castle Bromwich plant. Jaguar Land Rover throws government a challenge JLR makes makes loss as sales slide 13% Jaguar boss in 'horrifying' Brexit warning Professor Bailey says JLR is caught in a ""perfect storm"" - the threat of a no-deal Brexit, slowing growth in China and a fall in diesel sales. Most analysts agree that the jewel in Britain's manufacturing crown needs more than just a polish. So a big cut in the 40,000-strong workforce, though painful, wouldn't be too much of a surprise. Falling sales in China is arguably the single biggest cause of JLR's current woes. The world's biggest car market has been driving growth for years, not just for JLR but for the global industry. A year or two ago things were still looking so positive. China accounted for about 25% of JLR sales and the company was building up production at plants in the country to help feed that growth. The Chinese love British luxury goods, went the marketing hype. And JLR said it was perfectly positioned to cash in on the consumers' love of big brands. But the market has stalled. A economic slowdown has made consumers more cautious about buying big ticket items. Beijing has scrapped some tax breaks on new cars, and rises petrol prices has hurt sales of fuel-thirsty sport utility vehicles. All this came against a backdrop of trade war talk and uncertainty about stiffer tariffs on cars. In fact, the latest speculation is that China will cut import tariffs but that may delay some purchases in the hope that prices will fall. The scale of China's slowing market was evident last month, when total car sales fell 14% from a year earlier, marking the steepest such drop in nearly seven years. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said 2.55 million vehicles were sold, a fifth straight monthly decline. The November fall comes after almost 12% declines in each of the past two months, putting China on track for an annual sales contraction not seen since at least 1990. ""We're currently in a painful period, and this process is really tough,"" Xu Haidong, CAAM's assistant secretary general told a press conference when the figures were released. JLR has not been immune to this slowdown. In November, its sales in China were 50% lower than a year ago at 6,804. Sales in October fell 46% year-on-year. It hasn't helped that JLR is understood to currently have a fraught relationship with car dealers in the country, who want the company to put up more money to help subsidise sales promotions. Some of JLR's rivals are doing it, but the company has been reluctant to follow. Outside China, JLR also continues to struggle, although the problem is no means as acute. Overall sales in the three months to September fell by 13%, with all its key regions seeing a slowdown. But JLR is not entirely the victim of circumstances outside its control. JLR chief executive Ralf Speth has said a hard Brexit could put the business in jeopardy The company has been criticised for not starting the shift away from diesel earlier. Almost 90% of sales last year in Britain, its largest market, were diesels. Other critics say there is too much overlap between models, such as the Range Rover Velar and Range Rover Sport. Also, Professor Ferdinand DudenhÃ¶ffer, from the Center for Automotive Research, at Germany's University of Duisberg-Essen, says Jaguar probably has too many models to compete with its rivals. Jaguar sold 180,000 cars last year, broadly the equivalent of 30,000 per model. ""You cannot compete with BMW or Mercedes with just 30,000 sales per model,"" he said. Both BMW and Mercedes have this year issued stark warnings about the slowdown in China and falls in diesel sales. But both companies remain profitable, sustained by a global manufacturing base and bigger sales footprint. Basically, says the professor, the problem for JLR is that it makes too many big cars that run on diesel. ""JLR needs a more balanced portfolio in order to compete under new emissions rules. But the company must move with more speed,"" he said. The current restructuring plan includes reducing investment and taking out inventory. JLR's chief executive Ralf Speth said it would ""lay the foundations for long-term sustainable, profitable growth"". But there is another hurdle that could yet de-rail this restructuring, one that prof DudenhÃ¶ffer says outweighs all the other hurdles - a no-deal Brexit. Mr Speth has warned about the consequences for investment in the UK if there is a hard Brexit. And the professor says he was right to do so. ""The disruption to exports of cars and the import of parts would push up costs dramatically,"" he said. ""The cash position would deteriorate. I think Brexit is the most important problem they face right now.""

Jayden Moodie murder police find car,"Jaden Moodie lived in the area with his mother, police said A car believed to be involved in the murder of 14-year-old Jaden Moodie has been found by police in London. The teenager was struck by a vehicle while on his moped, and then stabbed to death in what police believe was a targeted attack. He was found wounded in Bickley Road, Waltham Forest, on Tuesday evening. The black Mercedes B Class was recovered in the Carlisle Road area of Leyton during the afternoon. No arrests have been made, the Met Police said. The teenager was knocked off the moped at about 18:30 GMT, and then stabbed several times by three attackers as he lay unconscious in the road. The car was found a few hundred metres away, and has remained at that site for forensic examination. Det Ch Insp Chris Soole, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, who is leading the investigation, said: ""We are treating the recovery of the car as a significant development in our enquiries, which are still very much in their early stages. ""Jaden's family are being fully supported and kept updated by our team. ""This is a truly heartbreaking time for them and we are doing everything we can to find out who was responsible for Jaden's death."" Moped crash boy, 14, stabbed to death Jaden, who police said lived in the area with his mother, is believed to be the youngest victim to die on London's streets in the past year. There were 132 homicides in 2018, the highest total since 2008. Police have not said whether they believe the murder was gang-related. The teenager and his mother had recently moved to London from Nottingham to be closer to some of his family. His godmother, Zoe Grant, described him as ""full of life, fun loving and a ray of sunshine"". ""He was a beautiful boy, so intelligent and had everything to live for,"" she said. Marcellus Baz, who was Jaden's youth worker when he lived in Nottingham, said the schoolboy's death was ""absolutely shocking"". The teenager was knocked off the moped at about 18:30 GMT on Tuesday Det Ch Insp Soole said additional police officers were in the area and members of the public were being encouraged to talk to them about any concerns they had, or to share information they think could help enquiries. ""I would urge anyone who has information about those responsible but who has not yet made contact with police to do so straight away. ""If you do not want to speak to police, please contact Crimestoppers, 100% anonymously,"" he said.

Opposition leader named DR Congo president,"Mr Tshisekedi is the son of the late veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi Opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi has won DR Congo's presidential election, electoral officials say. The announcement, made overnight, sparked accusations of an ""electoral coup"" from runner-up Martin Fayulu. The Catholic Church said that the result did not match data collected by its election monitors. The ruling party, whose candidate finished third, has not yet contested the result, prompting allegations of a power-sharing deal with Mr Tshisekedi. It is an accusation Mr Tshisekedi's team denies. If confirmed, Mr Tshisekedi will be the first opposition challenger to win since the DR Congo gained independence in 1960. Current President Joseph Kabila is stepping down after 18 years in office. Africa Live: Follow the latest updates The divisive aftermath of Tshisekedi's victory Church observers question DR Congo results Tshisekedi steps out of his father's shadow The capital Kinshasa and other key cities appeared calm on Thursday, but fears remain that the announcement of the result could trigger unrest. UN chief Antonio Guterres appealed for all parties to refrain from violence. In the early hours of Thursday the head of DR Congo's National Electoral Commission (Ceni), Corneille Nangaa, said Mr Tshisekedi had received 38.5% of the vote in the 30 December election and had been ""provisionally declared the elected president"". The full results were, with turnout reportedly 48%: Felix Tshisekedi - 7 million votes Martin Fayulu - 6.4 million votes Emmanuel Shadary - 4.4 million votes The result can still be challenged. Mr Tshisekedi vowed to be ""the president of all DR Congolese"", saying: ""No-one could have imagined such a scenario whereby an opposition candidate would emerge victorious."" He struck a conciliatory tone with Mr Kabila when addressing supporters at his Union for Democracy and Social Progress party headquarters in Kinshasa. ""I pay tribute to President Joseph Kabila and today we should no longer see him as an adversary, but rather, a partner in democratic change in our country,"" he said. A spokesman for Mr Shadary, who had been Mr Kabila's hand-picked candidate and was expected to win, accepted the defeat, saying ""the Congolese people have chosen and democracy has triumphed"". Martin Fayulu said the results had ""nothing to do with the truth"" Mr Fayulu's supporters say this backs their suspicion Mr Tshisekedi has cut a power-sharing deal with Mr Kabila. Mr Tshisekedi's spokesman, Louis d'Or Ngalamulume, said there was ""never any deal"". The BBC's Africa editor, Fergal Keane, says Mr Tshisekedi is seen by many as the opposition candidate least objectionable to President Kabila and that it is perhaps significant that neither Mr Kabila nor his party have so far voiced any objection to the result. Mr Fayulu, a former oil tycoon, said the results had ""nothing to do with the truth"". ""The Congolese people will never accept such a fraud,"" he told the BBC, adding: ""Felix Tshisekedi never got 7 million votes. Where did he get them from?"" He said the electoral commission and ruling party had made up the figures to give Mr Tshisekedi -  their ""protÃ©gÃ©"" - victory. The influential Catholic Church, which posted 40,000 observers to monitor the election, issued a statement on Thursday saying the result given by the electoral commission did not correspond with its own findings. The statement mentions no-one by name and urges all parties to observe their civic duty and refrain from violence. Our correspondent, Fergal Keane, says the Church may now be publicly doubting the results but it will be very wary of any public demonstrations. Earlier, French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian told CNews: ""We must have clarity on these results, which are the opposite to what we expected."" Former colonial power Belgium has also expressed doubts about the result. Analysis by Fergal Keane, BBC News, in Kinshasa Given the deeply polarised nature of politics here, any result was going to leave a divisive aftermath. Whether Mr Tshisekedi has the intention or the capacity to challenge the powerful hold Mr Kabila enjoys over the army, security services and key ministries will determine whether politics has really entered a new era.  He has already spoken of working with Mr Kabila to ensure the success of democracy. For Mr Fayulu there are difficulties, too. How does he decide to react? The most likely route for the moment is to try to challenge the result within the 10-day period parties are allowed under the law. Given the closeness of the vote, his supporters will point to claims of irregularities in several areas. Significantly the Church and civil society have called on citizens to avoid becoming involved in violence - a recognition of the dangers involved in street protests while facing security forces with a reputation for heavy-handedness.

He took over from his assassinated father Laurent in 2001. Elected in 2006, Joseph Kabila secured another term in controversial elections in 2011. He was barred from running for another term under the constitution, and was supposed to step down two years ago, but the election was postponed after the electoral commission said it needed more time to register voters.

Some HRT tablets 'higher clot risk' link,"Women taking certain types of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tablets could be more at risk from serious blood clots - although the overall risk is low, BMJ research suggests. It found tablets containing equine oestrogen were linked with a slightly higher risk than other tablets. And patches and gels for HRT were the safest but were underused. GPs' leaders said HRT treatments were tailored to meet the needs of individual patients. They said women should not panic or stop taking HRT. Instead, they should discuss any concerns at their next routine GP appointment. HRT is used to relieve symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes and night sweats, by replacing hormones that are at a lower level. The treatments come in a number of different forms, including tablets, gels, cream and patches. Most experts agree that HRT is a good and safe treatment - but there are some small potential risks, asNHS UK advice,externalexplains. These include a small increased risk of certain serious health problems, such as blood clots and breast cancer. This study,external, by University of Nottingham researchers, said the increased risk of taking HRT tablets was equivalent to nine extra cases of blood clots per 10,000 women per year. The study looked at the prescription records of 80,000 women aged 40-79 who had developed blood clots and compared them with records of 390,000 women who had not. For tablet treatments, the risk was found to differ for two types of oestrogens. The risk of blood clots was 15% higher for the treatments containing oestrogen manufactured from horse urine than for the synthetic oestradiol, for both single and combined hormone treatments. But there was no such risk for women using gels, patches or creams for HRT - also called transdermal treatment. The study said this was the safest type of HRT and yet it appeared to be underused, with just 20% of prescriptions for this type of therapy. According to the Royal College of GPs, most local NHS groups suggest prescribing tablets as a first-line treatment, unless medical issues suggest otherwise. Dr Yana Vinogradova, from Nottingham's school of medicine, said: ""Our study has shown that, for oral treatments, different tablets are associated with different risks of developing blood clots, depending on the active components. ""It has also confirmed that risks of thrombosis for patients using HRT treatments other than tablets [patches or gels] is very low."" She added: ""Our findings are particularly important information for women who require HRT treatment and are already at increased risk of developing blood clots."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said the observational study was ""interesting"" but could not prove that cases of blood clots - or deep vein thrombosis - had been caused by the tablets. ""As such, it is essential that more research is conducted in this area and taken into account as new clinical guidelines are updated and developed,"" she said. She said current practice was to prescribe the lowest possible dose of HRT for the shortest possible time. This happened after ""a comprehensive discussion between the GP and their patient"", she said, when treatments were tailored to meet the best interests of each individual. ""It's important that patients don't panic or stop taking HRT as a result of reading about this study but instead discuss their concerns at their next routine GP appointment or seek advice from a reputable website likeNHS Choices,external,"" Prof Stokes-Lampard said. Dr June Raine, from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said details of the risks were included in the prescribing information for all HRT products. ""Previous studies have suggested a lower risk of blood clots with transdermal patches than with oral tablets, but these studies have included too few women using transdermal patches to allow firm conclusions to be drawn."" She added: ""Any new significant information on the efficacy or safety of HRT tablets will be carefully reviewed and the information provided to healthcare professionals, and patients will be updated if appropriate.""

Shops saw 'worst Christmas in a decade',"There were a number of discounts in stores in the run-up to Christmas Retail sales were flat in December, as UK businesses experienced their worst Christmas in a decade, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Total retail sales showed 0% year-on-year growth during the month, the worst December performance since 2008. The BRC said price cuts appeared not to have been enough to encourage shoppers. A separate report from Barclaycard said consumer spending grew 1.8% year-on-year in December, the lowest rate of growth seen since March 2016. Esme Harwood, director at Barclaycard, said: ""Growth in consumer spending dropped to its lowest level since 2016 and represents a decline in real terms."" She added that consumers ""remain cautious amidst ongoing economic uncertainty"". Christmas retail winners and losers The BRC report came out on the same day as trading updates from some of the nation's biggest retailers. Debenhams reported a fall in salesduring the crucial Christmas trading period.  In a ""volatile"" environment with customers seeking discounts, Debenhams reported a 5.7% fall in like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to 5 January. Marks & Spencer saw its sales dropover the Christmas holiday period. Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, were down 2.2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. Food sales fell 2.1% and its clothing and home sales division slid 2.4%. Tesco appeared to buck the gloomy trend, saying trading over the Christmas period had been ""strong"". The company, which is the UK's biggest supermarket chain, says its like-for-like sales over Christmas in the core UK area were up 2.2% in the six weeks to 5 January. John Lewis said sales in the seven-weekChristmas period were 1.4% higher than for the same period last year. However, that may not be enough to secure a bonus for its staff this year, the firm added. Halfords issued a profits warning.  It said that that consumer confidence could remain weak into next year, hitting its operating profit. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""Squeezed consumers chose not to splash out this Christmas, with retail sales growth stalling for the first time in 28 months. ""The worst December sales performance in 10 years means a challenging start to 2019 for retailers, with business rates set to rise once again this year, and the threat of a no-deal Brexit looming ever larger."" This video can not be played Shoppers in Nottingham reveal whether they spent more or less this Christmas The BRC said that on a like-for-like basis, UK retail sales decreased by 0.7% from December 2017. Ms Dickinson said the retail landscape was ""changing dramatically"" in the UK, while the trading environment remained tough. She added: ""Retailers are facing up to this challenge, but are having to wrestle with mounting costs from a succession of government policies - from the apprenticeship levy, to higher wage costs, to rising business rates."" And Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said retail sales had stagnated despite some retailers' best efforts to generate sales through price cuts. ""Growth in food did provide a glimmer of hope, being among the few categories to notice an uptick,"" he added. ""However, the continued contrast in performance between the High Street and online remained evident in December - albeit 2018 did also see a continued slowdown in online retail sales.""

Phantom drives Rolls-Royce to record sales,"Rolls-Royce Motor Cars sold a record number of cars last year, with sales driven by the new eighth-generation Phantom model. The BMW-owned company sold a total of 4,107 vehicles, a rise of 5% on its previous record in 2014. Roll-Royce, which exports more than 90% of its production, said sales grew in all regions. The company's boss said he was confident about 2019 ""as long as it doesn't come to a hard Brexit"". The results come amid a difficult market for the UK car industry. Sales in the UK were sharply lower last year, and production for export has also fallen steeplyaccording to recent figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT),external. However, Rolls-Royce chief executive Torsten MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s said: ""We are in the luxury goods business. We have clients who have multiple cars in their garages, nobody needs a Rolls-Royce to get from A to B. ""You are commissioning a piece of art when you commission a Rolls-Royce."" But he said the 115-year old firm was also ""affected by consumer sentiment changes. We are not immune against any recessionary tendencies, so for that reason I'm also cautiously observing what's happening in the world"". The Americas remained the biggest market for Rolls-Royce last year, accounting for 30% of sales. Sales in China, which accounts for 20% of sales, continued to bounce back, rising by 40% in 2018 compared with 2017. And about 10%, or 400 cars, were sold in the UK market. The Phantom ""helped quite massively"" in delivering that performance said Mr MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s. The new Phantom, which came on the market at the beginning of 2018, was not the best-selling model but it was the ""growth driver"" said Mr MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s. The Ghost was the top-selling model. Overall, sales of Rolls-Royce vehicles were up 20% compared with 2017, however, the Phantom was absent from the market during that year ahead of the launch of the new model at the beginning of 2018. Rolls-Royce has previously announced preparations for a hard Brexit. It has brought forward its annual summer shut down to the first two weeks of April, immediately after the UK is due to leave the EU. It has expanded storage space for parts and looked at alternative routes for logistics. Mr MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s said he was confident about 2019 ""given that there are no major disruptions happening worldwide"". ""We urge the government to avoid a hard Brexit by all means,"" he added.

Will insect-eating dogs help climate change?,"Do you fret that your pet pooch is blamed by environmentalists for turning rainforests into poo in the park? Have no fear - you can now fatten Fido on black soldier flies instead of Brazilian beef. A pet food manufacturer now claims that 40% of its new product is made from soldier flies. It's one of many firms hoping to cash in on the backlash against beef by people concerned that the cattle are fed on soya. These soya plantations are responsible for the release of greenhouse gases in significant quantities. The key question is whether a diet of 40% soldier flies meets the nutritional needs of your beloved canine. We put the question to a pet diet expert at the Royal Veterinary College, Aarti Kathrani. Her conclusion was a cautious ""yes"". ""Insects can be a very useful source of protein,"" she told us. ""More studies are needed to show how much of these nutrients can actually be absorbed by a dog's body - but some studies suggest that insects can provide nutrients for dogs."" At first sight it seems obvious that feeding your dog meaty food is bad for the environment. The link between humans eating meat and the allied emissions of CO2 and methane is well established - and pets are estimated to eat 20% of global meat. It's also true that flies produce protein much more efficiently than cows - using a small percentage of the water and land. But actually the analysis is more subtle than that - because as societies become more wealthy, people often turn to muscle meat and reject the animal's offal. The flies are brought to maturity in about 14 days That offal is just as nutritious - and it gets made into pet food. That means that dog food is just as sustainable - or unsustainable - as humans eating meat. In fact, if dogs were weaned off meat and on to insects, the industry would have to find another purpose for the offal.  More sausage, perhaps? Or more humans eating insect protein. Or more going vegan? Dogs are omnivores - they eat more or less anything. Cats are much more choosy, because they can't make an essential amino acid, taurine. They find it instead in meat and fish. But Dr Kathrani says studies show that insects do contain taurine, so it's possible that insects could also form a useful part of the moggie diet. The new product is from Yora,  a UK start-up. The insect grubs are fed on food waste in the Netherlands. There are several competitors which also produce pet food incorporating fly protein. They include Insectdog, Entomapetfood, Chippin and Wilderharrier.

The company, which is the UK's biggest supermarket chain, said its like-for-like sales over Christmas in the core UK area were up 2.2% in the six weeks to 5 January. John Lewis said sales in the seven-weekChristmas period were 1.4% higher than for the same period last year. However, that may not be enough to secure a bonus for its staff this year, the firm added. Halfords issued a profits warning after sales fell 1.7% for the 14 weeks to 4 January. The cycling and car maintenance company blamed mild winter weather in November and December, plus weak consumer confidence. Sales at discount retailer B&M fell 1.6% in the 13 weeks to 29 December after a ""disappointing"" November. This video can not be played Shoppers in Nottingham reveal whether they spent more or less this Christmas Debenhams reported that like-for-like sales, which strip out changes to stores, over the 18 weeks to 5 January fell 5.7%. In the shorter trading period, the six weeks to 5 January, like-for-like sales  were down 3.4%. The founder of Sports Direct Mike Ashley has been taking an increased interest in the struggling retailer. Sports Direct already owns a near 30% stake in Debenhams and has offered a further Â£40m investment. Debenhams rebuffed his approach, but said all options remain open. In the meantime, Debenhams will postpone the possible sale of other parts of its business, including its successful operations in Denmark. But the company did not rule out a Company Voluntary Arrangement, under which it could close more stores, cut rent bills and reorganise its debts. By Dominic O'Connell, business presenter, Today Programme While we all get excited about the Christmas sales figures, they are not the whole story. All the companies reporting have spoken about a tough trading environment with widespread discounting, which means turning sales into profits will be difficult - and that those that did not join the race for sales too enthusiastically may be better off in the long-term. M&S may not have shot the lights out when it comes to sales growth, but it said it saw no reason to change its full-year profits forecast. John Lewis, however warned that profits this year would not be as good as last, and that it might not pay out its traditional annual bonus to its staff. The last time it did not pay out was in 1953. And Debenhams said it was in talks with its lenders, and was looking to bring ""new sources of funding"".  It did not say where that money would come from, but it has already shunned an offer of support from Mike Ashley. The Christmas trading period has simply reinforced what we already knew about the health of the High Street - that trading is tough, that those with decent online operations enjoy some degree of protection from that tough trading environment, and that the great High Street shakeout that has already claimed Maplins, Toys R Us and others may have only just begun. In October, when Debenhams published full-year results,it reported a record annual lossand said it would close up to 50 of its 165 branches. Some of its remaining stores are being refitted to boost trading. Nine stores so far have been revamped, with Stevenage the best performer among them, the firm said. This video can not be played Why shopping on the High Street needs to become an 'experience' Mr Bucher said the improvement in the redesigned stores demonstrated his attempt to turn around the business was making progress. ""We have worked hard to deliver the best possible outcome in very uncertain times for retailers. We responded to a significant increase in promotional activity in the market, particularly in key seasonal categories, in order to remain competitive for our customers,"" he said. Online sales rose 6% in the six-week Christmas trading period, after what Debenhams described as ""slow start to the season"". It said this meant there had been two-year online growth of over 20%.

General election 'answer to Brexit deadlock',"Mrs May said the deal was in the national interest at a press conference on Thursday Theresa May has spoken to the leaders of two of the biggest unions in the UK as she continues to try to build support for her Brexit deal. The PM spoke to Unite's Len McCluskey and the GMB's Tim Roache by phone on Thursday in what her spokesman described as ""constructive"" calls. He said Mrs May was undertaking ""widespread engagement"" about the deal. Mr Roache said he was glad the PM had ""finally picked up the phone"" but that her deal was not ""good enough"". ""If the deal genuinely did the job for GMB members, our union would support it, but it doesn't,"" he said. ""It's clear more time is required, we need to extend Article 50 and ultimately give the final say on Brexit to the public."" Laura Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics? Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn calls for election over Brexit World against no-deal Brexit - Japan PM Mrs May also spoke to John Allan, president of the CBI business lobby group, as MPs continue to debate the EU withdrawal agreement her government has negotiated with the EU, ahead of next Tuesday's vote. She has also met some Labour MPs as she continues efforts to build support for the deal, which more than 100 of her own MPs have said they will oppose. Asked if she was still ruling out Labour's policy of a permanent customs union with the EU, after talking to the party's MPs and union leaders, she her deal would deliver an ""ambitious"" trading arrangements with the EU and allow the UK to strike trade deals around the world. At a press conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, she said her deal was in the national interest ""because it's a good deal and therefore I hope that it will get wide support across the whole of Parliament"". Speaking alongside Mrs May in Downing Street, Mr Abe said  his country was in ""total support"" of Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement and wanted to ""invest more into your country and to enjoy further economic growth with the UK"". ""That is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the whole wish of the whole world,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

It has emerged that the government is considering backing an amendment from Labour Leave supporter John Mann, giving extra protections to workers and the environment, in a bid to win support. A number of Labour MPs in Leave-supporting constituencies back Mr Mann's amendment, which the MP said would open up the opportunity for other improvements to the prime minister's deal. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for an election over Brexit A spokesman for the prime minister said it was something they would ""consider very seriously"", adding that the government had ""a long standing commitment to strong labour protections"". Mr Mann told BBC News his amendment would make it more likely for him to back the deal, but admitted it didn't mean other Labour MPs would be ""rushing"" to do the same. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party did not ""accept or endorse"" what was on offer in the proposed amendment. He said it has already been ""quite clearly and emphatically rejected"" by leading trade unions. By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason The prime minister is hitting the phones - and the people on the other end are not regular recipients of telephonic greetings from Downing Street. So what's happening? Theresa May is reaching out. Her proposed Brexit deal needs friends, and if that means phoning people who wouldn't count as such politically, then so be it. The response from the trades unions has been less than gushing.  One source told me they amounted to ""eleventh hour, ten minute calls."" But, at the very least, it means Mrs May can say she is listening. Even if those on the other end of the line don't like what they are hearing. Greener UK - a group of 14 environmental organisations working on Brexit, including the RSPB and the Woodland Trust - said the aim of Mr Mann's amendment was ""commendable"", but it was not enough ""to prevent a weakening of environmental protections or standards"". Meanwhile, during the second of five days of debate on the deal, Conservative MP George Freeman has told MPs he will now vote for it, having previously said he could not support it. He said it ""wasn't perfect"" and he hoped there would be more concessions. Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Brexit and the timetable for a 'Plan B' But he added: ""I will, with a heavy heart on Tuesday, vote for this deal because we are now in the dying stages and no-deal is unconscionable. But I beg colleagues to ask their front benches to work together across the house in pursuit of something we can all be proud of."" The government has lost two Brexit votes in two days. The first defeatlimits the government's financial powersin the event of a no-deal departure. The second forces the PM to announcenew plans within three daysif her deal fails in the Commons. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP which has helped the government win votes since June 2017, haswarned the PM her deal is ""already dead"". In a sign that the party has not been swayed by the government's promise togive the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto,externalover any new EU regulations introduced under the terms of the proposed backstop arrangement, she accused Mrs May of ""wasting time"". Senior Conservatives have continued to express opposition to the withdrawal agreement and declaration on future relations, negotiated by Mrs May in November. The Labour Party will oppose Mrs May's deal next week, and push for a vote of no confidence if it is rejected by MPs, as Mr Corbyn believes that a general election is the most democratic way of breaking the Brexit deadlock. The DUP says it will support the government in any confidence vote if the Brexit deal is rejected, making a defeat less likely. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"America, China, and tech's next step","Huawei may not have any keynote speakers at CES, but the Chinese tech giant is still very much present In a corner of the Las Vegas Convention Center, a row of Huawei Mate 20 smartphones are lined up, sparkling, for CES delegates to try out. It's a typical scene at the trade show but one made slightly surreal by the fact that few Americans will likely ever own these phones. Right now, US networks don't offer any Huawei smartphones, because US security services are worried they could be used for Chinese surveillance. And yet, Huawei has still decided to promote itself at CES in some force - at a time when the company's chief financial officer faces possible extradition to the US over accusations of bank fraud. And in a climate where US-China trade relations are at boiling point. ""It makes business sense for them to come here,"" says Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES. ""Because they can meet their buyers from all around the world. So they want to be here."" But Mr Shapiro may be putting on a bit of a brave face. There are significant indications that some of the best-known Chinese companies have, for this year at least, taken a step back from America's premier tech event. Shenzhen-based ZTE, which had been at CES every year since 2011, was nowhere to be found at this year's show, despite being originally listed as an exhibitor. It has offered no explanation as to why, but last year Donald Trump signed an order that said ZTE equipment must not be used by the US government, or any company that wants to do public work. US-China trade relations are currently experiencing a rough patch While Huawei does have a large stand, no executives are in attendance - a contrast to last year when Richard Yu, one of the firm's most senior figures,was a keynote speaker. This year, not a single Chinese company executive is expected to speak at the show. More broadly, the CTA says it's too early to know whether the precise number of exhibitors from China is up or down on last year, until it carries out its audit of attendees. It did tell the BBC, however, that in terms of physical floor space, the amount of room taken up by Chinese companies is roughly the same as 2018 - approximately 13-14% of the entire show. The likes of Alibaba, JD.com, Lenovo and DJI are all in prime locations. Earlier this month, a shockwave ripped through the technology industry:Apple announced that its revenues would be significantly lowerwhen it reports its next quarterly earnings. Chief executive Tim Cook blamed China's economic volatility, and suggested looming US-China trade tariffs are already having an effect. Most analysts predict Apple will not be alone in reporting signs of strain. After all, fewer iPhones sold means fewer iPhones made in China. The complex tangle of supply chains and components sourced from all over the world in some respects makes the notion of an ""American"" or ""Chinese"" phone rather absurd. It's why all technology companies are looking very closely at the outcome of talks between Washington and Beijing. If the two sides are unable to strike a deal by 1 March, the tariffs will be in place. If that happens, the business world will be reassuring itself that a change in leadership might repair the damage. ""I have to say the [Trump] administration's part of the current tensions,"" says Frank Gillet, an analyst with Forrester Research. ""So, if that administration changes then we're going to have a reset."" More from CES 2019: Amazon and Google voice assistants carve up CES The expanding door that fights parcel thieves LG's see-through and vibrating OLED TVs Even if the trade dispute dissipates, what isn't going anywhere is the growing atmosphere of suspicion between these two global superpowers over how they use their new technology. This is coming to a head now because of the significant progress made by the Chinese tech industry over the past decade. It has shaken off its reputation as just a source of cheap, high-quality manufacturing, or as an irritating imitator of Western creativity. Huawei took ""Made in China"" and made it ""Designed in China"". High-quality, genuine innovation and a price point that often came in significantly below comparable efforts from Apple. Chinese smartphone makers have become increasingly competitive, with Xiaomi for example offering a 5G-ready device This has disrupted the smartphone world order. Huawei is currently second only to Samsung when it comes to global smartphone sales. Other Chinese brands like ZTE and Xiaomi are also selling well. Smartphones are just the start. One of the next major innovations is the mass adoption of 5G, a technology that should offer 20 times the download speeds of 4G mobile networks. To get there will require vast amounts of new networking infrastructure - and Huawei has positioned itself as a dominant - if not the dominant - supplier of equipment worldwide. ""Huawei is the only true supplier in 5G,"" says Huawei's security spokesman, Andy Purdy. ""Everyone is else is playing catch-up."" The US government has blocked the use of Huawei's 5G equipment in the country, and has reportedly urged other allies to do the same. Other Chinese firms are subject to bans as well. Huawei feels the move is anti-competitive. ""From the beginning of 2018 there's been a global drumbeat of hostility by the United States government against Huawei,"" Mr Purdy argues. He adds that current political posturing is preventing progress from being made. Some Chinese manufacturers feel the Trump administration is harming their business ""It's clear to us that whatever real cyber-security concerns exist regarding products, they can be addressed. But we have to have the conversations to address them."" Mr Purdy argues that globally many countries have embraced Huawei's technology - including the UK, which utilise Huawei products across So will the US ever be fully open to China's business? It's a question that is becoming harder to answer as China graduates into what is now a hub of innovation that is surpassing the progress of the West in profound ways. When so much of the future is about how we capture and crunch personal data, breakthrough moments in technology - which we look for at CES - are less tangible. The next big thing may not be a product, but a philosophy. What's more important to a prosperous society: innovation or liberty? ""The Chinese attitude towards privacy is actually helping them advance much more quickly,"" Mr Shapiro says. ""I would defend our European and American approach on liberty and individual rights. But I also think it has to be balanced against the need for innovation and competition.""

Judge dismisses Judd's Weinstein claim,"Ashley Judd can still proceed with her claim that Harvey Weinstein tried to sabotage her career A sexual harassment claim brought by actress Ashley Judd against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been dismissed by a court in California. But the judge said she could still pursue a defamation claim that Mr Weinstein sabotaged her career. Mr Weinstein has been accused by more than 75 women of varying degrees of sexual misconduct going back decades - allegations he denies. He has been charged with five counts of sexual abuse, including rape. The disgraced producer - who denies the charges, which were brought by two women - will stand trial in New York later this year. Where does the Weinstein case go from here? How the Weinstein scandal unfolded Who has accused Weinstein of what? Ashley Judd was one of Mr Weinstein's original accusers. Her sexual harassment lawsuit was re-filed following a change in California state law after her initial claim was rejected by Judge Gutierrez in a Los Angeles federal court last September. She alleges she rejected unwanted advances from him and he then tried to wreck her career. But in a statement late on Wednesday, Judge Gutierrez said the law that deals with sexual misconduct claims in professional relationships, which was revised to include directors and producers, could not be applied retrospectively to Ms Judd's case. This video can not be played Judd: I was not frightened of Weinstein However, Ms Judd's claim that the Oscar-winning producer ""blackballed"" her after she refused his advances would still be heard, Judge Gutierrez said. That part of her lawsuit states that ""Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms Judd's reputation and limit her ability to find work"". In 2017, Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson said he had been considering Ms Judd for a role in the 2002 film but that she was ""blacklisted"" following conversations with the Weinstein Company. He said that Mr Weinstein had warned him that the actress was a ""nightmare"" to work with. Mr Weinstein, however, said he had no role in Mr Jackson's casting and denied trying to derail Ms Judd's career. Ms Judd's lawyer Theodore Boutrous said of Wednesday's court ruling that it would not prevent her ""moving forward on multiple claims"". ""While we respectfully disagree with the Court's decision as to the one claim it ruled on today, we look forward to pursuing the three claims for relief that the Court has already ruled can move forward,"" he added. Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Phyllis Kupferstein, welcomed the judge's decision. ""We have said from the beginning that this claim was unjustified, and we are pleased that the court saw it as we did,"" she said in a statement, adding: ""We believe that we will ultimately prevail on her [Ms Judd's] remaining claims.""

Alexa and Google Assistant carve up CES,"Alexa and Google Assistant aren't clamouring to be heard, they're clamouring to be spoken to At CES, there's no shortage of gadgets to talk to. Smart TVs, cars, pianos - and even a toilet - these are just some examples of devices that come with voice-activated helpers. No matter who makes the hardware, the virtual aide linked to or packaged inside is likely to be one of two: either Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant. ForShadeCraft,external, the maker of a new device that lets garden parasols be controlled by voice, Alexa was simply more straight-forward to build in. ""It was much easier and simpler to integrate,"" explains chief executive Armen Gharabegian. ""But we have been testing Google voice as well."" At last, a parasol you can talk to Users can ask Alexa to open or close the sunshades mechanically, or play music via Bloom's speakers. But ShadeCraft wants to integrate Alexa completely, so that the parasol behaves just like an Amazon Echo smart speaker. Voice commands such as ordering Amazon products or asking what the weather will be like could then be done from the patio as well as the living room. Amazon has made it hassle-free to add Alexa to products, byoffering the assistant on a single chip,external- the Alexa Connect Kit. It has been available for a few months now, but at CES Googlejust announced their equivalent tool with a strikingly,externalsimilar name - Google Assistant Connect. However, any product using that chip will have to wirelessly connect to a Google smart device, which will process voice data. Roland has showcased a digital piano that also houses Alexa Still, in time, Bloom customers may be able to choose to talk to Google Assistant instead of Alexa. ""I think that we are perfectly positioned to be the extension of the AI hub outdoors,"" said Mr Gharabegian. More from CES 2019: The expanding door that fights parcel thieves LG's see-through and vibrating OLED TVs IBM's hourly weather reports will cover entire Earth The benefit of this would be to give users access to the particular functionality offered by different virtual helpers. Google Assistant, for example, tends to be better at answering queries about the wider world than Alexa. It also has exclusive access to some of the search firm's other products, letting users control Chromecast audio streams or display YouTube and Google Maps on devices with screens. Alexa, by contrast, is more widely supported by third-party products and has more apps. Another firm that thinks its customers may be best at deciding how to interact verbally with its devices is Sonos. It has shown off a prototype smart speaker that allows users to select either Alexa or Google Assistant, though it isn't possible to activate them both at the same time. Part of the problem is that interacting with multiple virtual helpers through one device could get confusing. ""Say an alarm goes off on the speaker,""writes Dieter Bohn at tech site The Verge,external. ""You might not know whether it was Alexa or Google that set it off, and you'd be stuck guessing which one to ask to stop while it beeps."" Google Assistant is also on a mission to conquer your home However, in time, people may well become accustomed to using both assistants interchangeably, and even others like Apple's Siri or Samsung's Bixby, depending on what they want to do. ""[Consumers] will be entrenched in one of those ecosystems and so the manufacturer of appliances is not going to want to lose sales to consumers who prefer one of them,"" says Ross Rubin at market analystsReticle Research,external. But for now the land grab is everything, which is why executives at Amazon must be feeling pleased with Alexa's progress. Amazon is estimated to have41% of the global smart speaker market,externalwhile Google comes in second, taking 28%. Alexa's dominance is visible across a wide range of other products too. ""Alexa had made the first-mover advantage and for a few years, that was the dominant integration technology at CES,"" explains Mr Rubin. ""Google has stepped up its presence year after year."" There are signs everywhere at CES that Alexa is still top dog in the voice assistant space Some, though, remain sceptical that voice assistants add much value to most products. ""They're putting Alexa in everything and I'm getting a little bit tired of it,"" one user-interface specialist from a major car-maker told the BBC at CES. ""If I want to open my toilet why should I tell Alexa to open my toilet instead of opening it myself?"" The specialist, who wishes to remain anonymous, noted how the ""sheer force"" of Amazon's marketing was particularly noticeable at the tech trade show this year. One other CES attendee concurred, tweeting:,external""To say that Amazon Alexa is everywhere at CES in Las Vegas would be an understatement."" Mr Rubin thinks that there are certain gadgets where the benefit of hands-free control does make sense. Take kitchen appliances, for instance. Instead of trying to finger a recipe book or smartphone with - literally - butter fingers, you can ask a voice assistant to call out the directions or repeat something if you need to hear it again. Google and Amazon have both deployed small armies of promoters to answer questions about their products The hands-free use case applies to Focals - a new range of stylish smart glasses made byToronto-based firm North,external. Focals project a colour display into the wearer's eyeball by bouncing it off the lens to create a hologram-like visual in the right eye. This is used to relay text messages or directions to a place, for instance. ""The result that you get is a small transparent display that sits about an arm's length in front of you,"" says spokesman Alexander Ingram. With Alexa and a speaker on board, there's another option - just listen to the information instead. North received investment from Amazon and so has built Alexa into Focals - but Mr Ingram says there are no plans to keep the glasses as an Alexa-only product. ""By being able to take these assistants out of the home and into the world, that just opens up a huge range of new applications,"" he said. North's Focals smart glasses are designed to look just like normal glasses There is another way to bring voice activation to a product without having to rely on one of the tech giants' assistants. Snips,externallets firms build their own voice tools that run solely on the devices they were intended for. So, if you want to make a coffee machine that simply responds to a handful of crucial commands, it would be an option. What's more, by not relying on Amazon's or Google's servers, users would not need to bother connecting their new coffee machine to the cloud before asking it for a cappuccino. And that avoids the risk of a cyber-security scandal or other privacy issue. ""This kind of information should stay in your home, it should not go elsewhere, to a server on the opposite side of the world,"" said the firm's vice president of product, Sebastien Maury.

MPs want hunger minister role introduced,"The MPs are concerned about the impact of hunger on children A group of MPs want the government to introduce a Minister for Hunger to respond to a growth in food insecurity in the UK - especially among children. The Environmental Audit Committee highlighted 2017 Unicef figures showing 19% of children under 15 in the UK live with adults who struggle to buy food. It says ministers have failed to recognise and respond to the problem. The government says the number of children living in workless households is at a record low. But MPs say the number of people without reliable access to affordable, nutritious food is ""significant and growing"", with the unemployed, sick or those with children most likely to be affected. The committee wants to see the appointment of a new minister with ""responsibility and accountability for combating hunger and food insecurity within the UK"". The job would involve exploring the scale, causes and impact of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and implementing strategies to improve the situation. Jo Millner works at a food bank but also struggles to feed her own family ""It's all very well having a Minister for Hunger but they need someone who is normal,"" says Jo Millner, who lives in York with her husband and 6-year-old-son. She volunteers at a food bank and community hub, and her husband works full-time in two jobs, but they still struggle to feed their family. ""[The government] don't have a clue what's happening on the ground. They don't see people crying their eyes out because they can't afford to buy a bag of pasta,"" she says. After paying their mortgage, Jo, 43, says there's often no money left for food and the family relies on food banks and support from her mother to survive. ""We pretty much live on pasta and rice,"" she says. ""We can't afford much fresh fruit and veg apart from what we get at the food bank. What we do get goes to our son because he needs to grow up healthy."" She says most of the people her food bank helps are working - but many are on insecure contracts or only working a few hours a week. ""The government wants people in work but then you are penalised for being in work and lose your benefits,"" she says. ""I'm working with a woman at the moment who has just gone from a 22-hour contract to a 30-hour contract and she's actually worse off because now she doesn't get school meals paid for."" ""We need to get all the different ministers to work together to tackle poverty,"" she adds. ""The whole system is broken."" The committee's report also suggests a close relationship between hunger and obesity. ""Insufficient access to food may lead to risk-averse purchasing habits and prioritisation of low-priced, filling foods with long shelf lives - which are often nutrient poor but calorie-rich,"" the report says. A spokeswoman for the Department of Work and Pensions said that, since 2010, one million people had been lifted out of absolute poverty - including 300,000 children. ""Household incomes have never been higher and the number of children living in workless households is at a record low, but we know there's more to do ensure that every family has access to nutritious, healthy food,"" she said. ""We already provide support through free school meals and ourHealthy Start Vouchers."",external Poor pupils 'filling pockets with food' Holiday hunger cash a 'great first step' Fighting holiday hunger in Birkenhead But Labour MP Mary Creagh, who is chairwoman of the committee, said more children were growing up in homes where parents do not have enough money to put food on the table. ""The combination of high living costs, stagnating wages and often, the roll-out of Universal Credit and the wider benefits system, means that levels of hunger in Britain are some of the highest across Europe. ""We found that nearly one in five children under 15 are living in a food insecure home - a scandal which cannot be allowed to continue."" Ms Creagh said urgent action was needed. ""This can only be addressed by setting clear UK-wide targets and by appointing a Minister for Hunger to deliver them."" Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which runs more than 420 food banks across the UK, welcomed the idea of a hunger minister. ""It's time for the government to take concrete steps towards a UK where everyone has enough money for food,"" she said. ""Although food bank volunteers are providing vital support to those in crisis, no charity can replace people having enough money for the basics. ""To end hunger, we need to understand the true scale of the challenge, and work across government to ensure everyone is anchored from being swept into poverty.""

Opposition named winner in DR Congo poll,"Mr Tshisekedi is the son of the late veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi Opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi has won DR Congo's presidential election, electoral officials say. The announcement, made overnight, sparked accusations of an ""electoral coup"" from runner-up Martin Fayulu. The Catholic Church said that the result did not match data collected by its election monitors. The ruling party, whose candidate finished third, has not yet contested the result, prompting allegations of a power-sharing deal with Mr Tshisekedi. It is an accusation Mr Tshisekedi's team denies. If confirmed, Mr Tshisekedi will be the first opposition challenger to win since the DR Congo gained independence in 1960. Current President Joseph Kabila is stepping down after 18 years in office. Africa Live: Follow the latest updates The divisive aftermath of Tshisekedi's victory Church observers question DR Congo results Tshisekedi steps out of his father's shadow The capital Kinshasa and other key cities appeared calm on Thursday, but fears remain that the announcement of the result could trigger unrest. UN chief Antonio Guterres appealed for all parties to refrain from violence. In the early hours of Thursday the head of DR Congo's National Electoral Commission (Ceni), Corneille Nangaa, said Mr Tshisekedi had received 38.5% of the vote in the 30 December election and had been ""provisionally declared the elected president"". The full results were, with turnout reportedly 48%: Felix Tshisekedi - 7 million votes Martin Fayulu - 6.4 million votes Emmanuel Shadary - 4.4 million votes The result can still be challenged. Mr Tshisekedi vowed to be ""the president of all DR Congolese"", saying: ""No-one could have imagined such a scenario whereby an opposition candidate would emerge victorious."" He struck a conciliatory tone with Mr Kabila when addressing supporters at his Union for Democracy and Social Progress party headquarters in Kinshasa. ""I pay tribute to President Joseph Kabila and today we should no longer see him as an adversary, but rather, a partner in democratic change in our country,"" he said. A spokesman for Mr Shadary, who had been Mr Kabila's hand-picked candidate and was expected to win, accepted the defeat, saying ""the Congolese people have chosen and democracy has triumphed"". Martin Fayulu said the results had ""nothing to do with the truth"" Mr Fayulu's supporters say this backs their suspicion Mr Tshisekedi has cut a power-sharing deal with Mr Kabila. Mr Tshisekedi's spokesman, Louis d'Or Ngalamulume, said there was ""never any deal"". The BBC's Africa editor, Fergal Keane, says Mr Tshisekedi is seen by many as the opposition candidate least objectionable to President Kabila and that it is perhaps significant that neither Mr Kabila nor his party have so far voiced any objection to the result. Mr Fayulu, a former oil tycoon, said the results had ""nothing to do with the truth"". ""The Congolese people will never accept such a fraud,"" he told the BBC, adding: ""Felix Tshisekedi never got 7 million votes. Where did he get them from?"" He said the electoral commission and ruling party had made up the figures to give Mr Tshisekedi -  their ""protÃ©gÃ©"" - victory. The influential Catholic Church, which posted 40,000 observers to monitor the election, issued a statement on Thursday saying the result given by the electoral commission did not correspond with its own findings. The statement mentions no-one by name and urges all parties to observe their civic duty and refrain from violence. Our correspondent, Fergal Keane, says the Church may now be publicly doubting the results but it will be very wary of any public demonstrations. Earlier, French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian told CNews: ""We must have clarity on these results, which are the opposite to what we expected."" Former colonial power Belgium has also expressed doubts about the result. Analysis by Fergal Keane, BBC News, in Kinshasa Given the deeply polarised nature of politics here, any result was going to leave a divisive aftermath. Whether Mr Tshisekedi has the intention or the capacity to challenge the powerful hold Mr Kabila enjoys over the army, security services and key ministries will determine whether politics has really entered a new era.  He has already spoken of working with Mr Kabila to ensure the success of democracy. For Mr Fayulu there are difficulties, too. How does he decide to react? The most likely route for the moment is to try to challenge the result within the 10-day period parties are allowed under the law. Given the closeness of the vote, his supporters will point to claims of irregularities in several areas. Significantly the Church and civil society have called on citizens to avoid becoming involved in violence - a recognition of the dangers involved in street protests while facing security forces with a reputation for heavy-handedness.

Fresh Brexit setback for May in MPs' vote,"The government lost by 11 votes Rebel Conservative MPs have joined forces with Labour to inflict a fresh blow on Theresa May's government in a Commons Brexit vote. It means the government will have to come up with revised plans within three days if Mrs May's EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week. It could also open the door to alternatives, such as a referendum. No 10 said Mrs May's deal was in the national interest but if MPs disagreed, the government would ""respond quickly"". The setback for the PM came as MPs started five days of debate on the withdrawal agreement with the EU, and the framework for future relations, ahead of the meaningful vote next Tuesday. The government was expecting to have 21 days to come up with a ""plan B"" for Brexit if, as widely expected, Mrs May's deal is voted down. How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Bercow Brexit ruling 'extremely concerning' Brexit: A really simple guide But MPs backed calls for it to respond within three working Parliamentary days, a deadline likely to fall on Monday 21 January. Theresa May lost by 11 votes, with 297 MPs siding with the government and 308 against. Among those voting against were 17 Conservatives, including former ministers Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah and Jo Johnson who want to see another referendum to decide whether the UK should leave or not.

Former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who led the rebellion, said he hoped for a ""serious dialogue"" between government and Parliament on alternatives to Mrs May's deal to avert a possible crisis. He told ITV's Peston that it would be up to Mrs May to decide what she wanted to do if her deal was rejected, but MPs would be able to vote on any motion she put forward within seven days. While the PM would have the right to say she wanted the Commons to re-consider her deal, he said MPs could amend the motion, telling her in effect ""we want you to do something else"". Fellow rebel Sarah Wollaston said she and other MPs opposed to a no-deal exit were engaged in a ""guerrilla campaign"" to show that it would never get the consent of Parliament. This video can not be played Bercow: ""Anti-Brexit sticker belongs to my wife"" By BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy The new Grieve amendment, now passed by MPs, means that in the event the PM loses next week, the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a ""managed no-deal"" to a further referendum, via a ""Norway option"" or a reheated version of the current deal, could be on the table. If a majority could be found for anything, it would not have the force of law - but it would at least indicate a policy which had the support of MPs. This is, in short, a massive ruling by the Speaker, made, apparently, against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler. I don't want to delve too deeply into the arcana of Business of the House motions only amendable by ministers of the Crown, but this drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit. Read Mark's full blog But Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who favours leaving without a withdrawal agreement, said it would not stop the UK exiting on 29 March. ""It merely requires a motion to be tabled not even debated,"" he said. And prisons minister Rory Stewart, who backs the PM's deal, said requiring Mrs May to restart complex negotiations with the EU and come back with changes in three days, was ""unreasonable"". He said Mr Grieve was ""trying to provide more support for what he wants, which is a second referendum"". Downing Street said it would consider the repercussions of Wednesday's defeat but its intention had always been to ""provide certainty"" as soon as possible. Labour has said it will table a motion of no confidence in the government if Mrs May's deal is voted down. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament had to ""take control of what happens next"" and suggested delaying the date of the UK's exit beyond 29 March might be ""inevitable"". He warned the UK's options were narrowing given the need to avoid, at all costs, a no-deal exit which he claimed was ""simply not viable for practical reasons"". Allow Twitter content?

Commons Speaker John Bercow faced an angry backlash from some Conservative MPs over his decision to allow MPs to vote on the issue. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. The MPs claim Mr Bercow broke Commons rules and ignored the advice of his own clerks. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom was among MPs to challenge his ruling in a series of points of order after Prime Minister's Questions. They argued that the business motion, tabled by the government, was not amendable and said the Speaker was breaking with precedent. Mr Bercow said he had made an ""honest judgement"" after consulting his clerks but rejected calls from Ms Leadsom to publish the advice he had received. He insisted he was ""not setting himself up against the government but championing the rights of the House of Commons"", adding that if people wanted to vote against the amendment they could. But a number of Tory MPs said the decision cast doubt on Mr Bercow's impartiality, with Crispin Blunt questioning whether he remained a ""neutral referee of our affairs"". The Commons defeat was the second in the space of 24 hours for the government on Brexit. On Tuesday, MPs, headed by former Tory ministers Mr Grieve and Oliver Letwin, defied the government on an amendment aimed at making it more difficult to leave the EU without a deal. The clashes in the Commons came as the PM, who cancelled a vote on her deal last month at the last minute to avoid a humiliating defeat, launched a fresh push to convince MPs. She is hopingnew proposals on Northern Ireland,externalwill change enough MPs' minds to save the deal. Stormont EU 'veto' proposals published Under the plans, the Northern Ireland Assembly would have a say on new EU rules if the backstop plan to prevent physical checks on the Irish border comes into force after Brexit. But the Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, have already rejected the so-called ""Stormont lock"" plans as ""cosmetic"" and ""meaningless"". Ministers have also accepted calls for MPs to be able to vote next year on alternatives to activating the backstop, such as extending the proposed 21-month transition period.

Whatâs going wrong at Jaguar Land Rover?,"Reports of a New Year jobs cull at Jaguar Land Rover (JRL) underline the scale of the challenge facing Britain's biggest carmaker. JLR has not confirmed the stories, which first appeared in the Financial Times. But, then again, it hasn't denied them either. According to JLR, speculation that up to 5,000 jobs may be at risk is just that - ""media speculation"". However, the company has already announced a Â£2.5bn restructuring plan called Project Charge and Project Accelerate. And as David Bailey, motor industry specialist at Aston Business School, says: ""I can't see how they'd make Â£2.5bn of savings without laying off workers."" Signs of trouble have been brewing all year. JLR made a pre-tax loss of Â£90m for the three months to end of September, compared to a profit for the same quarter in 2017. The firm's Solihull plant, where it makes Range Rover and Jaguar models, was closed for a two-week shutdown due to ""fluctuating demand"". That followed a move to a three-day week at JLR's Castle Bromwich plant. Jaguar Land Rover throws government a challenge JLR makes makes loss as sales slide 13% Jaguar boss in 'horrifying' Brexit warning Professor Bailey says JLR is caught in a ""perfect storm"" - the threat of a no-deal Brexit, slowing growth in China and a fall in diesel sales. Most analysts agree that the jewel in Britain's manufacturing crown needs more than just a polish. So a big cut in the 40,000-strong workforce, though painful, wouldn't be too much of a surprise. Falling sales in China is arguably the single biggest cause of JLR's current woes. The world's biggest car market has been driving growth for years, not just for JLR but for the global industry. A year or two ago things were still looking so positive. China accounted for about 25% of JLR sales and the company was building up production at plants in the country to help feed that growth. The Chinese love British luxury goods, went the marketing hype. And JLR said it was perfectly positioned to cash in on the consumers' love of big brands. But the market has stalled. A economic slowdown has made consumers more cautious about buying big ticket items. Beijing has scrapped some tax breaks on new cars, and rises petrol prices has hurt sales of fuel-thirsty sport utility vehicles. All this came against a backdrop of trade war talk and uncertainty about stiffer tariffs on cars. In fact, the latest speculation is that China will cut import tariffs but that may delay some purchases in the hope that prices will fall. The scale of China's slowing market was evident last month, when total car sales fell 14% from a year earlier, marking the steepest such drop in nearly seven years. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said 2.55 million vehicles were sold, a fifth straight monthly decline. The November fall comes after almost 12% declines in each of the past two months, putting China on track for an annual sales contraction not seen since at least 1990. ""We're currently in a painful period, and this process is really tough,"" Xu Haidong, CAAM's assistant secretary general told a press conference when the figures were released. JLR has not been immune to this slowdown. In November, its sales in China were 50% lower than a year ago at 6,804. Sales in October fell 46% year-on-year. It hasn't helped that JLR is understood to currently have a fraught relationship with car dealers in the country, who want the company to put up more money to help subsidise sales promotions. Some of JLR's rivals are doing it, but the company has been reluctant to follow. Outside China, JLR also continues to struggle, although the problem is no means as acute. Overall sales in the three months to September fell by 13%, with all its key regions seeing a slowdown. But JLR is not entirely the victim of circumstances outside its control. JLR chief executive Ralf Speth has said a hard Brexit could put the business in jeopardy The company has been criticised for not starting the shift away from diesel earlier. Almost 90% of sales last year in Britain, its largest market, were diesels. Other critics say there is too much overlap between models, such as the Range Rover Velar and Range Rover Sport. Also, Professor Ferdinand DudenhÃ¶ffer, from the Center for Automotive Research, at Germany's University of Duisberg-Essen, says Jaguar probably has too many models to compete with its rivals. Jaguar sold 180,000 cars last year, broadly the equivalent of 30,000 per model. ""You cannot compete with BMW or Mercedes with just 30,000 sales per model,"" he said. Both BMW and Mercedes have this year issued stark warnings about the slowdown in China and falls in diesel sales. But both companies remain profitable, sustained by a global manufacturing base and bigger sales footprint. Basically, says the professor, the problem for JLR is that it makes too many big cars that run on diesel. ""JLR needs a more balanced portfolio in order to compete under new emissions rules. But the company must move with more speed,"" he said. The current restructuring plan includes reducing investment and taking out inventory. JLR's chief executive Ralf Speth said it would ""lay the foundations for long-term sustainable, profitable growth"". But there is another hurdle that could yet de-rail this restructuring, one that prof DudenhÃ¶ffer says outweighs all the other hurdles - a no-deal Brexit. Mr Speth has warned about the consequences for investment in the UK if there is a hard Brexit. And the professor says he was right to do so. ""The disruption to exports of cars and the import of parts would push up costs dramatically,"" he said. ""The cash position would deteriorate. I think Brexit is the most important problem they face right now.""

"Jaguar Land Rover to cut up to 5,000 jobsThe car maker is expected to say it will cut thousands of jobs as part of a Â£2.5bn cost-cutting plan.BusinessComments","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will today announce it is cutting up to 5,000 jobs from its 40,000 strong UK workforce. Management, marketing and administrative roles are expected to be hardest hit, but some production staff may also be affected. The layoffs are part of a Â£2.5bn cost-cutting plan amid what industry insiders have called a ""perfect storm"". They mean a downturn in Chinese sales, a slump in diesel sales and concerns about UK competitiveness post-Brexit. JLR is particularly exposed to the first two of these factors. JLR has seen its employee numbers soar as its revenues have expanded. China is the company's biggest and hitherto most profitable market. But sales in China have fallen nearly 50% in recent months as cautious Chinese consumers have been holding back on big ticket purchases amid global trade tensions. The relationship between JLR and its Chinese sales network have also been strained as dealers demand better terms and promotional incentives. What's gone wrong at Jaguar Land Rover? UK car sales see biggest fall since financial crisis China car sales fall for the first time in 20 years The issues at JLR have arisen as Ford is also looking to cut back on itsworkforce numbers in Europe. Are you a Jaguar Land Rover employee? Will you be affected by the job cuts? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. JLR is also one of the most heavily-exposed car makers to ongoing consumer confusion about the wisdom of buying a diesel car in the aftermath of the VW emissions scandal. Ninety per cent of its vehicles are diesel-powered, although it has been investing in new electric and hybrid vehicles. Today's job losses come on top of cuts made last year. In Solihull, 1,000 agency workers were laid off in 2017. At Halewood in Merseyside, 180 agency staff were cut. In Castle Bromwich, 1,000 employees were put on a three day week for the last three months of 2018. Meanwhile, Jaguar has been increasing headcount elsewhere in the world. In China it has hired 4,000 workers since 2014. Most recently it announced it would move all production of the Land Rover Discovery to a new plant in Slovakia with plans to hire up to 3,000 workers. Unions are keen to examine whether JLR's international plants will continue to see additional investment at the expense of the UK. They are also concerned that the company is not permanently reducing its UK production capacity in the face of what could prove to be short-term headwinds. The company has sounded some of the most urgent warnings among UK manufacturers about the damage that Brexit uncertainty was doing to investment in the UK. In July last year, the company said it needed more certainty around Brexit in order to continue investing in its UK operations and warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit would cost the company more than Â£1.2bn in profit each year. Most commentators have concluded that the chance of a no-deal Brexit have increased with the governor of the Bank of England recently describing the probability as ""uncomfortably high"". Of all JLR's problems, the biggest flashing red light is a collapse in sales in its biggest market - China. But the company has been saying for more than a year that Brexit uncertainty would eventually take its toll on the perception of the UK as a stable and competitive base for global manufacturing. If, as expected, the UK bears the brunt, or the entirety, of JLR's global cost-cutting, JLR may well say it tried to warn us.
