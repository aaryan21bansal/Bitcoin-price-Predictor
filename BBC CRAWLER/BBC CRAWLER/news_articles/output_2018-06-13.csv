'Bill shock' warning on 118 calls,"118 118 has spent tens of millions on television advertising The telecoms regulator Ofcom has announced it wants to cap the price of 118 directory enquiry calls at Â£3.10 for a 90 second call. Market leader 118 118 charges Â£11.23 for a 90 second call to its service. Ofcom said providers had been increasing prices ""quite significantly"" in recent years and that people are paying much more than they expect. Overall 2% of adults or one million people use a 118 service, rising to 4% among those over the age of 65. Ofcom launched its enquiry into the cost of 118 calls in May 2017. It last investigated the sector in 2013 when the price was about Â£3 for a 90 second call. At that time it said there was not much evidence of ""bill shock"", which is where people are unpleasantly surprised when they receive their bill. Now however, it said some people were suffering ""bill shock"".

Haiti bans Oxfam GB after sex scandal,"Oxfam GB operations in Haiti were suspended in February Oxfam GB has been banned from operating in Haiti after its staff were accused of sexual misconduct following the 2010 earthquake. Haiti's government said the decision was taken because of Oxfam's ""violation of its laws and serious breach of the principle of human dignity"". Oxfam said it understood the decision, adding that the behaviour of some staff was ""completely unacceptable"". Haiti's decision follows a temporary suspension announced in February. The charity said it would continue to work in Haiti through affiliate members from Italy, Spain, and Quebec. Oxfam has been in Haiti since 1978, and increased its presenceafter the earthquake,external. But there have been no Oxfam GB staff in the country since the suspension in February. Oxfam chief executive to stand down Haiti suspends Oxfam GB operations How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Claims first emerged in the Times that staff, including a former country director, used prostitutes while based in Haiti after the earthquake. Four employees were fired for ""gross misconduct"" and three others, including the country director Roland Van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to leave the charity. Mr Van Hauwermeirendenied paying for sexbut admitted ""making mistakes"". In February, Oxfam offered its ""humblest apologies"" to Haiti. Thousands of peoplestopped making regular donationsto the charity after the scandal emerged. This video can not be played In February, then Oxfam boss Mark Goldring apologised in front of MPs Responding to Haiti's decision, Oxfam GB said: ""The behaviour of some former Oxfam staff working in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake was completely unacceptable. ""We have apologised to the government and the Haitian people for what happened."" Oxfam GB said stronger measures to prevent harassment and abuse have been in place since 2011 and a safeguarding plan was introduced after the scandal broke. It has also appointed an independent commission to review its culture and practices. Haiti's minister of planning and external cooperation Aviol Fleurant announced the government's decision in Port-au-Prince Oxfam GB chief executive Mark Goldringannounced his resignation last month, saying that someone else should help ""rebuild"" the group following  the scandal. Haiti's minister of planning and external cooperation, Aviol Fleurant, said a draft law was being prepared to give the government closer control over foreign charities operating in the country.

England edge Australia in first ODI,"This video can not be played Morgan and Root inspire England to victory First one-day international, The Oval: Australia 214 (47 overs):Maxwell 62, Plunkett 3-42, Moeen 3-43 England 218-7 (44 overs):Morgan 69, Root 50, Willey 35* England won by three wickets Scorecard England made heavy work of a run-chase before eventually completing a three-wicket win over Australia in the first one-day international at The Oval. Chasing 215 for victory, the home side were reduced to 38-3. And, after Eoin Morgan and Joe Root shared 115, they lost three wickets for 10 runs to slip to 163-6 in the face of some excellent Australia pace bowling. However, David Willey made an unbeaten 35 to secure victory with six overs to spare. Australia were playing their first ODI since the ball-tampering scandal resulted inbans for Steve Smith and David Warner,as well as the resignation of coach Darren Lehmann. New Australia captain Tim Paine introduced a pre-series handshake between the two teams, then saw his side struggle against England's spinners. Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid took five wickets between them and, after Australia fell to 90-5, they needed Glenn Maxwell (62) and Ashton Agar (42) to drag them to 214 all out. That did not seem enough on a blameless surface but England's two mini-collapses kept the contest interesting long into the London evening. The second game in the five-match series is in Cardiff on Saturday. NZ teenager Kerr scores ODI record 232 - highlights & report Scotland beaten by Pakistan in second T20 Some spectators goaded Australia's cricketers by waving sandpaper cards England - the world number ones - were well below their best in suffering a firstdefeat by Scotlandin a run-filled contest in Edinburgh on Sunday. Here, they were vastly improved with the ball but repeated some of the wasteful batting that cost them at The Grange. Even if Australia had been at full strength, England would have been favourites for this series - they won the winter ODIs 4-1 after being outplayed in the Ashes. As well as suspended former captain Smith and his deputy Warner, injuries have robbed the tourists of pace trio Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. Their inexperienced side, from which only Paine and Shaun Marsh were playing in the South Africa Test when the ball-tampering took place, were given the occasional reminder of the controversy. One company handed out advertisements on sandpaper at nearby tube stations, while a handful of spectators waved more sheets at Australian boundary fielders. This video can not be played Roy out second ball of England's chase The early burst of Australia's new-look attack gave the tourists real hope - Jason Roy was bowled by the pacy Billy Stanlake, debutant Michael Neser pinned Alex Hales lbw and Jonny Bairstow hooked Kane Richardson to deep square leg. Captain Morgan and Test counterpart Root rebuilt with serenity. Morgan swept and flicked the spinners in his 69, while Root played drives and deflections, as well as scampering between the wickets for exactly 50. England were on course for a comfortable victory, only for the impressive Australian fast bowlers to cause tension with their skill, accuracy and variations. Morgan bottom-edged behind and Jos Buttler, who had been reprieved from a skier by wicketkeeper Paine, miscued to mid-on, both off Andrew Tye. After that, Root edged Stanlake to give Paine the chance to make amends. Moeen and Willey steadied in a stand of 34 yet, just as he did in Scotland, Moeen needlessly holed out on the leg side when England were in sight of victory. Liam Plunkett impressed with the bat on Sunday and supported the calm Willey, the eighth-wicket pair happy to absorb the pressure and pinch singles before Willey won it with a magnificent straight six. After the tourists won the toss on a warm afternoon, a brisk Australia start had off-spinner Moeen into the attack in the ninth over. He took advantage of some poor strokes - Aaron Finch skewed to short third man, Marsh's flimsy defence cost him his off stump and Paine reverse-swept into the hands of Mark Wood. Moeen's 3-43 would have been more economical had Maxwell not hit a six and two fours in his final over. Maxwell showed glimpses of his power in a stand of 84 with the classy Agar,who made 98 as a number 11 on Test debutat Trent Bridge in 2013. But, when Maxwell found Bairstow at deep square leg off Plunkett, Australia's hopes of an imposing total went with him. The wily Rashid earlier had Marcus Stoinis caught behind and trapped Agar leg before, going through all his tricks for 2-36, leaving the pacemen to mop up the tail.

""The top order don't look comfortable starting their innings against spin. It was a great decision by Eoin Morgan to get the spinners on early."" This video can not be played 'The plan works' - Moeen removes Finch England captain Eoin Morgan:""We had to stem the flow and the spinners changed the pace of the game and created opportunities. ""Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali have been big threats in those middle overs for a few years now and they're getting even more experienced all the time. ""Australia came back and bowled well after I felt we bowled really well. We were below par with the bat. It was the opposite to Scotland, getting close to chasing 370 and then being seven down chasing 215 today. But it's important to show that even when it's not our day we can still get over the line. ""It was a good-natured game. They're a strong side, it was really competitive but played in the right spirit."" This video can not be played Joe Root out for 50 as England wobble More from Anderson:""What England lacked in Scotland was someone taking responsibility and seeing the innings through. Today, Eoin Morgan and Joe Root settled things after a nervy start. ""It's frustrating because I would've like to have seen one of them to go on and see England through to the end.

Antarctica's ice melt 'has accelerated',"This video can not be played Four things you should know about Antarctica Antarctica is shedding ice at an accelerating rate. Satellites monitoring the state of the White Continent indicate some 200 billion tonnes a year are now being lost to the ocean as a result of melting. This is pushing up global sea levels by 0.6mm annually - a three-fold increase since 2012 when the last such assessment was undertaken. Scientists report the new numbersin the journal Nature,external. Governments will need to take account of the information and its accelerating trend as they plan future defences to protect low-lying coastal communities. The researchers say the losses are occurring predominantly in the West of the continent, where warm waters are getting under and melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. Mission launches to weigh Earth's water Biggest ever Antarctic field campaign Giant iceberg splits from Antarctic ""We can't say when it started - we didn't collect measurements in the sea back then,"" explained Prof Andrew Shepherd, who leads the Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (Imbie). ""But what we can say is that it's too warm for Antarctica today. It's about half a degree Celsius warmer than the continent can withstand and it's melting about five metres of ice from its base each year, and that's what's triggering the sea-level contribution that we're seeing,"" he told BBC News. This video can not be played Andrew Shepherd: ""The study incorporates 24 independent satellite assessments"" Space agencies have been flying satellites over Antarctica since the early 1990s. Europe, in particular, has an unbroken observation record going back to 1992. These spacecraft can tell how much ice is present by measuring changes in the height of the ice sheet and the speed at which it moves towards the sea. Specific missions also havethe ability to weigh the ice sheetby sensing changes in the pull of gravity as they pass overhead. Imbie's job has been to condense all this information into a single narrative that best describes what is happening on the White Continent. Glaciologists usually talk of three distinct regions because they behave slightly differently from each other. In West Antarctica, which is dominated by those marine-terminating glaciers, the assessed losses have climbed from 53 billion to 159 billion tonnes per year over the full period from 1992 to 2017. On the Antarctic Peninsula, the finger of land that points up to South America, the losses have risen from seven billion to 33 billion tonnes annually. This is largely, say scientists, because the floating ice platforms sitting in front of some glaciers have collapsed, allowing the ice behind to flow faster. East Antarctica, the greater part of the continent, is the only region to have shown some growth. Much of this region essentially sits out of the ocean and collects its snows over time and is not subject to the same melting forces seen elsewhere. But the gains are likely quite small, running at about five billion tonnes per year. And the Imbie team stresses that the growth cannot counterbalance what is happening in the West and on the Peninsula. Indeed, it is probable that an unusually big dump of snow in the East just before the last assessment in 2012 made Antarctica as a whole look less negative than the reality. Globally, sea levels are rising by about 3mm a year. This figure is driven by several factors, including the expansion of the oceans as they warm. But what is clear from the latest Imbie assessment is that Antarctica is becoming a significant player. ""A three-fold increase now puts Antarctica in the frame as one of the largest contributors to sea-level rise,"" said Prof Shepherd, who is affiliated to Leeds University, UK. ""The last time we looked at the polar ice sheets, Greenland was the dominant contributor. That's no longer the case."" In total, Antarctica has shed some 2.7 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, corresponding to an increase in global sea level of more than 7.5mm. Artwork: European satellites in particular have an unbroken record going back to 1992 The latest edition of the journal Nature has a number of studies looking at the state of the continent and how it might change in a warming world. One of these papers,external, led by US and German scientists, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It should lift up - something scientists call isostatic readjustment. New evidence suggests where this process has occurred in the past, it can actually constrain ice losses -  as the land rises, it snags on the floating fronts of marine-terminating glaciers. ""It's like applying the brakes on a bike,"" said Dr Pippa Whitehouse from Durham University. ""Friction on the bottom of the ice, which was floating but has now grounded again, slows everything and changes the whole dynamic upstream. We do think the rebound (in the future) will be fast, but not fast enough to stop the retreat we've kicked off with today's warming. ""Ocean warming is going to make the ice too thin for this process to help."" This video can not be played Pippa Whitehouse: ""Push a balloon filled with honey - it rebounds when you remove your hand"" In Imbie's last assessment, the contribution of Antarctica to global sea-levels was considered to be tracking at the lower end of the projections that computer simulations had made of the possible height of the oceans at the end of the century. The new assessment sees the contribution track the upper end of these projections. ""At the moment, we have projections going through to 2100, which is sort of on a lifetime of what we can envisage, and actually the sea-level rise we will see is 50/60cm,"" said Dr Whitehouse. ""And that is not only going to impact people who live close to the coast, but actually when we have storms - the repeat time of major storms and flooding events is going to be exacerbated,"" she told BBC News.

VW fined Ã¢ÂÂ¬1bn over diesel scandal,"Car giant Volkswagen has been fined â¬1bn (Â£880m) by German prosecutors over its diesel emissions scandal. The Braunschweig public prosecutor found VW had sold more than 10 million cars between mid-2007 and 2015 that had emissions-test-cheating software installed. The car firm said it did not plan to appeal against the fine. VW said it had admitted ""its responsibility for the diesel crisis"". The fine is one of the highest ever imposed by German authorities against a company. VW chief executive Herbert Diess said by accepting the fine ""Volkswagen takes responsibility for the diesel crisis,"" ""Further steps are necessary to restore trust in the company and the auto industry,"" he added. The fine in Germany followsa US plea agreement last year,when VW agreed to pay a criminal fine of $4.3bn to resolve criminal and civil penalties. How serious is this for Volkswagen? Well, it's a big fine - â¬1bn is not a small sum. But it pales into insignificance compared with the fines and compensation the group has had to pay out in the US - which add up to well over â¬20bn If this puts an end to criminal proceedings in Europe, VW may well think it's a relatively small price to pay. The company has consistently denied that the software fitted to its cars was actually illegal under European law. Nevertheless, it will welcome the disappearance of that particular legal threat. VW does still face a number of civil lawsuits, brought by disgruntled car owners and shareholders. It's not clear yet what impact VW's admission of ""responsibility for the diesel crisis"" will have on those proceedings. But for the moment, it's possible to imagine suits in Wolfsburg breathing a heavy sigh of relief. It could have been worse. The total cost of the scandal has been much higher. VW has set aside $30bn to pay for its US bill, which includes fixing cars, buying back cars, clean air fines, penalties and compensation. The Volkswagen scandal erupted in September 2015, when the company admitted that nearly 600,000 cars sold in the US were fitted with ""defeat devices"" designed to circumvent emissions tests. Since then it has emerged that VW installed emissions-cheating software in nearly 11 million vehicles worldwide.

DJ King 'used fame' to commit sex assaults,"Jonathan King is accused of assaulting 11 teenage boys in the 1970s and 80s Former DJ and music producer Jonathan King used his fame to sexually assault teenage boys, a court has heard. The 73-year-old, of Bayswater, west London, showered the boys with gifts or promised sex with girls their own age, prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said. Mr King is also said to have lured youngsters into his car before driving them home and giving them alcohol. He is standing trial at Southwark Crown Court where he denies 24 serious sexual assault offences between 1970 and 1988. He is alleged to have carried out attacks on 11 boys aged between 14 and 16. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC told the jury of five men and seven women: ""When they were in his power and in no position to repel his advances he would assault them. ""It appears that it was a game of manipulation and power. ""He would play the same routine again and again, honed for success."" The jury was told the gifts included records and concert tickets and the boys were also shown pornography. The court was also told the defendant, who is appearing under his real name Kenneth George King, denies he would ever have sex with anyone under age or force himself on someone without consent. Describing the denials as ""hollow"", Ms Cottage revealed that Mr King was convicted in 2001 of sexual offences against five teenage boys in the 1980s. She also rejected his claims ""not to know or remember most of the boys"" related to the current charges, when there were still photographs, letters or addresses kept in his home ""like trophies"" up to 30 years later. Jurors were warned they would be shown images of a blow-up doll and pictures of naked girls during the trial. ""The reason that you have them at all is because the individual boys, at the time, said they were shown photos... of naked girls to try to encourage them to believe they were going to have sex with those girls,"" Ms Cottage explained. Outlining an account of one of his alleged victims, the prosecutor told the court that the 15-year-old was ""star struck"" when Mr King pulled up next to him near London's Tottenham Court Road in his white Daimler car in April 1970. The teenager was taken to dinner at a Chinese restaurant and given alcohol, and was later left ""shocked and frightened"" after being sexually assaulted at the music mogul's home. Ms Cottage said the complainant came forward after reading an article in the Independent newspaper in 2012, entitled ""Jonathan King: the only apology I have is to say that I was good at seduction"". Mr King denies meeting the boy or having any sexual encounter with him, the court heard. Another alleged victim was 14 or 15 years old when he was allegedly shown ""pop fan goodies"" in the boot of Mr King's car. The boy was allegedly taken to a Birmingham radio station while he was interviewed, plied with champagne and then taken to the Playboy Club in London. Ms Cottage said the complainant was promised sex with girls, shown pornography and supplied with condoms by King, who also took the boy and his sister to Pebble Mill, a BBC studio in Birmingham. Jurors were told he last saw Mr King on his 21st birthday, when the defendant told him ""he was too old and ugly for him now"". The trial continues.

Tourists killed in Portugal 'fall',"The pair were found on the beach in Ericeira, about 25 miles north of Lisbon A British woman and her boyfriend have been found dead on a beach in Portugal after apparently falling from a wall, the Foreign Office has said. The woman is reported to be Louise Benson, a wildlife conservation worker in her 30s and originally from Bristol. She and her Australian partner were found on Tuesday in Ericeira, a town 25 miles (40km) north of Lisbon. Local media report the authorities as saying the pair may have fallen as they recovered a phone or took photographs. Portuguese officials said the couple were thought to have been on the 30-metre (100ft) high wall before they died. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We are in touch with local authorities following the death of a British woman in Portugal and are providing support to her family."" Australia's foreign affairs department said they were assisting the family of its citizen.

Federal Reserve raises interest rates,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is presiding over a sea change in US policy The US Federal Reserve has voted to raise the target for its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, citing solid economic expansion and job gains. The widely-anticipated decision will lift the target for the central bank's benchmark rate to 1.75%-2%, the highest level since 2008. A majority of Fed officials also forecast two more rate rises this year, one more than previously predicted. The rise is part of the US recovery following the global financial crisis. It is the seventh time the bank has raised rates since 2015. The tighter policy reflects expectations that US growth and inflation will prove stronger than officials anticipated in March, while the unemployment rate continues to fall. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome ""Jay"" Powell said job gains are boosting income and confidence, while foreign expansion and tax cuts support additional growth. ""The main takeaway is that the economy is doing well,"" he said. Why US rates have a global impact Projections released after the Fed's two-day meeting in Washington show policymakers expect the US economy will grow 2.8% this year, while unemployment falls to 3.6%. They expect the core inflation rate to rise to roughly 2% this year. Mr Powell said concerns about trade are rising and the bank has received anecdotal reports that the uncertainties are leading companies to hold off on investment and hiring. But, he added, ""We really don't see it in the numbers."" Analysis: BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker This is another step on the road back to normal after the emergency measures taken following the financial crisis of 2008. The US has gone further down this path than the other largest developed economies. The central banks in Japan and the Eurozone still have their main rates at or close to zero.  Both are still actively undertaking quantitative easing, a policy of creating new money to buy financial assets in an effort to boost economic activity. The Fed stopped that in 2014 and has made a start on reducing its holdings of trillions of dollars' worth of assets.  That reflects the fact that the US recovery after the crisis has been stronger, and inflation is getting closer to the Fed's target. All three central banks (and the Bank of England) aim for inflation of about 2%, but in Japan and the Eurozone prices are rising substantially more slowly. In the UK, the Bank has stopped actively buying financial assets and interest rates are up a little from their lows. The British position has however been complicated by the referendum on membership of the European Union and a spike in inflation that followed the decline in the pound after the vote. The decision to raise rates comes as the US unemployment rate hovers at 3.8% - the lowest rate in nearly two decades - and inflation, which lagged the Fed's 2% target for years, shows signs of starting to pick up. The bank's preferred indicator of inflation, consumer spending figures, showed annual inflation rose 2% in April or 1.8% if energy and food were excluded. Mr Powell called the figures ""encouraging"" but said the bank wants to see the economy sustain that rate of inflation before it declares victory. Overall, he noted, the economy is in a much improved position than it was just a few years ago, as the US slowly emerged from the financial crisis and recession. ""The decision you see today is another sign that the US economy is in great shape,"" he said, adding that the bank continues to favour a gradual approach to raising rates. The higher rates should be a boon for savers, but they will increase borrowing costs for households and businesses throughout the economy. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for the interest rate website Bankrate.com, said that could ""squeeze"" families if wage growth remains sluggish. Analysts say the higher rates have also contributed to turmoil in some emerging markets. Low rates had prompted investors to pour money into riskier overseas markets in recent years in search of returns.

Comcast seeks to buy Murdoch's Fox,"Comcast already has a large entertainment business, including Jurassic World. Comcast, the US media conglomerate, has launched a bid for parts of 21st Century Fox, after getting rebuffed last year in favour of Disney. Comcast said,externalit has offered $65bn (Â£48.6bn) in cash for assets that include Fox's film and television studios and international businesses. The bid sets up a fight with Disney, which announced its own plan to acquire those businesses last year. The two firms are also vying for ownership of Sky in the UK. Comcast said its proposal is ""at least as favourable"" to shareholders as Disney's plan. The firm is offering Fox $35 per share in cash, which it says provides more shareholder certainty and is 19% higher than Disney's proposal, which involves exchanging shares. Media: What to look out for in 2018 Five reasons for the Fox-Disney deal Fox said it would ""carefully review and consider"" the offer. It said it remains subject to the terms of its deal with Disney, a stock transaction valued at $52.4bn, or more than $66bn including debt, when it was announced in December. That transaction, described by the two companies as a merger, was set to give Fox shareholders a roughly 25% stake in Disney. As part of the deal, Disney pledged to seek full ownership of Sky. Under both the Disney and Comcast proposals, Fox would create a new company to hold onto its news and sports businesses, including Fox News. The showdown over Fox is happening as the growth of online streaming and competitors such as Netflix reshape the entertainment industry. Comcast and Disney say Fox would bring original material and international reach that can help them compete. They are fighting over assets that include Fox's film and television studios, cable entertainment networks, and international properties, including Star India and Sky. The firm's properties include the original Star Wars movies, the X-Men franchise, and TV hits like The Simpsons. If Comcast succeeds in its bid, it would become a massive media conglomerate with few rivals in America. The firm, one of the largest providers of internet and pay TV in the US, already has a large television and film business, with subsidiaries such as NBC, Telemundo, Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Animation. The Simpson is part of Fox's catalogue Fox, which is led by Rupert Murdoch and his sons, rejected an offer from Comcast last year, citing concerns that antitrust officials would oppose a deal. But a court ruling this week on a similar merger may have alleviated those worries. On Tuesday, a federal judge cleared the AT&T's takeover of Time Warner, rejecting regulator concerns that the tie-up would stifle competition and lead to higher consumer prices. Comcast said it is confident it will win regulatory approval and that its new offer ""fully addresses"" the stated concerns. The firm's promises include a $2.5bn fee for Fox if it decides against the takeover. Comcast also said it would reimburse the money Fox would owe Disney for terminating that deal. Regulators are currently reviewing the Disney transaction. Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for antitrust, recently signalled that regulators were open to the combination. The tie-up with Disney would also carry a lower tax bill. Comcast's proposal is the latest attempt to merge content production with content distribution. Traditional telecommunications companies see these deals as vital to their survival in the cord-cutting era - an entertainment epoch in which streaming services like Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime have already gained a strong foothold. While Comcast had floated the deal for some time, it was waiting to see the outcome of an antitrust case brought by the Trump administration that was seeking to block America's largest pay-TV provider, AT&T, from buying Time Warner - the home of franchises like Game of Thrones, Wonder Woman and CNN. That case was dismissed on Tuesday, giving new impetus to Comcast's proposal and perhaps many more deals like it in the not-too-distant future.

Man called for 'race traitors' to be hanged,"Matthew Hankinson is accused of being a member of banned neo-Nazi group National Action A man accused of being a member of a banned neo-Nazi group called for ""traitors"" who supported multi-ethnic Britain to be hanged from lampposts, in a video shown to an Old Bailey jury. In the clip, taken in March 2015, Matthew Hankinson, 24, addressed a crowd in Newcastle upon Tyne. He is one of six men who deny being in National Action after a ban in 2016. On Tuesday one of the group admitted planning to murder a Labour MP as part of what he called a ""white jihad"". Jack Renshaw, 23, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete to kill West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper. He also admitted making a threat to kill police officer Victoria Henderson. There is no dispute in the trial that Mr Hankinson, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, is the speaker at the rally which took place more than a year before National Action was banned under terrorism legislation. He and the five other defendants deny being members of the group after it was outlawed in December 2016. During the Newcastle event, Mr Hankinson appears wearing dark sunglasses and surrounded by flag bearers, including one man carrying the National Action insignia. He tells the crowd they need to prepare for a coming race war which was necessary to secure the future of white people. ""If we don't fight and cut out the cancer, Britain will die,"" he says. ""The system will not compromise with us. We need the strongest of our race."" Referring to so-called race traitors who oppose far-right ideology, Mr Hankinson says: ""They will end up hanging from lampposts. We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. ""Blood must be shed, the blood of traitors. Stand up white men and set our people free."" The jury also watched a video of a demonstration involving National Action in Liverpool which resulted in minor clashes with anti-racism protesters and police in 2016. Jack Renshaw, in the centre holding the flag with his bare hand, from a National Action video of a demonstration in Liverpool in 2016 Mr Atkinson told the jury that Jack Renshaw was a masked man seen to be holding a banner, alongside some of the group's founders. A further video of a Rochdale protest included footage of another of the defendants - Andrew Clarke, 33, of Prescot in Merseyside. The other accused, who all deny being in the group are: Christopher Lythgoe, 32, and Michal Trubini, 35, both from Warrington; and Garron Helm, 24, from Seaforth, Merseyside. Mr Lythgoe also denies encouragement to murder by allegedly giving Renshaw permission to kill Labour MP Ms Cooper on behalf of the group. The court was told it was a whistleblower - Robbie Mullen - who first warned the anti-racism charity Hope not Hate - and, through them, the police - of Renshaw's plan to kill Ms Cooper. Mr Mullen, 25, from Widnes, Cheshire, told jurors he became interested in far-right politics in his late teens and joined National Action in 2015. National Action was against ""every non-white"" group, Robbie Mullen said Asked which ""groups"" National Action was against, he said: ""Jews, blacks, Asians - every non-white."" He said it wanted a ""white Britain"" by ""any means necessary,"" which included ""war"" and ""people getting killed"". Questioned by prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC, he said he had been a National Action member after it was banned and that the six men in the dock had remained members too. Asked why he had first contacted Hope not Hate in April 2017, he said ""partly the directions things were going in"". When asked to clarify, he said: ""To get out of the organisation - National Action."" He told jurors he had signed an agreement to give him immunity from prosecution over his former membership in return for giving evidence in the case. Andrew Clarke giving a speech in Rochdale in 2016 Mr Mullen said after National Action was banned, Mr Lythgoe took the organisation ""underground"" and had remained in charge. He said the meetings continued with the ""same place, same people, same purpose"". Mr Mullen said: ""The politics was still the same - free white man. The group had gone, the name had gone, but the people were still meeting."" He told the court of a July 2017 meeting at a pub in Warrington during which Renshaw outlined his plan to kill Rosie Cooper and Mr Lythgoe allegedly gave his approval. Mr Mullen said Mr Lythgoe suggested the former home secretary Amber Rudd be targeted, but Renshaw dismissed that because she would be too protected. He added that when Mr Lythgoe had said Renshaw could ""do it in the name of National Action"", Renshaw announced he would do it ""in the name of white jihad"". The case continues.

UK rebuffed over Galileo sat-nav system,"Artist's impression: There are currently 22 Galileo satellites in orbit The UK space industry, fighting to be part of the European satellite-navigation system, Galileo, has suffered another Brexit setback. Delegations to the European Space Agency have approved the procurement of the next batch of spacecraft, despite British calls to delay. The decision means UK companies will find it hard to win any contracts. As it stands, no deal has been agreed between London and the EU-27 to allow Britain continued participation. Even if this is eventually negotiated, any decision will probably come too late for UK firms to make the kind of bids for satellite work they have in the past. UK ups the ante on Galileo project Can the UK go it alone on a sat-nav scheme? Brexit to âforce sat-nav work out of UKâ UK considers rival to EU Galileo satellite Science minister Sam Gyimah said the vote at an Esa Council meeting to proceed with procurement put at risk Britain's future security relationship with the EU. ""The simple fact is that without full, fair and open industrial involvement, Galileo doesn't offer the UK value for money or meet our defence needs, so we would be obliged to walk away, resulting in delays and additional costs to the programme that will run into the billions,"" he said. ""There is an option on the table that would benefit both the UK and EU. If that is not accepted by the EU, we are a proud and confident nation and will be looking at all alternatives."" Ministers have previously talked about the UK building its own sat-nav system, which could cost Â£3-5bn. The European Commission says Brexit means the UK will have to be excluded from a key element of Galileo after March next year. This is the Public Regulated Service, or PRS - a navigation and timing signal intended for use by government agencies, armed forces and emergency services. The PRS is designed to be available and robust even in times of crisis. Brussels says London cannot immediately have access to it when the UK leaves the European bloc because it will become a foreign entity. PRS is for EU member states only. The UK believes to stay part of Galileo, it must have full access to PRS. Mr Gyimah wrote to the EC's commissioner for space, ElÅ¼bieta BieÅkowska, requesting Esa delay its deliberations to give negotiations a chance to succeed. ""To press ahead with the Batch 4 vote now could prejudge the outcome of further negotiations which is something I am sure we want to avoid,"" he said in his letter. The European Commission uses the European Space Agency as its technical and design agent on Galileo. So far, Esa has put 22 satellites in orbit for the network and has commissioned others to take the total number above 24 - considered a full system - plus spares. Batch 4, valued at some â¬400m, would likely acquire 12 additional satellites to act as the rolling replacements for earlier models in orbit that reach the end of their operational lives. To date, British engineers have assembled the payloads - the ""brains"" - of every single Galileo satellite. Artwork: Galileo satellites go into orbit two or four at a time A project of the European Commission and the European Space Agency 24 satellites constitute a full system but it will also have six spares in orbit 22 spacecraft are in orbit today; the 30 figure is likely to be reached in 2021 Original budget was â¬3bn but will now cost more than three times that Spacecraft have been launched in batches of two, but now go up four at a time Will work alongside the US-owned GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises eventual real-time positioning down to a metre or less Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Royal wedding cellist wins at Classic Brits,"Michael Ball and Alfie Boe pretended to make off with the Brits statue on the red carpet Michael Ball and Alfie Boe have revealed they only received one statue when they won best group at this year's Classic Brit Awards. ""You will have to rip it out of my cold dead hands,"" Ball teased his partner backstage, as he clutched the trophy. The duo scored then pretended to make off with one of the oversized prop statues that decorated the red carpet. Other winners on the night included teenage cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and veteran singer Dame Vera Lynn. Dame Vera Lynn, 101, said she was ""surprised and very happy"" to receive a lifetime achievement award, which her daughter accepted on her behalf. Virginia Lewis-Jones read out a letter from the wartime singer, which reflected on her career. ""I never imagined when a small child growing up in East Ham that I would be able to travel around the world as I have done, and seen and experienced so many interesting places and to meet so many interesting people."" Meanwhile, Kanneh-Mason followed up his performance at the Royal Wedding by winning two categories - male artist of the year and the critics' choice award. Kanneh-Mason's debut album reached number 11 in the UK charts The 19-year-old, who came to prominence when he won the BBC's Young Musician contest in 2016, dedicated the prizes to his parents. ""Having music lessons and going to concerts and travelling around takes up a lot of time and energy - especially as my parents have seven children who are also all doing the same,"" the musician told the BBC backstage. ""So I'm just grateful for the time and dedication they've given to all of us."" Ball and Boe also picked up the best album award for Together Again, their second collection of duets. ""There is only one way I can thank this man publicly,"" said Ball on the stage, before turning to Boe and kissing him on the lips. The singer and Radio 2 presenter told BBC News that winning the prize was ""genuinely one of the most thrilling moments I've had in my career. ""And to share it with a mate is fabulous."" Classical music 'must learn from hip hop' Royal wedding cellist gets chart boost Teen cellist donates Â£3,000 to school The ceremony - hosted by Classic FM presenters Myleene Klass and Alexander Armstrong - marked the return of the Classic Brit awards after a five-year hiatus. Other winners included Tokio Myers and Renee Fleming, while Andrew Lloyd Webber and Andrea Bocelli received accolades for their services to the industry. Performers included mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins, in her first televised performance since the birth of her second child. Tokio Myers - who won the breakthrough award - with Amanda Holden Former Britain's Got Talent winner Tokio Myers, who was named breakthrough artist of the year, said he hoped his win would inspire young people to ""explore a side of music they might not normally listen to for themselves"". The sentiment was echoed by saxophonist Jess Gillam, who picked up the Sound of Classical award, which recognises up-and-coming artists. ""My passion is to reach as many young people as possible,"" she said. ""You have to try and encourage them to come to concerts [because] a CD or recording isn't the same as experiencing that electric feeling of live music."" Singer Katherine Jenkins was among the attendees Myleene Klass co-hosted the ceremony Brit Awards chief executive Geoff Taylor expressed pride at the diversity of the winners. ""It's wonderful to see great icons such as Dame Vera Lynn and Andrea Bocelli being rightly honoured but also very encouraging to witness a new wave bristling with talent.

MPs quit Labour roles over Brexit,"Two Welsh MPs have quit their Labour party roles to rebel against leader Jeremy Corbyn in a key Brexit vote. Gower's Tonia Antoniazzi and Cardiff North's Anna McMorrin have both resigned as parliamentary aides. It was so they could vote for a closer relationship with the EU, defying the orders of their leader. Eight other Welsh MPs also voted for staying in the European Economic Area (EEA), which would mean staying in the European Union's single market. The Labour leadership had urged MPs to abstain but 75 voted for and 15 against. Brexit changes reversed amid Labour revolt MPs debate EU bill changes A Lords amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, committing the UK to EEA membership, was reversed by 327 to 126. In a statement, Mr Corbyn said he understood the ""difficulties"" facing MPs ""representing constituencies which voted strongly for Leave or Remain"" on the issue of the EEA. But he insisted Labour could not support the so-called Norway model as he did not believe it was the ""right option"" for the UK. ""It would leave us with next to no say over rules we have to follow, it does not allow us to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union and it fails to resolve the Irish border issue,"" he said. Plaid Cymru Brexit spokesperson Hywel Williams, Arfon MP, said: ""In abstaining on this crucial amendment, the Labour Party has paved the way for the Tories to deliver a hard-Brexit.""

Kuenssberg: Extraordinary day,"Look away now if you are of a nervous disposition. A wiser head than me - there's dispute over whether it was Mark Twain or Bismarck! - once remarked that laws are like sausages, if you respect them it's best not to watch them being made. Well the last forty eight hours in Westminster may give weight to that. Farce? Fiasco? Or maybe today in Parliament has been in the best tradition of British pantomime. Or perhaps, this is in fact the completely predictable agony of split political parties, with leaders who struggle to command their troops, just trying to make it through after a huge vote that by its very nature, split the country in two. Brexit changes reversed amid Labour revolt Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Or depending on your view, it is perhaps exactly what Parliament is there for, to reveal the contradictions, where the government is strong and weak, and force ministers to give a bit where they ought to. Whichever of those over-generalisations you plump for, and I suspect it will depend entirely on your own political convictions, this has been an extraordinary day. MPs talking of ""meltdown"", or ""uncharted territory"", warning the prime minister against ""betrayal"". Trust in Tory circles breaking down, as the prime minister tries to face all ways. There was the SNP's dramatic, if perhaps politically convenient, walk out over discussions of devolution being massively squeezed, complete with a scene where the Speaker looked like he might finally combust. Then votes tonight that saw one of the biggest ever rebellions against Jeremy Corbyn, with 90 of his MPs disobeying his orders on a vote on the European Economic Area. Several of his front bench team quit their shadow posts to do so. But even those rebels were split - 75 of them rebelling against the leadership to vote for closer ties to the EU, and 15 against Mr Corbyn to choose more distant relations. And 14 Tories defied Theresa May's instructions too. For a government with no majority, that is a worry for the prime minister. At times in the last forty eight hours this place has felt like a circus. But in the end, the government showed it can just get its way, whether by winning the argument, backing down, or postponing confrontation for now. It's not been pretty, and it's not going to get any easier. One former minister grimly predicted this is turning into Maastricht. So, tomorrow, stand by for another row over what happens next.

PM 'must honour Brexit vote assurances',"This video can not be played Solicitor General Robert Buckland says Brexit legislation will be improved Theresa May must honour ""assurances"" she's given that Parliament will get a bigger say on any final Brexit deal, pro-EU Tory MPs say. The government averted a rebellion on the issue after a meeting between the PM and more than a dozen MPs. One of the potential rebels, Dominic Grieve, warned there would be consequences for the government if not. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a government source had told her no actual concessions had been agreed. And a senior minister, Solicitor General Robert Buckland, said the government had only agreed to ""further discussions"" about the way in which they could make ""a further step forward"". A group of MPs said on Tuesday they were offered, in a last-minute concession, real ""input"" if no deal with the EU was done by December. Ministers win Brexit vote after concession Scottish government wants devolution changes Minister quits government over Brexit Phillip Lee quits: How big a problem is it for May? Details of precisely what this will involve could emerge in the coming days when the EU Withdrawal Bill is due to return to the House of Lords. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March next year, after the referendum in 2016 when people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave. The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"". Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit. But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy. Given that politicians, like the rest of the country, are divided on what Brexit should look like, this is posing problems for the government as it tries to get the bill through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. This video can not be played The government has dodged a defeat on its key Brexit legislation The government is currently trying to persuade MPs to undo most of the changes made by the House of Lords, and on Tuesday this involved a tussle over how much of a say Parliament will get if it does not like the deal struck between the UK and the EU. The government does not want to give MPs and peers the power to say what sort of Brexit deal the UK should strike with the EU, saying this should be left to ministers. When it came to the key vote, a group of Conservatives who had threatened to rebel agreed at the last minute not to defeat the government after public haggling between ministers and would-be rebels and a meeting between Mrs May and more than a dozen Tory MPs. But it is not yet clear exactly what the MPs were offered and whether they are happy with what has since been said by ministers. This video can not be played Tory rebel Nicky Morgan tells Today she was given 'assurances' by May ""I expect the government to honour its commitments and I expect the PM to honour her commitments and I have no reason to distrust the approach she took with us,"" one of the would-be rebels, Dominic Grieve, told the BBC's Newsnight. Ahead of the vote Mr Grieve tried to broker a compromise between MPs and ministers which would apply if Parliament rejects the final UK-EU Brexit deal. Under his proposals, the government would then have to seek MPs' approval for its plan of action through a motion in the House of Commons. It would also have to do this if no deal has been agreed by the end of November 2018. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ministers have agreed to consider these suggestions - but not a third strand of his proposals which would require the government to ""follow any direction"" from MPs if there is no deal by 15 February 2019. Remain-supporting Conservatives Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan were two of the MPs to meet with Mrs May. Ms Soubry said she trusted Mrs May to ""honour the undertaking she gave"". Ms Morgan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What was agreed was the prime minister understood that Parliament wants to have a real say, in all circumstances, in relation to what's going to happen in the Brexit deal."" Politics is often about the big picture, but sometimes it is a festival for pedants. Believe me, in Westminster, there is a very very big difference between the promise of more serious chat about something with the possibility of a change - and a promise actually to do something different, especially if it is made by the occupant of Number 10. So just hours after the concession, (or non-concession) very, very dark mutterings began from those who had been persuaded by what they thought was a promise. Read Laura's full blog Eurosceptic MPs have criticised moves to give Parliament more power as Brexit approaches, saying this would be used to ""wreck"" the UK's EU departure. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, a leading Brexit backer, said the concessions could ""come back to haunt"" the government if they amounted to a veto over the terms of the UK's departure. He told the BBC that rebels were seeking a ""wrecking motion"", stating: ""It not only has the risk of stopping Brexit, it is certainly going to make the negotiating position of the government considerably diminished. ""It is hugely irresponsible, and I can't believe that those that are perpetrating this don't know exactly what they are doing. And, for me, it's a betrayal of the British people."" The EU Withdrawal Bill is now back in the House of Commons, with MPs debating the rest of the Lords amendments. These include a requirement to seek membership of the European Economic Area - an arrangement like Norway's that would keep the UK part of the EU single market. This is opposed by both the Conservative and Labour leaderships, despite the backing of some pro-EU MPs in both parties. There is also an amendment requiring the government to report to Parliament on steps taken to negotiate a customs union with the EU. The government has rejected this one too, and has proposed an alternative amendment referring to a new ""customs arrangement"" which was thought to have averted the possibility of a rebellion on that subject. Tempers flared in the Commons as MPs discussed immigration, with Speaker John Bercow appealing to members to ""respect"" each other's arguments. Ms Soubry said she was ""appalled"" at a speech from Labour's Caroline Flint and accused her of not appreciating the value of immigrants. Ms Flint had argued for new immigration controls, saying people wanted to be able to ""turn the tap on and off when we choose"". She said she was not against all immigration but that her constituents wanted a ""fair and managed system"". Earlier some MPs claimed an amendment passed on Tuesday night could have implications for the government's preferred trade options after Brexit. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the amendment, which committed the government to avoiding any ""physical infrastructure, including border posts, or checks and controls"" in Northern Ireland after Brexit. He said this meant one of the government's proposals for replacing the customs union - a technology-based solution to minimise border delays - could be ""unlawful"" if it involves any border infrastructure checks. Dominic Grieve agreed, saying: ""Not only will we have to stay in a form of customs arrangement amounting to a union, but we're also going to have to have a high level of regulatory alignment because otherwise the life that takes place along the border will be impossible because of different regulations on either side."" Labour's whips' office said it expected eight votes to take place from 19:30BST.

Parents sports day video dispute warning,"Some parents have brought video ""evidence"" into a school in Cardiff to dispute sports day results Parents using video footage to challenge the results of a primary school sports day have been told the teacher's word is final. As parents watched their children take part in the event at a Cardiff primary school many filmed it. But some then brought video ""evidence"" in to dispute the results declared by teachers on the finishing line. The headteacher of Ysgol Mynydd Bychan in Cathays has sent a letter to parents warning them to stop the practice. Parents have demanded official standings were changed based on their footage, but the school had refused to budge in the results row. Sporting 'scandals' through the years How to ace sports day In a strongly worded letter, head Sian Evans has said: ""Teacher's word is final"". Mynydd Bychan school holds its sports day at Cardiff's National Indoor Athletics Centre The letter added: ""The members of staff at the finish line, and nobody else, have the absolute final say and as to the first, second and third place positions. ""Unfortunately, during the last few years parents have approached members of staff with evidence that they had filmed on electronic devices such as iPads in order to prove that their child should have been awarded a higher position in a particular race and comments also appeared on Facebook. The school holds its sports day at the nearby National Indoor Athletics Centre on the Cardiff Met University campus ""If this happens again, there is a strong possibility that we will have to consider changing the competitive nature of our sports morning."" ""The arrangements for the smooth running of the morning are very tight and take quite a bit of arranging. Members of staff work hard in various ways during the morning.""

Fortnite's World Cup to be 'open to all'VideoVideoBattlefield V resists gender attacksVideoVideoSuper Smash Bros Ultimate battle-testedSony's Last of Us sequel kisses and kills,"This video can not be played WATCH: Fans flock to Fortnite's first live event Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, has announced more details about its first World Cup. It would be open to all players, Epic said at a live celebrity tournament at the Los Angeles E3 gaming conference. And the $100m (Â£74m) prize pot - the largest in the highly lucrative world of e-sports - would be split between many events at different levels of competition around the world. It comes as some are expressing concern about young children playing Fortnite. Launched in June 2017, Fortnite now has 125 million players around the globe, according to Epic. Its most popular format, Battle Royale, pits 100 players against each other, some of whom are in small teams, to see who is the last person standing. The game is free, but players can spend real money on in-app purchases including skins to customise player avatars. Announcing the details of the World Cup in ablogpost,external, the company said: ""We're getting behind competitive play in a big way, but our approach will be different - we plan to be more inclusive, and focused on the joy of playing and watching the game. ""We'll be supporting community organised events, online events, and major organised competitions all over the world, where anyone can participate, and anyone can win."" ""This is for you, the players. Qualifications for the Fortnite World Cup will be based on merit. Epic will not be selling teams or franchises, and won't allow third-party leagues to do so either."" Nintendo Switch gets Fortnite and Super Smash Bros Ultimate Battlefield V creator resists gender attacks Xbox One gets new Halo, Forza and Gears of War games The play would focus on individuals and duos but ""there'll be plenty of opportunities to squad-up in competition, too"", it added. The qualifiers will begin in autumn 2018, with the World Cup event due to take place in late 2019. According to e-sports analyst Newzoo, organised, competitive computer gaming will generate more than Â£1bn in global revenue and almost double its audience to nearly 600 million people by 2020, giving it the potential to become one of the top five sports in the world. There is huge appetite for Fortnite. Last month, a tournament held by one of the game's most famous streamers, Ninja, saw more than 600,000 concurrent viewers on game streaming site Twitch. The game has an age classification of 12-plus but is increasingly attracting younger children, leading some to question whether it is suitable for such a young demographic. Alastair Graham, chief executive of online age verification company AgeChecked, said: ""[The] dangers of under-age children playing online games such as Fortnite are that it risks desensitising young children to mature themes such as gun violence, as well as putting them at risk of being scammed or groomed online by their elders.""

Sony's Last of Us sequel kisses and kills,"This video can not be played WATCH: Sony began its PlayStation 4 event with a kiss Sony has previewed one of its most anticipated PlayStation games with a trailer that shifted focus from two women kissing to a hanging man being disemboweled in its opening minutes. The Last of Us Part II is the follow-up to one of the top-reviewed and most awarded games of the PlayStation 3 generation. Gameplay footage made clear the sequel will be at least as bloody as its predecessor. However, no launch date was given. Initial reactions to the title from industry watchers were mostly positive, although one games reviewerremarked that the title was,external""fetishising extreme violence"". But there was praise for the way the developer Naughty Dog had presented the kiss. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I think they were trying to make to clear to people that this is what they're about - diversity [and] different sorts of stories,"" games journalist Julian Rizzo-Smith told the BBC. ""If you look at their franchises, it's stories led by strong females now. I think it's really setting a benchmark."" Sony also premiered the first gameplay footage from its surreal horror title Death Stranding. The game is being masterminded by Hideo Kojima, who was previously behind the Metal Gear series. Death Stranding's plot remains a mystery The trailer showed the lead character - modelled on The Walking Dead star Norman Reedus - trekking across a variety of landscapes before coming under attack from a group of invisible monsters, whose presence appears to be exposed by a foetus he is carrying. The plot still remains unclear and, again, no release date was offered. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gamers will be able to play through all of the next Assassin's Creed: Odyssey as a female character A kiss seen around the world! The embrace between Ellie and her (previously unannounced) girlfriend was a moment of genuine emotion - not titillation - that shows this multi-billion dollar industry is finally capturing the diversity of its audience. It was met with cheers, this was the climactic point of what is a major move forward in this industry. Gamers' affection for Ellie is based on good storytelling, Hollywood-worthy character development and terrific acting and direction - the character is not, as is so often the case in gaming, an act of tokenism designed to begrudgingly appease critics. On Monday we also saw Assassin's Creed, a game criticised in the past for having an entire roster of all-male characters. The latest instalment in the series, Odyssey, provides a new option to play as either male or female throughout the next game and, along the way, develop romantic relationships with men or women. So, Xbox's Gears 5, PlayStation's The Last of Us Part 2 and the multi-platform Assassin's Creed. All no doubt on course to be the biggest games of the next 12 months - and all lead by women. Sony has sold more than 76 million PlayStation 4 consoles to date, according to research firm IHS Markit. That represents nearly twice as many units as Microsoft's Xbox One, although it is still some way behind the PlayStation 2's tally of nearly 158 million. The Last of Us Part II featured several gruesome killings Many believe the Japanese firm's success has been driven by the popularity of its in-house exclusives including Uncharted 4, Horizon Zero Dawn and God of War. However, Microsoft now boasts having the more powerful games machine in the Xbox One X and has just announced that it has acquired and created several games studios. Sony's E3 event in under three minutes Xbox One chief teases Halo Infinite video game Gears of War gets a female lead ""A strong first-party library is what convinces people to buy your box over someone else's and this generation of consoles has hammered home that is still true,"" commented Laura Dale, news editor of the Kotaku UK news site. The opening part of Sony's E3 event was held in a room dressed up to look like one of Last of Us Part II's locations ""The PlayStation 4 has had frequent, high-quality first-party exclusives - which is something the Xbox One has not had. ""So, Sony goes into this E3 with everything to lose in the sense that it is in a strong position, but Microsoft did have a very good showing on Sunday."" Sony opted to show off about half the number of titles Microsoft did, in what was a much shorter event. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One analyst who attended both shows praised Sony's decision to try and recreate some of its games' environments for invitees, but added that Microsoft had likely produced the better experience for those live-streaming the showcases from afar. ""Sony certainly didn't show off as many new, unknown titles... and it was less pointed in terms of release dates,"" commented Lewis Ward from the consultancy IDC. ""But I don't think that was Sony's primary focus here. ""Its intent was to show off the beauty of its video games."" Ghost of Tsushima is being developed by Sucker Punch, the Sony division that created Infamous Other first-party exclusives shown off by Sony included Ghost of Tsushima, a Samurai-themed third-person sword-fighting game set in 1274. The Gaming Bolt review sitesuggested it resembled an episode,externalof Assassin's Creed set in Japan. New footage from Spider-Man - the centre-piece of Sony's 2017 E3 event - was also presented, featuring Electro and Rhino among other villains. The game is due for release in September. The Spider-Man trailer featured the super hero under attack from several of his enemies Content from third-party publishers was also displayed. Capcom showed off footage from a remake of Resident Evil 2. The survival-horror game was first released in 1998 and helped drive sales of the original PlayStation. Leon Kennedy returns in a Resident Evil 2 remake unveiled at the Sony press conference The new version is set to be released on 25 January 2019. Remedy Entertainment announced Control, a sci-fi game featuring a female lead with a shape-shifting gun who encounters several people's bodies floating mid-air. The Finnish developer was previously responsible for the Xbox/Windows exclusive Quantum Break. Remedy Entertainment said Control was set for release some time in 2019 California-based Squanch Games also announced a platformer featuring new characters developed by one of the co-creators of the TV comedy Rick and Morty. Trover Saves The Universe's madcap storyline centres on efforts to prevent a villain from draining dogs' life essence as part of a plan to destroy the universe. Unlike the other titles shown off at the event, a version of the game is being developed for use with the PlayStation's virtual reality headset. Trover Saves The Universe is set for release in ""early 2019"" Sony did, however, announce some other PlayStation VR releases following its conference. They included Deracine, a ghost story set in a girls' boarding school. It is being developed by the studio behind Bloodborne and Dark Souls, but the trailer suggested a more lyrical tone than those earlier blood-soaked games. Sony recently acknowledged that sales,externalof its virtual reality kit had been lower than expected. Deraine's trailer mixes together scenes from the past and present ""At this point it's more about supporting customers who bought PlayStation VR rather than trying to make it a huge success,"" commented Ms Dale. ""It's still the best value proposition out there in terms of headset resolution and price, but most of the market is still not ready for virtual reality.""

MPs quit Labour roles over Brexit vote,"Two Welsh MPs have quit their Labour party roles to rebel against leader Jeremy Corbyn in a key Brexit vote. Gower's Tonia Antoniazzi and Cardiff North's Anna McMorrin have both resigned as parliamentary aides. It was so they could vote for a closer relationship with the EU, defying the orders of their leader. Eight other Welsh MPs also voted for staying in the European Economic Area (EEA), which would mean staying in the European Union's single market. The Labour leadership had urged MPs to abstain but 75 voted for and 15 against. Brexit changes reversed amid Labour revolt MPs debate EU bill changes A Lords amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, committing the UK to EEA membership, was reversed by 327 to 126. In a statement, Mr Corbyn said he understood the ""difficulties"" facing MPs ""representing constituencies which voted strongly for Leave or Remain"" on the issue of the EEA. But he insisted Labour could not support the so-called Norway model as he did not believe it was the ""right option"" for the UK. ""It would leave us with next to no say over rules we have to follow, it does not allow us to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union and it fails to resolve the Irish border issue,"" he said. Plaid Cymru Brexit spokesperson Hywel Williams, Arfon MP, said: ""In abstaining on this crucial amendment, the Labour Party has paved the way for the Tories to deliver a hard-Brexit.""

N Korea nuclear disarmament by 2020 - US,"This video can not be played House speaker Paul Ryan: ""Let's go get an agreement"" The US hopes to see ""major disarmament"" by North Korea by the end of 2020, says Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. His comments, during a visit to South Korea, follow an unprecedented meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. They signed a deal agreeing to work towards ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". But the document has been criticised for lacking details on when or how Pyongyang would give up its weapons. Mike Pompeo (right) is in Seoul, South Korea, to discuss the outcome of Mr Trump's summit Mr Pompeo travelled from the summit in Singapore to Seoul, where he was briefing South Korea's government on the outcome of the summit. He said there was still ""a great deal of work to do"" with North Korea, but added: ""Major disarmament... We're hopeful that we can achieve that in the two and half years."" He said he was confident Pyongyang understood the need for any dismantling its nuclear programme to be properly verified - a key . When asked by reporters why this was not specified in the document signed in Singapore, he condemned their questions as ""insulting"" and ""ridiculous"". This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: What happens now? President Trump earlier declared that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat, insisting ""everybody can now feel much safer"". The credibility of that claim is in doubt. That is because under the agreement, the North retains its nuclear warheads, the missiles to launch them and has not agreed to any specific process to get rid of them. Pyongyang has celebrated the summitas a great win for the country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He also announced an unexpected end to military exercises regularly carried out between US and South Korean forces on the peninsula. The move - long demanded by Pyongyang - has been seen as a major concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise. South Korea's presidential Blue House later clarified that it needed to ""find out the precise meaning or intentions"" behind Mr Trump's remarks on ending the joint military drills. What are the US-South Korea war games? After the summit, North Korea's state media said the two leaders had agreed that ""step-by-step and simultaneous action"" was needed to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. American hardliners such as Mr Trump's national security adviser John Bolton have previously opposed such a phased approach, whereby the US takes reciprocal action. Most Western observers have said it includes no new commitments from North Korea nor details on how denuclearisation could be achieved or verified. Critics also expressed disappointment that Pyongyang's long record of human rights abuses was not addressed. President Moon Jae-in had on Tuesday hailed the summit as a ""historic event"", adding that it would be recorded as ""[helping] break down the last remaining Cold War legacy on Earth"".

Brexit changes reversed amid Labour revolt,"Anti-Brexit campaigners have been protesting outside the Houses of Parliament every day Attempts to keep the UK in the European Economic Area after Brexit have been defeated in the House of Commons despite dozens of Labour MPs defying the leader's instructions on the issue. MPs voted by 327 to 126 against a House of Lords proposal for a close relationship with the EU like Norway's. Jeremy Corbyn urged his MPs to abstain but 75 voted for and 15 against, while six quit their Labour roles. MPs overturned six further amendments peers had put forward. MPs were deciding whether the UK should stay part of the European Economic Area after it leaves the EU - a similar arrangement to non-EU countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Like EU members, these countries are part of the EU single market - in return they are obliged to make a financial contribution and accept many EU laws. The free movement of people also applies in the zone as it does in the EU. Supporters of the EEA argue it would give the UK the closest possible relationship with the EU without actually being a member, as it would offer full access to the single market. But critics say it would require the UK to adhere to EU rules without having a say in them - and would not be in keeping with the spirit of the 2016 referendum result. After the House of Lords altered the government's EU Withdrawal Bill in favour of EEA membership, the House of Commons agreed to change it back on Wednesday evening. The government won the vote comfortably after Labour abstained, although three Tory MPs, Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, rebelled themselves and backed the motion. PM 'must honour Brexit vote assurances' Please upgrade your browser Jeremy Corbyn said EEA membership was ""not the right option"" for Britain but that he understood the difficulties the issue posed for MPs representing strongly Leave or Remain constituencies. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Labour MP Laura Smith defended her decision to quit as shadow defence minister because she did not want to follow the leader's instruction to abstain. The MP for Crewe and Nantwich said she wanted to oppose the Lords amendment, saying remaining part of the EEA was not in the interests of her constituents who had voted to leave the EU in 2016. Labour MPs Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi have stepped down from their frontbench roles Ms Smith, who backed Remain in the referendum, said there were ""legitimate reasons"" why people had backed Brexit, adding: ""The country is divided on this issue and we need to start bringing people together."" On the other side of the debate were her Labour colleagues Ged Killen, Tonia Antoniazzi, Anna McMorrin, Ellie Reeves and Rosie Duffield who stepped down as parliamentary private secretaries to support EEA membership. In her resignation letter to Mr Corbyn, Ms Reeves said her Lewisham West and Penge constituency had voted by two to one to stay in the EU and hundreds had contacted her in support of staying part of the EEA. Earlier, Labour failed in an attempt to amend the bill with their own alternative motion to guarantee ""full access"" to European markets after Brexit from outside the EEA. This was defeated by 322 votes to 240.. MPs quit Labour roles over Brexit vote SNP MPs walk out of PMQs in protest By political editor Laura Kuenssberg A wiser head than me - there's dispute over whether it was Mark Twain or Bismarck! - once remarked that laws are like sausages, if you respect them it's best not to watch them being made. Well the last 48 hours in Westminster may give weight to that. Farce? Fiasco? Or maybe today in Parliament has been in the best tradition of British pantomime. Or perhaps, this is in fact the completely predictable agony of split political parties, with leaders who struggle to command their troops, just trying to make it through after a huge vote that by its very nature, split the country in two. Read more from Laura The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"". Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit. But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy. MPs also overturned other changes made to the bill by the Lords, including a requirement for ministers to set out steps to negotiate a customs union with the EU. The government agreed a compromise with potential Tory rebels earlier this week to work towards a ""customs arrangement"" with the EU. This won the support of the Commons by 325 votes to 298. Other changes insisted upon by the Lords relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, principles of EU law to be retained after Brexit and EU environmental principles were also removed. In response to the votes, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable accused Labour of conspiring with the Conservatives to ""wave through a hard Brexit"". But ministers did make one significant policy concession - on refugee policy after Brexit. They accepted a proposal by Labour MP Yvette Cooper to widen the terms under which unaccompanied child refugees can be reunited with family members living in the UK. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The government had already agreed to allow unaccompanied children to claim asylum in the UK if it was deemed to be in their ""best interests"". But, following Ms Cooper's intervention, ministers have agreed to drop a clause stating this could only happen if their family members already in the UK were over 18 years of age. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said ministers had listened ""very carefully"" to the views of MPs from different parties and would amend the bill when it returns to the Lords next week.

'Bill shock' warning on 118 callsThe regulator Ofcom says it wants to cap the price of directory enquiry calls at ÃÂ£3.10 for 90 seconds.,"118 118 has spent tens of millions on television advertising The telecoms regulator Ofcom has announced it wants to cap the price of 118 directory enquiry calls at Â£3.10 for a 90 second call. Market leader 118 118 charges Â£11.23 for a 90 second call to its service. Ofcom said providers had been increasing prices ""quite significantly"" in recent years and that people are paying much more than they expect. Overall 2% of adults or one million people use a 118 service, rising to 4% among those over the age of 65. Ofcom launched its enquiry into the cost of 118 calls in May 2017. It last investigated the sector in 2013 when the price was about Â£3 for a 90 second call. At that time it said there was not much evidence of ""bill shock"", which is where people are unpleasantly surprised when they receive their bill. Now however, it said some people were suffering ""bill shock"".

The highest cost for a 90 second call was charged by Telecom2 at Â£19.98. The firm's chairman, Robert Johnson, said only one of the company's directory enquiry numbers charged this rate and it was not being ""actively marketed"". The second biggest provider, BT cut the price for its 118 500 number on 1 June to Â£3.10 for 90 seconds, down from Â£6.88. In a statement Ofcom said: ""We're concerned about rising prices for directory enquiries, and callers paying much more than they expect. ""So we're taking action to protect consumers by proposing a cap on the cost of 118 numbers."" Ofcom's consultation will run until 22 August with a decision due at the end of the year.

VW fined â¬1bn over diesel scandal,"Car giant Volkswagen has been fined â¬1bn (Â£880m) by German prosecutors over its diesel emissions scandal. The Braunschweig public prosecutor found VW had sold more than 10 million cars between mid-2007 and 2015 that had emissions-test-cheating software installed. The car firm said it did not plan to appeal against the fine. VW said it had admitted ""its responsibility for the diesel crisis"". The fine is one of the highest ever imposed by German authorities against a company. VW chief executive Herbert Diess said by accepting the fine ""Volkswagen takes responsibility for the diesel crisis,"" ""Further steps are necessary to restore trust in the company and the auto industry,"" he added. The fine in Germany followsa US plea agreement last year,when VW agreed to pay a criminal fine of $4.3bn to resolve criminal and civil penalties. How serious is this for Volkswagen? Well, it's a big fine - â¬1bn is not a small sum. But it pales into insignificance compared with the fines and compensation the group has had to pay out in the US - which add up to well over â¬20bn If this puts an end to criminal proceedings in Europe, VW may well think it's a relatively small price to pay. The company has consistently denied that the software fitted to its cars was actually illegal under European law. Nevertheless, it will welcome the disappearance of that particular legal threat. VW does still face a number of civil lawsuits, brought by disgruntled car owners and shareholders. It's not clear yet what impact VW's admission of ""responsibility for the diesel crisis"" will have on those proceedings. But for the moment, it's possible to imagine suits in Wolfsburg breathing a heavy sigh of relief. It could have been worse. The total cost of the scandal has been much higher. VW has set aside $30bn to pay for its US bill, which includes fixing cars, buying back cars, clean air fines, penalties and compensation. The Volkswagen scandal erupted in September 2015, when the company admitted that nearly 600,000 cars sold in the US were fitted with ""defeat devices"" designed to circumvent emissions tests. Since then it has emerged that VW installed emissions-cheating software in nearly 11 million vehicles worldwide.

"Canada, US & Mexico to host 2026 World Cup","Fifa members voted on the bids at their congress in Moscow The 2026 World Cup will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico after their joint bid beat Morocco's proposal to host it. The 'United 2026' bid was selected by Fifa member nations, winning 134 votes compared to 65 for Morocco. The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever held - with 48 teams playing 80 matches over 34 days. ""Football is the only victor. We are all united in football,"" US Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro said. ""Thank you so, so much for this incredible honour. Thank you for entrusting us with this privilege."" Can US, Canada and Mexico really get along? Of the 211 Fifa member nations, 200 cast a vote at the 68th Fifa Congress in Moscow on Wednesday, with the winning bid needing a majority of 104. Canada, Mexico, Morocco and the US were exempt, while Ghana was absent after the country's government said it haddisbanded its football associationamid allegations of ""widespread"" corruption. Three US territories - Guam, the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico - were among the other member nations to not vote. Both Mexico (1970 and 1986) and the United States (1994) have previously hosted World Cups. Canada staged the Women's World Cup in 2015. Will a single country ever host the World Cup again? Since the 2018 and 2022 tournaments were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively in December 2010, widespread corruption has been exposed in the global game, including allegations of bribery and payment for votes. A BBC Panorama documentary claimed Qatar spent Â£117m on their successful bid for the 2022 World Cup - the first to be held in winter - while former Fifa president Sepp Blatter suggested there was an agreement in place for Russia to host the 2018 tournamentbefore the vote took place. Prominent figures, including Blatter, have since been indicted. As a result Fifa - under the presidency of Gianni Infantino - promised a""more open and transparent""vote to decide the 2026 World Cup host. It was decided that Fifa's 22-strong executive committee would no longer vote on behalf of the membership, as had occurred previously, Instead, the two bids made a final 15-minute presentation in front of congress before the Fifa member nations cast their votes. This video can not be played Three countries react to getting the World Cup 2026 bid The 'United' World Cup will generate $14bn (Â£10.3bn) in revenue and make an $11bn (Â£8.1bn) profit for Fifa, says Cordeiro. Of the 16 host cities, 10 will be in the United States while the remainder will be split evenly between Canada and Mexico. Sixty matches will take place in the US, while Canada and Mexico will host 10 games each. The final will be held at the 84,953-capacity MetLife Stadium, which is home to NFL sides the New York Giants and the New York Jets. The distance between the most northern host city (Edmonton) and the most southern (Mexico City) is almost 3,000 miles, which compares to 1,900 miles at this month's tournament in Russia. The tournament will mark the first time a World Cup has been shared by three host nations. The 1994 World Cup, staged by the US, had thehighest average attendance,externalin the tournament's history, while Mexico was the first nation to host the event twice. In 2017, Fifa said the host nation for the 2026 World Cup would qualify automatically and its slot would be taken from the allocation of its confederation. However, Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the issue of all three hosts - Canada, USA and Mexico - being given automatic slots is still to be decided, with discussions set to take place in the next few weeks. The 23 World Cup 2026 venues in Canada, the United States and Mexico - 10 of the 17 USA cities will be used US Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro:""Hosting the 2026 Fifa World Cup is a rare and important moment to demonstrate that we are all truly united through sport. ""We are humbled by the trust our colleagues in the Fifa family have put in our bid, strengthened by the unity between our three countries and the Concacaf region and excited by the opportunity we have to put football on a new and sustainable path for generations to come."" Morocco Football Federation president Fouzi Lekjaa:""I wish to congratulate Fifa for the conduct of this process and congratulate the president for what he has done in order to move things towards more transparency and more inclusion. ""I would like to reaffirm the determination of my country to continue to work for football and realise one day our dream to host the World Cup in Morocco."" The Football Association (FA):""We congratulate the USA, Canada and Mexico on winning the bid to host the 2026 Fifa World Cup. Both bids were of a very high quality and we welcome the fact that the bidding process was both open and transparent. ""We cast our vote for the 'United' bid as we believe the independent technical assessment made its advantages very clear. However, it is important to note that both bids were deemed to have met the hosting requirements and a tournament in Morocco, close to Europe and in a country that loves football, had a great deal for English football fans to be excited about."" Five times they have bid, and five times they have been overlooked - Morocco are perhaps destined to never host a World Cup. Morocco's bid faced unwanted attention when Fifa secretary general Fatma Samoura was the subject of an investigation into an alleged conflict of interest. Members of Fifa's World Cup bid evaluation task force said she had an undeclared family link with Morocco 2026 bid ambassador El Hadji Diouf. She wascleared of any wrongdoingand dismissed the claims as ""laughable"" and ""unfortunate"". The same evaluation task force laterexpressed concernsover stadiums, the availability of accommodation, and the travel network, despite ratifying their proposals. Nine of the 14 stadiums included in Morocco's bid were yet to be built, while the remaining five required ""significant renovation or upgrading"". But bid chief Hicham el Amrani said he wasconfident the country's infrastructure ""could deliver""and made play of the North African nation's position, nine miles from the southern tip of Spain - dubbing it a ""European"" World Cup.

King 'used fame' to commit sex assaults,"Jonathan King is accused of assaulting 11 teenage boys in the 1970s and 80s Former DJ and music producer Jonathan King used his fame to sexually assault teenage boys, a court has heard. The 73-year-old, of Bayswater, west London, showered the boys with gifts or promised sex with girls their own age, prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said. Mr King is also said to have lured youngsters into his car before driving them home and giving them alcohol. He is standing trial at Southwark Crown Court where he denies 24 serious sexual assault offences between 1970 and 1988. He is alleged to have carried out attacks on 11 boys aged between 14 and 16. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC told the jury of five men and seven women: ""When they were in his power and in no position to repel his advances he would assault them. ""It appears that it was a game of manipulation and power. ""He would play the same routine again and again, honed for success."" The jury was told the gifts included records and concert tickets and the boys were also shown pornography. The court was also told the defendant, who is appearing under his real name Kenneth George King, denies he would ever have sex with anyone under age or force himself on someone without consent. Describing the denials as ""hollow"", Ms Cottage revealed that Mr King was convicted in 2001 of sexual offences against five teenage boys in the 1980s. She also rejected his claims ""not to know or remember most of the boys"" related to the current charges, when there were still photographs, letters or addresses kept in his home ""like trophies"" up to 30 years later. Jurors were warned they would be shown images of a blow-up doll and pictures of naked girls during the trial. ""The reason that you have them at all is because the individual boys, at the time, said they were shown photos... of naked girls to try to encourage them to believe they were going to have sex with those girls,"" Ms Cottage explained. Outlining an account of one of his alleged victims, the prosecutor told the court that the 15-year-old was ""star struck"" when Mr King pulled up next to him near London's Tottenham Court Road in his white Daimler car in April 1970. The teenager was taken to dinner at a Chinese restaurant and given alcohol, and was later left ""shocked and frightened"" after being sexually assaulted at the music mogul's home. Ms Cottage said the complainant came forward after reading an article in the Independent newspaper in 2012, entitled ""Jonathan King: the only apology I have is to say that I was good at seduction"". Mr King denies meeting the boy or having any sexual encounter with him, the court heard. Another alleged victim was 14 or 15 years old when he was allegedly shown ""pop fan goodies"" in the boot of Mr King's car. The boy was allegedly taken to a Birmingham radio station while he was interviewed, plied with champagne and then taken to the Playboy Club in London. Ms Cottage said the complainant was promised sex with girls, shown pornography and supplied with condoms by King, who also took the boy and his sister to Pebble Mill, a BBC studio in Birmingham. Jurors were told he last saw Mr King on his 21st birthday, when the defendant told him ""he was too old and ugly for him now"". The trial continues.

SNP MPs walk out of PMQs in protest,"This video can not be played SNP MPs walked out of the Commons in a row with the Speaker SNP MPs have walked out en masse from Prime Minister's Questions after their Westminster leader was thrown out of the chamber in a row with the Speaker. Ian Blackford refused to sit down when ordered to by John Bercow having asked for the Commons to sit in private. This was in protest at a lack of debate on what he said was a ""power grab"" in the EU Withdrawal Bill. It brought PMQs to a temporary halt as the Speaker consulted his officials on what to do next. Mr Bercow said MPs could vote on the request for a private sitting at the end of PMQs - but when Mr Blackford refused to sit back down he was suspended for the rest of the day's sitting. His fellow SNP MPs followed him out of the chamber. Live updates: MPs debate EU bill changes Reality Check: Has the UK's devolution settlement been ripped up? Female MP in 'dilation' row with Bercow Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict The episode took place during the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session after Mr Blackford said it was a ""democratic outrage"" that MPs had not been given enough time to debate measures he described as a ""power grab"" by Westminster from Scotland. He added: ""Under the circumstances, given the disrespect that's shown, I have got no option but to ask that this House now sits in private."" Mr Bercow said it was better for a vote on his request to take place at the end of the session - but the SNP MP did not agree, rejecting repeated orders from the Speaker to resume his seat. John Bercow ordered Ian Blackford to sit down - but he refused The next MP to be called for a question was Conservative MP Luke Hall, who joked: ""With the amount of people leaving, it feels like one of my after-dinner speeches."" Speaking afterwards, Mr Blackford told the BBC's Daily Politics his party would ""use Parliamentary procedures to best effect"" to protest against what he said was devolution being ""ripped up"" as powers are repatriated from Brussels. His suspension from the Commons means he is unable to take part in the second day of  debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill. This video can not be played Ian Blackford complained about a ""power grab by the government against the Scottish Parliament and people"" Parliament retains the right to hold debates in private and any MP can propose that members of the public and press be removed from the galleries at any time. If such a proposal is made, the Commons Speaker must put the motion ""That this House sit in private"" to a vote without debate. But the procedure is seldom successful - attempts to exclude members of the public are usually deployed as a device to disrupt or delay the House's proceedings. MPs used to call out ""I spy strangers"" to invoke this procedure, but this phrase was replaced with the current wording in 1998. Scottish MPs' voices 'have not been heard' Scottish government wants devolution changes The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy, aiming to ensure a smooth transition on Brexit day when EU law no longer applies in the UK. But the Scottish Parliament has refused to give its consent to the legislation, saying policy in devolved areas that is currently decided in Brussels is being reclaimed by Westminster. The bill is currently making its way through Parliament  - and although devolution was to be debated in the second half of Tuesday's session, there were only a few minutes left for this after voting on amendments went on for almost three hours. The Brexit bill says that the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit. But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement. It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK. But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years. It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government.

Untold stories from the Grenfell wall," The Grenfell Wall sprang up overnight. Within hours, hundreds of people had left messages of sympathy and support. Relatives of those missing brought favourite items, teddies and photos. Missing posters were plastered everywhere, bearing the faces of those still unaccounted for and telephone numbers for anyone who might have information. The wall is still there today in the shadow of the tower. It provides a glimpse into the terrors that unfolded on 14 June 2017. The idea for the wall came from Jamie Sewell, who works for the Eden network, a charity that places youth workers on council estates to build links between communities and the church. Jamie Sewell Jamie had lived alongside Grenfell Tower for five years and, in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, he drew from his experiences as a youth worker. He and his wife had opened their home to teenagers on the fringes of gang life. Three years before the fire, one of those boys had died. He was just 15 and Jamie had helped with the grieving process by providing a quiet space in the church where friends could meet and share memories. With that in mind, the day after the fire, he took his van to a garden centre to buy large white boards, a little wicker heart and fairy lights. His team of youth workers spent that day comforting people who were looking for loved ones, and talking to youngsters who were upset at what had happened. Volunteers construct the wall It was 20:00 BST when his exhausted team decided to finally close the doors of the Latymer Community Church. Then, they set about creating the Grenfell Wall. “All of our team, by that point, were just absolutely wrecked,” he says. “We started putting it up and we weren’t sure how it was going to be received. I think we were a bit nervous. “We hadn’t even finished writing ‘Prayer Wall’, and we just quickly became swamped by people grabbing pens off us.” Then, Jamie recalls, those around him “just started writing and pouring their hearts out on to these boards”. People write on the wall A day later, Jamie’s boards were almost full and people started bringing their own down, attaching them along walkways surrounding the tower. As well as writing messages, they laid flowers and wreaths, with firefighters hanging their shirts on the nearby railings, along with heartfelt messages describing their sorrow. Firefighter's T-shirt Families of some of those missing made small shrines and placed toys and photos next to candles as they huddled together waiting for news. Children light candles “People just started grieving together,” says Jamie. “For me it became a real place to go, among the madness and the chaos, to be quiet and just to walk around and read, and I suppose it made me personally feel a lot less lonely.” Some of the first to write on the wall were volunteers who came from all over the country to bring food, water and clothing. Listen toThe Grenfell Wall, from BBC Radio 4, on the BBC iPlayer. Naeem Brisco runs a design company in Leicester and had woken to news of the fire. Naeem Brisco He has overcome more than his own fair share of difficulties - from getting into trouble as a kid, then going against family expectations by marrying for love rather than letting his family find him a wife. When that marriage broke down, he became homeless and was helped back on his feet by a stranger - which, he thinks, explains why he felt so moved to act in the aftermath of the Grenfell fire. Naeem Brisco He temporarily closed his business, brought his team together and loaded a van with supplies. When he got to London, close to Grenfell Tower, Naeem unloaded his van by organising volunteers into a human chain that passed donations down to the supply centre. Volunteers move the supplies: Nothing had prepared him for the smell that hung in the area and the sense of distress as he helped a teenager look for his parents. The wall became Naeem’s way of making sense of the situation. “Sometimes you’ve got to express yourself and by putting something in writing - I wouldn’t say it’s a closure, but it’s an element of you giving your condolence,” he says.  “You felt good when you wrote something. You’ve given a message, you know what I mean?” Naeem's message: Naeem positioned himself close to the tower as he gave out supplies - food, water and clothing - to those searching for information. School children with posters of Jessica Urbano Some, like the schoolmates of 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez, wore T-shirts bearing her photo and face masks to protect themselves from smoke from the still-smouldering tower. Maryam Adam, for her part, was bewildered and full of guilt that she could have done more to warn her friends in the tower. Maryam Adam Maryam lived next to the flat where the fire started and her husband, Abdulwahab, had woken her after their neighbour alerted him to blaze. She thought the flames would be easily extinguished and only agreed to leave because she was pregnant and worried about her baby. Her biggest regret is that she didn’t take her phone - as she watched the flames reach higher, she was unable to alert friends still trapped inside. There had been great excitement among people she knew in Grenfell when she first told them of her pregnancy. In the days following the fire, she held out hope that friends might be found alive: Rania and her two daughters, Fethia and Hania; Nura and her children, Yahya, Firdaws and Yaqub; and Amal with her daughter, Amaya, who had an infectious laugh. Poster: Amal and Amaya Maryam moved into her flat in 2008, after 10 years of living in a hostel. She is from Somalia and grew up in Sudan, before coming to the UK in her 20s and loving everything about her new life. She and her husband shared their one-bedroom flat with her brother and his wife and they were happy - all the more so once she found out she was pregnant. Her life was turned upside down by the fire and, a year on, she still struggles to make sense of it. “I know many, many, many of my friends died. They died in Grenfell,” she says. “When you see somebody asking for help and you can’t do anything for them, it’s too difficult.” The one piece of good news for Maryam was the birth, in November, of her son, Mohammed. Relatives in Sudan sent her traditional costume, which she proudly shows us as we talk. Maryam and family The family are in temporary accommodation - it’s overcrowded, with boxes stacked in a corner and a makeshift bed for her brother in the small living room. There is no room for a cot for Mohammed, who shares a bed with his parents. “You see, that is how we live. Just always we are dreaming, waiting just to get good news, but I don’t know if we are going to hear it or not.” Maryam in temporary accommodation She thinks of all the nights she spent not sleeping, worrying about her child. “We are not living in our home, or anything like it. I don’t know where I’m going to move, where I’m going to live. “And I’m fed up because I don’t know for how long I’m going to be waiting. We lost everything in Grenfell, we lost everything.” Maryam gradually accepted that she would not see her friends again. Amaya Tuccu-Ahmedin She often thinks of little Amaya and the picture on the Grenfell Wall - a cheeky grin as the three-year-old plays outdoors. It was taken by Luke Rosher, a teacher at St Peter’s Nursery on Portobello Road: “I took that photo actually, in the park, the playground - pure and innocent and lovely.” Luke at the nursery The head teacher at the nursery, Tracey Lloyd, had got to know Amaya’s mother, Amal, well. Tracey laughs as she recalls the wonderful meals Amal would prepare on sharing days. Amaya’s dad Mohamednur was committed to his daughter’s education, having earned both a degree and an MSc since arriving in Britain. He was originally from Eritrea and had been active with anti-government forces there. The family lived on the 19th floor of the tower and Amaya died in the arms of her mother. The pair held each other tight in their last moments of consciousness. The Grenfell Wall became an important part of the grieving process for nursery staff, who went together to remember the family. It also provided a way of helping young classmates who struggled to make sense of the loss. Posters on the railings near Grenfell One six-year-old neighbour of Amaya’s used red pencil to draw fierce flames over the windows of a tall tower. Other youngsters drew children screaming at windows. Luke worked with his class to put together handprints on a remembrance board that they took to the site. The poster the nursery children made for Amaya A year on, he is repeating the task. “I made a poster with the children, just little tiny handprints to show this is not just affecting grown-ups,” he says. “It is little children who are seeing this and living this and wanting to do this. There were, I think, 20 there and then we put a little message saying: ‘We miss you, Amaya.’” Tracey says: “I feel very close to Amal and Amaya and Mo and the auntie when I’m there and I think it’s important that we do remember those families, those innocent lives that were cut short way, way, way before their time.” Both Tracey and Luke remember the rush of emotions they both experienced when they first saw the Grenfell Wall. “Just seeing all the tributes was just amazing,” says Luke. “It was so many conflicting emotions.  There was obviously the sadness and, just disbelief - but then there was also this rush of, like, ‘Oh my gosh.’” Tracey recalls “flowers everywhere, candles, and things that people had written - eulogies, their thoughts - friends, families, the fire brigade with their T-shirts, and it just seemed to go on and on and on”. Firefighter's T-shirt Many of those who survived the fire were given temporary hotel rooms in the surrounding area - coming back to the estate to collect clothes and register at the relief centre. They had lost everything, including passports, bank cards, phones and computers as they fled, but this paled into insignificance compared with the trauma of not knowing who had survived. Miguel Alves and his wife Fatima were desperate for news of their friends Marcio Gomes, his wife Andreia and their two children, 12-year-old Luana and 10-year-old Megan. Miguel and Marcio play football together They had heard nothing since around 03:00, when the family began their escape from the 21st floor. Fatima prayed that they would be found alive. Miguel made contact with the Portuguese authorities, who initially told him they hadn’t made it out. The Gomes family had lived in the tower for 10 years With so many gathered at the Grenfell Wall, rumours were rife. There was conjecture about the death toll and stories of a baby thrown from a window. Missing posters came and went, with some marked “found”, and others staying intact. While Miguel and Fatima waited to hear about the Gomes family, their 20-year-old son Tiago looked at the missing posters put up by volunteers from Solidarity Sports, which provides activities and opportunities for disadvantaged children. Miguel and Fatima, with their son Tiago and daughter Ines Tiago, now 21, is studying physics at King’s College London and, passing the wall, he saw faces he remembered. He recalled teaching 13-year-old Yahya Hashim how to knot his tie on his first day of secondary school. Missing poster: Firdaws and Yahya There was also a poster of Steve Power, 63. Steve would give him advice while out walking his two bull terriers, telling Tiago to make the most of his education and that hard work would pay off in the end. Candles and missing posters Some nights, as he drifts in and out of sleep, Tiago realises: “Oh wait, I’m not in my bed.” He hopes that in the morning, it will all turn out to have been a dream, and he’ll return to normal life. And then he wakes up and finds he is still in the hotel: “Oh, this did actually happen. As I’m trying to sleep, I almost pinch myself saying ‘Wake up now,’ because I can’t deal with it any more.” Tiago and his sister, 16-year-old Ines Alves, had spent most of their childhood living in the tower and loved living there. Ines Alves A year on, Ines is still receiving counselling, but says it is hard to cope with images from the night - people calling for help and phone lights in the windows - coupled with the loss of everything they owned and friends they cared for. “Everyone knew each other,” she says. “You’d see each other in the flats and say ‘Hi’ or ‘Bye,’ or smile if you saw them in the street. It’s starting to hit me slowly, everything that’s happened. I still feel like I’m in a nightmare and tomorrow I’m going to wake up and go back home.” The pictures of Yahya, 13, his 12-year-old sister, Firdaws and little brother, Yaqub, were taken by Sean Mendez, who runs Solidarity Sports. The siblings had lived on the 22nd floor and, as soon as he heard about the fire, Sean went to hospitals searching for news. Since then he was worked with their aunt, Aseema Kedir, to set up the Hashim Family Legacy that, last October, enabled 16 children to fulfil the dream that Firdaws once had - to visit Walt Disney World in Florida. Sean talks about helping children affected by the fire: Similar legacies are being created by others, like Mike Volpe, the Director at Opera Holland Park. He lost a friend and employee, Deborah Lamprell, in the fire and he has organised a memorial concert to raise funds to help local children. “We’ve called it Hope for Grenfell because yes, it’s a part-memorial, it remembers all those people, it remembers Debbie for us in particular,” he says. “But it also says we need to have some hope. Everyone’s got to go on despite the need for justice and to find out what happened but we do actually have to go on. There has to be some hope, somewhere.” Miguel Alves kept hope alive while he waited for news of his missing friend, Marcio Gomes. But in the face of such a tragedy he knows it was only luck that spared him and his family. Fatima Alves Miguel and Fatima had been returning to their 13th-floor flat in the early hours when the lift stopped at the fourth floor. They saw the smoke and Miguel went up to wake his children and neighbours while Fatima waited outside. The couple are originally from Portugal. He is a chauffeur and they had saved for the £82,000 they needed to buy their flat. Living there he had become good friends with Marcio and his family. As soon as he escaped, Miguel phoned Marcio and urged him to get out. The fire service, however, had told the family to stay put. Twice they had tried to escape, but the smoke had beaten them back. With Miguel’s phone calls growing more urgent, Marcio contemplated the enormity of the decision he had to make. “Miguel said, ‘Look, you need to go out’ and obviously he was getting very agitated about it, and I said: ‘I’ve already tried twice,’ he recalls. “Then I said: ‘It’s just pitch black,’ and it’s thick black smoke. You couldn’t even see your hand in front.” Marcio could hear Miguel growing increasingly agitated and distressed. “You can see actually this is a lot worse than what you’re thinking. And also I had my neighbour and her daughter so, it’s a lot of responsibility if things go wrong. I’m thankful for Miguel because he made me more aware that this is really bad.” As the flames grew closer, he realised he didn’t have a choice: “There was no way we were going to survive by staying.” Marcio gathered wet towels and tried to stay at the rear of the building as they descended the stairwell. “You couldn’t see anything,” he says. “It was pitch black, absolutely pitch black.” He didn’t notice the dead bodies at first. “We only realised once we stepped on a body or tripped over - but there was nothing we could do for them and my focus was trying to get everybody downstairs. Luana and our neighbour’s daughter, they both then passed out at the same time. Didn’t see where they fell, you couldn’t see anything at all.” It was firefighters who found the two girls and carried them to safety. They spent nearly a month in induced comas, as did 10-year-old Megan and Marcio’s wife, Andreia. She was seven months pregnant and, before the fire, the couple had decorated a nursery for the son they were planning to call Logan. On its wall they had written: “Twinkle, twinkle, little star, do you know how loved you are?” Logan was stillborn when he was delivered and Marcio cradled him in his arms, willing him to breathe. Marcio and Andreia tell how they escaped the blaze: “I think we’re still processing it in all fairness, and I think we will always process it for the rest of our lives,” he says. “You’re never going to be 100% as you were before. You try to move on, you know - that’s how humans cope with things. There’s certain things I can’t talk about because I get really emotional - to do with the night, to do with my son. “You try and make new memories and move on. I think you get better at controlling the emotions as time goes on but it’s still difficult and it will always be difficult.” Marcio and Miguel have supported each other since the fire and feel that their weekly games of football provide an outlet for the grief. Marcio and Miguel Following the tragedy, other players donated kit and even football boots. Marcio is still experiencing some trouble with his breathing, caused by smoke inhalation, but seldom misses a game. “You know it just helps, I think, for me,” he says. “Just to talk to each other and it just helps process what happened.” Marcio and Miguel talk about their football games: Fatima, meanwhile, takes comfort from the Cenacle of Missionary Prayer Group. The shrine she had in her 13th-floor flat was destroyed in the fire, but she has rebuilt it in her temporary accommodation. She says it is nice to finally have a kitchen to prepare family meals - she likes to cook and to entertain, something she did regularly in their Grenfell flat. Fatima's shrine When the family is on their own, the memories return, she says. Miguel agrees. They have to enjoy life, he says. “We can be ashes inside of the tower, you know? Life is too short.” The couple have had counselling since the fire, as have their children. Ines is now in sixth form, having passed the GCSE chemistry exam she sat the day after the fire. The family recently were allowed to see inside the shell of their old flat but were not really prepared for how upsetting it would be. Fatima recalls seeing the metal frame from her son’s bed and his desk bent out of shape. “It was very sad,” she says. “I started crying when I saw that because in my mind, from the beginning, I said: ‘No, something will be saved.’“It was hard to see.” Since then, they have been sent three small boxes and two larger ones containing items salvaged from the ashes - the mugs that were inside the metal dishwasher, some coins from Tiago’s piggybank, a watch and a small cross, which is singed black around the edges. Miguel and Fatima's possessions Everything is in small see-through pouches, each of which smells of the fire when they are opened. It is emotionally draining and, to date, Fatima has emptied just two of the five boxes, and she has no idea whether or not to keep things. They are a reminder of her past life, but it is painful to see the state of them now. The family will soon move into a more permanent home, a nice house close to their old flat - a place they can finally call home. One of the first people to place a missing poster on the memorial wall was Thomas Murphy, originally from Ireland, who is a member of several community groups in the area and has lunch twice a week at the Salvation Army in Portobello Road. Thomas Murphy Maj Paul Scott, who oversees things there, says it was all hands on deck when the fire broke out, with Thomas and other volunteers helping sort out the donations and get people the help they needed. “Everybody just pulled together. It didn’t matter what religion we were or they were. We were amazed because we had about 80 people at one point who were looking for missing friends and relations.” This was particularly true for Thomas and the lunch club participants who knew some of those affected. For 90-year-old Olive it was painful to witness her granddaughters upset at losing a classmate, five-year-old Isaac Paulos. Marjory, 61, mourned the death of Marjorie Vital, who died with her 50-year-old son, Ernie. As locals they pass the wall, sometimes seeing vigils and memorial services, like the one held for 29-year-old Berkti Haftom and her son, Biruk, who was 12. The fire shattered many close bonds - for Thomas it meant the loss of his friend, Vincent Chiejina, who was born in Nigeria and, like him, was active in the Open Age Charity and St Francis of Assisi Church in Notting Hill. Thomas put up missing posters even though he knew his search was probably in vain: “I wasn’t naive to think that he had escaped out of that because I stood there that night and I watched that inferno.” Missing poster: Vincent Chiejina In the aftermath, Thomas printed out photos and went to the Grenfell Wall, asking anyone he could find for news of his 60-year-old friend, who lived alone on the 17th floor. During the weeks that followed he found out more about Vincent, who he says had always been protective of his privacy, but was incredibly caring and determined to help the most vulnerable in society. Vincent and Thomas “I just appreciated him and I found him to be a nice person,” Thomas says. “And eventually he told me what happened to him, that he was studying at university - mathematics was his forte - and then snap, his mind went. He told me as much as he wanted to and that was it, I left it at that, being discreet about it, you know. Whatever it was, it did a lot of harm to him. And I thought: ‘My God, ending up on that floor on your own.’ And he’s not alone, he’s not alone in that position.” For the community, the fate of the Grenfell Wall is still to be decided. At the moment, sheets of plastic help preserve the messages of love and support. Some local residents are angry that the wall has not been removed and feel that it is stopping people from moving forward. One woman who asked not to be named points to sightseers drifting by and camera crews in the area. “Tacky. It’s beginning to look tacky,” she says. “So how long does that stay there? Where does it all go, that stuff? And when? We all need to move on. There have been vigils after vigils and you come home and it’s like - how many memorial services do we need? And who are these actually for?” For his part, Jamie Sewell, who first put up the boards, sees this as an important opportunity to consider important issues raised by the fire. Jamie Sewell He hopes that some form of permanent legacy is forthcoming. The next challenge for the community, he says, is figuring out how it will remember the tragedy. Some people on the outside think that Grenfell is something that happened in the past and it's not happening any more, says Jamie: “But actually, there is still so much grief, so many questions.” One year on, looking at the wall “makes me realise that we were all in it together and we were all feeling much the same kind of thing - there’s anger, a massive sense of loss, a massive sense of injustice and a massive sense of confusion”, he says. “I think that’s what the Grenfell Wall ended up representing.” See the messages in close-up.

Battle starts for lifeline Yemen port,"This video can not be played Former child soldiers, a landmine survivor and an internally displaced child tell their stories Pro-government forces in Yemen, backed by Saudi Arabia, have begun attacking a key port held by rebel fighters. The coastal city of Hudaydah is where most of the aid arrives for people in Yemen's rebel-held areas. Agencies have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe. About eight million people are at risk of starvation in the war-torn country. Pro-government strikes began after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels ignored a deadline to withdraw by midnight (21:00 GMT on Tuesday). It is the first time the Saudi-led coalition of mostly Gulf states has tried to capture such a well-defended major city in Yemen. Yemen's conflict in 400 words Who is fighting whom? The UN Security Council is expected to meet to discuss the situation on Thursday, following a request from the UK. The conflict in Yemen has raged since late 2014, when the Houthis and allied forces seized north-western parts of the country, including the capital Sanaa, and eventually forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Sunni Arab states launched a military campaign in March 2015 to restore Mr Hadi's government. The Saudi-led coalition has accused the rebels of using Hudaydah to smuggle in Iranian weapons. Both Iran and the rebels deny this. The coalition says victory could break the stalemate in the war and force the Houthis to the negotiating table. But the port is a lifeline for the majority of Yemen's population and the UN had been trying to get parties to the conflict to reach a deal that would avert an attack. An estimated 600,000 people live in the area. Robert Mardini, regional head for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said the attack was ""likely to exacerbate an already catastrophic humanitarian situation"". A cholera outbreak has killed thousands of people in Yemen, including many in Hudaydah On Friday, UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Yemen Lise Grande warned: ""In a prolonged worst case, we fear that as many as 250,000 people may lose everything - even their lives."" Read more onwhy the battle for Hudaydah matters. On Tuesday, the exiled government said its forces and allied Saudi-led troops launched their assault after ""exhausting all peaceful and political means"". Coalition warplanes and warships later began bombarding Houthi positions. An alliance of Yemeni forces supporting the internationally recognised government is leading the ground assault. The Saudi-owned Al Arabiya network reported ""intense and concentrated"" strikes near the port. ""The liberation of Hudaydah port is a turning point in our struggle to recapture Yemen from the militias that hijacked it to serve foreign agendas,"" the exiled government said. The rebels have said they will ""confront the coalition of aggression on all fronts"". By BBC correspondent Nawal Al-Maghafi For the last three years the Saudi-led coalition hasn't made any major advances. But in the last few weeks, the rebel side has lost a lot of fighters and commanders. The coalition sees a window of opportunity and is desperate to gain ground. It has argued repeatedly that a Hudaydah offensive can be mounted quickly and effectively, leaving the port functioning at a higher capacity. But if the battle is prolonged, it will leave millions of Yemenis without food, fuel and other vital supplies. In reality, families in Hudaydah are already starving and desperately relying on humanitarian aid. Reporting from the city last year, I saw children who were severely undeveloped, their ribs protruding. This video can not be played How children are starving in Yemen's war They were living off a peanut-based paste provided by aid agencies. The hospitals were desperately trying to do what they could but were overwhelmed by cases of malnutrition and cholera. Now this battle threatens to push these people off the brink. Meanwhile, the possibility of the warring sides returning to the negotiating table seems even more remote. About 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed in the fighting since March 2015, according to the UN. The vast majority of the casualties have been the result of coalition air strikes. The UN's figures do not include those who have died of disease and malnutrition. Terror of life under siege in Yemen The girl with the strawberry ring The conflict and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid. It has created the world's largest food emergency and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,290 people. In a tweet, the UN's envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, called on both sides to end the fighting and find a negotiated settlement. Allow Twitter content?

Antarctica's ice melt 'has accelerated'Satellites observing the White Continent detect a jump in the rate of ice being lost to the ocean.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Four things you should know about Antarctica Antarctica is shedding ice at an accelerating rate. Satellites monitoring the state of the White Continent indicate some 200 billion tonnes a year are now being lost to the ocean as a result of melting. This is pushing up global sea levels by 0.6mm annually - a three-fold increase since 2012 when the last such assessment was undertaken. Scientists report the new numbersin the journal Nature,external. Governments will need to take account of the information and its accelerating trend as they plan future defences to protect low-lying coastal communities. The researchers say the losses are occurring predominantly in the West of the continent, where warm waters are getting under and melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. Mission launches to weigh Earth's water Biggest ever Antarctic field campaign Giant iceberg splits from Antarctic ""We can't say when it started - we didn't collect measurements in the sea back then,"" explained Prof Andrew Shepherd, who leads the Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (Imbie). ""But what we can say is that it's too warm for Antarctica today. It's about half a degree Celsius warmer than the continent can withstand and it's melting about five metres of ice from its base each year, and that's what's triggering the sea-level contribution that we're seeing,"" he told BBC News. This video can not be played Andrew Shepherd: ""The study incorporates 24 independent satellite assessments"" Space agencies have been flying satellites over Antarctica since the early 1990s. Europe, in particular, has an unbroken observation record going back to 1992. These spacecraft can tell how much ice is present by measuring changes in the height of the ice sheet and the speed at which it moves towards the sea. Specific missions also havethe ability to weigh the ice sheetby sensing changes in the pull of gravity as they pass overhead. Imbie's job has been to condense all this information into a single narrative that best describes what is happening on the White Continent. Glaciologists usually talk of three distinct regions because they behave slightly differently from each other. In West Antarctica, which is dominated by those marine-terminating glaciers, the assessed losses have climbed from 53 billion to 159 billion tonnes per year over the full period from 1992 to 2017. On the Antarctic Peninsula, the finger of land that points up to South America, the losses have risen from seven billion to 33 billion tonnes annually. This is largely, say scientists, because the floating ice platforms sitting in front of some glaciers have collapsed, allowing the ice behind to flow faster. East Antarctica, the greater part of the continent, is the only region to have shown some growth. Much of this region essentially sits out of the ocean and collects its snows over time and is not subject to the same melting forces seen elsewhere. But the gains are likely quite small, running at about five billion tonnes per year. And the Imbie team stresses that the growth cannot counterbalance what is happening in the West and on the Peninsula. Indeed, it is probable that an unusually big dump of snow in the East just before the last assessment in 2012 made Antarctica as a whole look less negative than the reality. Globally, sea levels are rising by about 3mm a year. This figure is driven by several factors, including the expansion of the oceans as they warm. But what is clear from the latest Imbie assessment is that Antarctica is becoming a significant player. ""A three-fold increase now puts Antarctica in the frame as one of the largest contributors to sea-level rise,"" said Prof Shepherd, who is affiliated to Leeds University, UK. ""The last time we looked at the polar ice sheets, Greenland was the dominant contributor. That's no longer the case."" In total, Antarctica has shed some 2.7 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, corresponding to an increase in global sea level of more than 7.5mm. Artwork: European satellites in particular have an unbroken record going back to 1992 The latest edition of the journal Nature has a number of studies looking at the state of the continent and how it might change in a warming world. One of these papers,external, led by US and German scientists, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It should lift up - something scientists call isostatic readjustment. New evidence suggests where this process has occurred in the past, it can actually constrain ice losses -  as the land rises, it snags on the floating fronts of marine-terminating glaciers. ""It's like applying the brakes on a bike,"" said Dr Pippa Whitehouse from Durham University. ""Friction on the bottom of the ice, which was floating but has now grounded again, slows everything and changes the whole dynamic upstream. We do think the rebound (in the future) will be fast, but not fast enough to stop the retreat we've kicked off with today's warming. ""Ocean warming is going to make the ice too thin for this process to help."" This video can not be played Pippa Whitehouse: ""Push a balloon filled with honey - it rebounds when you remove your hand"" In Imbie's last assessment, the contribution of Antarctica to global sea-levels was considered to be tracking at the lower end of the projections that computer simulations had made of the possible height of the oceans at the end of the century. The new assessment sees the contribution track the upper end of these projections. ""At the moment, we have projections going through to 2100, which is sort of on a lifetime of what we can envisage, and actually the sea-level rise we will see is 50/60cm,"" said Dr Whitehouse. ""And that is not only going to impact people who live close to the coast, but actually when we have storms - the repeat time of major storms and flooding events is going to be exacerbated,"" she told BBC News.

Parents sports day video dispute warningMums and dads filming races are told they cannot challenge results even if they send in footage.,"Some parents have brought video ""evidence"" into a school in Cardiff to dispute sports day results Parents using video footage to challenge the results of a primary school sports day have been told the teacher's word is final. As parents watched their children take part in the event at a Cardiff primary school many filmed it. But some then brought video ""evidence"" in to dispute the results declared by teachers on the finishing line. The headteacher of Ysgol Mynydd Bychan in Cathays has sent a letter to parents warning them to stop the practice. Parents have demanded official standings were changed based on their footage, but the school had refused to budge in the results row. Sporting 'scandals' through the years How to ace sports day In a strongly worded letter, head Sian Evans has said: ""Teacher's word is final"". Mynydd Bychan school holds its sports day at Cardiff's National Indoor Athletics Centre The letter added: ""The members of staff at the finish line, and nobody else, have the absolute final say and as to the first, second and third place positions. ""Unfortunately, during the last few years parents have approached members of staff with evidence that they had filmed on electronic devices such as iPads in order to prove that their child should have been awarded a higher position in a particular race and comments also appeared on Facebook. The school holds its sports day at the nearby National Indoor Athletics Centre on the Cardiff Met University campus ""If this happens again, there is a strong possibility that we will have to consider changing the competitive nature of our sports morning.""

PM's Questions: The verdict,"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. This was an extraordinary session, dominated by the mass walkout of the SNP's MPs. You canread all about that here. That rather took the spotlight off what was meant to be the main event. For the second week running, Jeremy Corbyn focused his firepower on the government's handling of Brexit, mining the rich seam of material offered to him by Boris Johnson's leaked remarks to a private dinner. Why didn't Mrs May take the foreign secretary's advice and ask Donald Trump to take over Brexit negotiations, he asked. The PM was initially unable to answer as she was drowned out by the noise of MPs. Mrs May eventually managed to get her reply in - a swipe at Labour's position. MPs then fell silent as she made a detour to talk about the first anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire - a subject raised by Mr Corbyn at the start of his question. Allow Twitter content?

She said all of the 203 families left homeless by the tragedy had been offered new permanent or temporary accommodation and 183 had accepted an offer of a permanent home. She then paid tribute to the ""dignity and strength"" the victims of the fire had shown. Mr Corbyn also paid tribute to the families - but said the ""reality"" was that some of them still did not have homes. Turning back to Brexit, he asked whether the transition period would go on until December 2021. The PM guessed he was talking about the ""backstop"". She gave him a lecture on what the backstop is and why the government does not expect it ever to be used. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I am not really sure whether it is a backstop or a backslide she is taking about here,"" said Mr Corbyn. He then asked - as he had done last week - when the government's Brexit white paper was going to be published. ""Where is it?"" bayed opposition MPs. ""Just calm down,"" the PM told them, it would be published after the June EU summit, she said. But Cabinet Office minister David Lidington had told the BBC it would be published in July, said Mr Corbyn. Mrs May, speaking as if explaining how the calendar works to a child, said: ""After the June European Council is July."" This video can not be played Mr Corbyn is told the white says the white paper will be published after ""after the June Council"" She then took a swipe at Labour ""divisions"" and a guide to deselecting Labour MPs which had reportedly been posted on the internet by activists. ""You have got to face facts - there may well be a meltdown,"" said Mr Corbyn. A gleeful Mrs May pointed a finger at the Labour benches. No, explained the Labour leader, these were not his words but the words of Boris Johnson at that private dinner. Another smile from Mr Johnson. The foreign secretary appeared to want ""more friction and more disruption to the economy"" as a result of Brexit, he claimed. Mrs May replied with a list of Labour's shifting positions on Brexit, claiming that only her party could deliver the ""will of the British people"". Allow Twitter content?

Her party was so divided on Brexit they were even whispering about her behind her back at Prime Minister's Questions, said Mr Corbyn. ""How much more damage is the prime minister going to do to the country before she realises the important thing is to get a deal for the people of this country, not one to appease the clashing giant egos of her Cabinet?"" This video can not be played Theresa May jokes about the name of the headline act at Labour's summer music festival. It was the Labour Party that was trying to ""frustrate"" Brexit, said Mrs May. She threw in an attack on the last Labour government's record on employment before unveiling her big joke. Labour had organised a music festival, Labour Live, she told MPs - ""I will pass over the fact that it is going to have a solidarity tent, which obviously won't have any Labour MPs"" - but the two headlining acts were ""the shadow chancellor and the Magic Numbers"". ""That just about sums them up,"" she said. This video can not be played SNP MPs walked out of the Commons in a row with the Speaker The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford pulled what is known in the trade as an ""I spy strangers move"" in protest at what he said was a ""power grab"" during last night's debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill. Mr Blackford demanded a vote on holding an emergency debate on Brexit and devolution after, he said, the SNP had been denied a voice on the matter in Tuesday's debate. Mrs May refused and said Brexit would give more power to Holyrood and, in any case, it was Labour that was to blame for the procedural manoeuvrings on Tuesday night. Slightly chaotic scenes followed as Speaker Bercow consulted his clerks and got into a spat with Mr Blackford, who refused to back down, and the Speaker then telling fellow SNP MP David Linden: ""Don't tell me what the procedures of this house are - there can be a vote at the end of this session and not now."" The Speaker then ordered Mr Blackford to leave the Commons and the SNP eventually walked out en masse, leaving a large gap in the order paper, which had five SNP MPs lined up to ask the PM a question. Tory MP Luke Hall, the first to be called after the debacle, said the mass walkout reminded him of one of his after dinner speeches. This video can not be played SNP MPs walked out of the Commons in a row with the Speaker Jacob Rees-Mogg gave Mrs May a sharp reminder of the Brexiteers' demands for the government not to be over-ruled by Parliament on Brexit, following Mrs May's concessions on a ""meaningful vote"" that enabled her to avoid defeat in Tuesday's Withdrawal Bill vote.

Here's the BBC's Mark D'Arcy's take on the session: Phew! First a really lively set of exchanges between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, then an orchestrated display of SNP fury, culminating in a walkout. The exchanges between the leaders had a rare level of personal needle - and the stare the PM gave Jeremy Corbyn, when he taunted her with the leaked comments made by Boris Johnson, suggested he had scored a direct hit. And he then continued with the simple tactic of quoting the Foreign Secretary's words against his boss. Neither of his targets enjoyed the experience. Given the government's current Brexit disarray, he had an open goal before him, but he's missed before - and this time the ball thundered into the back of the net. (Conservative Brexiteers will have been pleased, though, by the PM's later replies to Jacob Rees Mogg and Philip Davies, setting her face against a ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit that could risk overturning the referendum verdict.) Then came Ian Blackford. His protest, attempt to force a vote, and subsequent walkout may all be mocked in Westminster, but they may play differently with Scottish voters. I'm old enough to remember Nick Clegg making a protest in 2008, about the treatment of the then third party, the Lib Dems, (ironically on an amendment calling for an EU referendum) and briefly discomforting Speaker Martin. His frontbencher Ed Davey was ordered out of the chamber, and Mr Clegg then led a walkout - calling the Speaker's ruling a ""constitutional outrage"". Third parties traditionally find the way the Commons works, which is carved up between the government and the main opposition party, intensely frustrating. The SNP are good at using Westminster for clever, social media-savvy political theatre - perhaps because they don't hold it in quite the same reverence as the other parties; remember them whistling ""Ode to Joy"" during a division on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill? I would not be surprised if they try to generate a few more YouTube moments. The other issue that might worry the PM is the trains. Both Conservative Nadine Dorries and Labour's Jeff Smith raised it - and while Brexit dominates Westminster, many MPs will return to their constituencies at the weekend, to find their voters fulminating about packed or cancelled trains. Oh, and for the first time, PMQs breached the 1pm mark; it had to happen, I suppose.

Devolution settlement ripped up?,"The claim:The UK's 20-year devolution convention has been ""ripped up"". Reality Check verdict:The convention has been undermined but there is no legal reason why the UK government cannot ignore the Scottish Parliament over Brexit. Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right? Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commonsspent less than 20 minutesdebating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford,leading a walk-out of his MPsduring Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit. The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling. And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers. Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. SNP MPs walked out of the Commons on Wednesday The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster. However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". A protest against the so-called ""power grab"" was held outside the Scottish Parliament earlier this year This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier. The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example? Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK. He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent. Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"". However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act. This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".

Scottish MPs' voices 'not heard',"The UK government won the key vote by 324 to 298 Scottish MPs have insisted their voices have not been heard following the failure to reach a deal over the EU Withdrawal Bill. MPs are debating changes to the Brexit bill as ministers seek to reverse defeats in the House of Lords. Holyrood has not backed the bill but there was little time on Tuesday for MPs to discuss their concerns. The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford described the lack of debate ""a democratic outrage"". Scottish Labour's Ian Murray accused the UK government of failing to provide adequate time. But Scottish Secretary David Mundell insisted the voices of the people of the UK as a whole had been listened to and acted on. Mr Mundell said he was ""very disappointed"" by the lack of devolved consent, but insisted that ""the bill can prevail without it"". The Scottish government, however, says its wants changes to the devolution settlement. Scottish government wants devolution changes Ministers win Brexit vote after concession Minister quits government over Brexit MPs are debating the EU Withdrawal Bill, the UK government's flagship piece of Brexit legislation, across two marathon sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday. This video can not be played The SNP's Ian Blackford said the lack of debate time about devolution and Brexit was a ""democratic outrage"" The governmentsaw off a move to give MPs the decisive say on what happens over Brexitif they do not agree with the deal it negotiates, winning the key vote by 324 to 298. Devolution was to be debated in the second half of Tuesday's session, but there were only a few minutes left for this after voting on amendments went on for almost three hours. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""We were continually promised by David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, that he would bring forward amendments, that we would have debate in the House of Commons. ""What happened last night was a democratic outrage. Without debate, without the voices of the Scottish MPs being heard, the government pushed through these amendments to rip out the powers from the Scottish Parliament."" This video can not be played Labour's Ian Murray believed the UK government tried to put pressure on opposition parties not to vote in the Brexit debate Scottish Labour's Ian Murray dismissed claims that the lack of debate time was a failure of the House of Commons system. He said on Good Morning Scotland: ""It wasn't adequate. The government are completely in charge of the timetable. They could have given us 20 days or 100 days to debate this. ""This isn't a failure of Commons Standing Orders or a failure of the system - it's a failure of the government to provide a proper programme motion for debate."" This video can not be played Scottish Secretary David Mundell said it was ""very regrettable"" that MPs from Scotland had a limited time to speak in the Brexit debate The Secretary of State for Scotland said it was right that the bill should not fall as a result of Holyrood failing to support it. David Mundell said: ""Ian Blackford may see his role in discussions with Nicola Sturgeon to roll over and agree with her - I don't see it as my role. ""I see it as my role to stand up for the constitutional settlement that people voted for and that is that the Scottish Parliament does not have a veto over what happens in the rest of the UK."" Anti-Brexit campaigners staged a demonstration at Westminster as MPs debated the bill inside MSPs voted by a margin of 93 to 30 torefuse consent for the Brexit legislation last month, with Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems backing the SNP in the final vote. It followeda lengthy rowbetween the Scottish and UK governments about how powers coming back from Brussels after Brexit will be used. Changes have been made to the bill to reflect a deal struck between the UK and Welsh governments, but Mr Russell says these do not go far enough. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on Sunday urging him to let MPs ""properly"" debate devolved consent. But with the UK government seeking to overturn many of the15 defeatsthey suffered as the Withdrawal Bill passed through the House of Lords, there was ultimately little time for discussion of devolution. This will be the first time since the Scottish Parliament was re-established in 1999 that Westminster will have legislated across a devolved matter without the consent of MSPs. Months of talks between the two governments have failed to reach an agreement The Brexit bill says that the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit. But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement. It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK. But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years. It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government.

MP 'dilation' row with Bercow,"This video can not be played Claire Perry asks John Bercow to âconsider his behaviourâ after accusations of sexist behaviour towards her. Conservative minister Claire Perry has accused John Bercow of making ""sexist"" comments about her after he told her to avoid ""dilation"" in the Commons. She said he had used ""demeaning language"" while chiding her for taking too long to answer questions. Comments ""about me being dilated"" had caused ""surprise and dismay"" among MPs from all sides, she said. A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said he often used the word in the context of trying to speed up Commons business. The word dilated is commonly associated with childbirth, being the moment when a pregnant woman's cervix opens up sufficiently to allow labour to take place. But dilated can also be used to refer to someone ""speaking or writing at length"" on a subject. Bercow admits muttering word 'stupid' Commons Speaker facing new outburst claims MP committee blocks Bercow investigation The Speaker's conduct has come under scrutiny in recent months amid claims - that he has denied - that he has acted aggressively to members of his staff. Ms Perry has now written to Mr Bercow to ask him to ""consider his behaviour"" in light of comments he made during Tuesday's Department of Business Questions. Urging her to give ""shorter answers"" to questions from backbenchers, he said the Commons had a ""lot to get through"" and that ""dilation is not in order today"". Ms Perry, who has three children, replied: ""The last time I talked about dilation, I was in labour."" In response, Mr Bercow said ""what is required is a brief answer and a brief question - no dilation"". This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow tells MP Claire Perry: No dilation In her letter, Ms Perry said she had become accustomed to the ""occasional irascible outburst"" from the Speaker which, while ""never enjoyable"", she accepted could be considered part of the ""rough and tumble of government"". But she said she took exception to the ""tone and language"" used to ""admonish me for giving over-long answers that seemed both overly aggressive and particularly sexist"". The minister added. ""Your comments about me being dilated have especially caused comment. ""Of course you may have misspoken, hence my attempt to lighten the mood with a reference to the last time I was dilated but this only provoked a further outburst of anger."" She claimed a ""pattern of behaviour"" was emerging which suggested Mr Bercow had a ""woman problem"" and found it ""increasingly hard to interact respectfully with female MPs on the government benches"". A spokeswoman for the Speaker's Office said Mr Bercow meant nothing derogatory in the remark. ""During question time yesterday, the Speaker was trying to move business along ahead of the much-anticipated debate on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. ""He simply urged the minister to give a 'brief answer â¦ no dilation' - in other words, he was asking Ms Perry not to speak at length. It is a term he has used many times before."" In his own reply to Ms Perry, the Speaker said he did not agree with her assertions but suggested they meet for a cup of tea to ""clear the air"". Mr Bercow, who has been Speaker since 2009, has incurred the wrath of some ministers over the years by telling them to be more concise in the Commons, once cutting off David Cameron half way through an answer and telling him ""take it from me he has finished"". The Speaker came under fire last month amid unconfirmed claims that he had called Commons leader Andrea Leadsom a ""stupid woman"" in the chamber. He admitted using the word stupid as a ""muttered aside"" but only in the context of the government's handling of parliamentary business and insisted that he had every respect for Mrs Leadsom and all his colleagues.

Trump lauds Kim deal despite scepticism,"This video can not be played House speaker Paul Ryan: ""Let's go get an agreement"" The US hopes to see ""major disarmament"" by North Korea by the end of 2020, says Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. His comments, during a visit to South Korea, follow an unprecedented meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. They signed a deal agreeing to work towards ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". But the document has been criticised for lacking details on when or how Pyongyang would give up its weapons. Mike Pompeo (right) is in Seoul, South Korea, to discuss the outcome of Mr Trump's summit Mr Pompeo travelled from the summit in Singapore to Seoul, where he was briefing South Korea's government on the outcome of the summit. He said there was still ""a great deal of work to do"" with North Korea, but added: ""Major disarmament... We're hopeful that we can achieve that in the two and half years."" He said he was confident Pyongyang understood the need for any dismantling its nuclear programme to be properly verified - a key . When asked by reporters why this was not specified in the document signed in Singapore, he condemned their questions as ""insulting"" and ""ridiculous"".

He also announced an unexpected end to military exercises regularly carried out between US and South Korean forces on the peninsula. The move - long demanded by Pyongyang - has been seen as a major concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise. South Korea's presidential Blue House later clarified that it needed to ""find out the precise meaning or intentions"" behind Mr Trump's remarks on ending the joint military drills. What are the US-South Korea war games? After the summit, North Korea's state media said the two leaders had agreed that ""step-by-step and simultaneous action"" was needed to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. American hardliners such as Mr Trump's national security adviser John Bolton have previously opposed such a phased approach, whereby the US takes reciprocal action. Most Western observers have said it includes no new commitments from North Korea nor details on how denuclearisation could be achieved or verified. Critics also expressed disappointment that Pyongyang's long record of human rights abuses was not addressed. President Moon Jae-in had on Tuesday hailed the summit as a ""historic event"", adding that it would be recorded as ""[helping] break down the last remaining Cold War legacy on Earth"".

Ofcom seeks to cap cost of 118 calls,"118 118 has spent tens of millions on television advertising The telecoms regulator Ofcom has announced it wants to cap the price of 118 directory enquiry calls at Â£3.10 for a 90 second call. Market leader 118 118 charges Â£11.23 for a 90 second call to its service. Ofcom said providers had been increasing prices ""quite significantly"" in recent years and that people are paying much more than they expect. Overall 2% of adults or one million people use a 118 service, rising to 4% among those over the age of 65. Ofcom launched its enquiry into the cost of 118 calls in May 2017. It last investigated the sector in 2013 when the price was about Â£3 for a 90 second call.

Plumber wins workers' rights battle,"Gary Smith is entitled to basic workers' rights, the Supreme Court ruled A plumber has won a legal battle for working rights in a Supreme Court ruling expected to have huge ramifications for freelance workers. Gary Smith had worked solely for Pimlico Plumbers for six years. Despite being VAT-registered and paying self-employed tax, he was entitled to workers' rights, the court ruled. The ruling will be closely read by others with similar disputes, many of whom work for firms in the so-called gig economy. An employment tribunal was ""entitled to conclude"" that Mr Smith was a worker, the court ruled. As a worker Mr Smith would be entitled to employment rights, such as holiday and sick pay. Pimlico Plumbers chief executive Charlie Mullins said he was ""disgusted by the approach taken to this case by the highest court in the United Kingdom"". Mr Mullins said: ""This was a poor decision that will potentially leave thousands of companies, employing millions of contractors, wondering if one day soon they will get nasty surprise from a former contractor demanding more money, despite having been paid in full years ago. ""It can only lead to a tsunami of claims,"" he added. What is the 'gig' economy? Gig workers promised rights crackdown Fresh call for crackdown on gig economy Tim Goodwin of law firm Winckworth Sherwood cautioned that the ruling may not apply to other complaints. ""Even with a high level decision like this, to a degree the issue of employment status in the gig economy is up in the air. ""The government is consulting on this issue, and may bring forward legislation.  So it's quite possible that Parliament may overrule this decision within the next few months or years."" And Alan Lewis, employment partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell said the decision was not a ""game changer"" and that cases would continue to be argued on their specific facts and, for businesses that rely on self employed contracts, that means further uncertainty. ""This decision is not necessarily a win  for 'gig economy' workers seeking to challenge their employment status."" Pimlico Plumbers does ""not operate a gig model and the implications for Uber, City Sprint, Deliveroo etc may be limited,  although the publicity around this case may encourage other 'self employed' contractors to challenge their legal status,"" added Mr Lewis. This video can not be played Pimlico Plumbers boss says judges missed chance to bring employment law into 21st century. The Supreme Court ruling means that an employment tribunal can now proceed to examine Mr Smith's action against Pimlico Plumbers as a worker, including a claim that he was unfairly dismissed. Could the Pimlico Plumbers ruling be a watershed moment, a decisive shift in favour of people seeking employment rights? It is a powerful precedent and the fact that the judgment comes from the Supreme Court means that it will weigh heavily when similar cases come to be heard. However other cases, like those involving Uber and Deliveroo are unlikely to be stopped in their tracks. Each firm has a different way of operating, different contracts and makes different demands on people working. Some allow you to get someone else to do the job instead, for instance, while others do not. That's one of the key tests of employment status. So there's a bit more clarity now, but expect the court challenges from gig workers to keep coming. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said the case had exposed ""how widely sham self-employment has spread"". Ms O'Grady said the TUC wanted the government to act quickly to ""crack down on bogus self-employment"" . At the moment it is up to an individual to prove that they are employed and entitled to workers' rights. The TUC wants the ""burden of proof"" to be reversed so workers benefit from rights ""unless the employer can show they are genuinely self-employed"". ""It's time to end the Wild West in the gig economy,"" said Ms O'Grady. In Februarythe government promised to overhaul employment rightsto improve conditions for millions of workers, including those in the gig economy. The proposed changes include stricter enforcement of holiday and sick pay rights, and higher fines for firms that breach contracts or mistreat staff. It is currently consulting on the proposals. It is a response to last year'sTaylor Review into the gig economy, which concluded that all work in the UK's economy should be ""fair and decent"" and that people who work for platform-based companies, such as Deliveroo and Uber should be classed as dependent contractors. Author Matthew Taylor said that the combination of the Supreme Court decision and the government's proposals to reduce the tax incentives for companies to employ freelancers, would ""inevitably squeeze firms' freelance budgets"". ""This is generally a good thing, especially if it leads to more people who are employees in all-but-name securing proper workplace rights,"" he said. Mr Smith, from Kent, began his battle with Pimlico Plumbers when he wanted to reduce his hours following a heart attack in 2010. He wanted to cut the five-day week, which he had been signed up to work with the firm, to three. However, the firm refused and took away his branded van, which he had hired. He claims he was dismissed. Gig workers promised rights crackdown What is the 'gig' economy?

Owner jailed over fireworks blaze deaths,"This video can not be played Fireworks explode at Stafford fatal factory fire A businessman convicted over the deaths of two men at a factory ""rammed"" with fireworks has been jailed for 10 years. ""Arrogant"" Richard Pearson wasfound guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence last month, after employee Simon Hillier and customer Stewart Staples died at SP Fireworks in 2014. The number of fireworks stored at the unit was ""up to 10 times the permitted limit"", Stafford Crown Court had heard. Pearson, 44, was also injured in the fire in Stafford. Midlands Live: Patients 'cancel cancer treatment over holiday plans'; Burger chain cancels restaurant plans Mr Hillier, 41, and Mr Staples, 57, both from Hednesford, Staffordshire, died from inhaling combustible products. Pearson, of Holyrood Close, Stafford, had denied failing to take reasonable care in the storing and handling of explosives at his business unit in Baswich. Stewart Staples (on left) and Simon Hillier died in the fire He attempted to blame others for what happened, including Mr Hillier - a move Judge Michael Chambers QC described as ""not reasonable in any sense of the word"". Mr Chambers insisted this was ""not a case where remorse loomed large"" and Pearson had ""given the impression of being rather arrogant"". He told Pearson: ""You have known your true culpability from the start yet you have chosen to falsely blame others. ""Despite being very knowledgeable about fireworks and the risks they pose, motivated by financial profit, you have demonstrated an arrogant recklessness for the safety of others in the storage and handling of dangerous fireworks."" Richard Pearson had denied failing to take reasonable care in the storing and handling of explosives The owner of the Tilcon Avenue unit allegedly told paramedics at the scene it was ""rammed"" with explosives and, when questioned by police, claimed someone must have thrown a firework into the shop. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Staples' wife Angela said despite being a devout Christian for 28 years, the incident had ""led to a complete lack of faith"". She said: ""We still struggle with the pain, anger and grief of losing Stewart. I still find sleep hard to come by. ""The ripples from Stewart's death have spread far and wide."" Prosecutor Allan Compton added Mr Hillier's family had been left ""broken-hearted"" by his death. SP Plastics in Baswich, Stafford, was destroyed on 30 October 2014 Det Insp Glyn Pattinson, of Staffordshire Police, said: ""During the lengthy investigation and throughout his trial, Pearson attempted to offer alternative explanations for the fire, which thankfully the jury did not accept. ""He always sought to blame others and never once took responsibility for his own actions or showed any remorse for what happened that evening."" Tim Hyde, incident commander for Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service, said it had been a ""harrowing"" and ""dangerous"" scene that had greeted crews on 30 October 2014. Following the case, Stafford Conservative MP Jeremy Lefroy called for regulations on the amount of fireworks that can be stored to be tightened. Fireworks explode at fatal fire scene.

Parents sports day video dispute warningMums and dads filming races are told they cannot challenge results even if they send in footage.South East Wales,"Some parents have brought video ""evidence"" into a school in Cardiff to dispute sports day results Parents using video footage to challenge the results of a primary school sports day have been told the teacher's word is final. As parents watched their children take part in the event at a Cardiff primary school many filmed it. But some then brought video ""evidence"" in to dispute the results declared by teachers on the finishing line. The headteacher of Ysgol Mynydd Bychan in Cathays has sent a letter to parents warning them to stop the practice. Parents have demanded official standings were changed based on their footage, but the school had refused to budge in the results row. Sporting 'scandals' through the years How to ace sports day In a strongly worded letter, head Sian Evans has said: ""Teacher's word is final"". Mynydd Bychan school holds its sports day at Cardiff's National Indoor Athletics Centre The letter added: ""The members of staff at the finish line, and nobody else, have the absolute final say and as to the first, second and third place positions. ""Unfortunately, during the last few years parents have approached members of staff with evidence that they had filmed on electronic devices such as iPads in order to prove that their child should have been awarded a higher position in a particular race and comments also appeared on Facebook. The school holds its sports day at the nearby National Indoor Athletics Centre on the Cardiff Met University campus ""If this happens again, there is a strong possibility that we will have to consider changing the competitive nature of our sports morning."" ""The arrangements for the smooth running of the morning are very tight and take quite a bit of arranging. Members of staff work hard in various ways during the morning.""

Dixons Carphone admits huge data breach,"Dixons Carphone employs more than 42,000 people in eight countries Dixons Carphone has admitted a huge data breach involving 5.9 million payment cards and 1.2 million personal data records. It is investigating the hacking attempt, which began in July last year. Dixons Carphone said it had no evidence that any of the cards had been used fraudulently following the breach. There was ""an attempt to compromise"" 5.8 million credit and debit cards but only 105,000 cards without chip-and-pin protection had been leaked, it said. The hackers had tried to gain access to one of the processing systems of Currys PC World and Dixons Travel stores, the firm said. Dixons Carphone shares were down more than 3% in early afternoon trading. A spokesperson for the National Cyber Security Centre said it was ""working with Dixons Carphone and other agencies to understand how this data breach has affected people in the UK and advise on mitigation measures"". On the face of it, this is a very serious incident. Usually when companies report a data breach, they are very quick to reassure us that while names, email addresses and login may have been accessed, no payment information has been released. This is not the case here, with Dixons admitting that hackers got access to records of nearly six million payment cards. The good news is that nearly all of them were protected by good old chip and pin - and there is no evidence of any fraud relating to the 100,000 non-European cards which didn't have that protection. But there are still questions for Dixons Carphone to answer. Why has a hack that apparently happened nearly a year ago only been revealed now? And is there any connection to a previous data breach at Carphone in 2015? Dixons insists that it only discovered this latest hack a week ago and it has no connection with any previous incident. But the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which fined Carphone Warehouse Â£400,000 for the 2015 breach, will now be looking very closely at this latest failing of the merged companies. Luckily for Dixons, the incident happened before the new GDPR rules, which promise much bigger fines, came into force. The 1.2 million personal data records accessed by the hackers consisted of non-financial information such as names, addresses and email addresses. Carphone Warehouse said it had no evidence that the information had left its systems or resulted in any fraud, but it was contacting those affected to advise them. It added that it had brought in leading cyber-experts and added extra security measures to its systems. Dixons Carphone chief executive Alex Baldock said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the data breach and ""sorry for any upset"", ""The protection of our data has to be at the heart of our business, and we've fallen short here. ""We've taken action to close off this unauthorised access and though we have currently no evidence of fraud as a result of these incidents, we are taking this extremely seriously,"" he added. Bryan Glick, editor in chief of Computer Weekly, told the BBC that the breach was ""right up there"" as one of the biggest to date involving a UK company. However, he cautioned against any panic. ""If you've not heard from Dixons Carphone to warn you, the chances are you're OK,"" he said. Carphone Warehouse is one of many High Street retailers feeling the strain of tough economic challenges. Last month,it warned of a sharp fall in profits this yearand said it would close 92 of its more than 700 Carphone Warehouse stores.

Haim 'fired agent over equal pay',"Haim claim they sacked their agent after finding out they were paid 10 times less than a male artist performing at the same festival. The band say they initially ""didn't think twice"" about their pay, because they hoped playing the festival would help them get noticed. ""We later found out that someone was getting paid 10 times more than us,"" singer Danielle Haim told Grazia magazine. The sisters didn't name the festival. Danielle Haim is the band's middle sister Alana Haim said the band - sisters Este, Danielle and Alana - had to defend themselves in the music industry. ""It's scary out there and [messed] up not even to be paid half the same amount. But to be paid a tenth of that amount of money? It was insane,"" she said. Danielle added: ""We had been told that our fee was very low because you played at the festival in the hope you'd get played on the radio. ""We didn't think twice about it, but we later found out that someone was getting paid 10 times more than us. ""And because of that we fired our agent.""

Chess player boycotts Iran over headscarf,"Indian chess champion Soumya Swaminathan has pulled out of an Asian tournament in Iran over the country's compulsory headscarf rule. The 29-year-old Woman Grandmaster said the rule was a violation of her personal rights. ""Under the present circumstances, the only way for me to protect my rights is not to go to Iran,"" she wrote in a Facebook post, which went viral. The Asian Chess Championship will take place in Iran next month. Ms Swaminathan, who is ranked No 5 in India, told local media that the tournament was originally supposed to be held in Bangladesh. ""But once the new dates and new venue came up, I excused myself,"" she said. When asked if the All India Chess Federation (AICF) should have protested against the decision to shift location,she told the Times of India,external: ""I can't expect everyone to be of the same opinion as me. It's a subjective issue."" But inher Facebook post,external, Ms Swaminathan said she was ""disappointed to see that player's rights and welfare are given such less importance while allotting and/or organising official championships"". She wrote that athletes often made adjustments for the sake of sport, but ""enforceable religious dress"" should not be one of them, adding that ""some things simply cannot be compromised"".

'Obsessed' police revenge plotter jailed,"Ashkan Ebrahimi began stalking police officers and the judge involved in his court case A man ""obsessed with revenge"" against the legal system after losing a court case has been jailed for 15 years. A police raid on the Halifax home of Ashkan Ebrahimi in October 2015 discovered chemicals, swords, crossbows and high-powered air rifles. Evidence was also found that the 33-year-old had visited the home addresses of police officers and the judge involved his case. West Yorkshire Police said Ebrahimi planned on ""harming a police officer"". Yorkshire breaking news: RNLI stands by 'porn' suspensions; council pulls out of major IT deal The force said he became ""obsessed with revenge"" after a court granted his former partner a non-molestation order, which led to him being separated from his young child. ""The effects of this action sowed the seeds of a deep hatred of the police that grew exponentially from that moment,"" a police spokesman said. ""He believed that the police were committed to destroying his life and set about seeking to take extreme violent action against them."" A police raid on his Halifax home recovered a stash of weapons and chemicals He was arrested after concerns were raised by Calderdale College, where Ebrahimi had enrolled on an adult GCSE science course, about his unusual interest in chemicals and wanting to develop a science lab at home. A large amount of chemicals were recovered from his address, along with an extensive collection of weapons, police said. His mobile phone had vehicle registration numbers of the cars and photographs of the homes of people involved in his case.

Man called for 'race traitors' to be hung,"Matthew Hankinson is accused of being a member of banned neo-Nazi group National Action A man accused of being a member of a banned neo-Nazi group called for ""traitors"" who supported multi-ethnic Britain to be hanged from lampposts, in a video shown to an Old Bailey jury. In the clip, taken in March 2015, Matthew Hankinson, 24, addressed a crowd in Newcastle upon Tyne. He is one of six men who deny being in National Action after a ban in 2016. On Tuesday one of the group admitted planning to murder a Labour MP as part of what he called a ""white jihad"". Jack Renshaw, 23, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete to kill West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper. He also admitted making a threat to kill police officer Victoria Henderson. There is no dispute in the trial that Mr Hankinson, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, is the speaker at the rally which took place more than a year before National Action was banned under terrorism legislation. He and the five other defendants deny being members of the group after it was outlawed in December 2016. During the Newcastle event, Mr Hankinson appears wearing dark sunglasses and surrounded by flag bearers, including one man carrying the National Action insignia. He tells the crowd they need to prepare for a coming race war which was necessary to secure the future of white people. ""If we don't fight and cut out the cancer, Britain will die,"" he says. ""The system will not compromise with us. We need the strongest of our race."" Referring to so-called race traitors who oppose far-right ideology, Mr Hankinson says: ""They will end up hanging from lampposts. We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. ""Blood must be shed, the blood of traitors. Stand up white men and set our people free."" The jury also watched a video of a demonstration involving National Action in Liverpool which resulted in minor clashes with anti-racism protesters and police in 2016. Jack Renshaw, in the centre holding the flag with his bare hand, from a National Action video of a demonstration in Liverpool in 2016 Mr Atkinson told the jury that Jack Renshaw was a masked man seen to be holding a banner, alongside some of the group's founders. A further video of a Rochdale protest included footage of another of the defendants - Andrew Clarke, 33, of Prescot in Merseyside. The other accused, who all deny being in the group are: Christopher Lythgoe, 32, and Michal Trubini, 35, both from Warrington; and Garron Helm, 24, from Seaforth, Merseyside. Mr Lythgoe also denies encouragement to murder by allegedly giving Renshaw permission to kill Labour MP Ms Cooper on behalf of the group. The court was told it was a whistleblower - Robbie Mullen - who first warned the anti-racism charity Hope not Hate - and, through them, the police - of Renshaw's plan to kill Ms Cooper. Mr Mullen, 25, from Widnes, Cheshire, told jurors he became interested in far-right politics in his late teens and joined National Action in 2015. National Action was against ""every non-white"" group, Robbie Mullen said Asked which ""groups"" National Action was against, he said: ""Jews, blacks, Asians - every non-white."" He said it wanted a ""white Britain"" by ""any means necessary,"" which included ""war"" and ""people getting killed"". Questioned by prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC, he said he had been a National Action member after it was banned and that the six men in the dock had remained members too. Asked why he had first contacted Hope not Hate in April 2017, he said ""partly the directions things were going in"". When asked to clarify, he said: ""To get out of the organisation - National Action."" He told jurors he had signed an agreement to give him immunity from prosecution over his former membership in return for giving evidence in the case. Andrew Clarke giving a speech in Rochdale in 2016 Mr Mullen said after National Action was banned, Mr Lythgoe took the organisation ""underground"" and had remained in charge. He said the meetings continued with the ""same place, same people, same purpose"". Mr Mullen said: ""The politics was still the same - free white man. The group had gone, the name had gone, but the people were still meeting."" He told the court of a July 2017 meeting at a pub in Warrington during which Renshaw outlined his plan to kill Rosie Cooper and Mr Lythgoe allegedly gave his approval. Mr Mullen said Mr Lythgoe suggested the former home secretary Amber Rudd be targeted, but Renshaw dismissed that because she would be too protected. He added that when Mr Lythgoe had said Renshaw could ""do it in the name of National Action"", Renshaw announced he would do it ""in the name of white jihad"". The case continues.

Battle starts for lifeline Yemen portRebel-held Hudaydah is the main entry point for aid needed by millions at risk of starvation.,"This video can not be played Former child soldiers, a landmine survivor and an internally displaced child tell their stories Pro-government forces in Yemen, backed by Saudi Arabia, have begun attacking a key port held by rebel fighters. The coastal city of Hudaydah is where most of the aid arrives for people in Yemen's rebel-held areas. Agencies have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe. About eight million people are at risk of starvation in the war-torn country. Pro-government strikes began after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels ignored a deadline to withdraw by midnight (21:00 GMT on Tuesday). It is the first time the Saudi-led coalition of mostly Gulf states has tried to capture such a well-defended major city in Yemen. Yemen's conflict in 400 words Who is fighting whom? The UN Security Council is expected to meet to discuss the situation on Thursday, following a request from the UK. The conflict in Yemen has raged since late 2014, when the Houthis and allied forces seized north-western parts of the country, including the capital Sanaa, and eventually forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Sunni Arab states launched a military campaign in March 2015 to restore Mr Hadi's government. The Saudi-led coalition has accused the rebels of using Hudaydah to smuggle in Iranian weapons. Both Iran and the rebels deny this. The coalition says victory could break the stalemate in the war and force the Houthis to the negotiating table. But the port is a lifeline for the majority of Yemen's population and the UN had been trying to get parties to the conflict to reach a deal that would avert an attack. An estimated 600,000 people live in the area. Robert Mardini, regional head for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said the attack was ""likely to exacerbate an already catastrophic humanitarian situation"". A cholera outbreak has killed thousands of people in Yemen, including many in Hudaydah On Friday, UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Yemen Lise Grande warned: ""In a prolonged worst case, we fear that as many as 250,000 people may lose everything - even their lives."" Read more onwhy the battle for Hudaydah matters. On Tuesday, the exiled government said its forces and allied Saudi-led troops launched their assault after ""exhausting all peaceful and political means"". Coalition warplanes and warships later began bombarding Houthi positions. An alliance of Yemeni forces supporting the internationally recognised government is leading the ground assault. The Saudi-owned Al Arabiya network reported ""intense and concentrated"" strikes near the port. ""The liberation of Hudaydah port is a turning point in our struggle to recapture Yemen from the militias that hijacked it to serve foreign agendas,"" the exiled government said. The rebels have said they will ""confront the coalition of aggression on all fronts"". By BBC correspondent Nawal Al-Maghafi For the last three years the Saudi-led coalition hasn't made any major advances. But in the last few weeks, the rebel side has lost a lot of fighters and commanders. The coalition sees a window of opportunity and is desperate to gain ground. It has argued repeatedly that a Hudaydah offensive can be mounted quickly and effectively, leaving the port functioning at a higher capacity. But if the battle is prolonged, it will leave millions of Yemenis without food, fuel and other vital supplies. In reality, families in Hudaydah are already starving and desperately relying on humanitarian aid. Reporting from the city last year, I saw children who were severely undeveloped, their ribs protruding. This video can not be played How children are starving in Yemen's war They were living off a peanut-based paste provided by aid agencies. The hospitals were desperately trying to do what they could but were overwhelmed by cases of malnutrition and cholera. Now this battle threatens to push these people off the brink. Meanwhile, the possibility of the warring sides returning to the negotiating table seems even more remote. About 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed in the fighting since March 2015, according to the UN. The vast majority of the casualties have been the result of coalition air strikes. The UN's figures do not include those who have died of disease and malnutrition. Terror of life under siege in Yemen The girl with the strawberry ring The conflict and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid. It has created the world's largest food emergency and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,290 people. In a tweet, the UN's envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, called on both sides to end the fighting and find a negotiated settlement. Allow Twitter content?

Miss Iraq visits Israel after controversy,"Sarah Idan (right) captioned her 2017 pageant selfie ""Peace and Love from Miss Iraq and Miss Israel"" Six months ago, a simple selfie between two Miss Universe contestants provoked a backlash that pushed one to flee her home country, her family in tow. Sarah Idan was representing Iraq at the 2017 pageant in Las Vegas when she snapped a picture with Miss Israel, Adar Gandelsman, and posted it online. In the caption, she wrote ""Peace and Love from Miss Iraq and Miss Israel"". But some people in Iraq did not see it that way and, she said, sent her death threats. Allow Instagram content?

Iraq and Israel have no diplomatic relations, and Ms Idan's message was interpreted by some as an endorsement of Israel and a betrayal of Palestinian Arabs. ""When I posted the picture I didn't think for a second there would be blowback,"" she told CNN at the time. ""I woke up to calls from my family and the Miss Iraq Organization going insane. The death threats I got online were so scary."" Ms Idan and her family relocated to the US, but on Monday she was reunited with Ms Gandelsman in Israel, where the two posted fresh pictures online. Ms Idan posted a photograph and a video on her Instagram page, with the caption ""Sisters reunion"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said he welcomed her visit. ""Friendly relations between Israelis & Arabs will definitely help in ushering in a better tomorrow for all of us in the Middle East,"" he wrote on Twitter. Back in November, Ms Idan refused to take down her original selfie, despite what she said was pressure from the Miss Iraq organisation, but she did add a follow up post saying she had not intended to cause offence. ""I would like to apologise to anyone who considered the photo to be offensive to the Palestinian cause as this was not the aim behind the post, it was merely a call to peace and hope for a solution to the crisis,"" she wrote.

SNP MPs walk out of PMQs in protestThe party's Westminster leader was ordered to leave the chamber after a row with Speaker John Bercow.UK Politics,"This video can not be played SNP MPs walked out of the Commons in a row with the Speaker SNP MPs have walked out en masse from Prime Minister's Questions after their Westminster leader was thrown out of the chamber in a row with the Speaker. Ian Blackford refused to sit down when ordered to by John Bercow having asked for the Commons to sit in private. This was in protest at a lack of debate on what he said was a ""power grab"" in the EU Withdrawal Bill. It brought PMQs to a temporary halt as the Speaker consulted his officials on what to do next. Mr Bercow said MPs could vote on the request for a private sitting at the end of PMQs - but when Mr Blackford refused to sit back down he was suspended for the rest of the day's sitting. His fellow SNP MPs followed him out of the chamber. Live updates: MPs debate EU bill changes Reality Check: Has the UK's devolution settlement been ripped up? Female MP in 'dilation' row with Bercow Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict The episode took place during the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session after Mr Blackford said it was a ""democratic outrage"" that MPs had not been given enough time to debate measures he described as a ""power grab"" by Westminster from Scotland. He added: ""Under the circumstances, given the disrespect that's shown, I have got no option but to ask that this House now sits in private."" Mr Bercow said it was better for a vote on his request to take place at the end of the session - but the SNP MP did not agree, rejecting repeated orders from the Speaker to resume his seat. John Bercow ordered Ian Blackford to sit down - but he refused The next MP to be called for a question was Conservative MP Luke Hall, who joked: ""With the amount of people leaving, it feels like one of my after-dinner speeches."" Speaking afterwards, Mr Blackford told the BBC's Daily Politics his party would ""use Parliamentary procedures to best effect"" to protest against what he said was devolution being ""ripped up"" as powers are repatriated from Brussels. His suspension from the Commons means he is unable to take part in the second day of  debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill. This video can not be played Ian Blackford complained about a ""power grab by the government against the Scottish Parliament and people"" Parliament retains the right to hold debates in private and any MP can propose that members of the public and press be removed from the galleries at any time. If such a proposal is made, the Commons Speaker must put the motion ""That this House sit in private"" to a vote without debate. But the procedure is seldom successful - attempts to exclude members of the public are usually deployed as a device to disrupt or delay the House's proceedings. MPs used to call out ""I spy strangers"" to invoke this procedure, but this phrase was replaced with the current wording in 1998. Scottish MPs' voices 'have not been heard' Scottish government wants devolution changes The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy, aiming to ensure a smooth transition on Brexit day when EU law no longer applies in the UK. But the Scottish Parliament has refused to give its consent to the legislation, saying policy in devolved areas that is currently decided in Brussels is being reclaimed by Westminster. The bill is currently making its way through Parliament  - and although devolution was to be debated in the second half of Tuesday's session, there were only a few minutes left for this after voting on amendments went on for almost three hours. The Brexit bill says that the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit. But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement. It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK. But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years. It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government.

Wetherspoon to stop selling champagne,"Tim Martin campaigned for Brexit JD Wetherspoon plans to replace champagne and prosecco with non-European Union sparkling wines. Company founder Tim Martin, who campaigned for Brexit, said it was part of a transition away from products made in the EU. Wetherspoon sells two million bottles of sparkling wine each year, most of which is prosecco. The pub chain aims to replace the Italian fizz with UK or ""new world"" alternatives in the next year or two. Champagne will no longer be available at Wetherspoon's pubs from next month. There will also be changes to the beer line up. Wheat beer and alcohol-free beer from the UK, will replace the current options brewed in Germany. Mr Martin said the new drinks would be cheaper than the EU products they are replacing. ""There will be an inevitable transfer of trade post-Brexit to countries outside the EU, which will reduce prices in shops and pubs,"" he said. The move was part of a review all products over the next six to 24 months, he said, adding: ""We intend to honour existing contracts with EU suppliers, some of which have several years to run. ""However, we are starting to make the transition to non-EU trade now."" Wetherspoon, which has 880 pubs, will replace champagne with sparkling wines from the UK, such as from the Denbies vineyard, and Hardy's Sparkling Pinot Chardonnay from Australia. The chain sells fewer than 100,000 bottles of champagne a year and stocks only MoÃ«t & Chandon. ""Champagne has lost market share to lower price sparkling wines,"" Mr Martin said. He said that he intends to find a replacement for prosecco from the UK or new world countries which include Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and the US. ""The general message is that sparkling wine is a growth product,"" said Mr Martin. A representative of France's champagne industry was unconcerned by the decision. ""It seems to be economically driven, combined with Mr Martin's strong expressed feeling about European products,"" said Francoise Peretti, director of the Champange Bureau UK. ""UK consumers have clearly voted it [champagne] its sparkling wine of choice, making the UK the leading export market for champagne,"" Mr Peretti said. Wetherspoon said its new wheat beers brewed in the UK will include Blue Moon Belgian White, Thornbridge Versa Weisse Beer and SA Brains Atlantic White. Alcohol-free Adnams Ghost Ship will replace Erdinger alcohol-free beer from Germany. Wetherspoon will continue to serve Kopparberg cider from Sweden, as the company has said it will transfer production to the UK post-Brexit. ""In similar situations we will work closely with suppliers of niche products,"" Mr Martin said. The pubs sell 6 million bottles of Kopparberg each year.

Nintendo Switch gets Fortnite,"Fortnite is being released as a free download from the Nintendo eShop Nintendo has announced that Fortnite is being released for its Switch console to coincide with the opening of the E3 video games show in Los Angeles. However, the release is limited to the title's last-gamer-standing Battle Royale mode and will not include the original Save The World co-op content. Nintendo also revealed Super Smash Bros Ultimate will include every character to have appeared in prior versions. It described it as the ""biggest crossover in gaming history"". This video can not be played WATCH: Chris Foxx battle-tests Super Smash Bros Ultimate at E3 That means the fighting game will include the Japanese firm's own characters - Mario, Zelda and the Splatoon Inklings - as well as those from third-party developers, such as Final Fantasy's Cloud, Metal Gear Solid's Snake and Sonic The Hedgehog. Nintendo acknowledged that its decision to include so many fighters from the past meant that there was a limited number of new challenges. But it added that Ridley - a dragon-like villain from the Metroid franchise - would be included for the first time. The title is expected be one of the biggest releases yet for the 15-month-old games machine, and Nintendo spent the bulk of its video presentation describing the game's features. Splatoon's Inklings are among the characters to choose from in the latest Super Smash Bros game The multiplayer battle game - which lets up to eight players compete at once - is due to go on sale on 7 December.

Nintendo announced in April that it had sold 17.7 million units of the Switch to date, and forecast it would sell a further 20 million over the following year. That would represent a much better result than that managed by its predecessor, the Wii U. PlayStation's Last of Us sequel has kisses and kills Sony's E3 event in under three minutes Xbox One chief teases Halo Infinite Rapid-fire recap of Xbox One's new games Many analysts believe that a lack of compelling content in the Wii U's second year of release contributed to its underperformance. The launch of a Switch edition of Fortnite - which is already a huge hit on other platforms - should help avoid a repeat of that problem. Switch owners will be able to compete against those already playing Fortnite on Xbox One, PC, Mac and mobile devices, but not against PlayStation 4 gamers because of restrictions imposed by Sony. The Switch allows Fortnite to be played on its own screen or on bigger TVs ""It was widely rumoured that Epic Games' Fortnite was making its way to the Switch, but an earlier-than-expected release gives Nintendo a better chance of maintaining momentum through the summer months,"" commented Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at the IHS Markit consultancy. ""In the past, Nintendo has often failed to maintain support from third-party publishers due to its content dominance on its own platforms. The early success of the Switch has altered that dynamic, with many publishers keen to support the platform. ""But aside from Fortnite, there were no major third-party surprises, which is perhaps a little disappointing, although also a reflection of the seasonality of Nintendo's business, with lots of releases coming towards the end of the year."" Super Mario Party allows two Switch consoles to be arranged in different ways to enable characters to move between screens Other Switch games put in the spotlight during the Nintendo Direct presentation included: Daemon X Machina - a third-party ""mech"" flying-robots battle game from the Japanese developer Marvelous Entertainment, which is set to go in sale in 2019 the two Pokemon Let's Go releases announced last month - however the firm did not reveal any details of the ""core"" title previously promised for next year Super Mario Party - a mini-game collection that allows players to place two Switch consoles side-by-side to let characters shoot at each other and move between devices. It is set to become available on 5 October Fire Emblem: Three Houses - a top-down tactical war game set in a fantasy world, which is due to launch in Spring 2019 Most of Super Smash Bros Ultimate's characters will be locked at the start There were no huge surprises in Nintendo's presentation - the company had already announced most of the games it showed off before E3. When Nintendo released its Switch console in 2017, it hit the ground running and brought many of its biggest properties to the console within months. The release of Super Smash Bros Ultimate in December will fill one of the most notable first-party gaps in its line-up - and the inclusion of every hero that has ever appeared in the game will delight Nintendo fans Nintendo called it the biggest gaming crossover in history - demonstrating its determination to throw everything it has at its comeback. And the appearance of the multiplayer smash hit Fortnite on the Switch - as a free download - shows that third-party developers are willing to jump on board too.

Fortnite's World Cup to be 'open to all',"This video can not be played WATCH: Fans flock to Fortnite's first live event Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, has announced more details about its first World Cup. It would be open to all players, Epic said at a live celebrity tournament at the Los Angeles E3 gaming conference. And the $100m (Â£74m) prize pot - the largest in the highly lucrative world of e-sports - would be split between many events at different levels of competition around the world. It comes as some are expressing concern about young children playing Fortnite. Launched in June 2017, Fortnite now has 125 million players around the globe, according to Epic. Its most popular format, Battle Royale, pits 100 players against each other, some of whom are in small teams, to see who is the last person standing. The game is free, but players can spend real money on in-app purchases including skins to customise player avatars. Announcing the details of the World Cup in ablogpost,external, the company said: ""We're getting behind competitive play in a big way, but our approach will be different - we plan to be more inclusive, and focused on the joy of playing and watching the game. ""We'll be supporting community organised events, online events, and major organised competitions all over the world, where anyone can participate, and anyone can win."" ""This is for you, the players. Qualifications for the Fortnite World Cup will be based on merit. Epic will not be selling teams or franchises, and won't allow third-party leagues to do so either."" Nintendo Switch gets Fortnite and Super Smash Bros Ultimate Battlefield V creator resists gender attacks Xbox One gets new Halo, Forza and Gears of War games The play would focus on individuals and duos but ""there'll be plenty of opportunities to squad-up in competition, too"", it added. The qualifiers will begin in autumn 2018, with the World Cup event due to take place in late 2019. According to e-sports analyst Newzoo, organised, competitive computer gaming will generate more than Â£1bn in global revenue and almost double its audience to nearly 600 million people by 2020, giving it the potential to become one of the top five sports in the world. There is huge appetite for Fortnite. Last month, a tournament held by one of the game's most famous streamers, Ninja, saw more than 600,000 concurrent viewers on game streaming site Twitch. The game has an age classification of 12-plus but is increasingly attracting younger children, leading some to question whether it is suitable for such a young demographic. Alastair Graham, chief executive of online age verification company AgeChecked, said: ""[The] dangers of under-age children playing online games such as Fortnite are that it risks desensitising young children to mature themes such as gun violence, as well as putting them at risk of being scammed or groomed online by their elders.""

E3: Xbox One chief teases Halo Infinite,"This video can not be played WATCH: Halo Infinite was only one of the highlights from the Xbox One's E3 event Microsoft has shared a first look at the next Halo video game at its E3 Xbox press conference. But Halo Infinite - which will complete the second trilogy in the blockbuster series - was only briefly teased. More time was given to other exclusives, including fresh Gears of War and Forza titles, as well as games in new franchises. Microsoft also revealed it had bought several indie studios - including two of the UK's leading developers. The firm had previously acknowledged that it needed to do more to build up its range of first-party content. A total of 18 ""console launch"" exclusives were announced at the Los Angeles event. ""Microsoft gets a solid A,"" commented Michael Pachter, who follows the video games industry for Wedbush Securities. ""Nice to see them investing in more first-party gaming, and [the subscription service] Game Pass is looking like a better and better offer,""added Stephen Totilo,external, the editor-in-chief of games news website Kotaku. Phil Spencer hosted the press event in Los Angeles Microsoft's rivals Sony and Nintendo will preview their own titles later in the week. Sales of the Xbox One lag far behind those of Sony's console, which has made it a challenge for Microsoft to convince third-party publishers to restrict games to its platforms. At the end of March, 39.1 million Xbox Ones had been purchased worldwide - encompassing all versions of the games machine - according to market research firm IHS Markit. By contrast, 76.6 million units of the various PlayStation 4 consoles had been bought. But Microsoft went into E3 with two advantages. The Xbox One X - released last November - boasts more powerful graphics hardware than the PlayStation 4 Pro. And Microsoft offers Xbox Game Pass - a Netflix-like subscription service that offers access to more than 100 titles including new first-party releases. FastStart promises to anticipate the content players want access to The firm revealed that the service would soon benefit from FastStart - a new facility that will use ""machine learning techniques"" to speed up game-loading times, although it did not explain how. In addition, it revealed several third-party big-name releases from the past - including enhanced editions of Fallout 4 and Tom Clancy's The Division - were being added. The focus of E3, however, is new titles. No date was given for Halo Infinite's release Microsoft kicked off its event with a trailer for the new Halo game, which Xbox chief Phil Spencer described as Master Chief's ""greatest adventure yet"". But he declined to return to the game, leaving a fuller reveal to a later date. Instead, other exclusives were given more time, including new footage from the highly-anticipated action-adventure sequel Crackdown 3. Microsoft did not disclose the reason for Crackdown 3's latest delay The British-developed title had originally been scheduled for release in 2016 but has suffered multiple delays. It was confirmed that, as rumoured, the launch has been set back again, with the new sale date set as February 2019. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New content was also announced for the Xbox and Windows exclusive Sea of Thieves. The pirate-themed titlehas previously been described,externalby Microsoft as its ""fastest-selling first-party new intellectual property"" of the current generation of hardware. The DLC (downloadable content) pack Cursed Sails is due in July, and Forsaken Shores in September. And the audience cheered the reveal of Gears 5 - the latest entry in Microsoft's third-person military sci-fi shooter Gears of War series. The trailer appeared to place a female protagonist at its centre for the first time. Kait Diaz's journey fuels the plot of the latest Gears of War game In addition, two spin-offs to the series are planned: a title for smartphones and a strategy game for PCs. Mr Spencer addressed Xbox's need to secure further Xbox and Windows-only titles in the future, part way through his presentation. Microsoft has been on a spending spree to secure exclusive content ""We know that exclusive games from our Microsoft Studios are what originally turned so many of us into Xbox fans,"" he declared. ""This is why we are increasing our investment in our existing franchises that you already love and this is why we are amplifying our investment in new worlds."" Xbox gets new Halo, Forza and Gears of War Game over called on ZX Vega+ console Steam games store to 'allow everything' Crowdfunded Atari retro console attracts $2m To help achieve this, he revealed that Microsoft had acquired two of the UK's leading indie studios: Playground Games - the Leamington Spa studio responsible for the Forza Horizon racing series Ninja Theory - the Cambridge-based developer of Devil May Cry and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,which recently won five Bafta awards This video can not be played WATCH: Hellblade: Our big risk paid off In addition, Mr Spencer revealed Microsoft had purchased Undead Labs - the US studio behind the State of Decay zombie games - and Canada's Compulsion Games, which is working on the crowdfunded retro-futuristic title We Happy Few. The executive added that his firm had also created a new US-based studio, called The Initiative, which will be led by Darrell Gallagher, who previously oversaw 2013's Tomb Raider reboot. ""These five new teams will have the resources, the platform and creative independence to take bigger risks,"" Mr Spencer added. One company-watcher commented that the moves effectively doubled the amount of games studios owned by the tech giant. We Happy Few has been redesigned to put a plot at its core rather than rely on randomly-generated events ""It will take time to reap the rewards of this expansion strategy, but it puts Microsoft on a much stronger footing,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS. The chief executive of the British games trade body Ukie was among others to welcome the news. ""Great to see some of the best British games studios featuring so highly in Microsoft's strategy for the future,""tweeted Jo Twist,external. Sea of Thieves has been a success for Microsoft I've heard bigger cheers at Xbox's E3 events in the past, but fans here mostly got what they came to see - a new Halo, and the continuation of the Gears of War franchise. News of a female lead for Gears 5 seemed relatively well-received in the hall. Online it might, of course, be a different picture. Microsoft is also putting its hands deep in its pockets to make sure its console is getting exclusive titles. Eighteen exclusives this year is decent - though much of what they showed won't be out until 2019. More important longer-term is the announcement that it has acquired several smaller outfits. We won't know how astute those deals will be for quite some time. But the purchase of Playground Games and Ninja Theory are an endorsement of the British gaming industry. What struck me particularly about this year was how much time was spent telling gamers about all the different ways to pay. In particular, the Game Pass scheme is becoming ever more important to Microsoft's business. The momentum is clearly headed in the direction of all-you-can-play subscriptions being the primary way to pay. Good for variety, but perhaps bad for our attention spans. Bethesda showed off footage from Fallout 76 ahead of its own E3 press event Other major titles shown off at Microsoft's E3 show that were not billed as exclusives included: Fallout 76 - Bethesda said its post-apocalyptic prequel would be ""four times the size"" of Fallout 4 and be set in West Virginia. Its launch date is 14 November Tom Clancy's The Division 2 - Ubisoft's multiplayer role-playing sequel is set in Washington DC and is due to be released on 15 March 2019 Kingdom Hearts 3 - Square Enix's action-adventure game featuring Disney characters. It was revealed to include cartoon cast from the movies Frozen, Tangled and Wreck It Ralph Devil May Cry 5 - Capcom's demon-slaying shooter is promised for Spring 2019 Jump Force - a new super hero-themed fighting game from Bandai Namco Devil May Cry's Nero has had a haircut and now sports a robotic right hand The only other Xbox/Windows 10 exclusive announced was Ori and The Will Of The Wisps - a fantasy-animal platformer. However, Microsoftsaid several other indie games,external, including the skateboarding title Session, would launch on the Xbox One before other consoles.

'Thugs' stopped from going to World Cup,"More than 1,200 people banned from attending football matches have surrendered their passports ahead of the World Cup, the Home Office says. Of 1,312 individuals with football banning orders, 1,254 have given up their documents before the tournament in Russia, which starts on 14 June. Police say they will continue working to trace the remaining 58. Police minister Nick Hurd said the action would ensure ""thugs"" would not ""ruin the tournament for real fans"". About 10,000 people from the UK are expected to travel to Russia for the World Cup. Does England have the most critical media in world football? Meet the only English referee at the World Cup Predict who will win the World Cup Fans making the trip have been advised by the Foreign Office toread the latest travel advice before departing.,external Supporters are being encouraged to be ""good guests"", read up on the host cities and carry Â£200 in roubles at all times to cover emergency expenses. In March, English police had to reassure Russian authorities only ""genuine fans"" would make the journey, after more than 100 supporters were arrested when England played the Netherlands in Amsterdam. There were also violent clashes between Russia and England supporters when the two countries played each other in Marseille at Euro 2016. As well as the banning orders, police will be deployed at major UK ports during the World Cup to stop known troublemakers from travelling to Russia. A delegation from the UK will travel to the country to work with their police counterparts during the tournament. Football banning orders are imposed by courts and can last for up to 10 years. There are currently 327 banned individuals who do not hold passports and they are not required to report to police. Two years ago 1,406 people were ordered to surrender their passports prior to Euro 2016 in France, while 1,456 were asked to give them up before the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the national lead for football policing, said: ""A comprehensive policing operation has been in place across the country to account for passports of those on banning orders, which has once again seen only a handful of those outstanding.""

N Korean media celebrates Trump-Kim summit,"North Korea has celebrated the Trump-Kim summit as a great win for the country, with state media reporting that the US intends to lift sanctions. The two leaders met on Tuesday, signing a brief declaration on denuclearisation and reducing tensions. President Donald Trump said afterwards that sanctions would remain in place for now, but would be lifted once ""nukes are no longer a factor"". He also announced an unexpected end to US-South Korea military drills. The move - long demanded by Pyongyang - has been seen as a major concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise. The Pentagon has since sought to reassure its alliesof its ""ironclad"" security commitments. Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments In his latest tweets after arriving back in the United States, Mr Trump continued his upbeat tone. ""There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea,"" he maintained. ""President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. No longer - sleep well tonight!"" North Korea's media are tightly controlled by the government and only ever report positively on officials' activities. They rarely report on leader Kim Jong-un's activities in real time. This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: Win-win, or a Kim win? But Tuesday's summit in Singapore was front page news on Wednesday, with multiple images of Mr Kim alongside Mr Trump. Official newspaper Rodong Sinmun called the summit ""the meeting of the century"" on its front page. Kim is a 'funny guy' - analysing Trump's quotes State media agency KCNA published an enthusiastic article in English praising the talks as a historic break from the past. The declaration signed at the end of the summit said the two countries would co-operate towards ""new relations"", while the US would provide ""security guarantees"" to North Korea. This video can not be played North Korean state TV showed a cartoon as President Trump spoke in Singapore Pyongyang in return ""commits to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,"" the document says. Full text of the signed statement Missed chance to discuss human rights, says defector Most Western observers have said the deal appears to include significant concessions from the US while including no new commitments from North Korea nor details on how denuclearisation could be achieved. KCNA has focused on those elements as a great breakthrough for North Korea. Analysts have said the deal signed promised much but was short on detail ""Trump expressed his intention to halt US-South Korea joint military exercises, offer security guarantees to the North and lift sanctions against it along with advance in improving the mutual relationship through dialogue and negotiation,"" it said. Although not part of the joint declaration, Mr Trump said after the summit that sanctions ""will come off"" once the US is sure that the nukes are ""no longer a factor"". He also said he hoped that this would be soon. What are the US-South Korea war games? Depicting the two leaders very much as equals at the meeting, KCNA quotes Mr Kim as saying it was urgent ""to make bold decision on halting irritating and hostile military actions against each other"". KCNA also reported that both leaders had agreed to visit each other in the US and North Korea respectively. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spoke to Donald Trump after the summit, saying there was ""great meaning in Chairman Kim's clearly confirming to President Trump the complete denuclearisation"". Tokyo also, however, cautioned that despite Pyongyang's pledge for denuclearisation no concrete steps had been taken and that Japan would not let down its guard. Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said Japan sees ""US-South Korean joint exercises and the US military presence in South Korea as vital to security in East Asia"". The US holds regular joint exercises with both Japan and South Korea ""It is up to the US and South Korea to decide about their joint exercises. We have no intention of changing our joint drills with the US,"" he said. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the Singapore summit as an ""equal dialogue"" between the two sides, adding that ""no-one will doubt the unique and important role played by China: a role which will continue"". Chinese state media described the summit as a ""starting point"" but said ""no-one would expect the half-day summit to be able to iron out all differences and remove deep-seated mistrust between the two long-time foes"".

Raccoon dubbed hero after skyscraper climb,"This video can not be played The animal had been scaling the UBS building since Tuesday morning A daredevil raccoon has been safely rescued after leaving the internet on tenterhooks by scaling a 23-floor building in St Paul, Minnesota. The critter, dubbed #MPRraccoon after the radio station opposite the high-rise, trended worldwide on Twitter. Crowds gathered at the building after it went viral, and local media streamed its perilous climb for almost a day. Twitter celebrated as it reached the roof at 03:00am (08:00 BST) where cat food was waiting inside a trap. The raccoon has been collected by animal welfare and will be released later. Evan Frost and Tim Nelson, journalists withMinnesota Public Radio (MPR),external, documented the raccoon's nerve-wracking journey on Twitter. ""One of my colleagues spotted the raccoon on, kind of the ground floor, sitting on a ledge on Monday - it looked like a brown lump, almost like a cat sitting there,"" Evan Frost told the BBC in the early hours of Wednesday. Watchers were concerned for the animal's welfare, and feared he needed food and water ""We went out there at about 8:30 on Tuesday morning and saw it was a raccoon. Two workers in the building got out a couple of long planks - sort of making a kind of ladder for it."" But that initial rescue failed - and ended up scaring the animal upwards. It spent much of Tuesday going up and down the building's floors, occasionally napping on ledges. Before its final ascent to the roof, it had been slowly making its way down, as an anxious audience watched on into the night. ""It was heartbreaking to see yesterday,"" Tim Nelson told the BBC on Wednesday. ""We couldn't imagine how this would end well for him"". Allow Twitter content?

The raccoon has since been captured and fed by local Wildlife Management It has not been confirmed locally if the raccoon is a male or female. Raccoons are common in the US, but are usually found in alleys or riffling through rubbish bins - leading to the common animal nickname ""trash panda"". ""I was talking to a wildlife expert yesterday who said there might be a dozen or two dozen of these raccoons in every square mile here in Minnesota - they're everywhere. But you don't see them scaling office towers,"" Mr Nelson said. The building's windows were sealed, and local fire officials said it was too dangerous to attempt a human rescue Both men were overwhelmed by the global reaction to their posts about the raccoon's ascent. ""I think it just seems like something a lot of different people can get behind,"" Mr Frost told the BBC. ""It's kind of absurd that I took a couple of pictures of an animal that people usually hate and think is disgusting, and all of a sudden it has thousands of retweets and likes."" Husky rescued after getting into difficulty Cow saved from slaughter after straying over border Sausage dog swells up to three times its size Mr Nelson grew up in a town called Coon Rapids, named after the mammals. ""To think that one of these little animals would top the trending on Twitter is a complete surprise to me,"" he said. Crowds gathered throughout Tuesday day and overnight at the scene One woman, Mary Lucia, brought binoculars, and said she was worried about the animal on Tuesday Both men laughed when asked if they had managed to get any work done during raccoon-watch. Although the animal was filmed reaching the top shortly before 03:00 local time - it was not officially confirmed safe until five hours later when it was officially found safe inside the trap.

Children exposed to horror ads on YouTube,"Three parents contacted the ASA to say their children had been distressed by the ads Children were left distressed after seeing ads for a horror film on YouTube, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has revealed. Three parents contacted the ASA after their children saw ads for Insidious: The Last Key - rated 15 in the UK. One ad for the film was shown before videos of songs from Frozen, instructions for building a Lego fire station and a clip from the cartoon PJ Masks. The ASA has upheld the complaints. In a second ad, the ASA said a young woman was seen ""lying on a floor immobile, bloodied and distressed while a humanoid creature crept towards her and then probed at her with claw-like fingers and pierced her skin"". Further horror-themed imagery followed, including a sequence of women screaming. This ad played before two videos of Minecraft, a game popular with children. Sony Pictures and Sony-owned Columbia Pictures, which promoted the film, told the ASA they had excluded unknown audiences and children from their targeting. The BBC understands that a follow-up probe by Sony indicated that YouTube's content categorising algorithms were at fault. The Google-owned streaming service, however, said that advertisers were responsible for own their campaigns. The video site added the ads had not appeared on YouTube Kids, an app aimed specifically at children that offers a filtered selection of YouTube content. ""We considered the ads were unsuitable for children because they were excessively frightening and shocking, and were likely to cause fear and distress,"" the ASA said in its ruling. The ASA also received three complaints from adults who found the ads unduly distressing. And it noted that the ads had appeared before unrelated content, with no warning and could not be skipped until five seconds had elapsed. The regulator has told Sony Pictures to ensure that future ads are appropriately targeted. The firm declined to comment. But the BBC understands that it is now limiting its ads for mature content to a pre-vetted list of safe YouTube channels.

Children in B&Bs: 'I didn't feel safe',"""I lived in a B&B with my mum for over two months, I was the same age I am now, 12,"" says Ellen. ""It was always cold. I don't think there was heating. There were a lot of strangers around. I didn't feel safe. ""You didn't know who was living there or what they might be capable of."" Ellen was interviewed about her experiences of homelessness as part of a child-led campaign, calling for more to be done to stop children in England being placed in unsuitable accommodation. The Change It! campaign, led by children and young people and supported by the Children's Rights Alliance for England (CRAE), saysits research,externalshows children are being housed in ""cramped, dirty and unsafe conditions, miles away from school, friends and family"". Ellen told the researchers she and her mother had been cramped into one small room, with use of a communal kitchen. ""It was messy, plates everywhere, and tissue on the floor. The oven didn't work. There was a washing machine, but it was broken."" Michael, 14, who was in a B&B for five months, said: ""You can't go downstairs and watch TV, because there'll be someone shouting. You're locked up in one room with your family. ""There's nothing to do. It's like being in prison. Fowzia: ""It wasn't safe"" ""There are two showers in the building. We're meant to use the one upstairs - but it doesn't work properly, it's hot enough to burn you. ""So, we wake up at 05:00 so we can use the downstairs one and don't clash with the other people living here. ""Sometimes in the morning, you'll see stuff in the toilet and the sink. It's disgusting."" Fowzia was housed in a B&B for six months when she was 16. She said there had been people there she had not felt safe around. ""It wasn't safe. Once, someone got into our room. The door was completely broken. ""There were some families, but some of the people were not in families. It was weird. You would see lots of kids going in, and then just a random group of men coming out of the rooms."" Cameron said living in temporary accommodation for eight months had been ""too much"". ""We lived in the hostel for eight months when I was 10. I'm 11 now. Me and my dad couldn't afford the rent on our old place, so we had to move. Cameron: ""It was always cold"" ""The hostel was damp. It was always cold. There was a wasp nest right by the window of our room so we could never open it to let fresh air in."" Carl, 16, told researchers he was in a B&B with his father for seven months. ""When we first arrived, I found a dead bed bug on the bed. Then I saw blood on the sheet. I pulled the sheet off the bed, and on the mattress saw loads of blood stains too. ""After a few days, me and my dad started itching and we realised that we'd been getting bitten. ""It made me stressed having such a small space, no privacy of my own. Even going to the toilet, my dad can hear me. There's nothing you can do. You can't do your own thing. You've got no space."" The report says extended periods of time in this sort of accommodation increases the likelihood that children will: be bullied at school experience mental health problems develop physical illness fall behind in their education. ""B&Bs and temporary accommodation are often unsafe, dirty, overcrowded and breach health and safety regulations,"" it says. ""Very young children have nowhere to play, crawl and learn to walk, and parents find it difficult to set up regular sleep routines or potty train. Older children have no privacy and have nowhere to study or socialise with friends."" The report says many youngsters are being kept in this sort of accommodation for too long. It is unlawful for councils to place children (or pregnant women) in a B&B for more than six weeks. ""Children of all ages are being left in B&Bs and TA [temporary accommodation] for months on end, often with no support and no idea how long they will be there."" Many families are put in housing a long way from their local area, it adds. The campaign comes as official statistics show the numbers of people in temporary accommodation are increasing. Data published in March,externalshowed there were nearly 79,000 households in temporary accommodation at the end of December last year, including over 120,000 children. In total, 2,030 families with dependent children were placed in B&B-style accommodation at the end of December. The young people involved in the Change It! campaign want ministers to listen to the voices of children and young people. The group is calling on the government to take urgent action to ensure local authorities stop housing families in B&Bs for longer periods by ensuring there is enough suitable housing for children. Louise King, director of the CRAE, which is supporting the campaign, said: ""It's shocking that in 2018 children are telling us about living in infested accommodation and being forced to share filthy bathrooms with adults they do not know. ""Despite it being illegal to house children in B&Bs for longer than six weeks, the children we have spoken to have been forced to live there for months on end. ""The government must take urgent action to put a stop to this unacceptable situation."" A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Everyone deserves a safe and decent place to live. And councils are required to provide people with temporary accommodation that is suitable for their needs. ""We are spending more than Â£1.2bn to ensure all those who are homeless, including children, get the support they need. ""To ensure families can access permanent accommodation, we are also investing Â£2bn in social-rent housing and allowing councils to borrow more to build homes.""

Raccoon's skyscraper climb transfixes web," The Grenfell Wall sprang up overnight. Within hours, hundreds of people had left messages of sympathy and support. Relatives of those missing brought favourite items, teddies and photos. Missing posters were plastered everywhere, bearing the faces of those still unaccounted for and telephone numbers for anyone who might have information. The wall is still there today in the shadow of the tower. It provides a glimpse into the terrors that unfolded on 14 June 2017. The idea for the wall came from Jamie Sewell, who works for the Eden network, a charity that places youth workers on council estates to build links between communities and the church. Jamie Sewell Jamie had lived alongside Grenfell Tower for five years and, in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, he drew from his experiences as a youth worker. He and his wife had opened their home to teenagers on the fringes of gang life. Three years before the fire, one of those boys had died. He was just 15 and Jamie had helped with the grieving process by providing a quiet space in the church where friends could meet and share memories. With that in mind, the day after the fire, he took his van to a garden centre to buy large white boards, a little wicker heart and fairy lights. His team of youth workers spent that day comforting people who were looking for loved ones, and talking to youngsters who were upset at what had happened. Volunteers construct the wall It was 20:00 BST when his exhausted team decided to finally close the doors of the Latymer Community Church. Then, they set about creating the Grenfell Wall. “All of our team, by that point, were just absolutely wrecked,” he says. “We started putting it up and we weren’t sure how it was going to be received. I think we were a bit nervous. “We hadn’t even finished writing ‘Prayer Wall’, and we just quickly became swamped by people grabbing pens off us.” Then, Jamie recalls, those around him “just started writing and pouring their hearts out on to these boards”. People write on the wall A day later, Jamie’s boards were almost full and people started bringing their own down, attaching them along walkways surrounding the tower. As well as writing messages, they laid flowers and wreaths, with firefighters hanging their shirts on the nearby railings, along with heartfelt messages describing their sorrow. Firefighter's T-shirt Families of some of those missing made small shrines and placed toys and photos next to candles as they huddled together waiting for news. Children light candles “People just started grieving together,” says Jamie. “For me it became a real place to go, among the madness and the chaos, to be quiet and just to walk around and read, and I suppose it made me personally feel a lot less lonely.” Some of the first to write on the wall were volunteers who came from all over the country to bring food, water and clothing. Listen toThe Grenfell Wall, from BBC Radio 4, on the BBC iPlayer. Naeem Brisco runs a design company in Leicester and had woken to news of the fire. Naeem Brisco He has overcome more than his own fair share of difficulties - from getting into trouble as a kid, then going against family expectations by marrying for love rather than letting his family find him a wife. When that marriage broke down, he became homeless and was helped back on his feet by a stranger - which, he thinks, explains why he felt so moved to act in the aftermath of the Grenfell fire. Naeem Brisco He temporarily closed his business, brought his team together and loaded a van with supplies. When he got to London, close to Grenfell Tower, Naeem unloaded his van by organising volunteers into a human chain that passed donations down to the supply centre. Volunteers move the supplies: Nothing had prepared him for the smell that hung in the area and the sense of distress as he helped a teenager look for his parents. The wall became Naeem’s way of making sense of the situation. “Sometimes you’ve got to express yourself and by putting something in writing - I wouldn’t say it’s a closure, but it’s an element of you giving your condolence,” he says.  “You felt good when you wrote something. You’ve given a message, you know what I mean?” Naeem's message: Naeem positioned himself close to the tower as he gave out supplies - food, water and clothing - to those searching for information. School children with posters of Jessica Urbano Some, like the schoolmates of 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez, wore T-shirts bearing her photo and face masks to protect themselves from smoke from the still-smouldering tower. Maryam Adam, for her part, was bewildered and full of guilt that she could have done more to warn her friends in the tower. Maryam Adam Maryam lived next to the flat where the fire started and her husband, Abdulwahab, had woken her after their neighbour alerted him to blaze. She thought the flames would be easily extinguished and only agreed to leave because she was pregnant and worried about her baby. Her biggest regret is that she didn’t take her phone - as she watched the flames reach higher, she was unable to alert friends still trapped inside. There had been great excitement among people she knew in Grenfell when she first told them of her pregnancy. In the days following the fire, she held out hope that friends might be found alive: Rania and her two daughters, Fethia and Hania; Nura and her children, Yahya, Firdaws and Yaqub; and Amal with her daughter, Amaya, who had an infectious laugh. Poster: Amal and Amaya Maryam moved into her flat in 2008, after 10 years of living in a hostel. She is from Somalia and grew up in Sudan, before coming to the UK in her 20s and loving everything about her new life. She and her husband shared their one-bedroom flat with her brother and his wife and they were happy - all the more so once she found out she was pregnant. Her life was turned upside down by the fire and, a year on, she still struggles to make sense of it. “I know many, many, many of my friends died. They died in Grenfell,” she says. “When you see somebody asking for help and you can’t do anything for them, it’s too difficult.” The one piece of good news for Maryam was the birth, in November, of her son, Mohammed. Relatives in Sudan sent her traditional costume, which she proudly shows us as we talk. Maryam and family The family are in temporary accommodation - it’s overcrowded, with boxes stacked in a corner and a makeshift bed for her brother in the small living room. There is no room for a cot for Mohammed, who shares a bed with his parents. “You see, that is how we live. Just always we are dreaming, waiting just to get good news, but I don’t know if we are going to hear it or not.” Maryam in temporary accommodation She thinks of all the nights she spent not sleeping, worrying about her child. “We are not living in our home, or anything like it. I don’t know where I’m going to move, where I’m going to live. “And I’m fed up because I don’t know for how long I’m going to be waiting. We lost everything in Grenfell, we lost everything.” Maryam gradually accepted that she would not see her friends again. Amaya Tuccu-Ahmedin She often thinks of little Amaya and the picture on the Grenfell Wall - a cheeky grin as the three-year-old plays outdoors. It was taken by Luke Rosher, a teacher at St Peter’s Nursery on Portobello Road: “I took that photo actually, in the park, the playground - pure and innocent and lovely.” Luke at the nursery The head teacher at the nursery, Tracey Lloyd, had got to know Amaya’s mother, Amal, well. Tracey laughs as she recalls the wonderful meals Amal would prepare on sharing days. Amaya’s dad Mohamednur was committed to his daughter’s education, having earned both a degree and an MSc since arriving in Britain. He was originally from Eritrea and had been active with anti-government forces there. The family lived on the 19th floor of the tower and Amaya died in the arms of her mother. The pair held each other tight in their last moments of consciousness. The Grenfell Wall became an important part of the grieving process for nursery staff, who went together to remember the family. It also provided a way of helping young classmates who struggled to make sense of the loss. Posters on the railings near Grenfell One six-year-old neighbour of Amaya’s used red pencil to draw fierce flames over the windows of a tall tower. Other youngsters drew children screaming at windows. Luke worked with his class to put together handprints on a remembrance board that they took to the site. The poster the nursery children made for Amaya A year on, he is repeating the task. “I made a poster with the children, just little tiny handprints to show this is not just affecting grown-ups,” he says. “It is little children who are seeing this and living this and wanting to do this. There were, I think, 20 there and then we put a little message saying: ‘We miss you, Amaya.’” Tracey says: “I feel very close to Amal and Amaya and Mo and the auntie when I’m there and I think it’s important that we do remember those families, those innocent lives that were cut short way, way, way before their time.” Both Tracey and Luke remember the rush of emotions they both experienced when they first saw the Grenfell Wall. “Just seeing all the tributes was just amazing,” says Luke. “It was so many conflicting emotions.  There was obviously the sadness and, just disbelief - but then there was also this rush of, like, ‘Oh my gosh.’” Tracey recalls “flowers everywhere, candles, and things that people had written - eulogies, their thoughts - friends, families, the fire brigade with their T-shirts, and it just seemed to go on and on and on”. Firefighter's T-shirt Many of those who survived the fire were given temporary hotel rooms in the surrounding area - coming back to the estate to collect clothes and register at the relief centre. They had lost everything, including passports, bank cards, phones and computers as they fled, but this paled into insignificance compared with the trauma of not knowing who had survived. Miguel Alves and his wife Fatima were desperate for news of their friends Marcio Gomes, his wife Andreia and their two children, 12-year-old Luana and 10-year-old Megan. Miguel and Marcio play football together They had heard nothing since around 03:00, when the family began their escape from the 21st floor. Fatima prayed that they would be found alive. Miguel made contact with the Portuguese authorities, who initially told him they hadn’t made it out. The Gomes family had lived in the tower for 10 years With so many gathered at the Grenfell Wall, rumours were rife. There was conjecture about the death toll and stories of a baby thrown from a window. Missing posters came and went, with some marked “found”, and others staying intact. While Miguel and Fatima waited to hear about the Gomes family, their 20-year-old son Tiago looked at the missing posters put up by volunteers from Solidarity Sports, which provides activities and opportunities for disadvantaged children. Miguel and Fatima, with their son Tiago and daughter Ines Tiago, now 21, is studying physics at King’s College London and, passing the wall, he saw faces he remembered. He recalled teaching 13-year-old Yahya Hashim how to knot his tie on his first day of secondary school. Missing poster: Firdaws and Yahya There was also a poster of Steve Power, 63. Steve would give him advice while out walking his two bull terriers, telling Tiago to make the most of his education and that hard work would pay off in the end. Candles and missing posters Some nights, as he drifts in and out of sleep, Tiago realises: “Oh wait, I’m not in my bed.” He hopes that in the morning, it will all turn out to have been a dream, and he’ll return to normal life. And then he wakes up and finds he is still in the hotel: “Oh, this did actually happen. As I’m trying to sleep, I almost pinch myself saying ‘Wake up now,’ because I can’t deal with it any more.” Tiago and his sister, 16-year-old Ines Alves, had spent most of their childhood living in the tower and loved living there. Ines Alves A year on, Ines is still receiving counselling, but says it is hard to cope with images from the night - people calling for help and phone lights in the windows - coupled with the loss of everything they owned and friends they cared for. “Everyone knew each other,” she says. “You’d see each other in the flats and say ‘Hi’ or ‘Bye,’ or smile if you saw them in the street. It’s starting to hit me slowly, everything that’s happened. I still feel like I’m in a nightmare and tomorrow I’m going to wake up and go back home.” The pictures of Yahya, 13, his 12-year-old sister, Firdaws and little brother, Yaqub, were taken by Sean Mendez, who runs Solidarity Sports. The siblings had lived on the 22nd floor and, as soon as he heard about the fire, Sean went to hospitals searching for news. Since then he was worked with their aunt, Aseema Kedir, to set up the Hashim Family Legacy that, last October, enabled 16 children to fulfil the dream that Firdaws once had - to visit Walt Disney World in Florida. Sean talks about helping children affected by the fire: Similar legacies are being created by others, like Mike Volpe, the Director at Opera Holland Park. He lost a friend and employee, Deborah Lamprell, in the fire and he has organised a memorial concert to raise funds to help local children. “We’ve called it Hope for Grenfell because yes, it’s a part-memorial, it remembers all those people, it remembers Debbie for us in particular,” he says. “But it also says we need to have some hope. Everyone’s got to go on despite the need for justice and to find out what happened but we do actually have to go on. There has to be some hope, somewhere.” Miguel Alves kept hope alive while he waited for news of his missing friend, Marcio Gomes. But in the face of such a tragedy he knows it was only luck that spared him and his family. Fatima Alves Miguel and Fatima had been returning to their 13th-floor flat in the early hours when the lift stopped at the fourth floor. They saw the smoke and Miguel went up to wake his children and neighbours while Fatima waited outside. The couple are originally from Portugal. He is a chauffeur and they had saved for the £82,000 they needed to buy their flat. Living there he had become good friends with Marcio and his family. As soon as he escaped, Miguel phoned Marcio and urged him to get out. The fire service, however, had told the family to stay put. Twice they had tried to escape, but the smoke had beaten them back. With Miguel’s phone calls growing more urgent, Marcio contemplated the enormity of the decision he had to make. “Miguel said, ‘Look, you need to go out’ and obviously he was getting very agitated about it, and I said: ‘I’ve already tried twice,’ he recalls. “Then I said: ‘It’s just pitch black,’ and it’s thick black smoke. You couldn’t even see your hand in front.” Marcio could hear Miguel growing increasingly agitated and distressed. “You can see actually this is a lot worse than what you’re thinking. And also I had my neighbour and her daughter so, it’s a lot of responsibility if things go wrong. I’m thankful for Miguel because he made me more aware that this is really bad.” As the flames grew closer, he realised he didn’t have a choice: “There was no way we were going to survive by staying.” Marcio gathered wet towels and tried to stay at the rear of the building as they descended the stairwell. “You couldn’t see anything,” he says. “It was pitch black, absolutely pitch black.” He didn’t notice the dead bodies at first. “We only realised once we stepped on a body or tripped over - but there was nothing we could do for them and my focus was trying to get everybody downstairs. Luana and our neighbour’s daughter, they both then passed out at the same time. Didn’t see where they fell, you couldn’t see anything at all.” It was firefighters who found the two girls and carried them to safety. They spent nearly a month in induced comas, as did 10-year-old Megan and Marcio’s wife, Andreia. She was seven months pregnant and, before the fire, the couple had decorated a nursery for the son they were planning to call Logan. On its wall they had written: “Twinkle, twinkle, little star, do you know how loved you are?” Logan was stillborn when he was delivered and Marcio cradled him in his arms, willing him to breathe. Marcio and Andreia tell how they escaped the blaze: “I think we’re still processing it in all fairness, and I think we will always process it for the rest of our lives,” he says. “You’re never going to be 100% as you were before. You try to move on, you know - that’s how humans cope with things. There’s certain things I can’t talk about because I get really emotional - to do with the night, to do with my son. “You try and make new memories and move on. I think you get better at controlling the emotions as time goes on but it’s still difficult and it will always be difficult.” Marcio and Miguel have supported each other since the fire and feel that their weekly games of football provide an outlet for the grief. Marcio and Miguel Following the tragedy, other players donated kit and even football boots. Marcio is still experiencing some trouble with his breathing, caused by smoke inhalation, but seldom misses a game. “You know it just helps, I think, for me,” he says. “Just to talk to each other and it just helps process what happened.” Marcio and Miguel talk about their football games: Fatima, meanwhile, takes comfort from the Cenacle of Missionary Prayer Group. The shrine she had in her 13th-floor flat was destroyed in the fire, but she has rebuilt it in her temporary accommodation. She says it is nice to finally have a kitchen to prepare family meals - she likes to cook and to entertain, something she did regularly in their Grenfell flat. Fatima's shrine When the family is on their own, the memories return, she says. Miguel agrees. They have to enjoy life, he says. “We can be ashes inside of the tower, you know? Life is too short.” The couple have had counselling since the fire, as have their children. Ines is now in sixth form, having passed the GCSE chemistry exam she sat the day after the fire. The family recently were allowed to see inside the shell of their old flat but were not really prepared for how upsetting it would be. Fatima recalls seeing the metal frame from her son’s bed and his desk bent out of shape. “It was very sad,” she says. “I started crying when I saw that because in my mind, from the beginning, I said: ‘No, something will be saved.’“It was hard to see.” Since then, they have been sent three small boxes and two larger ones containing items salvaged from the ashes - the mugs that were inside the metal dishwasher, some coins from Tiago’s piggybank, a watch and a small cross, which is singed black around the edges. Miguel and Fatima's possessions Everything is in small see-through pouches, each of which smells of the fire when they are opened. It is emotionally draining and, to date, Fatima has emptied just two of the five boxes, and she has no idea whether or not to keep things. They are a reminder of her past life, but it is painful to see the state of them now. The family will soon move into a more permanent home, a nice house close to their old flat - a place they can finally call home. One of the first people to place a missing poster on the memorial wall was Thomas Murphy, originally from Ireland, who is a member of several community groups in the area and has lunch twice a week at the Salvation Army in Portobello Road. Thomas Murphy Maj Paul Scott, who oversees things there, says it was all hands on deck when the fire broke out, with Thomas and other volunteers helping sort out the donations and get people the help they needed. “Everybody just pulled together. It didn’t matter what religion we were or they were. We were amazed because we had about 80 people at one point who were looking for missing friends and relations.” This was particularly true for Thomas and the lunch club participants who knew some of those affected. For 90-year-old Olive it was painful to witness her granddaughters upset at losing a classmate, five-year-old Isaac Paulos. Marjory, 61, mourned the death of Marjorie Vital, who died with her 50-year-old son, Ernie. As locals they pass the wall, sometimes seeing vigils and memorial services, like the one held for 29-year-old Berkti Haftom and her son, Biruk, who was 12. The fire shattered many close bonds - for Thomas it meant the loss of his friend, Vincent Chiejina, who was born in Nigeria and, like him, was active in the Open Age Charity and St Francis of Assisi Church in Notting Hill. Thomas put up missing posters even though he knew his search was probably in vain: “I wasn’t naive to think that he had escaped out of that because I stood there that night and I watched that inferno.” Missing poster: Vincent Chiejina In the aftermath, Thomas printed out photos and went to the Grenfell Wall, asking anyone he could find for news of his 60-year-old friend, who lived alone on the 17th floor. During the weeks that followed he found out more about Vincent, who he says had always been protective of his privacy, but was incredibly caring and determined to help the most vulnerable in society. Vincent and Thomas “I just appreciated him and I found him to be a nice person,” Thomas says. “And eventually he told me what happened to him, that he was studying at university - mathematics was his forte - and then snap, his mind went. He told me as much as he wanted to and that was it, I left it at that, being discreet about it, you know. Whatever it was, it did a lot of harm to him. And I thought: ‘My God, ending up on that floor on your own.’ And he’s not alone, he’s not alone in that position.” For the community, the fate of the Grenfell Wall is still to be decided. At the moment, sheets of plastic help preserve the messages of love and support. Some local residents are angry that the wall has not been removed and feel that it is stopping people from moving forward. One woman who asked not to be named points to sightseers drifting by and camera crews in the area. “Tacky. It’s beginning to look tacky,” she says. “So how long does that stay there? Where does it all go, that stuff? And when? We all need to move on. There have been vigils after vigils and you come home and it’s like - how many memorial services do we need? And who are these actually for?” For his part, Jamie Sewell, who first put up the boards, sees this as an important opportunity to consider important issues raised by the fire. Jamie Sewell He hopes that some form of permanent legacy is forthcoming. The next challenge for the community, he says, is figuring out how it will remember the tragedy. Some people on the outside think that Grenfell is something that happened in the past and it's not happening any more, says Jamie: “But actually, there is still so much grief, so many questions.” One year on, looking at the wall “makes me realise that we were all in it together and we were all feeling much the same kind of thing - there’s anger, a massive sense of loss, a massive sense of injustice and a massive sense of confusion”, he says. “I think that’s what the Grenfell Wall ended up representing.” See the messages in close-up.

Nintendo Switch gets FortniteVideoVideoBattlefield V resists gender attacksVideoVideoSuper Smash Bros Ultimate battle-testedSony's Last of Us sequel kisses and killsE3: Xbox One chief teases Halo Infinite,"Fortnite is being released as a free download from the Nintendo eShop Nintendo has announced that Fortnite is being released for its Switch console to coincide with the opening of the E3 video games show in Los Angeles. However, the release is limited to the title's last-gamer-standing Battle Royale mode and will not include the original Save The World co-op content. Nintendo also revealed Super Smash Bros Ultimate will include every character to have appeared in prior versions. It described it as the ""biggest crossover in gaming history"". This video can not be played WATCH: Chris Foxx battle-tests Super Smash Bros Ultimate at E3 That means the fighting game will include the Japanese firm's own characters - Mario, Zelda and the Splatoon Inklings - as well as those from third-party developers, such as Final Fantasy's Cloud, Metal Gear Solid's Snake and Sonic The Hedgehog. Nintendo acknowledged that its decision to include so many fighters from the past meant that there was a limited number of new challenges. But it added that Ridley - a dragon-like villain from the Metroid franchise - would be included for the first time. The title is expected be one of the biggest releases yet for the 15-month-old games machine, and Nintendo spent the bulk of its video presentation describing the game's features. Splatoon's Inklings are among the characters to choose from in the latest Super Smash Bros game The multiplayer battle game - which lets up to eight players compete at once - is due to go on sale on 7 December.

Nintendo announced in April that it had sold 17.7 million units of the Switch to date, and forecast it would sell a further 20 million over the following year. That would represent a much better result than that managed by its predecessor, the Wii U. PlayStation's Last of Us sequel has kisses and kills Sony's E3 event in under three minutes Xbox One chief teases Halo Infinite Rapid-fire recap of Xbox One's new games Many analysts believe that a lack of compelling content in the Wii U's second year of release contributed to its underperformance. The launch of a Switch edition of Fortnite - which is already a huge hit on other platforms - should help avoid a repeat of that problem. Switch owners will be able to compete against those already playing Fortnite on Xbox One, PC, Mac and mobile devices, but not against PlayStation 4 gamers because of restrictions imposed by Sony. The Switch allows Fortnite to be played on its own screen or on bigger TVs ""It was widely rumoured that Epic Games' Fortnite was making its way to the Switch, but an earlier-than-expected release gives Nintendo a better chance of maintaining momentum through the summer months,"" commented Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at the IHS Markit consultancy. ""In the past, Nintendo has often failed to maintain support from third-party publishers due to its content dominance on its own platforms. The early success of the Switch has altered that dynamic, with many publishers keen to support the platform. ""But aside from Fortnite, there were no major third-party surprises, which is perhaps a little disappointing, although also a reflection of the seasonality of Nintendo's business, with lots of releases coming towards the end of the year."" Super Mario Party allows two Switch consoles to be arranged in different ways to enable characters to move between screens Other Switch games put in the spotlight during the Nintendo Direct presentation included: Daemon X Machina - a third-party ""mech"" flying-robots battle game from the Japanese developer Marvelous Entertainment, which is set to go in sale in 2019 the two Pokemon Let's Go releases announced last month - however the firm did not reveal any details of the ""core"" title previously promised for next year Super Mario Party - a mini-game collection that allows players to place two Switch consoles side-by-side to let characters shoot at each other and move between devices. It is set to become available on 5 October Fire Emblem: Three Houses - a top-down tactical war game set in a fantasy world, which is due to launch in Spring 2019 Most of Super Smash Bros Ultimate's characters will be locked at the start There were no huge surprises in Nintendo's presentation - the company had already announced most of the games it showed off before E3. When Nintendo released its Switch console in 2017, it hit the ground running and brought many of its biggest properties to the console within months. The release of Super Smash Bros Ultimate in December will fill one of the most notable first-party gaps in its line-up - and the inclusion of every hero that has ever appeared in the game will delight Nintendo fans Nintendo called it the biggest gaming crossover in history - demonstrating its determination to throw everything it has at its comeback. And the appearance of the multiplayer smash hit Fortnite on the Switch - as a free download - shows that third-party developers are willing to jump on board too.

Sony's Last of Us sequel kisses and killsE3: Xbox One chief teases Halo Infinite,"This video can not be played WATCH: Sony began its PlayStation 4 event with a kiss Sony has previewed one of its most anticipated PlayStation games with a trailer that shifted focus from two women kissing to a hanging man being disemboweled in its opening minutes. The Last of Us Part II is the follow-up to one of the top-reviewed and most awarded games of the PlayStation 3 generation. Gameplay footage made clear the sequel will be at least as bloody as its predecessor. However, no launch date was given. Initial reactions to the title from industry watchers were mostly positive, although one games reviewerremarked that the title was,external""fetishising extreme violence"". But there was praise for the way the developer Naughty Dog had presented the kiss. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I think they were trying to make to clear to people that this is what they're about - diversity [and] different sorts of stories,"" games journalist Julian Rizzo-Smith told the BBC. ""If you look at their franchises, it's stories led by strong females now. I think it's really setting a benchmark."" Sony also premiered the first gameplay footage from its surreal horror title Death Stranding. The game is being masterminded by Hideo Kojima, who was previously behind the Metal Gear series. Death Stranding's plot remains a mystery The trailer showed the lead character - modelled on The Walking Dead star Norman Reedus - trekking across a variety of landscapes before coming under attack from a group of invisible monsters, whose presence appears to be exposed by a foetus he is carrying. The plot still remains unclear and, again, no release date was offered. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gamers will be able to play through all of the next Assassin's Creed: Odyssey as a female character A kiss seen around the world! The embrace between Ellie and her (previously unannounced) girlfriend was a moment of genuine emotion - not titillation - that shows this multi-billion dollar industry is finally capturing the diversity of its audience. It was met with cheers, this was the climactic point of what is a major move forward in this industry. Gamers' affection for Ellie is based on good storytelling, Hollywood-worthy character development and terrific acting and direction - the character is not, as is so often the case in gaming, an act of tokenism designed to begrudgingly appease critics. On Monday we also saw Assassin's Creed, a game criticised in the past for having an entire roster of all-male characters. The latest instalment in the series, Odyssey, provides a new option to play as either male or female throughout the next game and, along the way, develop romantic relationships with men or women. So, Xbox's Gears 5, PlayStation's The Last of Us Part 2 and the multi-platform Assassin's Creed. All no doubt on course to be the biggest games of the next 12 months - and all lead by women. Sony has sold more than 76 million PlayStation 4 consoles to date, according to research firm IHS Markit. That represents nearly twice as many units as Microsoft's Xbox One, although it is still some way behind the PlayStation 2's tally of nearly 158 million. The Last of Us Part II featured several gruesome killings Many believe the Japanese firm's success has been driven by the popularity of its in-house exclusives including Uncharted 4, Horizon Zero Dawn and God of War. However, Microsoft now boasts having the more powerful games machine in the Xbox One X and has just announced that it has acquired and created several games studios. Sony's E3 event in under three minutes Xbox One chief teases Halo Infinite video game Gears of War gets a female lead ""A strong first-party library is what convinces people to buy your box over someone else's and this generation of consoles has hammered home that is still true,"" commented Laura Dale, news editor of the Kotaku UK news site. The opening part of Sony's E3 event was held in a room dressed up to look like one of Last of Us Part II's locations ""The PlayStation 4 has had frequent, high-quality first-party exclusives - which is something the Xbox One has not had. ""So, Sony goes into this E3 with everything to lose in the sense that it is in a strong position, but Microsoft did have a very good showing on Sunday."" Sony opted to show off about half the number of titles Microsoft did, in what was a much shorter event. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One analyst who attended both shows praised Sony's decision to try and recreate some of its games' environments for invitees, but added that Microsoft had likely produced the better experience for those live-streaming the showcases from afar. ""Sony certainly didn't show off as many new, unknown titles... and it was less pointed in terms of release dates,"" commented Lewis Ward from the consultancy IDC. ""But I don't think that was Sony's primary focus here. ""Its intent was to show off the beauty of its video games."" Ghost of Tsushima is being developed by Sucker Punch, the Sony division that created Infamous Other first-party exclusives shown off by Sony included Ghost of Tsushima, a Samurai-themed third-person sword-fighting game set in 1274. The Gaming Bolt review sitesuggested it resembled an episode,externalof Assassin's Creed set in Japan. New footage from Spider-Man - the centre-piece of Sony's 2017 E3 event - was also presented, featuring Electro and Rhino among other villains. The game is due for release in September. The Spider-Man trailer featured the super hero under attack from several of his enemies Content from third-party publishers was also displayed. Capcom showed off footage from a remake of Resident Evil 2. The survival-horror game was first released in 1998 and helped drive sales of the original PlayStation. Leon Kennedy returns in a Resident Evil 2 remake unveiled at the Sony press conference The new version is set to be released on 25 January 2019. Remedy Entertainment announced Control, a sci-fi game featuring a female lead with a shape-shifting gun who encounters several people's bodies floating mid-air. The Finnish developer was previously responsible for the Xbox/Windows exclusive Quantum Break. Remedy Entertainment said Control was set for release some time in 2019 California-based Squanch Games also announced a platformer featuring new characters developed by one of the co-creators of the TV comedy Rick and Morty. Trover Saves The Universe's madcap storyline centres on efforts to prevent a villain from draining dogs' life essence as part of a plan to destroy the universe. Unlike the other titles shown off at the event, a version of the game is being developed for use with the PlayStation's virtual reality headset. Trover Saves The Universe is set for release in ""early 2019"" Sony did, however, announce some other PlayStation VR releases following its conference. They included Deracine, a ghost story set in a girls' boarding school. It is being developed by the studio behind Bloodborne and Dark Souls, but the trailer suggested a more lyrical tone than those earlier blood-soaked games. Sony recently acknowledged that sales,externalof its virtual reality kit had been lower than expected. Deraine's trailer mixes together scenes from the past and present ""At this point it's more about supporting customers who bought PlayStation VR rather than trying to make it a huge success,"" commented Ms Dale. ""It's still the best value proposition out there in terms of headset resolution and price, but most of the market is still not ready for virtual reality.""

Dixons Carphone to close 92 stores,"Dixons Carphone employs more than 42,000 people in nine countries Shares in Dixons Carphonehave closed 20.7% downafter it warned of a sharp fall in profits this year. The mobile phone and electrical goods retailer also said it would close 92 of its more than 700 Carphone Warehouse stores this year. It expects pre-tax profits for 2017-18 to be Â£382m, but it predicts profits will fall to Â£300m in 2018-19. Chief executive Alex Baldock said ""nobody is happy with our performance"" but the problems were all ""fixable"". The company blamed ""challenges"" in the market for mobile phones and mobile services, including a declining market for long-term mobile contracts and people not renewing their handsets as frequently. It had also seen weaker demand for computers. Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Five things to do with empty retail space However, total sales were 3% higher in the year to 16 April, while like-for-like sales were up 4%. In the UK, sales grew 2% for the year as a whole, and by 1% in the fourth quarter. The international division did better, with like-for-like sales in Nordic countries up 9% in the year and Greece up 11%. Mr Baldock, who took over as group chief executive earlier this year, said the international business was in ""good shape"" so ""we're focusing early action on the UK"". ""We won't tolerate our current performance in mobile, or as a group. We know we can do a lot better,"" he added. ""Eight weeks in the business have cemented my optimism about Dixons Carphone's long-term prospects. I've found exceptional strengths, and though there's plenty to fix, it's all fixable."" The company expects a further decline in the market for long-term mobile contracts in the current financial year, but forecasts an increase in its share of the market for SIM-free handsets. It was also ""budgeting for a contraction"" in the UK electrical goods market. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, described the profits warning as ""grim"" but agreed the problems were ""all entirely fixable"". ""Dixons looks a bit flabby, and the market is just as soft, but there should be some easy wins in terms of making it leaner, especially around store closures,"" he added.

Dixons Carphone boss leaves for Boots,"Dixons Carphone employs over 42,000 people in nine countries The chief executive of Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse is leaving to join High Street chemist Boots. Dixons Carphone confirmed the departure of its boss Sebastian James, just days before it reports its results for the Christmas period. Last month, thefirm warned of a sharp fall in profitsbecause customers were not upgrading their phones enough. Mr James, who has been at Dixons since 2008 and is a friend of David Cameron and George Osborne, will go in April. He will be replaced as boss of the UK's biggest specialist electronics chain by Alex Baldock, chief executive of online retailer Shop Direct. Dixons Carphone, which employs over 42,000 people in nine countries, issued two profit warnings last year amid a slowdown in sales of new mobile handsets. Its shares have fallen more than 40% in the last 12 months, as investors worried about the firm's falling profits and a spending squeeze for UK shoppers. This video can not be played UK must stay in single market, says Dixons Carphone chief Mr James said he was ""very sad to leave"" but that he was proud of the ""profound transformation"" of the business. When Dixons, which owns Currys PC World, merged with mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse in 2014, he became chief executive of the joint group. A high-profile business leader, Mr James came out in support of remaining in the European Union's single market after the Brexit vote in June 2016. Since then, some parts of the business have struggled. Although Currys PC World reported growth last year, Carphone Warehouse suffered as customers shunned expensive handsets and held onto their old phones for longer. The firm is due to give its Christmas trading statement on Tuesday. Mr James will then join Boots's parent company, Walgreens Boots Alliance, later this year, the firm said.

"PM 'must honour Brexit vote assurances'Parliament must get a bigger say on a final Brexit deal, pro-Remain MPs warn after Commons showdown.UK Politics","This video can not be played Solicitor General Robert Buckland says Brexit legislation will be improved Theresa May must honour ""assurances"" she's given that Parliament will get a bigger say on any final Brexit deal, pro-EU Tory MPs say. The government averted a rebellion on the issue after a meeting between the PM and more than a dozen MPs. One of the potential rebels, Dominic Grieve, warned there would be consequences for the government if not. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a government source had told her no actual concessions had been agreed. And a senior minister, Solicitor General Robert Buckland, said the government had only agreed to ""further discussions"" about the way in which they could make ""a further step forward"". A group of MPs said on Tuesday they were offered, in a last-minute concession, real ""input"" if no deal with the EU was done by December.

Details of precisely what this will involve could emerge in the coming days when the EU Withdrawal Bill is due to return to the House of Lords. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March next year, after the referendum in 2016 when people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave. The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"". Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit. But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy. Given that politicians, like the rest of the country, are divided on what Brexit should look like, this is posing problems for the government as it tries to get the bill through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. This video can not be played The government has dodged a defeat on its key Brexit legislation The government is currently trying to persuade MPs to undo most of the changes made by the House of Lords, and on Tuesday this involved a tussle over how much of a say Parliament will get if it does not like the deal struck between the UK and the EU. The government does not want to give MPs and peers the power to say what sort of Brexit deal the UK should strike with the EU, saying this should be left to ministers. When it came to the key vote, a group of Conservatives who had threatened to rebel agreed at the last minute not to defeat the government after public haggling between ministers and would-be rebels and a meeting between Mrs May and more than a dozen Tory MPs. But it is not yet clear exactly what the MPs were offered and whether they are happy with what has since been said by ministers. This video can not be played Tory rebel Nicky Morgan tells Today she was given 'assurances' by May ""I expect the government to honour its commitments and I expect the PM to honour her commitments and I have no reason to distrust the approach she took with us,"" one of the would-be rebels, Dominic Grieve, told the BBC's Newsnight. Ahead of the vote Mr Grieve tried to broker a compromise between MPs and ministers which would apply if Parliament rejects the final UK-EU Brexit deal. Under his proposals, the government would then have to seek MPs' approval for its plan of action through a motion in the House of Commons. It would also have to do this if no deal has been agreed by the end of November 2018. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ministers have agreed to consider these suggestions - but not a third strand of his proposals which would require the government to ""follow any direction"" from MPs if there is no deal by 15 February 2019. Remain-supporting Conservatives Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan were two of the MPs to meet with Mrs May. Ms Soubry said she trusted Mrs May to ""honour the undertaking she gave"". Ms Morgan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What was agreed was the prime minister understood that Parliament wants to have a real say, in all circumstances, in relation to what's going to happen in the Brexit deal."" Politics is often about the big picture, but sometimes it is a festival for pedants. Believe me, in Westminster, there is a very very big difference between the promise of more serious chat about something with the possibility of a change - and a promise actually to do something different, especially if it is made by the occupant of Number 10. So just hours after the concession, (or non-concession) very, very dark mutterings began from those who had been persuaded by what they thought was a promise. Read Laura's full blog Eurosceptic MPs have criticised moves to give Parliament more power as Brexit approaches, saying this would be used to ""wreck"" the UK's EU departure. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, a leading Brexit backer, said the concessions could ""come back to haunt"" the government if they amounted to a veto over the terms of the UK's departure. He told the BBC that rebels were seeking a ""wrecking motion"", stating: ""It not only has the risk of stopping Brexit, it is certainly going to make the negotiating position of the government considerably diminished. ""It is hugely irresponsible, and I can't believe that those that are perpetrating this don't know exactly what they are doing. And, for me, it's a betrayal of the British people."" The EU Withdrawal Bill is now back in the House of Commons, with MPs debating the rest of the Lords amendments. These include a requirement to seek membership of the European Economic Area - an arrangement like Norway's that would keep the UK part of the EU single market. This is opposed by both the Conservative and Labour leaderships, despite the backing of some pro-EU MPs in both parties. There is also an amendment requiring the government to report to Parliament on steps taken to negotiate a customs union with the EU. The government has rejected this one too, and has proposed an alternative amendment referring to a new ""customs arrangement"" which was thought to have averted the possibility of a rebellion on that subject. Tempers flared in the Commons as MPs discussed immigration, with Speaker John Bercow appealing to members to ""respect"" each other's arguments. Ms Soubry said she was ""appalled"" at a speech from Labour's Caroline Flint and accused her of not appreciating the value of immigrants. Ms Flint had argued for new immigration controls, saying people wanted to be able to ""turn the tap on and off when we choose"". She said she was not against all immigration but that her constituents wanted a ""fair and managed system"". Earlier some MPs claimed an amendment passed on Tuesday night could have implications for the government's preferred trade options after Brexit. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the amendment, which committed the government to avoiding any ""physical infrastructure, including border posts, or checks and controls"" in Northern Ireland after Brexit. He said this meant one of the government's proposals for replacing the customs union - a technology-based solution to minimise border delays - could be ""unlawful"" if it involves any border infrastructure checks. Dominic Grieve agreed, saying: ""Not only will we have to stay in a form of customs arrangement amounting to a union, but we're also going to have to have a high level of regulatory alignment because otherwise the life that takes place along the border will be impossible because of different regulations on either side."" Labour's whips' office said it expected eight votes to take place from 19:30BST.

Could your medication make you depressed?,"When you hear of a drug having side-effects you might think of a physical reaction like a rash or a headache. But according to a new US study, many commonly-prescribed drugs may increase the risk of depression. The list includes heart medications, birth control pills and some painkillers - things lots of people in the UK are also prescribed. More than a third of the drugs the 26,000 participants took had depression as a possible side-effect. The study,in the Journal of the American Medical Association,external, looked only at people in the US who were 18 or older and taking at least one type of prescription medication between 2005 to 2014. It found that 37% of these prescription drugs, which also included some painkillers and antacids, had depression listed as one of the potential adverse effects. Rates of depression were higher among the study participants taking these drugs: 7% among those who took one of the drugs 9% for people on two 15% for people taking three or more Around 5% of US adults are estimated to suffer from depression. Lead author Dima Qato, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, said: ""Many may be surprised to learn that their medications, despite having nothing to do with mood or anxiety or any other condition normally associated with depression, can increase their risk of experiencing depressive symptoms and may lead to a depression diagnosis."" However, it's not clear if the drugs are to blame for low mood. Feeling ill for any reason can make you feel low. And it is possible some of the participants may have already had a history of depression. UK experts cautioned that the paper shows an association between taking these drugs and an increased risk of depression but not cause and effect. Prof David Baldwin, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""It is not surprising that using medicines to treat physical illnesses such as heart and lung disease should be associated with depressive symptoms, as these physical illnesses are themselves linked to an increased risk of depression."" The Royal College of GPs also pointed out that not all of the findings will necessarily apply to the UK, as the health system is different in the US. Nevertheless, its chair, Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, added that it shows ""how vital it is that patients disclose any medication they may be taking that the GP might not be aware of, or to the pharmacist if buying medication over the counter"". Experts said the paper showed a link between these drugs and and depression but not cause and effect It depends on the medication. For some drugs, depression can be a common side-effect, such as certain birth control pills. But for others it's much rarer. Very common side-effects will affect more than one in 10 people, whereas those that are very rare will apply to fewer than one in 10,000. This information is printed inside packets of medication in the Patient Information Leaflet and is alsosearchable online,external. Prof David Taylor, from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, also said it was important to consider whether there was a ""plausible explanation"" for why a drug might cause depression. For example, with oral contraceptives there is a clear association between hormone levels and mood. But in others, like heart medication, it is trickier to unpick whether it's the drugs or the condition that might be causing the depression, he says. ""We're not very good at working out what the drugs cause and what just happens in the course of somebody being treated which isn't linked to the drugs, "" Prof Taylor said. 'Drug errors cause appalling harm' Dementia risk linked to some medicines If you're taking any of these medications currently and have no signs of depression then you shouldn't worry, Prof Taylor advises. For those on these drugs who are experiencing depression, he recommends speaking to your GP or specialist doctor to discuss if there might be drugs that don't have the potential side-effects. If you're thinking about taking some of these drugs, he said it was worth being ""somewhat cautious"". ""That applies particularly if you're already taking another drug which is linked to depression."" Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"Petrol prices cannot be justified, says RAC","The RAC says the current petrol price is too high and cannot be justified. The motoring organisation is urging retailers to pass on recent falls in the wholesale cost of petrol. It says there is ""no good reason"" for keeping prices as high as they are and says petrol retailers should cut forecourt prices by 2p a litre. But a fuel retailers association said wholesale price and dollar volatility had added to pressures on independent petrol stations. Asda was the first major retailer to cut fuel prices following the RAC's claim. The supermarket giant said it had reduced the price of unleaded by up to 3p per litre and diesel by up to 2p. The new national price cap means drivers will pay no more than Â£1.25 per litre for unleaded and Â£1.28 for diesel at its 318 filling stations. The RAC says fuel prices have risen almost daily since the end of April, despite wholesale costs coming down by around 2.5p per litre since May 24. Reality check: Why do fuel prices vary so much? Petrol prices in record monthly rise, says RAC Fuel hikes threaten consumer spending It says diesel prices have been rising for even longer, with supermarkets raising the price every single day since the 27 March. Average UK forecourt prices currently stand at Â£1.29 per litre for unleaded and Â£1.33 for diesel. Motoring fuel prices are affected by the price of crude oil. As crude oil is priced in dollars, the exchange rate also plays a part. In May, there were record rises in the price of petrol, largely as a result of the oil price peaking at $80 and a weakening of sterling against the dollar. But since the end of last month the oil price has been falling, and so have wholesale fuel prices. RAC spokesperson Rod Dennis said: ""Our data shows that it's high time retailers cut the price of petrol and diesel at the pumps - we see no good reason for them to wait before passing on savings they are benefiting from which have been brought about by falling wholesale prices. ""Motorists really felt the impact of rising in prices in May, when the cost of filling up a petrol family car jumped by around Â£3.30 in a single month. We are now well into June, and drivers are still waiting for some relief to rising prices."" However, Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""We are in the middle of one of the most volatile periods of wholesale price movements we have seen for some time."" He said the retailers will reduce prices if they think they can do, and are ""not going to price at an insult level"". However, Mr Madderson said that fluctuations in the dollar against sterling, plus requirements on retailers to add more biofuels to diesel and petrol, had helped push up prices. He added that he could only see petrol prices going up as volumes of sales fall due to the take-up of hybrid and electric cars as retailers try to maintain margins.

Sir Martin Sorrell 'to get ÃÂ£19m in bonuses',"Shareholders of advertising giant WPP are expected to approve the payment of up to Â£19m in bonuses over the next four years to its former chief executive. Sir Martin Sorrell resigned four weeks ago amid allegations of serious personal misconduct which he denied. The BBC understands that around 25% of votes cast at the AGM will oppose ongoing payments to Sir Martin. He turned a former wire shopping basket company into a $20bn ad giant. Sir Martin Sorrell may no longer be the chief executive of advertising giant WPP, but he will be the reluctant star of the company's AGM today - in absentia. The rise and fall of the king of advertising WPP should come clean over Sorrell exit After more than 30 years in charge he resigned on 14 April this year after an investigation into a whistleblower's allegations of personal misconduct. Sir Martin has strenuously denied allegations that company money was used to pay a prostitute. Sources close to WPP claim that at some point during the investigation, lawyers appointed by the company shared information with Sir Martin's advisers, after which Sir Martin decided to step down. But this version and sequence of events has been rejected by sources close to Sir Martin as ""completely untrue"". So why did Sir Martin resign? What did the investigation turn up? What could have ended a 33-year career in which he had turned a Â£250,000 wire basket-making shell company into a global advertising colossus? Why did Sir Martin conclude that his position was untenable? The obvious answer would be a boardroom assassination. The company has lost nearly a third of its value since the beginning of 2017 as advertisers cut back on traditional media advertising while directing more money directly to Google and Facebook. His perceived tendency to treat the company as his own personal fiefdom was tolerated when the going was good, but it began to grate when times became leaner and the company less valuable. Had the board, under Chairman Roberto Quarta, decided it was time for him to go? WPP sources insist there was no boardroom rift and no knives out for him. Subsequent events seem to suggest otherwise, according to people familiar with Sir Martin's take. What is not disputed is that Sir Martin - who had been interviewed by lawyers in connection with the misconduct allegations which were crucially still not public knowledge - had come up with a succession plan of his own over the Easter weekend. Sir Martin would signal his intention to step down by appointing executives Mark Read and Andrew Scott as joint chief operating officers. This plan was put to Mr Quarta, who promised a quick decision on whether the board would go for it. That very night, the existence of the investigation - known to only a handful of senior people - was leaked to the Wall Street Journal. This was the moment that Sorrell says he realised the board - or someone on it - was determined to topple him. His resignation followed ten days later. Over three decades he proved himself a brilliant empire builder who made himself and his shareholders a fortune. Having turned Â£250,000 into a Â£16bn empire he could perhaps be forgiven for thinking he was not your average hired chief executive. There was nothing normal about his Â£70 million pay in 2016 - or his wife's Â£274,000  travel expenses, or the allegations about the poor treatment of some employees which he always denied.

Sir Martin Sorrell 'to get Â£19m in bonuses',"Shareholders of advertising giant WPP are expected to approve the payment of up to Â£19m in bonuses over the next four years to its former chief executive. Sir Martin Sorrell resigned four weeks ago amid allegations of serious personal misconduct which he denied. The BBC understands that around 25% of votes cast at the AGM will oppose ongoing payments to Sir Martin. He turned a former wire shopping basket company into a $20bn ad giant. Sir Martin Sorrell may no longer be the chief executive of advertising giant WPP, but he will be the reluctant star of the company's AGM today - in absentia. The rise and fall of the king of advertising WPP should come clean over Sorrell exit After more than 30 years in charge he resigned on 14 April this year after an investigation into a whistleblower's allegations of personal misconduct. Sir Martin has strenuously denied allegations that company money was used to pay a prostitute. Sources close to WPP claim that at some point during the investigation, lawyers appointed by the company shared information with Sir Martin's advisers, after which Sir Martin decided to step down. But this version and sequence of events has been rejected by sources close to Sir Martin as ""completely untrue"". So why did Sir Martin resign? What did the investigation turn up? What could have ended a 33-year career in which he had turned a Â£250,000 wire basket-making shell company into a global advertising colossus? Why did Sir Martin conclude that his position was untenable? The obvious answer would be a boardroom assassination. The company has lost nearly a third of its value since the beginning of 2017 as advertisers cut back on traditional media advertising while directing more money directly to Google and Facebook. His perceived tendency to treat the company as his own personal fiefdom was tolerated when the going was good, but it began to grate when times became leaner and the company less valuable. Had the board, under Chairman Roberto Quarta, decided it was time for him to go? WPP sources insist there was no boardroom rift and no knives out for him. Subsequent events seem to suggest otherwise, according to people familiar with Sir Martin's take. What is not disputed is that Sir Martin - who had been interviewed by lawyers in connection with the misconduct allegations which were crucially still not public knowledge - had come up with a succession plan of his own over the Easter weekend. Sir Martin would signal his intention to step down by appointing executives Mark Read and Andrew Scott as joint chief operating officers. This plan was put to Mr Quarta, who promised a quick decision on whether the board would go for it. That very night, the existence of the investigation - known to only a handful of senior people - was leaked to the Wall Street Journal. This was the moment that Sorrell says he realised the board - or someone on it - was determined to topple him. His resignation followed ten days later. Over three decades he proved himself a brilliant empire builder who made himself and his shareholders a fortune. Having turned Â£250,000 into a Â£16bn empire he could perhaps be forgiven for thinking he was not your average hired chief executive. There was nothing normal about his Â£70 million pay in 2016 - or his wife's Â£274,000  travel expenses, or the allegations about the poor treatment of some employees which he always denied. He attended an interview with lawyers concerning the claims of misconduct without a lawyer - which some took as a sign he may not have been taking the matter seriously enough. Several shareholders have told the BBC that they welcomed attempts by Mr Quarta to make things a bit ""more normal"". However, by many accounts, Sorrell didn't like it.

US reassurance after Korea war games halt,"This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: Win-win, or a Kim win? The Pentagon has reassured allies of its ""ironclad"" security commitments, after President Donald Trump cancelled its Korean military exercises. Mr Trump made the announcement after Tuesday's historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore. The move is seen as a big concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise. Meanwhile, North Korean state media said Mr Kim had accepted an offer from President Trump to visit the US. KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had invited Mr Trump to visit Pyongyang ""at a convenient time"" and Mr Trump had also invited Mr Kim to the United States. ""The two top leaders gladly accepted each other's invitation,"" KCNA added. In his first reported comments since the talks, Mr Kim said it was ""urgent"" to halt ""irritating and hostile military actions against each other"". He said the two countries ""should commit themselves to refraining from antagonising"" each other ""and take legal and institutional steps to guarantee it"", KCNA reported. How the summit unfolded Kim is a 'funny guy' - analysing Trump's quotes How many dead US soldiers are in North Korea? The US and South Korea hold regular joint live-fire exercises The Kim-Trump summit - the first such meeting between the two countries - centred on nuclear disarmament and reducing regional tensions. It concluded with a one-page agreement. In the press conference afterwards, however, Mr Trump added another announcement: the cancellation of the military exercises. The drills, often called ""war games"", are held in South Korea with local forces and US soldiers stationed there. Mr Trump also said he wanted to bring US troops home - although he did not specify a timeframe. He said the drills were ""provocative"" - even though the US has previously defended them - and there were suggestions that US allies had not been forewarned of this move. South Korea's Presidential Blue House said it needed ""to find out the precise meaning or intentions"" of Mr Trump's statement. South Korean President Moon Jae-in spoke by phone with Mr Trump for 20 minutes late on Tuesday, but an official readout of the call made no mention of military exercises, according to Reuters. The previous day US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters he did not believe that troop levels were on the agenda. When asked if he would know if such discussions were planned, he said, ""Yeah, I sure would."" There are thousands of US soldiers in South Korea However, the Pentagon has since denied that Mr Mattis was caught off guard. He was consulted ahead of time, said Pentagon spokesperson Dana White. In a statement sent to the BBC, she said: ""Our alliances remain ironclad, and ensure peace and stability in the region."" In a flurry of tweets later on Tuesday, Mr Trump said there was ""no limit"" to what North Korea could achieve if it gave up its nuclear weapons. He thanked Mr Kim for ""taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people"" and said the world had taken ""a big step back from potential nuclear catastrophe"".

The US maintains around 30,000 troops in South Korea and once a year it brings in others - typically from its Pacific base in Guam - to join large-scale drills. Full text of the signed statement Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments North Korea sees the annual exercises as a rehearsal for invasion, but the government in Seoul maintains they are defensive in nature. Mr Trump said scrapping them will save a ""tremendous amount of money"", but he added that they could be reinstated if co-operation from the North declines. The summit began with a handshake, unimaginable just months ago. Mr Trump and Mr Kim - who traded vicious insults last year - gripped each other's hands in front of US and North Korean flags. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures After a one-on-one meeting, followed by wider talks with advisers and a working lunch, they presented their agreement. It said the two countries would co-operate towards ""new relations"", while the US would provide ""security guarantees"" to North Korea. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Kim also ""reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". This video can not be played Trump: ""The past does not have to define our future"" Observers say the document lacks substance, in particular on how denuclearisation would be achieved. However, speaking to reporters after, Mr Trump said: Mr Kim had agreed to denuclearisation being ""verified"", a key US demand ahead of the meeting Mr Trump said Mr Kim had also agreed to destroy a ""major missile engine testing site"" But he said sanctions would remain in place for now and argued ""we haven't given up anything"". Several reporters asked whether Mr Trump had raised the issue of human rights with Mr Kim, who runs a totalitarian regime with extreme censorship and forced-labour camps. Missed chance to discuss human rights, says defector How many dead US soldiers in N Korea? Who was Trump's nuclear uncle? The US president said he had, and repeated his description of Mr Kim as ""talented"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Two years ago Barack Obama travelled to Cuba - and was roundly denounced by conservatives for breaking bread with totalitarian leaders and praised by liberals for his statesmanship. Now, with Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong-un, the tables have been turned. Mostly. On conservative Fox News and among Mr Trump's core supporters, the president was lauded for a historic diplomatic breakthrough. Among Democrats, there was more than a fair amount of concern that the president was engaging in a glorified publicity stunt with little chance of success. South Korean newspapers reporting the Trump-Kim summit Republicans in Congress have been more measured. There was plenty of talk of ""historic first steps"", in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words, but concern over how the yet-to-be negotiated verification details will turn out. A few other conservatives expressed dismay at seeing the US and North Korean flags side-by-side, and viewed Mr Trump's solicitous manner and warm words for Mr Kim as too much, given his nation's history of human rights violations. ""Needless to say, we would've wrecked Obama for doing this,"" tweeted conservative blogger Allahpundit. Tuesday was the latest reminder that in just 16 months, US - and international - politics have been turned upside down. Trump Kim summit: Win-win or a Kim win?

Human rights: 'A missed opportunity',"Grace Jo (right), her mother (left) and older sister living underground in China in 2004 In the late 1990s, Grace Jo was still a child in rural North Korea when her dark black hair turned yellow. ""I was so malnourished,"" she said, ""we would spend days without having anything to eat"". One of her two brothers, the youngest, had already died of starvation; the other, weak, could barely walk. Her eldest sister had left the family in search of food and had never come back. Her father had also died, Ms Jo said, after being arrested and then tortured as he returned from China where he had gone to buy rice. The only hope for those still alive to survive, her mother thought, was to escape. From their north-eastern province of North Hamgyong, Ms Jo, then aged seven, her mother and another sister, Jinhye, 10, walked for three days on unpaved roads and through mountains, until they reached the Tumen River and crossed into China. Once there, they lived underground, fearful of being caught - China, North Korea's main ally, has a strict policy of sending defectors back. During that time, they learned that Ms Jo's five-year-old brother, who had been unable to travel and so stayed behind, had also died. ""We tried many ways to stay in China,"" she said. But in 2001, three years after arriving, they were found out, jailed and returned. Who's pulling the strings of the N Korea breakthrough? Kim: The new kid on the diplomatic block 'Stop romanticising a dictator' Back in North Korea, Ms Jo's mother was sent to a forced labour camp while the girls were put in an orphanage, where they also had to work. Eight months later, as the two children were being transferred to a different shelter, they managed to escape. Their mother had already been released and, shortly after, the three were back together. In 2002, they managed to flee North Korea for a second time. Ms Jo's mother bribed some border guards but, two years later, they were caught again and sent back. ""We thought we would die in prison. We didn't have any hope."" But, while in China, they had started working with an American-Korean pastor to protect North Korean defectors. Now, it was them who needed help. So in 2006, he paid some $10,000 (Â£7,500) in bribes to  the North's secret police to free the family. ""Money talks in North Korea,"" Ms Jo said, and four months later they were released. For a third time, they escaped to China and, in 2008, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) settled them as refugees in the United States. Ten years later, Ms Jo, who is now a college student in Maryland, would watch something she thought impossible unfold: the leaders of the US and North Korea shaking hands. This video can not be played Trump Kim: The moment they shook hands Just months before, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un had been exchanging insults and threats of war. Now,both were holding unprecedented talks in Singapore. Watching as the two leaders sat alongside each other, Grace Jo felt doubtful that ordinary North Koreans, struggling under tight sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear and weapons tests, would see any benefits. ""It's a strategy"" said Ms Jo, who is now one of the leaders of North Korean Refugees in the United States (NKinUSA), an organisation founded by her sister to help other defectors. ""If he [Mr Kim] wants to get money, he needs to get rid of the sanctions. Then money will come into North Korea and he will keep his regime alive."" What Trump and Kim won't talk about Many analysts already see the summit as a victory for Mr Kim, who runs a totalitarian regime with extreme censorship and forced labour camps. North Koreans can be jailed for almost anything, activists say, and there are between 80,000 and 120,000 people in prisons across the country, according to a report by the US State Department. The economy is also strictly controlled and the government funnels money into its missile and nuclear programme - the focus of the talks - despite widespread shortages of basic necessities. ""I feel very sorry that human rights are not being discussed,"" said Ms Jo. ""We can't separate the nuclear issue from human rights issues. They developed nuclear arms while people were dying of starvation, others in prisons."" Grace Jo (right) with her mother in the US At the time when Ms Jo made her first escape, North Korea was facing a severe famine, which killed hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of people. When she was five, she said, she was so hungry that she ate six newborn mice that her mother boiled after finding them under some stones next to the family's house. The situation in the isolated country has improved since then, but the North continues to face significant shortages of food, and an estimated 41% of the total population of 25 million are undernourished, according to the UN. Meanwhile the country's elite enjoy relatively comfortable lives in the capital, Pyongyang. ""I hope this [meeting] will bring change,"" said Ms Jo, ""open North Korea to the world and allow people to have a free life.""

Searching for the lost on the wall," The Grenfell Wall sprang up overnight. Within hours, hundreds of people had left messages of sympathy and support. Relatives of those missing brought favourite items, teddies and photos. Missing posters were plastered everywhere, bearing the faces of those still unaccounted for and telephone numbers for anyone who might have information. The wall is still there today in the shadow of the tower. It provides a glimpse into the terrors that unfolded on 14 June 2017. The idea for the wall came from Jamie Sewell, who works for the Eden network, a charity that places youth workers on council estates to build links between communities and the church. Jamie Sewell Jamie had lived alongside Grenfell Tower for five years and, in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, he drew from his experiences as a youth worker. He and his wife had opened their home to teenagers on the fringes of gang life. Three years before the fire, one of those boys had died. He was just 15 and Jamie had helped with the grieving process by providing a quiet space in the church where friends could meet and share memories. With that in mind, the day after the fire, he took his van to a garden centre to buy large white boards, a little wicker heart and fairy lights. His team of youth workers spent that day comforting people who were looking for loved ones, and talking to youngsters who were upset at what had happened. Volunteers construct the wall It was 20:00 BST when his exhausted team decided to finally close the doors of the Latymer Community Church. Then, they set about creating the Grenfell Wall. “All of our team, by that point, were just absolutely wrecked,” he says. “We started putting it up and we weren’t sure how it was going to be received. I think we were a bit nervous. “We hadn’t even finished writing ‘Prayer Wall’, and we just quickly became swamped by people grabbing pens off us.” Then, Jamie recalls, those around him “just started writing and pouring their hearts out on to these boards”. People write on the wall A day later, Jamie’s boards were almost full and people started bringing their own down, attaching them along walkways surrounding the tower. As well as writing messages, they laid flowers and wreaths, with firefighters hanging their shirts on the nearby railings, along with heartfelt messages describing their sorrow. Firefighter's T-shirt Families of some of those missing made small shrines and placed toys and photos next to candles as they huddled together waiting for news. Children light candles “People just started grieving together,” says Jamie. “For me it became a real place to go, among the madness and the chaos, to be quiet and just to walk around and read, and I suppose it made me personally feel a lot less lonely.” Some of the first to write on the wall were volunteers who came from all over the country to bring food, water and clothing. Listen toThe Grenfell Wall, from BBC Radio 4, on the BBC iPlayer. Naeem Brisco runs a design company in Leicester and had woken to news of the fire. Naeem Brisco He has overcome more than his own fair share of difficulties - from getting into trouble as a kid, then going against family expectations by marrying for love rather than letting his family find him a wife. When that marriage broke down, he became homeless and was helped back on his feet by a stranger - which, he thinks, explains why he felt so moved to act in the aftermath of the Grenfell fire. Naeem Brisco He temporarily closed his business, brought his team together and loaded a van with supplies. When he got to London, close to Grenfell Tower, Naeem unloaded his van by organising volunteers into a human chain that passed donations down to the supply centre. Volunteers move the supplies: Nothing had prepared him for the smell that hung in the area and the sense of distress as he helped a teenager look for his parents. The wall became Naeem’s way of making sense of the situation. “Sometimes you’ve got to express yourself and by putting something in writing - I wouldn’t say it’s a closure, but it’s an element of you giving your condolence,” he says.  “You felt good when you wrote something. You’ve given a message, you know what I mean?” Naeem's message: Naeem positioned himself close to the tower as he gave out supplies - food, water and clothing - to those searching for information. School children with posters of Jessica Urbano Some, like the schoolmates of 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez, wore T-shirts bearing her photo and face masks to protect themselves from smoke from the still-smouldering tower. Maryam Adam, for her part, was bewildered and full of guilt that she could have done more to warn her friends in the tower. Maryam Adam Maryam lived next to the flat where the fire started and her husband, Abdulwahab, had woken her after their neighbour alerted him to blaze. She thought the flames would be easily extinguished and only agreed to leave because she was pregnant and worried about her baby. Her biggest regret is that she didn’t take her phone - as she watched the flames reach higher, she was unable to alert friends still trapped inside. There had been great excitement among people she knew in Grenfell when she first told them of her pregnancy. In the days following the fire, she held out hope that friends might be found alive: Rania and her two daughters, Fethia and Hania; Nura and her children, Yahya, Firdaws and Yaqub; and Amal with her daughter, Amaya, who had an infectious laugh. Poster: Amal and Amaya Maryam moved into her flat in 2008, after 10 years of living in a hostel. She is from Somalia and grew up in Sudan, before coming to the UK in her 20s and loving everything about her new life. She and her husband shared their one-bedroom flat with her brother and his wife and they were happy - all the more so once she found out she was pregnant. Her life was turned upside down by the fire and, a year on, she still struggles to make sense of it. “I know many, many, many of my friends died. They died in Grenfell,” she says. “When you see somebody asking for help and you can’t do anything for them, it’s too difficult.” The one piece of good news for Maryam was the birth, in November, of her son, Mohammed. Relatives in Sudan sent her traditional costume, which she proudly shows us as we talk. Maryam and family The family are in temporary accommodation - it’s overcrowded, with boxes stacked in a corner and a makeshift bed for her brother in the small living room. There is no room for a cot for Mohammed, who shares a bed with his parents. “You see, that is how we live. Just always we are dreaming, waiting just to get good news, but I don’t know if we are going to hear it or not.” Maryam in temporary accommodation She thinks of all the nights she spent not sleeping, worrying about her child. “We are not living in our home, or anything like it. I don’t know where I’m going to move, where I’m going to live. “And I’m fed up because I don’t know for how long I’m going to be waiting. We lost everything in Grenfell, we lost everything.” Maryam gradually accepted that she would not see her friends again. Amaya Tuccu-Ahmedin She often thinks of little Amaya and the picture on the Grenfell Wall - a cheeky grin as the three-year-old plays outdoors. It was taken by Luke Rosher, a teacher at St Peter’s Nursery on Portobello Road: “I took that photo actually, in the park, the playground - pure and innocent and lovely.” Luke at the nursery The head teacher at the nursery, Tracey Lloyd, had got to know Amaya’s mother, Amal, well. Tracey laughs as she recalls the wonderful meals Amal would prepare on sharing days. Amaya’s dad Mohamednur was committed to his daughter’s education, having earned both a degree and an MSc since arriving in Britain. He was originally from Eritrea and had been active with anti-government forces there. The family lived on the 19th floor of the tower and Amaya died in the arms of her mother. The pair held each other tight in their last moments of consciousness. The Grenfell Wall became an important part of the grieving process for nursery staff, who went together to remember the family. It also provided a way of helping young classmates who struggled to make sense of the loss. Posters on the railings near Grenfell One six-year-old neighbour of Amaya’s used red pencil to draw fierce flames over the windows of a tall tower. Other youngsters drew children screaming at windows. Luke worked with his class to put together handprints on a remembrance board that they took to the site. The poster the nursery children made for Amaya A year on, he is repeating the task. “I made a poster with the children, just little tiny handprints to show this is not just affecting grown-ups,” he says. “It is little children who are seeing this and living this and wanting to do this. There were, I think, 20 there and then we put a little message saying: ‘We miss you, Amaya.’” Tracey says: “I feel very close to Amal and Amaya and Mo and the auntie when I’m there and I think it’s important that we do remember those families, those innocent lives that were cut short way, way, way before their time.” Both Tracey and Luke remember the rush of emotions they both experienced when they first saw the Grenfell Wall. “Just seeing all the tributes was just amazing,” says Luke. “It was so many conflicting emotions.  There was obviously the sadness and, just disbelief - but then there was also this rush of, like, ‘Oh my gosh.’” Tracey recalls “flowers everywhere, candles, and things that people had written - eulogies, their thoughts - friends, families, the fire brigade with their T-shirts, and it just seemed to go on and on and on”. Firefighter's T-shirt Many of those who survived the fire were given temporary hotel rooms in the surrounding area - coming back to the estate to collect clothes and register at the relief centre. They had lost everything, including passports, bank cards, phones and computers as they fled, but this paled into insignificance compared with the trauma of not knowing who had survived. Miguel Alves and his wife Fatima were desperate for news of their friends Marcio Gomes, his wife Andreia and their two children, 12-year-old Luana and 10-year-old Megan. Miguel and Marcio play football together They had heard nothing since around 03:00, when the family began their escape from the 21st floor. Fatima prayed that they would be found alive. Miguel made contact with the Portuguese authorities, who initially told him they hadn’t made it out. The Gomes family had lived in the tower for 10 years With so many gathered at the Grenfell Wall, rumours were rife. There was conjecture about the death toll and stories of a baby thrown from a window. Missing posters came and went, with some marked “found”, and others staying intact. While Miguel and Fatima waited to hear about the Gomes family, their 20-year-old son Tiago looked at the missing posters put up by volunteers from Solidarity Sports, which provides activities and opportunities for disadvantaged children. Miguel and Fatima, with their son Tiago and daughter Ines Tiago, now 21, is studying physics at King’s College London and, passing the wall, he saw faces he remembered. He recalled teaching 13-year-old Yahya Hashim how to knot his tie on his first day of secondary school. Missing poster: Firdaws and Yahya There was also a poster of Steve Power, 63. Steve would give him advice while out walking his two bull terriers, telling Tiago to make the most of his education and that hard work would pay off in the end. Candles and missing posters Some nights, as he drifts in and out of sleep, Tiago realises: “Oh wait, I’m not in my bed.” He hopes that in the morning, it will all turn out to have been a dream, and he’ll return to normal life. And then he wakes up and finds he is still in the hotel: “Oh, this did actually happen. As I’m trying to sleep, I almost pinch myself saying ‘Wake up now,’ because I can’t deal with it any more.” Tiago and his sister, 16-year-old Ines Alves, had spent most of their childhood living in the tower and loved living there. Ines Alves A year on, Ines is still receiving counselling, but says it is hard to cope with images from the night - people calling for help and phone lights in the windows - coupled with the loss of everything they owned and friends they cared for. “Everyone knew each other,” she says. “You’d see each other in the flats and say ‘Hi’ or ‘Bye,’ or smile if you saw them in the street. It’s starting to hit me slowly, everything that’s happened. I still feel like I’m in a nightmare and tomorrow I’m going to wake up and go back home.” The pictures of Yahya, 13, his 12-year-old sister, Firdaws and little brother, Yaqub, were taken by Sean Mendez, who runs Solidarity Sports. The siblings had lived on the 22nd floor and, as soon as he heard about the fire, Sean went to hospitals searching for news. Since then he was worked with their aunt, Aseema Kedir, to set up the Hashim Family Legacy that, last October, enabled 16 children to fulfil the dream that Firdaws once had - to visit Walt Disney World in Florida. Sean talks about helping children affected by the fire: Similar legacies are being created by others, like Mike Volpe, the Director at Opera Holland Park. He lost a friend and employee, Deborah Lamprell, in the fire and he has organised a memorial concert to raise funds to help local children. “We’ve called it Hope for Grenfell because yes, it’s a part-memorial, it remembers all those people, it remembers Debbie for us in particular,” he says. “But it also says we need to have some hope. Everyone’s got to go on despite the need for justice and to find out what happened but we do actually have to go on. There has to be some hope, somewhere.” Miguel Alves kept hope alive while he waited for news of his missing friend, Marcio Gomes. But in the face of such a tragedy he knows it was only luck that spared him and his family. Fatima Alves Miguel and Fatima had been returning to their 13th-floor flat in the early hours when the lift stopped at the fourth floor. They saw the smoke and Miguel went up to wake his children and neighbours while Fatima waited outside. The couple are originally from Portugal. He is a chauffeur and they had saved for the £82,000 they needed to buy their flat. Living there he had become good friends with Marcio and his family. As soon as he escaped, Miguel phoned Marcio and urged him to get out. The fire service, however, had told the family to stay put. Twice they had tried to escape, but the smoke had beaten them back. With Miguel’s phone calls growing more urgent, Marcio contemplated the enormity of the decision he had to make. “Miguel said, ‘Look, you need to go out’ and obviously he was getting very agitated about it, and I said: ‘I’ve already tried twice,’ he recalls. “Then I said: ‘It’s just pitch black,’ and it’s thick black smoke. You couldn’t even see your hand in front.” Marcio could hear Miguel growing increasingly agitated and distressed. “You can see actually this is a lot worse than what you’re thinking. And also I had my neighbour and her daughter so, it’s a lot of responsibility if things go wrong. I’m thankful for Miguel because he made me more aware that this is really bad.” As the flames grew closer, he realised he didn’t have a choice: “There was no way we were going to survive by staying.” Marcio gathered wet towels and tried to stay at the rear of the building as they descended the stairwell. “You couldn’t see anything,” he says. “It was pitch black, absolutely pitch black.” He didn’t notice the dead bodies at first. “We only realised once we stepped on a body or tripped over - but there was nothing we could do for them and my focus was trying to get everybody downstairs. Luana and our neighbour’s daughter, they both then passed out at the same time. Didn’t see where they fell, you couldn’t see anything at all.” It was firefighters who found the two girls and carried them to safety. They spent nearly a month in induced comas, as did 10-year-old Megan and Marcio’s wife, Andreia. She was seven months pregnant and, before the fire, the couple had decorated a nursery for the son they were planning to call Logan. On its wall they had written: “Twinkle, twinkle, little star, do you know how loved you are?” Logan was stillborn when he was delivered and Marcio cradled him in his arms, willing him to breathe. Marcio and Andreia tell how they escaped the blaze: “I think we’re still processing it in all fairness, and I think we will always process it for the rest of our lives,” he says. “You’re never going to be 100% as you were before. You try to move on, you know - that’s how humans cope with things. There’s certain things I can’t talk about because I get really emotional - to do with the night, to do with my son. “You try and make new memories and move on. I think you get better at controlling the emotions as time goes on but it’s still difficult and it will always be difficult.” Marcio and Miguel have supported each other since the fire and feel that their weekly games of football provide an outlet for the grief. Marcio and Miguel Following the tragedy, other players donated kit and even football boots. Marcio is still experiencing some trouble with his breathing, caused by smoke inhalation, but seldom misses a game. “You know it just helps, I think, for me,” he says. “Just to talk to each other and it just helps process what happened.” Marcio and Miguel talk about their football games: Fatima, meanwhile, takes comfort from the Cenacle of Missionary Prayer Group. The shrine she had in her 13th-floor flat was destroyed in the fire, but she has rebuilt it in her temporary accommodation. She says it is nice to finally have a kitchen to prepare family meals - she likes to cook and to entertain, something she did regularly in their Grenfell flat. Fatima's shrine When the family is on their own, the memories return, she says. Miguel agrees. They have to enjoy life, he says. “We can be ashes inside of the tower, you know? Life is too short.” The couple have had counselling since the fire, as have their children. Ines is now in sixth form, having passed the GCSE chemistry exam she sat the day after the fire. The family recently were allowed to see inside the shell of their old flat but were not really prepared for how upsetting it would be. Fatima recalls seeing the metal frame from her son’s bed and his desk bent out of shape. “It was very sad,” she says. “I started crying when I saw that because in my mind, from the beginning, I said: ‘No, something will be saved.’“It was hard to see.” Since then, they have been sent three small boxes and two larger ones containing items salvaged from the ashes - the mugs that were inside the metal dishwasher, some coins from Tiago’s piggybank, a watch and a small cross, which is singed black around the edges. Miguel and Fatima's possessions Everything is in small see-through pouches, each of which smells of the fire when they are opened. It is emotionally draining and, to date, Fatima has emptied just two of the five boxes, and she has no idea whether or not to keep things. They are a reminder of her past life, but it is painful to see the state of them now. The family will soon move into a more permanent home, a nice house close to their old flat - a place they can finally call home. One of the first people to place a missing poster on the memorial wall was Thomas Murphy, originally from Ireland, who is a member of several community groups in the area and has lunch twice a week at the Salvation Army in Portobello Road. Thomas Murphy Maj Paul Scott, who oversees things there, says it was all hands on deck when the fire broke out, with Thomas and other volunteers helping sort out the donations and get people the help they needed. “Everybody just pulled together. It didn’t matter what religion we were or they were. We were amazed because we had about 80 people at one point who were looking for missing friends and relations.” This was particularly true for Thomas and the lunch club participants who knew some of those affected. For 90-year-old Olive it was painful to witness her granddaughters upset at losing a classmate, five-year-old Isaac Paulos. Marjory, 61, mourned the death of Marjorie Vital, who died with her 50-year-old son, Ernie. As locals they pass the wall, sometimes seeing vigils and memorial services, like the one held for 29-year-old Berkti Haftom and her son, Biruk, who was 12. The fire shattered many close bonds - for Thomas it meant the loss of his friend, Vincent Chiejina, who was born in Nigeria and, like him, was active in the Open Age Charity and St Francis of Assisi Church in Notting Hill. Thomas put up missing posters even though he knew his search was probably in vain: “I wasn’t naive to think that he had escaped out of that because I stood there that night and I watched that inferno.” Missing poster: Vincent Chiejina In the aftermath, Thomas printed out photos and went to the Grenfell Wall, asking anyone he could find for news of his 60-year-old friend, who lived alone on the 17th floor. During the weeks that followed he found out more about Vincent, who he says had always been protective of his privacy, but was incredibly caring and determined to help the most vulnerable in society. Vincent and Thomas “I just appreciated him and I found him to be a nice person,” Thomas says. “And eventually he told me what happened to him, that he was studying at university - mathematics was his forte - and then snap, his mind went. He told me as much as he wanted to and that was it, I left it at that, being discreet about it, you know. Whatever it was, it did a lot of harm to him. And I thought: ‘My God, ending up on that floor on your own.’ And he’s not alone, he’s not alone in that position.” For the community, the fate of the Grenfell Wall is still to be decided. At the moment, sheets of plastic help preserve the messages of love and support. Some local residents are angry that the wall has not been removed and feel that it is stopping people from moving forward. One woman who asked not to be named points to sightseers drifting by and camera crews in the area. “Tacky. It’s beginning to look tacky,” she says. “So how long does that stay there? Where does it all go, that stuff? And when? We all need to move on. There have been vigils after vigils and you come home and it’s like - how many memorial services do we need? And who are these actually for?” For his part, Jamie Sewell, who first put up the boards, sees this as an important opportunity to consider important issues raised by the fire. Jamie Sewell He hopes that some form of permanent legacy is forthcoming. The next challenge for the community, he says, is figuring out how it will remember the tragedy. Some people on the outside think that Grenfell is something that happened in the past and it's not happening any more, says Jamie: “But actually, there is still so much grief, so many questions.” One year on, looking at the wall “makes me realise that we were all in it together and we were all feeling much the same kind of thing - there’s anger, a massive sense of loss, a massive sense of injustice and a massive sense of confusion”, he says. “I think that’s what the Grenfell Wall ended up representing.” See the messages in close-up.

Saudi-backed forces attack Yemen port,"This video can not be played Former child soldiers, a landmine survivor and an internally displaced child tell their stories Pro-government forces in Yemen, backed by Saudi Arabia, have begun attacking a key port held by rebel fighters. The coastal city of Hudaydah is where most of the aid arrives for people in Yemen's rebel-held areas. Agencies have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe. About eight million people are at risk of starvation in the war-torn country. Pro-government strikes began after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels ignored a deadline to withdraw by midnight (21:00 GMT on Tuesday). It is the first time the Saudi-led coalition of mostly Gulf states has tried to capture such a well-defended major city in Yemen. Yemen's conflict in 400 words Who is fighting whom? The UN Security Council is expected to meet to discuss the situation on Thursday, following a request from the UK. The conflict in Yemen has raged since late 2014, when the Houthis and allied forces seized north-western parts of the country, including the capital Sanaa, and eventually forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Sunni Arab states launched a military campaign in March 2015 to restore Mr Hadi's government. The Saudi-led coalition has accused the rebels of using Hudaydah to smuggle in Iranian weapons. Both Iran and the rebels deny this. The coalition says victory could break the stalemate in the war and force the Houthis to the negotiating table. But the port is a lifeline for the majority of Yemen's population and the UN had been trying to get parties to the conflict to reach a deal that would avert an attack. An estimated 600,000 people live in the area. Robert Mardini, regional head for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said the attack was ""likely to exacerbate an already catastrophic humanitarian situation"". A cholera outbreak has killed thousands of people in Yemen, including many in Hudaydah On Friday, UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Yemen Lise Grande warned: ""In a prolonged worst case, we fear that as many as 250,000 people may lose everything - even their lives."" Read more onwhy the battle for Hudaydah matters. On Tuesday, the exiled government said its forces and allied Saudi-led troops launched their assault after ""exhausting all peaceful and political means"". Coalition warplanes and warships later began bombarding Houthi positions. An alliance of Yemeni forces supporting the internationally recognised government is leading the ground assault. The Saudi-owned Al Arabiya network reported ""intense and concentrated"" strikes near the port. ""The liberation of Hudaydah port is a turning point in our struggle to recapture Yemen from the militias that hijacked it to serve foreign agendas,"" the exiled government said. The rebels have said they will ""confront the coalition of aggression on all fronts"". By BBC correspondent Nawal Al-Maghafi For the last three years the Saudi-led coalition hasn't made any major advances. But in the last few weeks, the rebel side has lost a lot of fighters and commanders. The coalition sees a window of opportunity and is desperate to gain ground. It has argued repeatedly that a Hudaydah offensive can be mounted quickly and effectively, leaving the port functioning at a higher capacity. But if the battle is prolonged, it will leave millions of Yemenis without food, fuel and other vital supplies. In reality, families in Hudaydah are already starving and desperately relying on humanitarian aid. Reporting from the city last year, I saw children who were severely undeveloped, their ribs protruding. This video can not be played How children are starving in Yemen's war They were living off a peanut-based paste provided by aid agencies. The hospitals were desperately trying to do what they could but were overwhelmed by cases of malnutrition and cholera. Now this battle threatens to push these people off the brink. Meanwhile, the possibility of the warring sides returning to the negotiating table seems even more remote. About 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed in the fighting since March 2015, according to the UN. The vast majority of the casualties have been the result of coalition air strikes. The UN's figures do not include those who have died of disease and malnutrition. Terror of life under siege in Yemen The girl with the strawberry ring The conflict and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid. It has created the world's largest food emergency and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,290 people. In a tweet, the UN's envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, called on both sides to end the fighting and find a negotiated settlement. Allow Twitter content?

Ireland to hold blasphemy referendum,"Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said the referendum would mark an ""important step"" in Ireland's ""international reputation"" The Republic of Ireland will hold a referendum on whether to change its laws against blasphemy. It is expected that the vote will be held on the same day as the Presidential election, which is likely to take place in October. The move is part of a commitment made in the programme for government. The previous Fine Gael-Labour coalition, which governed from 2011 to 2016, had promised a vote on the law. Stephen Fry blasphemy probe dropped by Irish police However, it never followed through on a referendum, which is required to change any part of the Republic's constitution.

In 2009, a new law made blasphemy punishable by a fine of up to 25,000 euros (Â£21,000). British actor, comedian and writer Stephen Fry was investigated under blasphemy laws in 2015 after Irish police received a complaint over an interview with Irish national broadcaster RTÃ in which he called God stupid, selfish and ""quite clearly a maniac"".

""By removing this provision from our Constitution, we can send a strong message to the world that laws against blasphemy do not reflect Irish values and that we do not believe such laws should exist.""

"Ten-year-old handbag sells for Â£162,000","The bag was sold by auctioneers Christie's on Tuesday A second-hand Hermes Birkin bag has sold for Â£162,500 ($217,144) in London, a new European record for the most expensive handbag sold at auction. The 2008 Himalaya Birkin, with an 18-carat white gold diamond encrusted lock, exceeded its list price of Â£100,000 - Â£150,000 on Tuesday. The record for a bag sold at auction - also a Hermes Birkin - is Â£253,700 ($380,000),set in Hong Kong in 2017,external. It is the ""undisputed most valuable bag in the world,"" Christie's said. It was first time the bag had been offered in a European auction, said Matthew Rubinger, international director at the auctioneers. The handbag that costs as much as a house The secret supplier to the world's top designers Jane Birkin ditches 'too heavy' namesake bag The 10-year-old niloticus crocodile bag was said to be in ""grade 2 condition"" - with no obvious flaws. It measures just 30cm wide - smaller than the original Birkin handbag - and is made from nilo crocodile hide and features diamonds. The matte white Himalaya niloticus crocodile bag sold at Christie's Its name refers to the colour gradient, said to resemble the snow-capped hills of the Himalayas. A 2006 blue version of the handbag sold for Â£100,000 at the same auction on Tuesday. Kim Kardashian, Victoria Beckham and Celine Dion are among those to be spotted with the rare Himalaya on their arm, while many more celebrities count other Birkins as part of their collections. The Birkin counts Mariah Carey, Tamara Ecclestone and Khloe Kardashian among its fans New Birkin bags can start at around Â£7,000 each, but they are not easy to buy, with famously long waiting lists. The French luxury fashion house Hermes designed what became known as the Birkin in 1981. Named after the singer and actress Jane Birkin, it has become one of the most sought-after accessories in the world, but it began as a quest for the perfect holdall. Ms Birkin had met the chief executive of Hermes on a flight from Paris to London, where he offered to design her a holdall and asked if the company could name it after her. She said she was ""flattered to death and said yes, yes, yes"". Suddenly everyone was ""wandering around with your handbag"", she said.

"MP's murder was to be 'white jihad'A 23-year-old man bought a machete as part of his plan to kill Labour MP Rosie Cooper, a court hears.UK","Jack Renshaw admitted two charges on the first day of the trial An alleged member of a banned neo Nazi group has admitted planning to murder a Labour MP in an act of what he termed ""white jihad"", a jury has heard. Jack Renshaw, 23, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete to kill West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper. He also admitted making a threat to kill police officer Victoria Henderson. Renshaw, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, is one of six men on trial who deny being in the group National Action. The other accused are: Christopher Lythgoe, 32, and Michal Trubini, 35, both from Warrington; Matthew Hankinson, 24, from Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside; Andrew Clarke, 33, from Prescot, Merseyside, and Garron Helm, 24, from Seaforth, Merseyside. Mr Lythgoe also denies encouragement to murder by allegedly giving Renshaw permission to kill Ms Cooper on behalf of the group. Renshaw had previously denied the two charges, but changed his pleas at the start of his trial. Prosecutors said Renshaw wanted to take hostages to lure Det Con Henderson to the scene so he could kill her too. But the court heard the plan was foiled after a disenchanted former member of National Action reported the threat to Hope Not Hate, an organisation seeking to combat extreme right-wing political racism. Prosecutors told the jury that National Action had supported the murder of MP Jo Cox in June 2016. Duncan Atkinson QC, said the defendants were ""not being prosecuted for their racist or neo-Nazi beliefs, however repulsive they may be, but for their participation in a banned organisation that sought actively through fear, intimidation and the threat of violence rather than through free speech and democracy to shape society"". He said Renshaw was preparing a ""politically and racially motivated murder"", and had sought the ""blessing"" of Mr Lythgoe. Mr Lythgoe, the prosecutor added, was effectively the national leader of National Action and ""nothing significant"" happened without his approval. The six men deny membership of a proscribed organisation He said National Action had engaged in a ""campaign of virulent anti-Semitic and homophobic propaganda"" since 2013. It was formally put on a government list of proscribed organisations in December 2016, but the defendants' active participation in the group did not stop with the ban, Mr Atkinson said. Jurors were told that Mr Lythgoe sent an email to others members just before the ban, saying: ""Long term we'll keep moving forward just as we have been"" - and the next day he wrote: ""We are just shedding one skin for another"". Mr Atkinson told the court that Robbie Mullen had been a member of National Action before the ban but became disillusioned with the group, particularly after the murder of Jo Cox. Jurors heard that, on 1 July last year, at a meeting attended by most of the defendants and Mr Mullen, Renshaw said that he planned to kill Rosie Cooper. The court heard Renshaw said he had already purchased a 19-inch (50 cm) long machete, and it was later found at his home. Rosie Cooper is the Labour MP for West Lancashire Mr Atkinson said Renshaw's ""objective was not simply to make a political point, as he put it to kill for National Action and white jihad, but to revenge himself on those he considered to be persecuting him"", namely Lancashire Police, and Det Con Henderson in particular. Renshaw told the meeting that after killing Ms Cooper, he would take hostages, and demand Det Con Henderson attend the scene, the prosecution claimed. ""His plan then would be to kill that officer who was, he said, his real target,"" Mr Atkinson told jurors."" The court heard Renshaw had been arrested in January 2017 on suspicion of stirring up racial hatred over two anti-Semitic speeches he had given. He was interviewed by Det Con Henderson and another officer and then for a second time after analysis of a seized mobile phone ""revealed what the police considered to be evidence of child sex offences or grooming"". Renshaw had talked about how police were trying to destroy his life and make it sound like he was a paedophile, prosecutor said. He said after he had killed the officer he would commit ""suicide by cop"" by pretending to be wearing a suicide vest and would also make a video to say the attack had been done on behalf of National Action. Jurors were told Mr Mullen believed Renshaw was serious and there was an imminent threat to life, and reported what had been said to his contacts at Hope not Hate. Hope not Hate director Nick Lowles alerted the MP Ruth Smeeth -  who once worked at the charity - and she in turn warned Ms Cooper, leading to the police inquiry, Mr Atkinson said. The trial was adjourned until Wednesday.

Why did Trump mention beaches?,"North Korea's beaches could represent a new business opportunity, according to Mr Trump US President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore was a historic event, marking the first time that current heads of the two countries have met. From the historic handshake between the two leaders to the signing of a joint agreement, experts have analysed the meeting and its significance for future US-North Korean relations. But there were some odd moments of the day, which have got people talking. Before he became president, Donald Trump was better known for his property empire. But it was still a surprising moment to hear the US leader mention a lesser known North Korean attraction: its coastline. ""They (North Korea) have great beaches. You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean. I said, 'Boy look at that view. Wouldn't that make a great condo?',"" he told reporters after meeting Mr Kim. North Korea: surfer's paradise? The US government currently advises against all travel to North Korea and says that its citizens who decide to go should draft a will before departure. Before the two leaders sat down for a working lunch, Mr Trump jokingly asked photographers: ""Getting a good picture, everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin?"" However, his words seem to have been lost in translation, judging by Mr Kim's blank expression. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some of the dishes on the menu raised eyebrows, even among Koreans. Before the US president gave a news conference, journalists were treated to a highly unusual four-minute video in Korean and English, which Mr Trump said he had shown to Mr Kim. On a background of tense music and strong images, a dramatic narrator asked: ""Will this leader choose to advance his country... Will he shake the hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen?... Which path will be chosen? ""Featuring President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un in a meeting to remake history, to shine in the sun. One moment, one choice. The future remains to be written."" Allow Twitter content?

After talks concluded, Mr Trump decided to show the North Korean leader his ride for the summit - a black presidential limousine known as The Beast. Cameras followed the two men as they walked over to the vehicle and Mr Kim briefly looked inside. President Trump shows Kim Jong-un ""The Beast"" The pens originally laid out for the signing of the documents were black and featured President Trump's signature in gold. The pen bearing Trump's signature was inspected by a North Korean aide, but was later swapped for another But at the last moment,Mr Kim's influential sister Kim Yo-jongswitched the North Korean leader's pen for a ballpoint pen. Security for the North Korean leader has been high throughout the trip, but it is unclear whether the pens were swapped for security or political reasons.

Trump: Kim is a 'funny guy',"This video can not be played Was the summit a win-win for both countries, or a Kim win? The handshake has happened, the summit is over, and now Donald Trump is hitting the media circuit - including his first sit-down interview with a major news network other than Fox - to make the case for what he has accomplished. Because it's Mr Trump, some of what he has to say is head-scratching, other parts will have his supporters smirking or swooning, while many of his critics will be outraged. Here are a few of his key lines - and what they could mean. ""He's got a great personality. He's a funny guy. He's very smart. He's a great negotiator. He loves his people, not that I'm surprised by that."" This was Mr Trump's response when Voice of America's Greta Van Susteren asked what he found surprising about the North Korean leader. He would alsotell ABC's George Stephanopoulos,externalthat the North Korean people love him back and that they have ""great fervour"" for their leader. That the US president says he was not surprised that Mr Kim, who oversees a totalitarian regime that imprisons an estimated 120,000 of its people for political reasons, ""loves his people"" or that they love him will certainly come as a shock to many human rights advocates. In fact, the pageantry of the summit, Mr Trump's solicitous manner and his kind words for Mr Kim have already drawn the ire of some of the president's critics - and others who have, in the past, largely held their tongue. 'A missed chance' says defector The summit's oddest moments Did rhetoric match reality? Handshake moment explained in pictures ""I think the North Korean flag is a piece of vile filth that stands for the dynastic rule of a racist cult that subjugates, tortures and enslaves its own people,""writes National Review senior editor Jonah Goldberg,external, regarding the display of US and North Korean flags at the summit site. ""Ideally it would spontaneously combust when it even touches our flag."" TheNational Rifle Association's Dana Loesch said,externalshe was ""not a fan"" of having the US and North Korean flags together, ""as any sort of equals"". Several reporters pressed Mr Trump on North Korea's record of human rights violations - and whether the president, who described Mr Kim as ""talented"", should have been more cautious with his language. ""Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough - I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it - he ran it,"" Mr Trump said in reply to a question about his praise of Mr Kim. ""Very few people, at that age - you can take one out of 10,000, probably, could do it."" That ""talented"" line provoked a response from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. ""This isn't the past. This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done."" Donald Trump, in his press conference, announced that Mr Kim had ""reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". He had also agreed to ""vigorous"" negotiations to implement the agreement. Agreements and negotiations have happened in fits and starts for nearly three decades, of course. Mr Trump sees a different outcome because he sees himself differently. He's the consummate dealmaker. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures ""My whole life has been deals,"" he told reporters. ""I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't. A lot of politicians don't."" Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised his predecessors, saying that they didn't get the job done - but he campaigned on the promise that he would be a different kind of president and would get a different, better result. It's a view he's not backing away from. ""I think he trusts me, and I trust him."" During the US-Soviet arms disarmament negotiations of the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan coined the phrase ""trust but verify"". On multiple occasions on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he trusts Mr Kim - and Stephanopoulos brought the Reagan line up during his interview with the president. Mr Trump responded that the US and North Korea would be working together and developing ""great relationships at different levels"". As for the details? The ""trust"" has been professed, but the ""verify"" is yet to be spelled out. ""If I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honour to do it."" One of the prime lines of criticisms directed at Mr Trump for participating in the summit is that he is encouraging other rogue regimes to develop their own nuclear weapons so that they can stand on equal footing with a US president. Mr Trump has shredded an agreement with Iran that was designed to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear arsenal. It is an ""honour"", on the other hand, for the president to deal with Mr Kim, a ""very powerful man"" who has ""powerful nuclear weapons"". Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican who has largely supported the Trump administration, makes the distinction clear. ""Countries like Iran and Cuba and other two-bit rogue regimes don't have nuclear weapons yet,""he told,externalradio host Hugh Hewitt. ""They can't threaten the United States in that way. Once North Korea had nuclear weapons, once they have missiles that can deliver them to use, I would liken it to past presidents sitting down with Soviet dictators."" Nuclear weapons got North Korea to the table. The big question now is what it will take for the US to convince Mr Kim to give them up. ""I think the initial rhetoric was very important. Frankly, as much as I hated to do it, and as much as some people thought I was doing the wrong thing, I think without that we wouldn't be here."" It was just under one year ago that Mr Trump warned North Korea that its threats against the US would be met by ""fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen"". He'd go on, over the course of the following months, to deride Mr Kim as ""little Rocket Man"" and disparage the size of his ""nuclear button"". This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance Lines like those had pundits, politicians and analysts expressing shock and concern that the US was on a path to war - and inside reports from the White House of military deliberations and planning did nothing to ease minds. Now Mr Trump is saying that it was all part of his strategy - a modern-day incarnation of Richard Nixon's ""madman"" gambit with the North Vietnamese - which he says may have made him look ""foolish"" but has proven to be effective. ""We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should."" This nugget was nestled at the beginning of the question-and-answer portion of Mr Trump's post-summit press conference - and it represents a significant concession on the part of the US side. Even using the term ""war games"" itself comes across as a nod to the North Koreans. Annual US-South Korea joint military training exercises had been a constant source of irritation for the North, which viewed the operations as preparation for war. Mr Trump is ending them - at least for the moment - and perhaps most noteworthy is that he couched the revelation as a cost-saving step. That may play well with Mr Trump's base, who rallied around Mr Trump's campaign pledge to spend US resources at home, not abroad - although it does mark a change of tack from the president's boasts of record level of military spending in the latest US budget for a depleted US armed forces. ""Honestly, I think he's going to do these things.  I may be wrong.  I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, 'Hey, I was wrong.'  I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse."" This line - a president admitting that he may not admit to mistakes - raised more than a few eyebrows, but it's part of what makes Mr Trump so irresistible to his supporters. They thoroughly believe that all politicians lie, that they all will never admit mistakes, that they all say whatever they think voters want to hear. Mr Trump, at least in their estimation, is being open about it. He is, in effect, letting them in on the joke. Maybe this is a mistake. Maybe the negotiations will fall apart. Maybe Mr Trump will find some sort of excuse. But, if that happens, he'll do it with a wink and a nod to those who have stood by him through it all.

One of the prime lines of criticisms directed at Mr Trump for participating in the summit is that he is encouraging other rogue regimes to develop their own nuclear weapons so that they can stand on equal footing with a US president. Mr Trump has shredded an agreement with Iran that was designed to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear arsenal. It is an ""honour"", on the other hand, for the president to deal with Mr Kim, a ""very powerful man"" who has ""powerful nuclear weapons"". Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican who has largely supported the Trump administration, makes the distinction clear. ""Countries like Iran and Cuba and other two-bit rogue regimes don't have nuclear weapons yet,""he told,externalradio host Hugh Hewitt. ""They can't threaten the United States in that way. Once North Korea had nuclear weapons, once they have missiles that can deliver them to use, I would liken it to past presidents sitting down with Soviet dictators."" Nuclear weapons got North Korea to the table. The big question now is what it will take for the US to convince Mr Kim to give them up. ""I think the initial rhetoric was very important. Frankly, as much as I hated to do it, and as much as some people thought I was doing the wrong thing, I think without that we wouldn't be here."" It was just under one year ago that Mr Trump warned North Korea that its threats against the US would be met by ""fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen"". He'd go on, over the course of the following months, to deride Mr Kim as ""little Rocket Man"" and disparage the size of his ""nuclear button"". This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance Lines like those had pundits, politicians and analysts expressing shock and concern that the US was on a path to war - and inside reports from the White House of military deliberations and planning did nothing to ease minds. Now Mr Trump is saying that it was all part of his strategy - a modern-day incarnation of Richard Nixon's ""madman"" gambit with the North Vietnamese - which he says may have made him look ""foolish"" but has proven to be effective. ""We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should."" This nugget was nestled at the beginning of the question-and-answer portion of Mr Trump's post-summit press conference - and it represents a significant concession on the part of the US side. Even using the term ""war games"" itself comes across as a nod to the North Koreans. Annual US-South Korea joint military training exercises had been a constant source of irritation for the North, which viewed the operations as preparation for war. Mr Trump is ending them - at least for the moment - and perhaps most noteworthy is that he couched the revelation as a cost-saving step. That may play well with Mr Trump's base, who rallied around Mr Trump's campaign pledge to spend US resources at home, not abroad - although it does mark a change of tack from the president's boasts of record level of military spending in the latest US budget for a depleted US armed forces. ""Honestly, I think he's going to do these things.  I may be wrong.  I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, 'Hey, I was wrong.'  I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse."" This line - a president admitting that he may not admit to mistakes - raised more than a few eyebrows, but it's part of what makes Mr Trump so irresistible to his supporters. They thoroughly believe that all politicians lie, that they all will never admit mistakes, that they all say whatever they think voters want to hear. Mr Trump, at least in their estimation, is being open about it. He is, in effect, letting them in on the joke. Maybe this is a mistake. Maybe the negotiations will fall apart. Maybe Mr Trump will find some sort of excuse. But, if that happens, he'll do it with a wink and a nod to those who have stood by him through it all.

"The beaches, the pens - six moments from the dayVideoVideo","North Korea's beaches could represent a new business opportunity, according to Mr Trump US President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore was a historic event, marking the first time that current heads of the two countries have met. From the historic handshake between the two leaders to the signing of a joint agreement, experts have analysed the meeting and its significance for future US-North Korean relations. But there were some odd moments of the day, which have got people talking. Before he became president, Donald Trump was better known for his property empire. But it was still a surprising moment to hear the US leader mention a lesser known North Korean attraction: its coastline. ""They (North Korea) have great beaches. You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean. I said, 'Boy look at that view. Wouldn't that make a great condo?',"" he told reporters after meeting Mr Kim. North Korea: surfer's paradise? The US government currently advises against all travel to North Korea and says that its citizens who decide to go should draft a will before departure. Before the two leaders sat down for a working lunch, Mr Trump jokingly asked photographers: ""Getting a good picture, everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin?"" However, his words seem to have been lost in translation, judging by Mr Kim's blank expression. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some of the dishes on the menu raised eyebrows, even among Koreans. Before the US president gave a news conference, journalists were treated to a highly unusual four-minute video in Korean and English, which Mr Trump said he had shown to Mr Kim. On a background of tense music and strong images, a dramatic narrator asked: ""Will this leader choose to advance his country... Will he shake the hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen?... Which path will be chosen? ""Featuring President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un in a meeting to remake history, to shine in the sun. One moment, one choice. The future remains to be written."" Allow Twitter content?

Cameras followed the two men as they walked over to the vehicle and Mr Kim briefly looked inside. President Trump shows Kim Jong-un ""The Beast"" The pens originally laid out for the signing of the documents were black and featured President Trump's signature in gold. The pen bearing Trump's signature was inspected by a North Korean aide, but was later swapped for another But at the last moment,Mr Kim's influential sister Kim Yo-jongswitched the North Korean leader's pen for a ballpoint pen.

Tory MPs set for Brexit 'concession' talks,"This video can not be played Solicitor General Robert Buckland says Brexit legislation will be improved Theresa May must honour ""assurances"" she's given that Parliament will get a bigger say on any final Brexit deal, pro-EU Tory MPs say. The government averted a rebellion on the issue after a meeting between the PM and more than a dozen MPs. One of the potential rebels, Dominic Grieve, warned there would be consequences for the government if not. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a government source had told her no actual concessions had been agreed. And a senior minister, Solicitor General Robert Buckland, said the government had only agreed to ""further discussions"" about the way in which they could make ""a further step forward"". A group of MPs said on Tuesday they were offered, in a last-minute concession, real ""input"" if no deal with the EU was done by December. Ministers win Brexit vote after concession Scottish government wants devolution changes Minister quits government over Brexit Phillip Lee quits: How big a problem is it for May? Details of precisely what this will involve could emerge in the coming days when the EU Withdrawal Bill is due to return to the House of Lords. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March next year, after the referendum in 2016 when people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave. The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"". Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit. But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy. Given that politicians, like the rest of the country, are divided on what Brexit should look like, this is posing problems for the government as it tries to get the bill through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. This video can not be played The government has dodged a defeat on its key Brexit legislation The government is currently trying to persuade MPs to undo most of the changes made by the House of Lords, and on Tuesday this involved a tussle over how much of a say Parliament will get if it does not like the deal struck between the UK and the EU. The government does not want to give MPs and peers the power to say what sort of Brexit deal the UK should strike with the EU, saying this should be left to ministers. When it came to the key vote, a group of Conservatives who had threatened to rebel agreed at the last minute not to defeat the government after public haggling between ministers and would-be rebels and a meeting between Mrs May and more than a dozen Tory MPs. But it is not yet clear exactly what the MPs were offered and whether they are happy with what has since been said by ministers. This video can not be played Tory rebel Nicky Morgan tells Today she was given 'assurances' by May ""I expect the government to honour its commitments and I expect the PM to honour her commitments and I have no reason to distrust the approach she took with us,"" one of the would-be rebels, Dominic Grieve, told the BBC's Newsnight. Ahead of the vote Mr Grieve tried to broker a compromise between MPs and ministers which would apply if Parliament rejects the final UK-EU Brexit deal. Under his proposals, the government would then have to seek MPs' approval for its plan of action through a motion in the House of Commons. It would also have to do this if no deal has been agreed by the end of November 2018. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ministers have agreed to consider these suggestions - but not a third strand of his proposals which would require the government to ""follow any direction"" from MPs if there is no deal by 15 February 2019. Remain-supporting Conservatives Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan were two of the MPs to meet with Mrs May. Ms Soubry said she trusted Mrs May to ""honour the undertaking she gave"". Ms Morgan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What was agreed was the prime minister understood that Parliament wants to have a real say, in all circumstances, in relation to what's going to happen in the Brexit deal."" Politics is often about the big picture, but sometimes it is a festival for pedants. Believe me, in Westminster, there is a very very big difference between the promise of more serious chat about something with the possibility of a change - and a promise actually to do something different, especially if it is made by the occupant of Number 10. So just hours after the concession, (or non-concession) very, very dark mutterings began from those who had been persuaded by what they thought was a promise. Read Laura's full blog Eurosceptic MPs have criticised moves to give Parliament more power as Brexit approaches, saying this would be used to ""wreck"" the UK's EU departure. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, a leading Brexit backer, said the concessions could ""come back to haunt"" the government if they amounted to a veto over the terms of the UK's departure. He told the BBC that rebels were seeking a ""wrecking motion"", stating: ""It not only has the risk of stopping Brexit, it is certainly going to make the negotiating position of the government considerably diminished. ""It is hugely irresponsible, and I can't believe that those that are perpetrating this don't know exactly what they are doing. And, for me, it's a betrayal of the British people."" The EU Withdrawal Bill is now back in the House of Commons, with MPs debating the rest of the Lords amendments. These include a requirement to seek membership of the European Economic Area - an arrangement like Norway's that would keep the UK part of the EU single market. This is opposed by both the Conservative and Labour leaderships, despite the backing of some pro-EU MPs in both parties. There is also an amendment requiring the government to report to Parliament on steps taken to negotiate a customs union with the EU. The government has rejected this one too, and has proposed an alternative amendment referring to a new ""customs arrangement"" which was thought to have averted the possibility of a rebellion on that subject. Tempers flared in the Commons as MPs discussed immigration, with Speaker John Bercow appealing to members to ""respect"" each other's arguments. Ms Soubry said she was ""appalled"" at a speech from Labour's Caroline Flint and accused her of not appreciating the value of immigrants. Ms Flint had argued for new immigration controls, saying people wanted to be able to ""turn the tap on and off when we choose"". She said she was not against all immigration but that her constituents wanted a ""fair and managed system"". Earlier some MPs claimed an amendment passed on Tuesday night could have implications for the government's preferred trade options after Brexit. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the amendment, which committed the government to avoiding any ""physical infrastructure, including border posts, or checks and controls"" in Northern Ireland after Brexit. He said this meant one of the government's proposals for replacing the customs union - a technology-based solution to minimise border delays - could be ""unlawful"" if it involves any border infrastructure checks. Dominic Grieve agreed, saying: ""Not only will we have to stay in a form of customs arrangement amounting to a union, but we're also going to have to have a high level of regulatory alignment because otherwise the life that takes place along the border will be impossible because of different regulations on either side."" Labour's whips' office said it expected eight votes to take place from 19:30BST.
