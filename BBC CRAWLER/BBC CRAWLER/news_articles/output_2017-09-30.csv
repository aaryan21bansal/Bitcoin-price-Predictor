Air France jet engine fails mid-flight,"Passengers could see the damaged engine from windows mid-flight An Air France flight from Paris to Los Angeles was forced to make a sudden diversion when it lost part of an engine over the Atlantic. One of the four engines on the Airbus A380 flight AF66 failed west of Greenland on Saturday. No-one was injured in the incident, but passengers remained on board hours after the landing at 15:42 GMT. The plane was carrying 496 passengers and 24 crew at the time, an Air France spokesperson told AFP news agency. David Rehmar, a former aircraft mechanic who was a passenger on the flight, told the BBC that based on his observations, the incident was a fan failure. He said there was a sudden movement followed by a loud noise, which caused panic among the passengers. ""You heard a loud 'boom', and it was the vibration alone that made me think the engine had failed,"" he said. Mr Rehmar said that for a few moments, he thought ""we were going to go down."" His worry that the aircraft's wing could have been compromised disappeared when the flight stabilised within 30 seconds. And he added that the pilots had quickly shut down the affected engine. The wing suffered no serious damage and the plane landed safely The plane flew for about an hour on three engines before it reached Goose Bay Airport, in Labrador in eastern Canada. Photos taken by passengers showed the cowling, or engine covering, completely destroyed, and some cosmetic damage to the wing's surface. Mr Rehmar said that a bird strike was not a likely cause of the incident at such a high altitude, and his experience led him to believe the stage-one fan - the exterior fan blades on the front of the engine - had somehow failed. But the cause of any such failure is not yet clear. Passengers were stranded on the plane in Canada for a number of hours, as the airport is not equipped to handle an Airbus A380. He said passengers had been provided with meals and that the captain had come out to speak to passengers. Some posed with him in images posted on social media. Two 777s were dispatched from Montreal to pick them up and transfer them to Los Angeles. In a statement, Air France simply confirmed ""serious damage"" to one engine and said its crew had ""handled this serious incident perfectly"".

The illness that affects one in six of us,"At any one time, a sixth of the population in England aged 16 to 64 have a mental health problem, according to statistics body NHS Digital. Whether it is family or friends, neighbours or work colleagues, the chances are we all know someone who is affected. And bearing in mind the figure leaves out less common conditions and is a snapshot in time, you could easily argue it is even more prevalent than that. Indeed many do. With Prime Minister Theresa May expected to announce plans to improve care next week, these 10 charts show the extent of the challenge. It seems to be getting more common - or at least among those with severe symptoms. While the proportion of people affected does not appear to have risen in the past few years, if you go back a little further there has certainly been a steady increase. Evidence from the NHS Digital study in England shows the rise has been driven by an increase in women with illness. Why is this? Undoubtedly some of it is down to people being more willing to report and admit mental health problems. Experts point to the way self-harm in particular is recognised in a way it was not 20 or 30 years ago. But it is also clear 21st Century life is taking its toll on some people. Economic uncertainty, social media, the influence of the media and rising expectations of what life should be like have all been suggested as possible causes. Women are now much more likely to have a common mental illness. One in five report they have, compared with one in eight men in England. If you include only those with severe symptoms, the difference is less acute, but still apparent. Young people are particularly susceptible. A number of theories have been put forward for this. The economic uncertainty of the past decade has particularly affected the young, making it harder to get on the career ladder. And psychiatrists and mental health campaigners are increasingly raising questions about whether social media increases peer-group pressure and online bullying. Whatever the reason, the one thing experts are agreed on is that the figures are shocking. Mental health problems prompt thousands of people to take their own lives. In fact there are about 6,000 suicides in the UK each year and it's the biggest killer of men up to the age of 49. Men account for three-quarters of the total figure. The best overall measure is the number of suicides per 100,000 people.  That's because, with a rising population, the absolute figure is almost bound to go up.  Since the 1980s, the trend is down. There's quite a big national variation, with England having the lowest suicide rate and Northern Ireland the highest. Scotland and Wales have similar rates and are in the middle. As already mentioned, mental health problems are particularly common in the young in the UK. In fact, most mental health problems develop in childhood or when a person is a young adult. Three-quarters of problems are established by the age of 24. It is why there is such an emphasis at the moment on addressing childhood mental illness. In 2015, the government promised funding for child and adolescent mental health services would increase. Extra money has also been earmarked for adult services in England. Together with the investment in children's services it means by 2020-21 Â£1.28bn more should be spent in real terms than was in 2015-16. Ministers say the money will be used to put mental health services in A&E, more crisis teams in the community and a focus on helping new mothers, with one in five reporting problems in the first year after the birth of their baby. But an analysis last year by the King's Fund health think tank found 40% of mental health trusts in England had actually seen their budgets cut in 2015-16. The government is adamant things will change. They have to. While 23% of NHS activity is taken up by mental illness, mental health trusts have been receiving only about 11% of funding in recent years. Extra investment is being made in the other parts of the UK. Wales and Scotland have both recently unveiled new plans. But like England, mental health remains the poor cousin compared to the spending on physical ailments. The promise of investment has also been accompanied by a desire to reshape services - and particularly how quickly we can access them. The government established the first set of waiting time targets for the NHS in England in 2016. They mean the health service should be providing access to talking therapies within 18 weeks and treatment for those experiencing their first episode of psychosis within two weeks for at least half of people. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all have their own targets too. But drugs are still the most common form of treatment. The number of medicines dispensed for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks has almost doubled in the past 10 years. An increase in the numbers of people getting antidepressants is clearly a factor. But so too is the fact prescribing patterns have changed. Doctors are much more likely to keep people on drugs for longer with evidence suggesting it is a more effective way of treating patients. But as common as antidepressants are, the fact remains the majority of people with mental illness report they are not getting help. Only one in three of those polled said they were receiving treatment, according to NHS Digital. With the high rates of non-treatment in mind, it perhaps should not come as a surprise that there is an upwards trend in England in the number of people being detained under the Mental Health Act. Campaigners say patients in crisis are given just enough treatment to stabilise them before being sent home too early to ease pressure on beds. What happens then? They suffer another crisis and are detained again. So some people spend years being detained over and over again without ever getting well. The pressure on the system also manifests itself in long journeys for treatment. Last year a major report looked at the issue and pointed to thousands of people being sent more than 30 miles for services like acute care, psychiatric intensive care or rehabilitation. In some rural areas, of course, travelling long distances is not that uncommon for all sorts of care. But that's not the point, said the report.  Far too many people in towns and cities, where services should be easier to access, are affected, and the situation was ""unacceptable"". Everyone knows it's a problem.  Nobody likes it, and it can be massively disruptive for patients and their families. Yet an awful lot of sufferers of mental ill health travel a long, long way to get treatment. And, according to the British Medical Association, things are getting worse not better. In fact, it says, there's been a ""startling rise"" in the number of patients being sent out of area for treatment, a rise of nearly 40% between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to 5,876 adults. One patient they found had been sent from Somerset to the Highlands, a journey of 587 miles. The use of police cells for people in mental health crisis has attracted huge disquiet, not least among officers themselves. In a rare public statement of concern from a senior police chief, Devon and Cornwall Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton tweeted ""#unacceptable"" when a 16-year-old girl was held for two days in a cell in 2015 because no beds were available. That caused quite a stir among officers, patients and distraught families who felt that police cells were the last place someone in a health crisis should be held. But now the use of police cells is down - at least in England and Wales, though figures in Scotland suggest it may have gone up. In England and Wales it has fallen by more than half from 4,500 in 2014-15 to just over 2,000 in 2015-16,  according to the National Police Chiefs' Council. The NPCC also says the downward change is even bigger for under 18s to just 43 cases in 2015-16. But perhaps the most promising development in terms of mental health is the changing attitude towards mental illness. A public campaign called Time to Change was launched in 2009 by leading charities Mind and Rethink. It has been supported by the lottery and government along the way - and seems to be working. Latest results from the National Attitudes to Mental Illness Survey, released in May, showed people's willingness to work, live with and live nearby someone with a mental health problem has been improving in England. Campaigners have described the progress as wonderful but warn against complacency. Despite the improvements, nearly nine in 10 people who have had mental health problems report they have suffered stigma and discrimination. For all the positives, there's a long way to go, it seems.

PM pledges to freeze tuition fees,"This video can not be played Theresa May says the government ""has to look again"" at the issue of tuition fees Theresa May has admitted a change in her party's approach on tuition fees in England, saying she has listened to voters and fees will freeze at Â£9,250. Fee repayment thresholds will also rise, so graduates will start paying back loans once they earn Â£25,000, rather than Â£21,000, the PM said. She said the whole student finance system would be reviewed and did not rule out a move to a graduate tax. Labour, which wants to scrap tuition fees, called the plan ""desperate"". The prime minister, who is in Manchester for her party's conference,also pledged to extend the Help to Buy schemewhich helps people buy newly-built homes, in an attempt to win over younger voters. The Olympic cost of PM's tuition fees plan 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees 'I worry about money most of the time' How to own a home by the age of 25 Tories 'urgently need more volunteers' Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show she plans to apologise to Conservative activists for her decision to call a snap election. She said the message she had taken from the election, at which she lost her Commons majority, was that the Conservatives needed to ""listen to voters,"" particularly younger people and those who are ""just about managing"". She said that when the government increased student fees it had been expected that there would be a ""diversity in the system,"" with some universities offering shorter and cheaper courses, rather than always charging the maximum amount. ""That hasn't happened. We've got to look at it again,"" she told Marr. Asked if there could be a graduate tax instead of the current system, she said: ""By looking at it again we will be looking at the issues that people are raising, we will be looking at where the system has worked, we will be looking at the concerns that people have."" The Conservative Party conference runs from Sunday until Wednesday The planned Â£250 increase in tuition fees for 2018-19 to Â£9,500 will not go ahead and fees will instead remain at the current maximum of Â£9,250 per year. The overhaul of the higher education sector could also see the introduction of fast-track, two-year degree courses, an idea which has been suggested to limit the costs for young people considering higher education. Other ideas being considered by the government as part of the overhaul are cutting the interest rates on loans and introducing lower fees for students studying certain subjects, such as engineering, where there is a skills shortage. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said he wanted to see the government going further by  reintroducing maintenance grants for the poorest students and reducing interest rates for low and medium earners. ""We also need to do more to reverse the worrying decline in the numbers of part-time and mature students,"" he added. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust education think tank, agreed that maintenance grants should be reintroduced and also called for fees to be means-tested so those from low-income families repay less. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the move was ""a desperate attempt by the Tories to kick the issue into the long grass because they have no plans for young people and no ideas for our country"". She added: ""They are yesterday's party."" By Sean Coughlan, BBC education correspondent Calling this a ""freeze"" on tuition fees in England is a distinctly positive spin on abandoning a policy of increasing fees above Â£9,250 only put in place this year. If not a U-turn, it's certainly a Uni-turn. But it shows how quickly the politics have changed - with rising fees and ballooning debts now a toxic combination for any party wanting to court young voters. Although billed as a change of direction, universities had already predicted thata fee rise was ""dead in the water""because, without a majority, the government had no realistic prospect of pushing it through. Perhaps more significant is the increase in the earnings threshold for repayments - up from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000. There is also the promise of re-examining interest rates for loans, hiked to 6.1% from this autumn. But this will be the first time an announced fee rise has had to be ditched. The question will be whether cancelling an increase will be a bold enough move compared with promises to scrap them altogether. Martin Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, welcomed the move, saying increasing the repayment threshold from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000 could save many lower and middle earning graduates thousands of pounds. Writing on his Facebook page,external, he said ""every single graduate earning over Â£21,000 a year will pay less"". ""And it has a long-term progressive benefit too,"" he added. ""As most graduates won't clear their loans in full before it's wiped - by reducing what they repay each year, you reduce what they repay in total too."" However, he said details were still ""sketchy"" and it was unclear who it would apply to. The Help to Buy mortgage scheme is currently only available on newly-built homes in England The Help to Buy expansion will see Â£10bn go to another 135,000 buyers in order to help them to own their own home. The funding will allow recipients to get a mortgage with a deposit of just 5%. The money can only be put towards the purchase of new-build homes. The Conservative Party conference runs from Sunday until Wednesday - when Mrs May will be the final speaker in Manchester. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent in Manchester The conference slogan isn't ""anything but Brexit"", but listen to what the party's high command wants to talk about here in the next few days, and it might as well be. There is a clear attempt by senior Conservatives here to change the subject; stray beyond the ever present - and divisive - topic of leaving the European Union, and flesh out the government's domestic political priorities. Ministers want to be seen to be addressing an Achilles heel for them at the general election - young people, who overwhelmingly rejected them in June. Hence two policies pitched directly at them: university tuition fees in England, and getting on the property ladder. The political reality, though, is Brexit - the defining political issue of our time - will never be far from the lips of people here. And neither too will the precarious state of the party and its leader, after the humiliation of going backwards in an election Theresa May called voluntarily.

Trump lashes out at hurricane plea mayor,"This video can not be played Mayor Cruz gave a news conference on Friday: ""Mayday, we are in trouble"" Donald Trump has lashed out at Puerto Rico politicians over their criticism of US relief efforts on the island following Hurricane Maria. The category four hurricane a week ago killed 16 people on the island and left millions in need of aid. In a series of tweets, Trump said that Puerto Rican officials showed ""poor leadership ability"" and ""want everything to be done for them"". It comes after the Mayor of San Juanmade a desperate pleafor federal help. ""We have no time for patience any more,"" Carmen Yulin Cruz said in a news conference. ""I am asking the president of the United States to make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives. ""I am done being polite. I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell."" This video can not be played Signal loss: Why Puerto Rico is suffering in silence She then appeared in a T-shirt that said ""Help us, we're dying"" for a CNN television interview. Does Trump care about Puerto Rico's hurricane victims? The mayor, who is living in a shelter after her home was destroyed, said Puerto Rico is set to be without power for six to eight months after the storm damaged 90% of homes on the island. More bad weather is in the offing, with the National Weather Service in San Juan warning that a strong thunderstorm would imminently affect the east of the island, with torrential rain and strong winds expected. Almost half the island's 3.4 million population are without drinking water, the US Defence Department said on Thursday. Efforts are being made on the island to clear road access and restore hospitals to working conditions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a series of tweets on Saturday morning, Trump suggested the mayor had been told ""to be nasty to Trump"" by his Democratic opposition. He also said he would visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday with the First Lady, Melania. It follows widespread criticism of his administration's response to the hurricane. Responding to Trump's tweets in an interview the mayor said: ""I was asking for help. I wasn't saying anything nasty about the president."" The San Juan mayor has been vocal about the island's need for federal aid ""I will continue to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, compliment the people that I have to compliment, and call out the people that I need to call out. ""This isn't about me. This isn't about anyone. This is about lives that are being lost."" Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Puerto Rico We visited a school in LoÃ­za, just to the east of the capital, that had become a makeshift hurricane shelter. Nobody there had heard of the row between Donald Trump and the mayor of San Juan. They had, after all, no phone signals, no internet, no television and had much more pressing things to think about. Most had lost their homes and any belongings they had not managed to grab before Hurricane Maria struck. They told us they finally received mattresses to sleep on a full nine days after the hurricane, after having slept on the bare concrete of the classrooms until then. They said they had been visited by an official from the Federal Emergency Management Agency only on this, the 10th day. These people are in accessible areas close to the capital. There are fears about many in remote areas still waiting to be reached. On Thursday the President announced shipping restrictions had been lifted to help provide aid to the island. The US military general in charge of the relief operation said on Friday that about 4,500 troops were already involved. This video can not be played 'No power for 6-8 months' in Puerto Rico The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said 95% of the island remained without power and 55% of people did not yet have access to drinking water, but that most petrol stations had reopened. Concerns were raised on Thursday that thousands of shipping containers of aid were sitting in a San Juan undistributed. Ground transportation has been hindered by a lack of fuel and blocked roads. The US navy has deployed a hospital ship and has assigned engineers to repair the island's damaged power grid, the US Department of Defense said on Friday.

US 'in direct contact' with North Korea,"Rex Tillerson is in China meeting President Xi Jinping and other top officials The US is in ""direct contact"" with North Korea, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said. Mr Tillerson said Washington was ""probing"" the possibility of talks with Pyongyang, ""so stay tuned"". ""We have lines of communications to Pyongyang,"" he said during a trip to China. ""We're not in a dark situation."" North Korea and the US have engaged in heated rhetoric in recent months but it was not previously known they had lines of communication. Inside the world's most secretive country Where is the war of words heading? The US state department later confirmed there were a number of communication channels open with Pyongyang, but said little progress was being made. ""Despite assurances that the United States is not interested in promoting the collapse of the current regime (...) North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearisation,"" department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. This video can not be played North Koreans rally against ""dotard psycho Trump"" The US wants North Korea to halt its weapons programme, which has seen it perform repeated missile tests and, on 3 September, the test of a miniaturised hydrogen bomb which could be loaded on to a long-range missile, which Pyongyang said was successful. But attempts at dialogue seem to be at odds with President Donald Trump's own attitude to the issue. Just last month, he said ""talking is not the answer"". Allow Twitter content?

Record Â£167m lottery jackpot up for grabs,"The biggest UK jackpot on record is up for grabs on Tuesday after no-one took home Friday's Euromillions top prize. If one lucky ticketholder takes the estimated Â£167m jackpot, they will be go down as the biggest lottery winners in British and European history. The current UK record is Â£161m, won by Colin and Christine Weir, from Largs, North Ayrshire, six years ago. Winning numbers for Friday's draw, which had a Â£157m jackpot, were: 7, 18, 19, 32, 48. Lucky Stars were 3 and 7. Andy Carter, at the National Lottery, said: ""At an estimated Â£167m, Tuesday's Euromillions jackpot will be the biggest ever offered to National Lottery players in the UK. ""A single UK winner would be the biggest this country and Europe has ever seen."" To date, 91 UK ticketholders have won the Euromillions jackpot or a share of the jackpot prize, placing the country second behind France in terms of jackpot wins. Other European countries taking part in Euromillions, which has been running since 2004, include Spain, Austria, Belgium, the Irish Republic, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland. Record winners Christine and Colin Weir have donated millions to political and charitable causes The Weirs, who won their fortune in 2011, have since used their money for political and charitable causes.

Amputee teen racer walks Brands Hatch,"This video can not be played Formula 4 racing driver Billy Monger had to have both legs amputated after a crash A teenage racing driver who lost the lower part of both his legs in a crash has walked part of the Brands Hatch circuit for charity. Billy Monger, from Charlwood, Surrey,hit the back of a stationary carat Donington Park on 16 April - three weeks before his 18th birthday. The Formula 4 driver had to have both legs amputated and spent nearly a month in hospital recuperating. He walked 200m of the track before driving a buggy to complete the feat. Billy was back in a specially adapted racing car just 11 weeks after his crash About 1,000 people turned out at the track to support and cheer on the teenager - who only got his new prosthetic limbs on Thursday. Speaking just before the walk, which is in aid of the air ambulance, he said: ""I'll just be making sure I don't make any mistakes and don't fall over. ""Obviously there will be a lot of overriding emotion that will go with it, but I'll try and do my best, that's all I can do really."" British Touring Car medical director Dr Paul Trafford recalled the accident in Leicestershire. ""We all felt quite helpless because we were struggling to release Billy. He was talking to us, he knew he'd injured himself badly, and he looked so young,"" he said. ""It had a big effect on a lot of the people involved. Quite amazingly Billy seems to be the one that's bounced back quicker than anybody else who was there."" In July, just 11 weeks after the crash, Billy returned to the cockpit of a specially adapted racing car and is hoping to be back racing fully by spring 2018.

Schools occupied before Catalonia vote,"Pro-independence activists have occupied designated polling stations More than 160 schools in Catalonia have been occupied by activists trying to keep them open ahead of the region's banned independence referendum, Spain's central government says. Police visited 1,300 of the 2,315 schools in Catalonia designated as polling stations, finding 163 occupied. Tens of thousands of people are expected to attempt to vote on Sunday. Demonstrators also rallied in Barcelona on Saturday evening against the poll, calling instead for unity with Spain. Waving Spanish flags and carrying banners reading ""Catalonia is Spain"", thousands marched on the town hall. Meanwhile, Spanish authorities are stepping up their attempts to stop the ballot taking place. Authorities in Madrid have sent thousands of police to the region to stop the referendum - declared illegal by Spain's constitutional court. The Madrid government hasordered the Catalan regional police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, to assist them. Many of the extra officers drafted in are stationed in two ships in the port of Barcelona. Police have also occupied the regional government's telecommunications centre. This video can not be played Tom Burridge reports from one of the designated polling stations for the banned independence referendum Police have also been ordered to clear schools occupied by activists aiming to ensure the buildings can be used for voting. Spanish government sources quoted by Reuters said police would decide for themselves how to enforce orders to stop people voting. The head of the Catalan police has urged officers to avoid using force. Many of those inside the schools are parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday. Some told Reuters news agency that police had told them they could stay as long as they were not doing anything connected to Sunday's vote. Why these are uncharted waters for Spain Spain's moved to halt Catalan vote Laia, a 41-year-old sociologist who is staying in a Barcelona school this evening, said the police had visited four times. ""They read us out the part of the court order that says no activities related to the preparation of the banned referendum are allowed,"" she told Reuters. This video can not be played Why some Catalans want independence - and others don't Catalonia, a wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain, has its own language and culture. It also has a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution. Pressure for a vote on self-determination has grown over the past five years as austerity has hit the Spanish economy and people hard. Thousands attended a demonstration in favour of Spanish unity in Barcelona on Saturday But Spanish unionists argue Catalonia already enjoys broad autonomy within Spain, along with other regions like the Basque Country and Galicia. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Spain's distinctive north-eastern region Officers have been visiting the locations due to be used as polling stations, as well as seizing items such as ballot papers, while prosecutors have ordered the closure of websites linked to the vote and the arrest of officials organising the referendum. But Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont told Reuters that the referendum would go ahead. ""Everything is prepared at the more than 2,000 voting points so they have ballot boxes and voting slips, and have everything people need to express their opinion,"" he said. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy stared down Catalan secessionists when they held a trial referendum in 2014, offering no concessions to their demand for a legal vote. He has pledged to stop the 2017 vote, saying it goes againstthe constitution,externalwhich refers to ""the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards"". Central government spokesman IÃ±igo Mendez de Vigo accused the Catalan government of being inflexible and one-sided but it is a charge Catalan nationalists throw back at Madrid itself. Despite the tension in the region, demonstrations by independence campaigners have been largely peaceful. ""I don't believe there will be anyone who will use violence or who will want to provoke violence that will tarnish the irreproachable image of the Catalan independence movement as pacifist,"" Mr Puigdemont said.

Brexit transition deal 'unacceptable',"Mr Bolton is UKIP's fourth leader in just over a year Theresa May has given away the UK's stance on Brexit and shown Britain does not want to leave the EU in ""anything but name"", UKIP's new leader has said. Henry Bolton said a two-year transitional period for leaving the EU was ""unacceptable"" and Britain must be prepared to ""get out now"". He accused the Tories of deliberately ""dropping the ball"" as he addressed his party's annual conference. Mr Bolton also said multiculturalism was ""swamping"" British culture. The former army officer waved a British flag as he took to the stage at the party conference in Torquay to Pharrell William's hit song Happy. Henry Bolton elected UKIP leader Who is Henry Bolton? He started by asking members whether the UK was any closer to dictating its own borders or concluding trade deals to which he was answered with cries of ""no"". Mr Bolton told the conference the Conservatives ""cannot be trusted"" to take Britain out of the EU or even govern the country. ""The government, far from offering strong and stable leadership, has proven inept and unable to set and pursue clear strategic goals."" He said UKIP had a moral obligation to ensure that Britain leaves the EU and the ""fight back starts here today"". Earlier this month, Prime Minister Theresa May used a speech in Florenceto set out proposals for a two-year transition periodafter the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Mr Bolton said she had effectively asked for everything to stay exactly the same as it is. ""Far from strengthening the UK's hand in Brexit negotiations, the prime minister's speech in Florence gave it away,"" he said. ""The message she sent was that the UK does not want to leave the EU in anything but name."" He said a Brexit transitional period was ""unacceptable"" and Britain must be prepared to leave the EU straight away. ""We are getting out of the EU because we care about the future. Leaving the EU is but the first step to taking control of our own destiny."" Mr Bolton also told members that multiculturalism was ""swamping or displacing our own British culture"" and many people saw their communities changing without having a voice in how they were shaped. He said immigration was overwhelming public services and harming ""our own culture, traditions and way of life"". However, he stopped short of repeating UKIP's 2017 pledge toachieve zero net migration. Earlier he told reporters he would not commit to putting a figure on immigration as it was ""entirely unrealistic"" and ""we need to be a lot more practical and operational about it"".

""Andy Foster was an inspirational member of the Up and Under family,"" it said in a statement. ""His passion for the outdoors, and mountains in particular, was enormous and infectious."" Mr Foster, who studied engineering at Cardiff University, had gone on to work for clothing company Patagonia, where he was described as a ""much-loved member"" of the team. Mr Foster's death is the first fatality from a rock fall in the park in four years, according to the parks service.

Twin pilots retire by landing together,"Nick (left) landed his flight from Geneva 30 seconds after Jeremy landed from Gothenburg Twin brothers have retired as airline pilots, landing their final flights 30 seconds apart. Captains Jeremy and Nick Hart marked their 60th birthdays on Thursday by landing their planes together at Heathrow Airport. Jeremy from Flitton in Bedfordshire described retiring alongside his brother as ""a good way to finish"". Nick from Banbury, Oxfordshire, said: ""Like every aeroplane has its last landing, so does a pilot."" The pair, who were born 30 minutes apart and have clocked up 45,000 flying hours between them, said they had often been mistaken for each other during their careers but never flown together because they were both captains. Jeremy joined British Airways 30 years ago in 1987, while Nick joined from British Midland in 2012 when it was taken over by BA. Nick said: ""Jerry had never mentioned to his colleagues at British Airways that he had a twin brother who flew for British Midland, and one day [years ago] a British Airways pilot strode over to me at Heathrow and asked what on Earth I thought I was doing dressing up in a British Midland uniform. ""It took a bit of explaining to convince him that I wasn't Jeremy."" The brothers never flew together because they were both captains Jeremy, who landed an Airbus A320 at 12:34 BST from Gothenburg, Sweden, said: ""I've spent more than two and-a-half years in the air -  a lot of it in the holding pattern over Heathrow."" Nick, who flew from Geneva, landing at 12:35, said: ""I've done 28 years short-haul flying. That's about 11,000 flights. It's at least 1.2 million passengers."" British Airways' head Airbus pilot James Basnett said: ""They arrived in the world 30 minutes apart, flew the same aircraft in the same airline, and then departed in the same manner that they arrived - minutes apart. ""A fitting finale to long and impressive careers and I know that they will be sorely missed on the fleet.

Happy Birthday pop pickers! 50 facts about Radio 1 and 2,"L-R: Chris Evans, Clara Amfo, Annie Nightingale, Terry Wogan On 30 September, 1967, the BBC's Light Programme split in two. Younger listeners were given Radio 1, while the Light Programme itself morphed into Radio 2, continuing with its mix of big bands, record requests, sport and comedy. But do you know which DJ inspired the lyrics to I Am The Walrus? Or why Radio 1's first weather forecast prompted 12 complaints? Here are 50 facts to celebrate the stations' first 50 years. 1.The first voice on Radio 1 was Tony Blackburn, right? Wrong. Shortly after 5:30am on 30 September, broadcaster Paul Hollingdale was at the helm, with his Breakfast Special show broadcast simultaneously on both stations. 2.The opening announcement was not what you'd call dynamic... This video can not be played Jeremy Vine and Johnnie Walker look back at Radio 2's first broadcast. 3.The two stations split at 7:00am. After a five-second countdown, Tony Blackburn officially launched Radio 1 with a jingle promising ""too much fun"" and the sound of a barking dog. 4.The first song played on Radio 1 wasFlowers In The Rain,externalby The Move. Over on Radio 2, it was Julie Andrews singing The Sound Of Music. 5.George Martin's Theme One, however, was technically the first piece of music on Radio 1. Blackburn also played Johnny Dankworth's Beefeaters under his opening link. 6.Blackburn later revealed that the famous film footage of the launch was recorded the night before, and he had to write down the words, so he could replicate them when the station went live.

""I was yelled at when a 10-second link lasted 11 seconds,""recalled Keith Skues,external. ""'You cannot just ignore Greenwich Mean Time, Skues!'"" 8.Weather presenter Rosie O'Day received 12 complaints in the opening weeks of Radio 1 and 2. Why? Because she had the audacity to be a woman. ""Please, please spare us from Rosie O'Day reading the weather forecast,""complained one,external. ""It sounds more like a children's fairy story. I'm sure she is a charming girl, but let us stick to a man for the weather news!"" 9.Radio 2's Ken Bruce has a licence to drive Routemaster double-decker buses, and owns six of them, which he hires out for weddings and funerals. 100 Voices that made the BBC Sir Terry Wogan named top BBC radio DJ Ken Bruce - Busmaster 10.Before his Radio 1 debut, Dave Lee Travis stole the microphone he'd used on Radio Caroline.

""I just went and got a pair of scissors and cut the cable."" 11.Radio 1 launched half a decade after The Beatles' debut single, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the music industry. Trade magazine Record Retailer accused the BBC of ""trailing years behind public taste"" and warned ""the new station must swing if it is to be effective"". Waggoners Walk starred Edward Cast, Ellen McIntosh and Elaine Stritch 12.Radio 2's own soap opera, Waggoners Walk, launched in 1969. Set in Hampstead, it was often controversial, covering story-lines like contraception and homosexuality. 13.The show was cancelled at short notice in 1980. Some of the cast heard the news on the radio, and the writers responded by having aliens invade Hampstead Heath. 14.Terry Wogan made his Radio 2 debut in 1967, presenting show Late Night Extra - ""on the beat with music and news [and] off the record with pop"". 15.The Radio 1 Roadshow began in July 1973 with a Land Rover pulling a converted caravan around British holiday resorts. It's now morphed into the Big Weekend, with up to 100,000 fans watching acts like Jay-Z, Foo Fighters and Madonna playing unlikely towns like Swindon, Dundee and Norwich. The Radio 1 Roadshow in 1987, with pop stars Pepsi and Shirley alongside shorts enthusiasts ""Ooh"" Gary Davies and Mike Read 16.Between 1967 and 2004, John Peel brought more than 2,000 artists into the BBC to record one of his fabled Peel Sessions. First up were psychedelic rock band Tomorrow, with the likes of Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, The Smiths, Nirvana, Pulp and The White Stripes coming after. 17.But it was The Fall who recorded the most Peel sessions - 32 in all. 18.These days, DJs are expected to know everything about music - but no-one can be right all the time. Revealing the Radio 1 Top 40 in March 1981,Tony Blackburn announced,externala new entry by pop newcomers ""Duhran Duhran"". After several phone calls, he corrected the mistake, saying: ""None of us are too big to apologise."" Duran who? 19.Kenny Everett recorded several interviews with The Beatles for Radio 1 and 2  - but he also helped inspire one of their lyrics after taking an acid trip with John Lennon on the Weybridge golf course (of all places). ""A couple of months after my psychedelic round of golf with John I was in the Abbey Road recording studios where the Beatles were recording I Am The Walrus,"" wrote Everett in his autobiography. ""When he got to the line about getting a tan from standing in the English rain, he stopped and said to me: 'Reminds me of that day on the Weybridge golf course, eh Ken?' to which I replied: 'What'?' I'm sure he thought I was a complete lemon... or was it a bird?"" Kenny Everett - psychedelic golf clubs not pictured 20.Chris Evans has presented both the Radio 1 and Radio 2 Breakfast Shows - but he got his start in radio as Timmy Mallet's assistant on Manchester's Radio Piccadilly, playing a character called Nobby No Level, whose catchphrase was: ""What I don't know - I don't know!"" 21.To celebrate its fifth birthday in 1972, Radio 1 released hundreds of balloons from the top of Broadcasting House. Attached to each balloon was a form on which the finder could write their favourite record title and return it to their favourite DJ, who would play it on air. 22.In 2015, Elaine Paige helped Pieter - a regular listener to her Radio 2 show - propose to his boyfriend live on air. This video can not be played Elaine Paige helps a listener propose to his partner on Radio 2 23.Derek Jameson, who presented Radio 2's Breakfast Show from 1986 - 1991, became a broadcaster late in life as a consequence of suing the BBC. The former newspaper editor accused Radio 4's Week Ending of libel for saying he was ""so ignorant he thought erudite was a type of glue"". He lost the case and was ordered to pay Â£75,000 in costs - forcing him to accept a job with the corporation he had sued. 24.Many songs have been ""banned"" by BBC Radio over the years - but one of the first to be censored by Radio 1 was Pink Floyd's It Would Be So Nice. A reference to the Evening Standard newspaper in the opening verse was enough to breach the BBC's strict no-advertising policy. Mike Read - did he ban Relax, or not? 25.DJ Mike Read got the blame for banning Relax - but he says the decision wasn't in his power. ""I didn't ban Relax,"" he said, ""the BBC banned it. I was just a BBC employee."" Defending the decision, he added: ""The video did have that big fat Buddha bloke urinating from the balcony into somebody's mouth. Even now, that's not terribly good."" 26.Read later made up with the band and provided a voice-over on the TV advert for their debut album. 27.Jimi Hendrix, Madness and The Who have all recorded jingles for Radio 1 and 2.

With millions listening, he played Chicago's If You Leave Me Now over and over again, begging for Tessa to return. He has called this his ""one big broadcasting mistake"". 30.In 1991, Radio 1 managed to persuade Whitney Houston to cover for Simon Bates while he was on holiday. 31.Nowadays, almost every show has some sort of interactive element, but Annie Nightingale's Sunday Show was Radio 1's first dedicated request show. It ran for 12 years from 1975. Annie Nightingale was Radio 1's first female DJ 32.Taping songs off the radio was a rite of passage days before streaming. It was illegal, of course, but Annie used it to her advantage. ""I used to say: 'In a few minutes, I'll be playing Is That All There Is by Cristina,' so it gave people a chance to set up their tape recorders,"" she laughs. 33.Nigel Ogden, the host of Radio 2's big organ bonanza, The Organist Entertains, first featured on the show as a player in his teens, before taking over as a presenter in 1980. 34.""Hi there, pop pickers"". ""Quack Quack,Oops"". ""Stop!.... Carry on"". ""One Year Out"". ""It's Another True Storeeee!"" ""Not 'Arf"". Chris Evans - who's a naughty boy, then? 35.After a Christmas Party got out of hand in 1995, Chris Evans ""phoned in sick"" for the following day's Breakfast show. He was duly docked a day's pay - reportedly in the region of Â£7,000.  The following morning, he was back on the airwaves, telling listeners: ""I feel like I've had a holiday in Bermuda - although it was more expensive than a week in Bermuda, obviously."" 36.Simon Bates' first job at the BBC was as a Radio 4 continuity announcer. ""I was very bad at it too,""he told The Independent,external. ""I never mastered the art of saying 'Radio 4' between the end of one programme and the start of the next. If you try it, it's really very difficult."" Radio 1's 1970s line-up: Stuart Henry, Dave Lee Travis, Ed Stewart, Tony Blackburn, David Hamilton, Alan Freeman, Rosko and John Peel 37.Early DJs were hired for their skills as presenters, rather than an interest in music. John Peel, the one exception, remembered attending a party at Dave Lee Travis's house when he ""suddenly realised that DLT didn't own any records"". He asked him about it and Travis replied, ""Oh no, it's too much trouble... Anything I really like I've copied on tape. I've got quite a lot of tapes and I play them in the car, you see."" 38.Chris Moyles opened his first Radio 1 Breakfast Show in 2004 with a five-minute song crammed with clips of his predecessors. The song concluded with the prescient declaration: ""From now until they fire his ass, the saviour of Radio 1 is here"". This video can not be played Chris Moyles' opening jingle from 2004 39.Moyles clocked up eight years in the hot seat before bowing out in 2012 - making him Radio 1's longest-serving Breakfast presenter. 40.Terry Wogan managed 27 years on Radio 2's Breakfast show, before bowing out in 2009.

During take-off, he played Fifth Dimension's Up & Away In My Beautiful Balloon, the needle on the record skipping as the plane's wheels left the ground. 42.Except they didn't... the whole programme was an elaborate hoax for April Fool's Day. 43.Jeff Young pioneered Radio 1's first dance music programme with his ""Big Beat"" show in 1987. Pete Tong and Dave Pearce picked up the mantle with Dance Anthems and the weekend Recovery Session - a breakfast show for clubbers - in the 1990s. 44.Amy Winehouse's Live Lounge cover of Valerie by The Zutons was so popular it was later turned into a single in its own right, produced by Mark Ronson. It became one of her biggest hits, charting at number two (higher than the original, which peaked at nine). 45.

The illness one in six of us has,"At any one time, a sixth of the population in England aged 16 to 64 have a mental health problem, according to statistics body NHS Digital. Whether it is family or friends, neighbours or work colleagues, the chances are we all know someone who is affected. And bearing in mind the figure leaves out less common conditions and is a snapshot in time, you could easily argue it is even more prevalent than that. Indeed many do. With Prime Minister Theresa May expected to announce plans to improve care next week, these 10 charts show the extent of the challenge. It seems to be getting more common - or at least among those with severe symptoms. While the proportion of people affected does not appear to have risen in the past few years, if you go back a little further there has certainly been a steady increase. Evidence from the NHS Digital study in England shows the rise has been driven by an increase in women with illness. Why is this? Undoubtedly some of it is down to people being more willing to report and admit mental health problems. Experts point to the way self-harm in particular is recognised in a way it was not 20 or 30 years ago. But it is also clear 21st Century life is taking its toll on some people. Economic uncertainty, social media, the influence of the media and rising expectations of what life should be like have all been suggested as possible causes. Women are now much more likely to have a common mental illness. One in five report they have, compared with one in eight men in England. If you include only those with severe symptoms, the difference is less acute, but still apparent. Young people are particularly susceptible. A number of theories have been put forward for this. The economic uncertainty of the past decade has particularly affected the young, making it harder to get on the career ladder. And psychiatrists and mental health campaigners are increasingly raising questions about whether social media increases peer-group pressure and online bullying. Whatever the reason, the one thing experts are agreed on is that the figures are shocking. Mental health problems prompt thousands of people to take their own lives. In fact there are about 6,000 suicides in the UK each year and it's the biggest killer of men up to the age of 49. Men account for three-quarters of the total figure. The best overall measure is the number of suicides per 100,000 people.  That's because, with a rising population, the absolute figure is almost bound to go up.  Since the 1980s, the trend is down. There's quite a big national variation, with England having the lowest suicide rate and Northern Ireland the highest. Scotland and Wales have similar rates and are in the middle. As already mentioned, mental health problems are particularly common in the young in the UK. In fact, most mental health problems develop in childhood or when a person is a young adult. Three-quarters of problems are established by the age of 24. It is why there is such an emphasis at the moment on addressing childhood mental illness. In 2015, the government promised funding for child and adolescent mental health services would increase. Extra money has also been earmarked for adult services in England. Together with the investment in children's services it means by 2020-21 Â£1.28bn more should be spent in real terms than was in 2015-16. Ministers say the money will be used to put mental health services in A&E, more crisis teams in the community and a focus on helping new mothers, with one in five reporting problems in the first year after the birth of their baby. But an analysis last year by the King's Fund health think tank found 40% of mental health trusts in England had actually seen their budgets cut in 2015-16. The government is adamant things will change. They have to. While 23% of NHS activity is taken up by mental illness, mental health trusts have been receiving only about 11% of funding in recent years. Extra investment is being made in the other parts of the UK. Wales and Scotland have both recently unveiled new plans. But like England, mental health remains the poor cousin compared to the spending on physical ailments. The promise of investment has also been accompanied by a desire to reshape services - and particularly how quickly we can access them. The government established the first set of waiting time targets for the NHS in England in 2016. They mean the health service should be providing access to talking therapies within 18 weeks and treatment for those experiencing their first episode of psychosis within two weeks for at least half of people. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all have their own targets too. But drugs are still the most common form of treatment. The number of medicines dispensed for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks has almost doubled in the past 10 years. An increase in the numbers of people getting antidepressants is clearly a factor. But so too is the fact prescribing patterns have changed. Doctors are much more likely to keep people on drugs for longer with evidence suggesting it is a more effective way of treating patients. But as common as antidepressants are, the fact remains the majority of people with mental illness report they are not getting help. Only one in three of those polled said they were receiving treatment, according to NHS Digital. With the high rates of non-treatment in mind, it perhaps should not come as a surprise that there is an upwards trend in England in the number of people being detained under the Mental Health Act. Campaigners say patients in crisis are given just enough treatment to stabilise them before being sent home too early to ease pressure on beds. What happens then? They suffer another crisis and are detained again. So some people spend years being detained over and over again without ever getting well. The pressure on the system also manifests itself in long journeys for treatment. Last year a major report looked at the issue and pointed to thousands of people being sent more than 30 miles for services like acute care, psychiatric intensive care or rehabilitation. In some rural areas, of course, travelling long distances is not that uncommon for all sorts of care. But that's not the point, said the report.  Far too many people in towns and cities, where services should be easier to access, are affected, and the situation was ""unacceptable"". Everyone knows it's a problem.  Nobody likes it, and it can be massively disruptive for patients and their families. Yet an awful lot of sufferers of mental ill health travel a long, long way to get treatment. And, according to the British Medical Association, things are getting worse not better. In fact, it says, there's been a ""startling rise"" in the number of patients being sent out of area for treatment, a rise of nearly 40% between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to 5,876 adults. One patient they found had been sent from Somerset to the Highlands, a journey of 587 miles. The use of police cells for people in mental health crisis has attracted huge disquiet, not least among officers themselves. In a rare public statement of concern from a senior police chief, Devon and Cornwall Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton tweeted ""#unacceptable"" when a 16-year-old girl was held for two days in a cell in 2015 because no beds were available. That caused quite a stir among officers, patients and distraught families who felt that police cells were the last place someone in a health crisis should be held. But now the use of police cells is down - at least in England and Wales, though figures in Scotland suggest it may have gone up. In England and Wales it has fallen by more than half from 4,500 in 2014-15 to just over 2,000 in 2015-16,  according to the National Police Chiefs' Council. The NPCC also says the downward change is even bigger for under 18s to just 43 cases in 2015-16. But perhaps the most promising development in terms of mental health is the changing attitude towards mental illness. A public campaign called Time to Change was launched in 2009 by leading charities Mind and Rethink. It has been supported by the lottery and government along the way - and seems to be working. Latest results from the National Attitudes to Mental Illness Survey, released in May, showed people's willingness to work, live with and live nearby someone with a mental health problem has been improving in England. Campaigners have described the progress as wonderful but warn against complacency. Despite the improvements, nearly nine in 10 people who have had mental health problems report they have suffered stigma and discrimination. For all the positives, there's a long way to go, it seems.

What happened in the city that banned Uber?,"Within 24 hours of losing a public vote, Uber had left Austin Uber's new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will be in the UK on Tuesday for a meeting with Transport for London (TfL). He hopes the negotiations will stop the imminent revoking of his companyâs license to run its ride-sharing business in the capital. When TfL, backed by Mayor Sadiq Khan, announced Uber would no longer be allowed to operate, the service's 3.5m users, and 40,000 drivers, were aghast. Despite the very best efforts of the cab trade, Uber has become a valued way for Londoners to get around, particularly late at night. The same was true in Austin, Texas. Itâs a city that shares few similarities with London, other than its own bitter tussle with Uber - the fallout from which could contain clues as to what might happen if, and it's a big if, TfL follows through with its threat. Uber had been available in Austin since 2014. But on 10 May 2016, Uber (and rival service Lyft) turned off their apps and left. Less than 24 hours earlier, Austinites had gone to the polls to vote on Proposition 1. It was a law that removed a requirement on ride-sharing companies to gather fingerprints as part of their background checks on drivers, as well as sharing more data with city officials. Uber didn't want to do this. It argued that the fingerprint database drivers would be cross-checked against would be ineffective. It's also likely - though Uber never expressed this publicly - that adding a layer to the sign-up process would make it more time-consuming, and expensive, to recruit drivers. It's something the company, in all the markets it works in, constantly seeks to avoid - and in Austin it was prepared to spend big to avoid the restrictions. David Butts, a political consultant who campaigned against Uber during the dispute, estimates that the firm spent more than $10m (Â£7.5m) fighting city officials. âWe have never seen a campaign that spent that much money, for anything,â he said. Uber did not respond to the BBCâs request to comment on this story. Whatever the size of the lobbying bill, it wasnât enough. Mr Khosrowshahi said Uberâs poor corporate reputation may have been a factor in TfL's thinking, and the same may have been true for Austinâs voters, according to Ben Wear, a reporter for the Austin American-Statesman. Uber's chief executive will be in London to discuss TfL's concerns over his company ""I think a lot of people that actually actively used their service here in Austin voted against them, knowing that theyâd leave, because of the corporate behaviour that at that time had gone on for about two years. ""They showed up and basically ignored the cityâs rules."" And so just like that, Uber and Lyft were gone. Andy Tryba and his team got to work.  ""We basically stayed up all night for about four weeks or so to kind of get it up and going,"" he told me. âItâs to my knowledge the worldâs only non-profit version of ride-share.â He's the co-founder of Ride Austin, a locally developed app that stepped in to take Uberâs place - one of about 11 eventual alternatives that popped up in the weeks and months after Uber's disappearance. Unlike Uber and Lyft, which take a percentage of a rideâs final fare, RideAustin takes a fixed $2 fee, regardless of how long or far the journey. Riders are offered the chance to round up their fare and donate the extra amount to a number of charities - it has so far raised over $250,000. âThere were 125,000 a week or so that were occurring in the city when Uber and Lyft were operating here. Obviously, the day that they pulled out there was a bit of an adjustment period. âBut within a few weeks, there were several players that came into town. Very quickly that total number of rides were filled by those other players.â There were teething problems with these new apps, said Mike Allen, who has driven in Austin for almost two years. âIt was a fun challenge to get them to a point where they were able to work for us as drivers,â he said. ""But we got there."" The real test came when it was time for the most famous event in Austinâs calendar - South by Southwest. The tech, music and film festival draws thousands to the city every year, and in 2017 it presented the new apps with their biggest challenge yet in handling the demand. South by Southwest attracts thousands every year - including Barack Obama in 2016 That challenge grew too great on the middle Saturday of the festival, when as afternoon rolled into evening, it started to pour down with rain. I was among those hopelessly opening up apps trying to find one that was still working. RideAustin buckled, as too did Fasten, another app that had moved into the city when Uber left. ""Technical issues are just part and parcel of tech businesses,"" said Vlad Christoff, co-founder of Fasten. âWe had braced for a 10x increaseâ¦ we got 17x. Yes - we had a little bit of a hiccup!â But by June, Uber and Lyft were back. There hadnât been a compromise on security or data. Instead, state power in Texas overruled Austinâs local decision by creating statewide rules on ride-sharing that did not insist on fingerprint checks. Within a week, one Austin app, Fare, had folded. RideAustin saw its bookings drop by 55% - and it hasnât ever recovered. The local apps all maintain that they have plenty of drivers, who make more money on their apps per trip than Uber or Lyft. And though it's difficult to measure independently, the fares are the same or cheaper too. Which makes you wonder - why did users go back to Uber and Lyft? ""They are very good at leveraging their cash position to do lots of free rides and promotions to get their share back,"" Mr Tryba said. Fastenâs Mr Christoff thinks brand recognition beyond the city is the problem. âThe part that weâve lost is visitors. For one year people landed at Austinâs airport, and they found out the hard way that the default ride-sharing apps on their phone didnât work. ""Once Uber and Lyft came back, business continued as usual. [But] the locals stayed with us.â Drivers too have turned more frequently to Uber and Lyft instead of the smaller apps. ""It boils down to the quantity of rides,"" says Mr Allen. ""When youâre getting 10 requests on Uber to every one request on RideAustin, youâve got to go to where the rides are. Right now Uber is paying me the most money, but per ride RideAustin is the best."" I think it's unlikely that Uber's troubles in London will reach such a breaking point that the company ends up being forced off the streets. The appeal process keeps it on the road for the foreseeable future, and when dealing with city officials, Uberâs new CEO Mr Khosrowshahi has hinted at an ever-so-slightly more understanding approach than the man he replaced, Travis Kalanick. If Uber does leave, there are already a number of apps already in play (not to mention black cabs) that would seek to pick up the extra business - and the orphaned drivers. Both RideAustin and Fasten said they would consider looking at London as a new market for them, but had no immediate plans. âThere is life after Uber,â Mr Christoff said. For political consultant David Butts, who worked with Austin City Council on the issue, the entire dispute speaks to a bigger problem of billionaire-backed start-ups believing they are free to dictate the rules. To city officials in London, he says: ""Stand up to them.â ""Donât cave in. Theyâre not as strong. Make the case to people: do you want a corporation dictating to the City of London?â ______ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres under fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Birmingham's commonwealth touch,"The distinctive design of Birmingham Selfridges - worth an eight-page souvenir pullout? The Qatar World Cup was due to be the context in which TV audiences existed in the summer of 2022 - wall charts and stickers, the lot. But then concerns over the searing heat kicked in and the tournament was shifted to winter. What, then, instead for those from four-and-a-half years into the future missing out on a spot of sport with their after-work ciders, sipped in short sleeves? Whose prowess could pub sages and armchair fans possibly debate? Step in the 2022 Commonwealth Games to punctuate those longer evenings. Where Qatar was concerned, audiences would have been overwhelmed with colour pieces about the country - a host nation, and its cities, tending to capture the imagination. But can the same eight-page pullout flattery be levelled at Birmingham? Spaghetti Junction looking loopy It is the UK choice for the Games' host city, and on Friday cleared another hurdle to nudge itcloser to that ultimate prize. But can England's middle child - neither London nor Manchester - ever pique the interest of audiences domestic and international? And what might one find out about Digbeth as opposed to Doha? It turns out there is more there than abendy traffic interchange named after pasta. There is more - to reference recent notoriety - than abacklog of bin bagsin a city that once thought a bid to be an Olympic host should look like this... This video can not be played According to this song, bringing the 1992 Olympic Games to Birmingham would be ""the best thing that anybody could do"". In fact, it might be fair, as of 2017, to call it boomtown Brum, at least in terms of investment and shifting national perception. The area seemed on to something when more people leaving London moved to Birmingham than any other UK city -Londoners gave their reasons here. And to help with those heading a little bit north, the BBC createdthis handy survival guide, advising sophisticates how to navigate a network of canals, public transport called the ""buzz"" and those riding the ""buzz"" who might call you ""bab"". Could Commonwealth hipsters survive in Birmingham? Speaking of public transport, conditions remain favourable for Birmingham's popularity. High-speed rail line HS2 is set to link London to the second city in a way that will kill boxset-watching time, albeit a few years after a 2022 javelin is thrown in anger. Against this backdrop, HSBC bank announced anHQ relocation from London to Birmingham, with about 1,000 jobs set to be transferred and the bank describing its new home as a ""growing city"" with ""expertise and infrastructure"". And away from commercial property, house prices in theWest Midlands are among those experiencing the biggest increaseas prices in the south east fall. Combined, all this might not amount to Birmingham becoming a London borough by the back door, no matter how many references are made to a symphony orchestra, ballet, Michelin stars and international class stadia. But it remains the case that Birmingham is seeing significant investment, and with it, a changing look that flies in the face of assumptions of a pasta-themed concrete jungle. New buildings such as the Library of Birmingham have seen the city's landscape change Earlier in 2017, Deloitte saida ""record number"" of new developments across all sectors meant Birmingham was enjoying ""a well-deserved boom"", with Marketing Birmingham's boss adding the city was ""embarking on an unprecedented construction spree"" to meet ""record demand created by new and relocating businesses"". Among the projects have been a revamp of New Street Station and the shopping centre above it, Grand Central - Â£600m and Â£150m schemes respectively. Grand Central formed part of redevelopment totalling Â£750m But numbers cannot do all the talking. What do locals think visitors to the Games would make of Birmingham? ""Birmingham is getting more international"" - Kevin Cunningham ""Every year Birmingham is getting more international and in 10 years it'll be an amazing city,"" said Kevin Cunningham. ""When people come, I think they'll be surprised by Birmingham's diversity but also its history."" Ramavtar and Martin think the Games could change views on Birmingham Ramavtar saw even more potential, and something of possibly greater value than the economic bounce he expected: ""It'd be perfect, people would get to see more of Birmingham."" And for Martin, it is seeing that is believing: ""There's been a misconception of Birmingham and there's a certain stereotype, but a lot of people haven't even been here.""

Why French readers now know when models are Photoshopped,"It's no secret that images of models are often retouched to make their bodies look thinner or curvier in certain places, to lengthen their legs to mannequin-esque proportions, or to smooth out their skin and widen their eyes. From Sunday, in France, any commercial image that has been digitally altered to make a model look thinner will have a cigarette-packet style warning on it. ""Photographie retouchÃ©e"", it will say, which translates to ""edited photograph"". Anyone flouting the new rule could be fined â¬37,500 (Â£33,000) or 30% of the cost of creating the ad. The government is essentially trying to tackle persistent image-doctoring as a public health issue. It's hoped the change will help tackle extreme thinness among models, and body image problems among those who aspire to shapes they cannot hope to live up to because they were faked on a computer programme. ""Exposing young people to normative and unrealistic images of bodies leads to a sense of self-depreciation and poor self-esteem that can impact health-related behaviour,"" Health Minister Marisol Touraine said. France is not the first country to introduce these kinds of rules. Israel, for example, has already done so. But thinness gets a lot of attention in France. Cannes accused of slimming down classic 1959 actress photo Tens of thousands of people in the country suffer from anorexia and the average body mass index (BMI) - a measure used to determine if someone is underweight or overweight - is the lowest in Europe. In one new book, author Gabrielle Deydier makes the case that thinness is revered in her country, and fatness despised. She even lost her job in a school, she says, after a colleague took exception to her obesity. Another time, in a job interview, she was shocked to hear her interviewer say it was ""well-known"" that fatter people had lower IQs. The BBC's Tulip Mazumdar got her photos airbrushed - it made her feel she looked ""old, tired and a bit chubby"" in the originals Could a change in the way advertisements are presented make a difference to how French people see their bodies? It's a concept not entirely rejected by Tom Quinn of UK eating disorders charity Beat. He told the BBC: ""It's simplistic to suggest that looking at Photoshopped images will cause eating disorders. But many people who look at altered images have low self esteem. Tulip Mazumdar: What does it feel like to be airbrushed? ""We support any measures that contribute to a society having a healthier view of body types and everyone being more aware of which pictures have been touched up. ""Moving towards a society where there isn't the same pressure on models and the general public to be as thin as possible will be very welcome."" The veteran lecturer and campaigner Jean Kilbourne, author of Deadly Persuasion: Why Women and Girls Must Fight the Power of Advertising, has said: ""Ads sell more than products. ""They sell values, they sell images, they sell concepts of love and sexuality, of success, and perhaps most important, of normalcy. ""To a great extent, they tell us who we are and who we should be."" This video can not be played Anorexia survivor Shannon is campaigning for shops in the UK to use mannequins that reflect a healthy weight because people compare themselves to them Dr Terri Apter, psychologist and author of The Confident Child, told the BBC that while she felt ""this kind of culture"" could change, things seemed to be moving very slowly. ""There's not less anorexia than there was 25 years ago, for all the effort that many people have put in,"" she said. While the French change ""in and of itself"" won't ""have a big impact on the culture"", it will protect models, she adds. This is not the only thing the French government has done recently to try and tackle excessive thinness in the country's world-leading fashion industry. Since May, models have had to show a doctor's note to prove they are healthy, and some top companies have banned super-thin models. But it's important to remember that there are other tricks of the trade besides Photoshop alteration. Posing a certain way, taking a photo from a certain angle, lighting well or just sucking your tummy in can make a model look very different in a very short time. This applies both to thinness and the current trend of athletic-looking bodies, flat stomachs, and larger, squat-honed, buttocks. Allow Instagram content?

Catalonia referendum defies Spanish obstruction,"This video can not be played Students have declared a pro-independence ""strike"" A nation, a Spanish region, an aspiring independent state: however you define it, Catalonia has become a byword in Spain for controversy and political conflict. Now, the deadlock between Catalonia's devolved government, which wants independence, and Spain's central government, which has always ruled out a vote on the issue, has reached a critical moment. There is the surreal. Tweetie Pie, the yellow Warner Bros cartoon bird known here as PiolÃ­n, adorns a cruise ship parked in Barcelona port. There are no tourists on board the huge floating hotel, just thousands of national Spanish police. This ship, decorated bizarrely with cartoon character Tweetie Pie, is one of three chartered to house extra Spanish police But there is an underlying and deadly serious message, too. The boat's occupants are the guardians of Spanish territorial integrity. No-one questions where their loyalties lie. Then there is the confusing. Catalonia's government, or Generalitat as it is known locally, promises the vote will happen. However, a proper election campaign has been strikingly absent. With children back at home for the weekend will schools quickly turn into voting stations, or will they remain closed? And there is the downright baffling. Catalonia's own police force, Mossos d'Esquadra, in theory should - if they follow the letter of Spanish law - work alongside national Spanish police and stop the vote from happening. But it is the Mossos' colleagues and friends at the Generalitat who are keeping the pro-independence dream of a referendum alive. The vote has stoked tension between Spain's Guardia Civil (L) and the Catalan Mossos d'Esquadra Catalan police are stuck between a rock of Spanish court orders to stop the vote and a hard place of Catalan nationalist desires for it to go ahead. If police physically stop people from voting, will this maintain public order or encourage trouble on the streets? Fearing a backlash, the Spanish government has stopped short of suspending the powers of the Catalan government. But it has tightened its grip on Catalonia's finances. How Spain is battling to halt Catalan vote Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Spain's distinctive north-eastern region In such uncharted waters, opinion polls about both independence and the idea of a vote suddenly feel outdated. So, what I can offer are my perceptions based on the many people I have met in Catalonia over the past month, and during the four years when I lived in Spain, when Catalan nationalism evolved into a potent force. For the record, this is anecdotal evidence, not scientific political data. First, an army-sized, highly motivated chunk of Catalan society will at least try to vote on Sunday. The chaotic nature of Sunday's poll means many No-supporters will stay away. And so a majority of those who turn out will almost certainly be impassioned supporters of independence. The opinions of these people have been well documented on the BBC over the past two weeks. Others, like Silvia Gomez, who has family from two other Spanish regions, AndalucÃ­a and AragÃ³n, admit that giving up 38 years of Spanish nationality would be a difficult call. However she is tempted to vote Yes, for the same reasons as Cristina Caparros, who designs boats in Barcelona's port. Cristina inclines towards independence because she disapproves of Spain's centre-right Popular Party government. ""I don't want to belong to this country any moreâ¦ I think we can make a better, new country,"" she told me. This video can not be played Why some Catalans want independence I suggested to Spanish Education Minister IÃ±igo Mendez de Vigo that the stubborn negotiating tactics of his government, and sometimes less-than-diplomatic language on the Catalan issue, had driven more people into the pro-independence camp. Past corruption cases, linked to his party, appeared to add fuel to an already-burning fire. He simply ruled out any possibility of a legitimate Catalan vote on Sunday. ""In order to hold a referendum you need the ballot, an administrative organisation - nothing exists. So there will be no [public] consultation on Sunday,"" he told me. ""There isn't a consensus in order to change the Spanish constitution, so this is why the Catalan government goes unilaterally. ""To dance the tango you need two and in this case the Spanish government was always ready to talk, but they didn't want to dance.  They only wanted to do things unilaterally and this is what the Spanish government will not accept."" There is another large, quieter and more ill-defined section of Catalan society, within which people have more nuanced opinions. Fisherman Luis TallÃ³, 54, has always considered himself ""very Catalan, but not pro-independence"". But he is still demanding that the Spanish government allow a proper referendum. His colleague, JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez, who buys seafood in bulk straight from the boats, says his and other families are so split on the issue that it is no longer a comfortable topic at the dinner table. Originally from MÃ¡laga in the south of Spain, he has lived in Barcelona for 66 years. He is one of many people I have met in recent weeks favouring a referendum ""done correctly"" - but not the type of vote expected to take place on Sunday. JosÃ© says he protested and voted in a referendum in favour of more autonomy for Catalonia, before Spain's courts blocked the initiative, at the behest of the Popular Party, in 2010. But he blames the pro-independence movement for ""dividing Catalan society"". ""If we want to stay friends, we cannot talk about politics anymore.""

The man who made Man Utd 'outcasts',"Charlie Roberts, pictured in 1912, founded the body that became the Professional Footballers' Association A footballer labelled Manchester United's ""first real star"" has been inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. But Charlie Roberts is now remembered more for his trade union activism off the pitch than his success on it. Roberts was an England international who captained the Red Devils to their first two league titles and their first FA Cup win in the years before World War One. He was also a campaigner for players' rights, founding football's first successful players' union and leading his team of self-declared ""outcasts"" to victory over the Football Association (FA). Born in County Durham in 1883, he had grown up among mining communities that were at the heart of the burgeoning trade union movement - an upbringing that would go on to influence his later career. His football talent took him to Manchester United in 1904 where his robust defending made him a fans' favourite. He was capped for England a year later and, over the next few years, captained the Red Devils to their first major trophies. The team was hit by one of football's forgotten tragedies, though, in April 1907. Scottish defender Tommy Blackstock, 25, collapsed and died on the pitch after heading a ball during United's match against St Helens. His death spurred Roberts and his teammate Billy Meredith - one of the game's early superstars - into action. Roberts' grandson Ted Roberts said: ""There was nothing available for Blackstock's family, and my grandfather was horrified that nothing was available. ""So they decided to do something about it."" Billy Meredith, known as ""the Welsh Wizard"", founded the union with Roberts Roberts and other star players were already unhappy about the FA's wage cap, which prevented clubs from paying players more than Â£4 a week - the equivalent of about Â£440 today. He believed ""footballers were working men like any others, and deserved to be treated fairly"", said football historian Dr Gary James. The pair founded the Association of Football Players' and Trainers' Union (AFPTU), popularly known as the Players' Union, with the aim of removing the the wage cap and winning footballers the same rights enjoyed by other workers. This worried the FA and club owners. Roberts (left) led Manchester United to a 1-0 victory over Bristol City in the 1909 FA Cup final ""Football was a business, just as it is now, and... clubs had to make money to pay their staff,"" said Dr James. ""The authorities didn't want the possibility of fixtures disappearing due to strikes."" Despite clubs' reservations, many footballers joined the AFPTU, and the FA reluctantly recognised it as the players' official representative body. This uneasy peace deal failed in spectacular fashion in 1909. A proposed transfer to Chesterfield saw Fulham's George Parsonage, who was not keen on making the move north, ask for more than the regulation signing-on fee of Â£10. Aghast at what they saw as an exorbitant request, the Derbyshire club reported Parsonage to the FA, who banned the midfielder for life. Roberts' 1909 FA Cup final shirt was sold for Â£30,000 in an auction in 2015 Born in Darlington in 1883, he started his playing career at Bishop Auckland and Grimsby Town before he was signed by United in 1904 for Â£400 He made 299 appearances, scored 23 goals and helped the team win their first Football League titles in 1908 and 1911 and their first FA Cup in 1909 He later worked as a tobacconist - the Ducrobel cigar was named after him and Manchester United teammates Dick Duckworth and Alex Bell He died aged 56 in 1939 In response, the AFPTU gathered a petition of 1,322 signatures. Fearing strike action, the FA demanded players resign from the union or face a life ban. While most left, Roberts' United teammates stood firm - and were promptly suspended by the club. A stand off between the club and players ensued. Roberts and his colleagues posed with a wooden sign calling themselves ""The Outcasts Football Club"". This photograph made the front pages of the next day's newspapers ""much to our enjoyment and the disgust of several of our enemies"", as Roberts later recalled. As the beginning of the 1909/10 season neared, the row had still not been resolved. Unable to put out a side, United contacted their first opponents, Bradford City, to discuss the possibility of a cancellation. However, the FA backed down and struck a deal which allowed union members to play in Football League matches. A scroll at the PFA's offices pays tribute to Charlie Roberts, who was captain in Manchester United's victorious 1909 FA Cup final Revenge was taken on Roberts, however. Although he went on to become one of the country's most expensive footballers when he moved to Oldham Athletic for Â£1,500 in 1913, he was frozen out by the FA. He never added to his three England caps won in 1905. The union survived and would later become the Professional Footballers' Association - which finally won its battle to abolish football's wage cap in 1961. Gordon Taylor, its long-serving chief executive, said modern multi-millionaire players should be aware of the role Roberts played. ""I think it's really important. They need to know the state of the profession they are in and the part that Charlie Roberts played,"" he said. ""By coming together and showing solidarity, Roberts and his teammates helped make the game attractive. They had big concerns. The profession of football was not even recognised at the time. ""Now we can be very proud that this country has got the most full-time professional clubs in the world.""

Activists occupy schools ahead of vote,"Pro-independence activists have occupied designated polling stations More than 160 schools in Catalonia have been occupied by activists trying to keep them open ahead of the region's banned independence referendum, Spain's central government says. Police visited 1,300 of the 2,315 schools in Catalonia designated as polling stations, finding 163 occupied. Tens of thousands of people are expected to attempt to vote on Sunday. Demonstrators also rallied in Barcelona on Saturday evening against the poll, calling instead for unity with Spain. Waving Spanish flags and carrying banners reading ""Catalonia is Spain"", thousands marched on the town hall. Meanwhile, Spanish authorities are stepping up their attempts to stop the ballot taking place. Authorities in Madrid have sent thousands of police to the region to stop the referendum - declared illegal by Spain's constitutional court.

French ads to warn when thinness is faked,"It's no secret that images of models are often retouched to make their bodies look thinner or curvier in certain places, to lengthen their legs to mannequin-esque proportions, or to smooth out their skin and widen their eyes. From Sunday, in France, any commercial image that has been digitally altered to make a model look thinner will have a cigarette-packet style warning on it. ""Photographie retouchÃ©e"", it will say, which translates to ""edited photograph"". Anyone flouting the new rule could be fined â¬37,500 (Â£33,000) or 30% of the cost of creating the ad. The government is essentially trying to tackle persistent image-doctoring as a public health issue. It's hoped the change will help tackle extreme thinness among models, and body image problems among those who aspire to shapes they cannot hope to live up to because they were faked on a computer programme. ""Exposing young people to normative and unrealistic images of bodies leads to a sense of self-depreciation and poor self-esteem that can impact health-related behaviour,"" Health Minister Marisol Touraine said. France is not the first country to introduce these kinds of rules. Israel, for example, has already done so. But thinness gets a lot of attention in France. Cannes accused of slimming down classic 1959 actress photo Tens of thousands of people in the country suffer from anorexia and the average body mass index (BMI) - a measure used to determine if someone is underweight or overweight - is the lowest in Europe. In one new book, author Gabrielle Deydier makes the case that thinness is revered in her country, and fatness despised. She even lost her job in a school, she says, after a colleague took exception to her obesity. Another time, in a job interview, she was shocked to hear her interviewer say it was ""well-known"" that fatter people had lower IQs. The BBC's Tulip Mazumdar got her photos airbrushed - it made her feel she looked ""old, tired and a bit chubby"" in the originals Could a change in the way advertisements are presented make a difference to how French people see their bodies? It's a concept not entirely rejected by Tom Quinn of UK eating disorders charity Beat. He told the BBC: ""It's simplistic to suggest that looking at Photoshopped images will cause eating disorders. But many people who look at altered images have low self esteem. Tulip Mazumdar: What does it feel like to be airbrushed? ""We support any measures that contribute to a society having a healthier view of body types and everyone being more aware of which pictures have been touched up. ""Moving towards a society where there isn't the same pressure on models and the general public to be as thin as possible will be very welcome."" The veteran lecturer and campaigner Jean Kilbourne, author of Deadly Persuasion: Why Women and Girls Must Fight the Power of Advertising, has said: ""Ads sell more than products. ""They sell values, they sell images, they sell concepts of love and sexuality, of success, and perhaps most important, of normalcy. ""To a great extent, they tell us who we are and who we should be."" This video can not be played Anorexia survivor Shannon is campaigning for shops in the UK to use mannequins that reflect a healthy weight because people compare themselves to them Dr Terri Apter, psychologist and author of The Confident Child, told the BBC that while she felt ""this kind of culture"" could change, things seemed to be moving very slowly. ""There's not less anorexia than there was 25 years ago, for all the effort that many people have put in,"" she said. While the French change ""in and of itself"" won't ""have a big impact on the culture"", it will protect models, she adds. This is not the only thing the French government has done recently to try and tackle excessive thinness in the country's world-leading fashion industry. Since May, models have had to show a doctor's note to prove they are healthy, and some top companies have banned super-thin models. But it's important to remember that there are other tricks of the trade besides Photoshop alteration. Posing a certain way, taking a photo from a certain angle, lighting well or just sucking your tummy in can make a model look very different in a very short time. This applies both to thinness and the current trend of athletic-looking bodies, flat stomachs, and larger, squat-honed, buttocks. Allow Instagram content?

Police boost efforts to stop Catalan vote,"Pro-independence activists have occupied designated polling stations More than 160 schools in Catalonia have been occupied by activists trying to keep them open ahead of the region's banned independence referendum, Spain's central government says. Police visited 1,300 of the 2,315 schools in Catalonia designated as polling stations, finding 163 occupied. Tens of thousands of people are expected to attempt to vote on Sunday. Demonstrators also rallied in Barcelona on Saturday evening against the poll, calling instead for unity with Spain. Waving Spanish flags and carrying banners reading ""Catalonia is Spain"", thousands marched on the town hall. Meanwhile, Spanish authorities are stepping up their attempts to stop the ballot taking place. Authorities in Madrid have sent thousands of police to the region to stop the referendum - declared illegal by Spain's constitutional court.

The illness one in six of us have,"At any one time, a sixth of the population in England aged 16 to 64 have a mental health problem, according to statistics body NHS Digital. Whether it is family or friends, neighbours or work colleagues, the chances are we all know someone who is affected. And bearing in mind the figure leaves out less common conditions and is a snapshot in time, you could easily argue it is even more prevalent than that. Indeed many do. With Prime Minister Theresa May expected to announce plans to improve care next week, these 10 charts show the extent of the challenge. It seems to be getting more common - or at least among those with severe symptoms. While the proportion of people affected does not appear to have risen in the past few years, if you go back a little further there has certainly been a steady increase. Evidence from the NHS Digital study in England shows the rise has been driven by an increase in women with illness. Why is this? Undoubtedly some of it is down to people being more willing to report and admit mental health problems. Experts point to the way self-harm in particular is recognised in a way it was not 20 or 30 years ago. But it is also clear 21st Century life is taking its toll on some people. Economic uncertainty, social media, the influence of the media and rising expectations of what life should be like have all been suggested as possible causes. Women are now much more likely to have a common mental illness. One in five report they have, compared with one in eight men in England. If you include only those with severe symptoms, the difference is less acute, but still apparent. Young people are particularly susceptible. A number of theories have been put forward for this. The economic uncertainty of the past decade has particularly affected the young, making it harder to get on the career ladder. And psychiatrists and mental health campaigners are increasingly raising questions about whether social media increases peer-group pressure and online bullying. Whatever the reason, the one thing experts are agreed on is that the figures are shocking. Mental health problems prompt thousands of people to take their own lives. In fact there are about 6,000 suicides in the UK each year and it's the biggest killer of men up to the age of 49. Men account for three-quarters of the total figure. The best overall measure is the number of suicides per 100,000 people.  That's because, with a rising population, the absolute figure is almost bound to go up.  Since the 1980s, the trend is down. There's quite a big national variation, with England having the lowest suicide rate and Northern Ireland the highest. Scotland and Wales have similar rates and are in the middle. As already mentioned, mental health problems are particularly common in the young in the UK. In fact, most mental health problems develop in childhood or when a person is a young adult. Three-quarters of problems are established by the age of 24. It is why there is such an emphasis at the moment on addressing childhood mental illness. In 2015, the government promised funding for child and adolescent mental health services would increase. Extra money has also been earmarked for adult services in England. Together with the investment in children's services it means by 2020-21 Â£1.28bn more should be spent in real terms than was in 2015-16. Ministers say the money will be used to put mental health services in A&E, more crisis teams in the community and a focus on helping new mothers, with one in five reporting problems in the first year after the birth of their baby. But an analysis last year by the King's Fund health think tank found 40% of mental health trusts in England had actually seen their budgets cut in 2015-16. The government is adamant things will change. They have to. While 23% of NHS activity is taken up by mental illness, mental health trusts have been receiving only about 11% of funding in recent years. Extra investment is being made in the other parts of the UK. Wales and Scotland have both recently unveiled new plans. But like England, mental health remains the poor cousin compared to the spending on physical ailments. The promise of investment has also been accompanied by a desire to reshape services - and particularly how quickly we can access them. The government established the first set of waiting time targets for the NHS in England in 2016. They mean the health service should be providing access to talking therapies within 18 weeks and treatment for those experiencing their first episode of psychosis within two weeks for at least half of people. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all have their own targets too. But drugs are still the most common form of treatment. The number of medicines dispensed for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks has almost doubled in the past 10 years. An increase in the numbers of people getting antidepressants is clearly a factor. But so too is the fact prescribing patterns have changed. Doctors are much more likely to keep people on drugs for longer with evidence suggesting it is a more effective way of treating patients. But as common as antidepressants are, the fact remains the majority of people with mental illness report they are not getting help. Only one in three of those polled said they were receiving treatment, according to NHS Digital. With the high rates of non-treatment in mind, it perhaps should not come as a surprise that there is an upwards trend in England in the number of people being detained under the Mental Health Act. Campaigners say patients in crisis are given just enough treatment to stabilise them before being sent home too early to ease pressure on beds. What happens then? They suffer another crisis and are detained again. So some people spend years being detained over and over again without ever getting well. The pressure on the system also manifests itself in long journeys for treatment. Last year a major report looked at the issue and pointed to thousands of people being sent more than 30 miles for services like acute care, psychiatric intensive care or rehabilitation. In some rural areas, of course, travelling long distances is not that uncommon for all sorts of care. But that's not the point, said the report.  Far too many people in towns and cities, where services should be easier to access, are affected, and the situation was ""unacceptable"". Everyone knows it's a problem.  Nobody likes it, and it can be massively disruptive for patients and their families. Yet an awful lot of sufferers of mental ill health travel a long, long way to get treatment. And, according to the British Medical Association, things are getting worse not better. In fact, it says, there's been a ""startling rise"" in the number of patients being sent out of area for treatment, a rise of nearly 40% between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to 5,876 adults. One patient they found had been sent from Somerset to the Highlands, a journey of 587 miles. The use of police cells for people in mental health crisis has attracted huge disquiet, not least among officers themselves. In a rare public statement of concern from a senior police chief, Devon and Cornwall Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton tweeted ""#unacceptable"" when a 16-year-old girl was held for two days in a cell in 2015 because no beds were available. That caused quite a stir among officers, patients and distraught families who felt that police cells were the last place someone in a health crisis should be held. But now the use of police cells is down - at least in England and Wales, though figures in Scotland suggest it may have gone up. In England and Wales it has fallen by more than half from 4,500 in 2014-15 to just over 2,000 in 2015-16,  according to the National Police Chiefs' Council. The NPCC also says the downward change is even bigger for under 18s to just 43 cases in 2015-16. But perhaps the most promising development in terms of mental health is the changing attitude towards mental illness. A public campaign called Time to Change was launched in 2009 by leading charities Mind and Rethink. It has been supported by the lottery and government along the way - and seems to be working. Latest results from the National Attitudes to Mental Illness Survey, released in May, showed people's willingness to work, live with and live nearby someone with a mental health problem has been improving in England. Campaigners have described the progress as wonderful but warn against complacency. Despite the improvements, nearly nine in 10 people who have had mental health problems report they have suffered stigma and discrimination. For all the positives, there's a long way to go, it seems.

Suspected 'baby food extortionist' held,"It is not clear if the arrested person is the same man who appeared in security video footage in a supermarket near Konstanz Police in Germany have arrested a man on suspicion of contaminating adult and baby food in the hope of gaining millions of euros from supermarkets. The unnamed man, 55, was taken into custody on Friday evening in the TÃ¼bingen area south of Stuttgart. Police on Thursday released images of a suspect in a supermarket near Konstanz. Earlier this month retailers received an email threatening that food across Europe would be poisoned unless â¬11.7m ($13.8m; Â£10.3m) was paid. Several jars of baby food that had been contaminated with a liquid used in anti-freeze were subsequently recovered by police. The jars contained ethylene glycol, an odourless and colourless toxic liquid that has a sweet taste and is known to attract children and animals. There were no reports of any injuries. The suspect was reportedly arrested by police travelling in a helicopter following tip-offs from the public. Police say their suspicions about the man have now strengthened, and they will release more information later. It is unclear whether he is the same man as in the photo or whether contaminated food is still in circulation. Supermarket customers are being urged by authorities to remain on the look-out for tampered goods,Die Welt reported.,external Officials have not said which retailers were targeted. They said that while there was no need to panic, shoppers should remain vigilant.

Police seal off Catalan polling stations,"Pro-independence activists have occupied designated polling stations More than 160 schools in Catalonia have been occupied by activists trying to keep them open ahead of the region's banned independence referendum, Spain's central government says. Police visited 1,300 of the 2,315 schools in Catalonia designated as polling stations, finding 163 occupied. Tens of thousands of people are expected to attempt to vote on Sunday. Demonstrators also rallied in Barcelona on Saturday evening against the poll, calling instead for unity with Spain. Waving Spanish flags and carrying banners reading ""Catalonia is Spain"", thousands marched on the town hall. Meanwhile, Spanish authorities are stepping up their attempts to stop the ballot taking place. Authorities in Madrid have sent thousands of police to the region to stop the referendum - declared illegal by Spain's constitutional court. The Madrid government hasordered the Catalan regional police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, to assist them. Many of the extra officers drafted in are stationed in two ships in the port of Barcelona. Police have also occupied the regional government's telecommunications centre. This video can not be played Tom Burridge reports from one of the designated polling stations for the banned independence referendum Police have also been ordered to clear schools occupied by activists aiming to ensure the buildings can be used for voting. Spanish government sources quoted by Reuters said police would decide for themselves how to enforce orders to stop people voting. The head of the Catalan police has urged officers to avoid using force. Many of those inside the schools are parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday. Some told Reuters news agency that police had told them they could stay as long as they were not doing anything connected to Sunday's vote. Why these are uncharted waters for Spain Spain's moved to halt Catalan vote Laia, a 41-year-old sociologist who is staying in a Barcelona school this evening, said the police had visited four times. ""They read us out the part of the court order that says no activities related to the preparation of the banned referendum are allowed,"" she told Reuters. This video can not be played Why some Catalans want independence - and others don't Catalonia, a wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain, has its own language and culture. It also has a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution. Pressure for a vote on self-determination has grown over the past five years as austerity has hit the Spanish economy and people hard. Thousands attended a demonstration in favour of Spanish unity in Barcelona on Saturday But Spanish unionists argue Catalonia already enjoys broad autonomy within Spain, along with other regions like the Basque Country and Galicia. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Spain's distinctive north-eastern region Officers have been visiting the locations due to be used as polling stations, as well as seizing items such as ballot papers, while prosecutors have ordered the closure of websites linked to the vote and the arrest of officials organising the referendum. But Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont told Reuters that the referendum would go ahead. ""Everything is prepared at the more than 2,000 voting points so they have ballot boxes and voting slips, and have everything people need to express their opinion,"" he said. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy stared down Catalan secessionists when they held a trial referendum in 2014, offering no concessions to their demand for a legal vote. He has pledged to stop the 2017 vote, saying it goes againstthe constitution,externalwhich refers to ""the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards"". Central government spokesman IÃ±igo Mendez de Vigo accused the Catalan government of being inflexible and one-sided but it is a charge Catalan nationalists throw back at Madrid itself. Despite the tension in the region, demonstrations by independence campaigners have been largely peaceful. ""I don't believe there will be anyone who will use violence or who will want to provoke violence that will tarnish the irreproachable image of the Catalan independence movement as pacifist,"" Mr Puigdemont said.

Johnson urges two-year Brexit transition,"Theresa May is coming under fresh pressure over Brexit on the eve of the Conservative party conference. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has again intervened on Brexit, setting out four conditions he says are necessary. Speaking to the Sun,external, Mr Johnson insisted any transition period after Britain leaves the EU should not last ""a second more"" than two years. Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson's position threatened a trade war with the EU, which could impact on jobs. The prime minister will be seeking to reassert her authority as she goes into her first party conference since she lost her government's majority in the general election. It also comes after six months of Brexit negotiations in which there has been no significant breakthrough. Ruth Davidson warns of Brexit 'over-optimism' Countdown to Brexit: UK imports and exports in six charts Frictionless borders: learning from Norway BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake says Mrs May must take the agenda back to her priority: the economy. Our correspondent says the timing of Mr Johnson's latest comments was ""no accident"", coming as Conservatives gather in Manchester for their annual conference, which starts on Sunday. In his interview with the Sun, Mr Johnson called for four conditions for Brexit, which were then described by the paper as his ""four red lines"": Transition period must be a maximum of two years UK must refuse to accept new EU rules during that period No payments for access to the single market after the end of the transition period UK must not agree to shadow EU rules to gain access to the single market Mr Johnson said: ""The crucial thing I want to get over to Sun readers about Brexit is that it is going to be great and we need to believe in ourselves and believe we can do it. It is unstoppable."" He also touched on other subjects in the interview - calling for a faster increase in the minimum wage and for public sector pay rises. While he dismissed suggestions of any leadership ambitions, his comments are likely to fuel speculation that he is still positioning himself for the top job. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the foreign secretary's comments sent a signal to EU negotiators that the ""strings were being pulled by others"". ""Senior Conservatives are displaying an abject failure to act together in the national interest and seem more motivated by selfish, personal ambition."" However, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government was determined to deliver the ""best possible outcome for Britain"". ""What you're hearing from leading Conservatives, in my view, is simply that commitment,"" he said. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent in Manchester As Conservative activists begin to flood the Mancunian streets, their mood will be set by the gap between previous expectation and contemporary reality. The anticipated leap forward to a greater majority at the election; the truth, a humiliating reverse - an emotional defeat despite a mathematical victory of sorts. And, for a contrite prime minister, confronting the party faithful for the first time since the result, it's a second weekend this month where her foreign secretary has upstaged her. Theresa May has acknowledged to party members the election outcome was ""disappointing"" and will strive to ensure the debate about Brexit doesn't drown out an opportunity to be heard discussing domestic priorities. Meanwhile Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, forever keen to illustrate his upbeat party is on a permanent election footing, spent the day campaigning in marginal Thurrock, in Essex. Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has attacked the ""over-optimism"" of Brexiteerstelling the Times,externalthat it ""sells people short"". Mr Johnson's interview comes just a week afterMrs May's major speech on Brexitin Florence and is the second recent intervention by her cabinet minister. He previouslyoutlined his ""vision""in an article for the Daily Telegraph, which prompted Mrs May to say: ""This government is driven from the front."" Theresa May, pictured meeting Nato troops in Estonia on Friday, wants to make Britain fairer for the young Mrs May said that, while she was focused on getting the best deal with the EU, she was also committed to making Britain fairer - in particular for the younger generation. ""I understand the concerns raised, particularly by young people,"" she said. ""My determination to act on those concerns, and crucially, to fulfil the promise of my first speech on the steps of Downing Street, is greater than ever."" Theresa May 'driving from front' on Brexit 'May speech not changed by Boris Johnson article' The call from Mr Johnson comes as other Eurosceptic Tory MPs have said the UK should walk away from Brexit talks by Christmas unless the EU shows it is serious about a free trade deal. The Leave Means Leave campaign has urged Mrs May to speed up talks with the EU. The group - which includes ex-minister Owen Paterson - said the prime minister should not be afraid of a ""no deal"" scenario. In a letter to Mrs May, they say: ""To delay the end of the transition period until after the projected 2022 general election could jeopardise the entire Brexit programme."" Mrs May must make clear that British courts must no longer be bound by European Court of Justice rulings after the moment of withdrawal and that the UK will be free to negotiate, sign and implement trade deals with other countries during the transitional phase, the group argues.

Trump criticises Puerto Rico leadership,"This video can not be played Mayor Cruz gave a news conference on Friday: ""Mayday, we are in trouble"" Donald Trump has lashed out at Puerto Rico politicians over their criticism of US relief efforts on the island following Hurricane Maria. The category four hurricane a week ago killed 16 people on the island and left millions in need of aid. In a series of tweets, Trump said that Puerto Rican officials showed ""poor leadership ability"" and ""want everything to be done for them"". It comes after the Mayor of San Juanmade a desperate pleafor federal help. ""We have no time for patience any more,"" Carmen Yulin Cruz said in a news conference. ""I am asking the president of the United States to make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives. ""I am done being polite. I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell."" This video can not be played Signal loss: Why Puerto Rico is suffering in silence She then appeared in a T-shirt that said ""Help us, we're dying"" for a CNN television interview. Does Trump care about Puerto Rico's hurricane victims? The mayor, who is living in a shelter after her home was destroyed, said Puerto Rico is set to be without power for six to eight months after the storm damaged 90% of homes on the island. More bad weather is in the offing, with the National Weather Service in San Juan warning that a strong thunderstorm would imminently affect the east of the island, with torrential rain and strong winds expected. Almost half the island's 3.4 million population are without drinking water, the US Defence Department said on Thursday. Efforts are being made on the island to clear road access and restore hospitals to working conditions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a series of tweets on Saturday morning, Trump suggested the mayor had been told ""to be nasty to Trump"" by his Democratic opposition. He also said he would visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday with the First Lady, Melania. It follows widespread criticism of his administration's response to the hurricane. Responding to Trump's tweets in an interview the mayor said: ""I was asking for help. I wasn't saying anything nasty about the president."" The San Juan mayor has been vocal about the island's need for federal aid ""I will continue to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, compliment the people that I have to compliment, and call out the people that I need to call out. ""This isn't about me. This isn't about anyone. This is about lives that are being lost."" Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Puerto Rico We visited a school in LoÃ­za, just to the east of the capital, that had become a makeshift hurricane shelter. Nobody there had heard of the row between Donald Trump and the mayor of San Juan. They had, after all, no phone signals, no internet, no television and had much more pressing things to think about. Most had lost their homes and any belongings they had not managed to grab before Hurricane Maria struck. They told us they finally received mattresses to sleep on a full nine days after the hurricane, after having slept on the bare concrete of the classrooms until then. They said they had been visited by an official from the Federal Emergency Management Agency only on this, the 10th day. These people are in accessible areas close to the capital. There are fears about many in remote areas still waiting to be reached. On Thursday the President announced shipping restrictions had been lifted to help provide aid to the island. The US military general in charge of the relief operation said on Friday that about 4,500 troops were already involved. This video can not be played 'No power for 6-8 months' in Puerto Rico The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said 95% of the island remained without power and 55% of people did not yet have access to drinking water, but that most petrol stations had reopened. Concerns were raised on Thursday that thousands of shipping containers of aid were sitting in a San Juan undistributed. Ground transportation has been hindered by a lack of fuel and blocked roads. The US navy has deployed a hospital ship and has assigned engineers to repair the island's damaged power grid, the US Department of Defense said on Friday.

Star Wars filming 'turned down by Queen',"The Crown Estate said it was approached ""a few years ago"" by the Star Wars film franchise A Star Wars request to film on land owned by the Queen was turned down, it has been revealed. The Crown Estate said no to the film franchise when it wanted to film scenes at Windsor Great Park, Berkshire. An estate spokesman said the planned scenes were not suitable for the park, adding: ""Our head isn't turned by star names or star films."" Part of the 5,000-acre park was recently used for the new Winnie-the-Pooh film, Goodbye Christopher Robin. The Star Wars revelation came as the Crown Estate's head of commercial operations, Nick Day, spoke to the BBC about a forest in the park being used as the 100 Acre Wood, the home of Pooh and his chums. Obelisk Pond in Windsor Great Park was used in The Legend Of Tarzan Mr Day said: ""Star Wars was just such a huge thing that the risk for the park was just too great. ""The location they were interested in wasn't suitable for large numbers of people in there. ""Our priority is to maintain and protect Windsor Great Park and we can facilitate film crews if we're sure the risk to the park is minimal. ""But Star Wars is a huge machine, and there's also massive outside interest in those sort of things. It wasn't right for here."" He added Windsor Great Park, which has different areas including park land, forests and open farmland, is often a popular location for films being shot at nearby Pinewood Studios. He would not reveal the Star Wars film in question, out of discretion, but said he was approached ""a few years ago"". In recent years, the park's Obelisk Pond transformed into a part of the River Congo for The Legend Of Tarzan, and a farmer's field was used to film a rock concert scene in Bridget Jones's Baby. But Mr Day said he turns down at least ""eight out of 10"" film location requests, no matter how big budget the movie is. He said: ""If it doesn't work for here then, no matter who you are, I'm afraid that dollars, bright lights and names don't sway us."" New Winnie-the-Pooh character unveiled.

Archbishop criticises BBC over Savile,"Justin Welby criticised the BBC's integrity The Archbishop of Canterbury has criticised the way the BBC handled sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile. The Most Rev Justin Welby said the BBC had not shown the same integrity over accusations of child abuse that the Catholic and Anglican churches had. Abuse survivors disputed that, saying their experience was of ""long years of silence, denial and evasion"". The BBC said it did not recognise the accusation against the corporation, and had acted transparently over Savile. The archbishop was invited to contribute to a series on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, looking back at Britain over the past 60 years, to mark the programme's anniversary. He said: ""I think we are a kinder society more concerned with our own failures, more willing to be honest where we go wrong in most of our institutions."" But he added ""there are still dark areas"". When asked which, Mr Welby replied:  ""If I'm really honest, I'd say the BBC is one. ""I haven't seen the same integrity over the BBC's failures over Savile as I've seen in the Roman Catholic Church, in the Church of England, in other public institutions over abuse. ""We may be proved wrong about that but you know that's one area,"" he said. Jimmy Savile abused 72 victims connected to the BBC A group of six victims of abuse in the Church of England said they did not recognise the archbishop's description of ""integrity"" from their own ""bitter experience"". ""Far from the 'rigorous response and self-examination' he claims, our experience of the church, and specifically the archbishop, is of long years of silence, denial and evasion. ""The Church of England needs to confront its own darkness in relation to abuse before confronting the darkness of others."" Justin Humphreys, from the Churches Child Protection Advisory Service, said it was not always helpful to make comparisons between institutions. ""I think we run the risk of being accused of pointing the finger whilst we're not looking at our own backyard. ""However, I think it is reasonably well known that there are parallels that can be drawn between both the church, the BBC and other institutions that have been looked at for the same reasons as they have."" A retired judge, Dame Janet Smith,concluded in February 2016that Savile had 72 victims who were connected to the BBC. The offending took place from 1959 to 2006, mostly in the 1970s on the Top of the Pops programme, and the corporation missed opportunities to stop the abuse. A BBC spokesman said of the archbishop's comments: ""This isn't a characterisation we recognise.  When the Savile allegations became known we established an independent investigation by a High Court judge. ""In the interests of transparency, this was published in full.  We apologised and accepted all the recommendations. ""And while today's BBC is a different place, we set out very clear actions to ensure the highest possible standards of child safeguarding. The Church of England and Catholic Church have been connected to abuse Senior figures in both the Anglican and Catholic churches have been accused of abuse in recent years. A Vatican official, Cardinal George Pell, has beencharged with sex offences in his native Australia, but vehemently denies any wrongdoing. An independent review report of the crimes of the former Bishop of Gloucester, Peter Ball, published in 2017found senior figures in the Church of England had colluded with Ball. Mr Welby's predecessor as Archbishop, Lord Carey, resigned from an honorary position in the Diocese of Oxford following the report. A Lambeth Palace spokeswoman pointed out that since Mr Welby's appointment as archbishop, safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults had been made the ""highest priority"" and there were now ""robust"" policies, independent audits and dedicated training. She added: ""The archbishop believes this level of rigorous response and self-examination needs to extend to all institutions, including the BBC."" In his Radio 4 interview, Mr Welby also referred to the dispute about men's and women's pay at the BBC, pointing out that although women had only recently become bishops, senior men and women in the church now received the same pay. He said: ""We just think it's normal now whereas you listen to old radio programmes or TV programmes and you just shudder. ""I think with that sense of recognition of the importance of the individual of minorities, of profound care for minority rights, whether it's disabilities, black and minority ethnic, LGBT, different things, those are really healthy things."" A BBC spokesman said: ""The national gender pay gap is 18%.  The BBC's is under 10% and we have committed to closing it in 2020. ""The Church of England's own published pay gap for non-office holders is 41%. ""We all collectively have more work to do, to sort an issue that is a problem across the vast majority of organisations.""

May under renewed pressure over Brexit,"Theresa May is coming under fresh pressure over Brexit on the eve of the Conservative party conference. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has again intervened on Brexit, setting out four conditions he says are necessary. Speaking to the Sun,external, Mr Johnson insisted any transition period after Britain leaves the EU should not last ""a second more"" than two years. Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson's position threatened a trade war with the EU, which could impact on jobs. The prime minister will be seeking to reassert her authority as she goes into her first party conference since she lost her government's majority in the general election. It also comes after six months of Brexit negotiations in which there has been no significant breakthrough. Ruth Davidson warns of Brexit 'over-optimism' Countdown to Brexit: UK imports and exports in six charts Frictionless borders: learning from Norway BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake says Mrs May must take the agenda back to her priority: the economy. Our correspondent says the timing of Mr Johnson's latest comments was ""no accident"", coming as Conservatives gather in Manchester for their annual conference, which starts on Sunday. In his interview with the Sun, Mr Johnson called for four conditions for Brexit, which were then described by the paper as his ""four red lines"": Transition period must be a maximum of two years UK must refuse to accept new EU rules during that period No payments for access to the single market after the end of the transition period UK must not agree to shadow EU rules to gain access to the single market Mr Johnson said: ""The crucial thing I want to get over to Sun readers about Brexit is that it is going to be great and we need to believe in ourselves and believe we can do it. It is unstoppable."" He also touched on other subjects in the interview - calling for a faster increase in the minimum wage and for public sector pay rises. While he dismissed suggestions of any leadership ambitions, his comments are likely to fuel speculation that he is still positioning himself for the top job. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the foreign secretary's comments sent a signal to EU negotiators that the ""strings were being pulled by others"". ""Senior Conservatives are displaying an abject failure to act together in the national interest and seem more motivated by selfish, personal ambition.""

NHS not fit for 21st Century - inspector,"The NHS is not fit for the 21st Century, the new chief inspector of hospitals in England has said. Professor Ted Baker, who started the role last month, said the system had not adapted to deal with the growth in the population. In aninterview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalhe said: ""The model of care we have got is still the model we had in the 1960s and 70s."" The Department of Health is yet to respond to his views. Prof Baker succeeded Sir Mike Richards overseeing the hospital division of the Care Quality Commission (CQC), having been his deputy since 2014. The former hospital medical director said the NHS had not modernised because of a historic lack of investment. He said: ""One of the things I regret is that 15 or 20 years ago, when we could see the change in the population, the NHS did not change its model of care. ""It should have done it then - there was a lot more money coming in but we didn't spend it all on the right things. We didn't spend it on transformation of the model of care."" The number of pensioners has increased by a third in the last 30 years and he said the system had not been able to deal with the increase in the number of elderly people in particular. He also criticised accident and emergency wards and has written to all hospital chief executives calling for action to improve safety. Too many hospitals had ""wholly unsatisfactory arrangements"", he said, such as letting ambulances queue up at the entrance or leaving patients in corridors. The CQC is expected to highlight increasing pressures on hospitals, who are in danger running out of beds and staff, in a report next month on the state of the health and care services. That was an issue that Prof Baker touched on in the interview, saying: ""Capacity is being squeezed all the time. That is a real concern going forward - because there comes a point at which the capacity isn't there"". The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym said Prof Baker's comments come after predictions of a difficult winter for the service, with the chief executive of NHS England warning of the possibility of a serious flu outbreak. NHS Providers, representing trusts, has said that without an emergency cash bailout the service faces the worst winter in recent history, our correspondent added.

Star Wars film 'turned down by Queen',"The Crown Estate said it was approached ""a few years ago"" by the Star Wars film franchise A Star Wars request to film on land owned by the Queen was turned down, it has been revealed. The Crown Estate said no to the film franchise when it wanted to film scenes at Windsor Great Park, Berkshire. An estate spokesman said the planned scenes were not suitable for the park, adding: ""Our head isn't turned by star names or star films."" Part of the 5,000-acre park was recently used for the new Winnie-the-Pooh film, Goodbye Christopher Robin. The Star Wars revelation came as the Crown Estate's head of commercial operations, Nick Day, spoke to the BBC about a forest in the park being used as the 100 Acre Wood, the home of Pooh and his chums. Obelisk Pond in Windsor Great Park was used in The Legend Of Tarzan Mr Day said: ""Star Wars was just such a huge thing that the risk for the park was just too great. ""The location they were interested in wasn't suitable for large numbers of people in there. ""Our priority is to maintain and protect Windsor Great Park and we can facilitate film crews if we're sure the risk to the park is minimal. ""But Star Wars is a huge machine, and there's also massive outside interest in those sort of things. It wasn't right for here."" He added Windsor Great Park, which has different areas including park land, forests and open farmland, is often a popular location for films being shot at nearby Pinewood Studios. He would not reveal the Star Wars film in question, out of discretion, but said he was approached ""a few years ago"". In recent years, the park's Obelisk Pond transformed into a part of the River Congo for The Legend Of Tarzan, and a farmer's field was used to film a rock concert scene in Bridget Jones's Baby. But Mr Day said he turns down at least ""eight out of 10"" film location requests, no matter how big budget the movie is. He said: ""If it doesn't work for here then, no matter who you are, I'm afraid that dollars, bright lights and names don't sway us."" New Winnie-the-Pooh character unveiled.

Three jailed over Paris jewel heists,"The Cartier store in central Paris was the scene of the second robbery A French court has given three jewel thieves prison sentences of up to 15 years for two robberies in Paris. In the first robbery, in 2013, criminals made off quietly with millions of euros worth of jewellery from a De Beers outlet. But a robbery more than a year later from a Cartier store went awry and ended in a gunfight with police. Prosecutors said similarities in the raids led investigators to charge two of the men with the earlier crime. At a Paris court on Friday, Dominique Vilaca, involved in both crimes, was jailed for 15 years, as was Ismaila Fofana, 26, who took part in the 2014 heist. His cousin Youssouf Fofana, 25, was jailed for seven years for the De Beers robbery. The court heard how two robbers had targeted the De Beers outlet in the upmarket Printemps department store in central Paris in February 2013, getting away with jewellery worth about 3.78 million euros (Â£3.3m). No-one was hurt. However, in November 2014, police exchanged fire with two robbers as they fled the Cartier store with jewellery worth more than eight million euros. They took a staff member hostage and led police on a chase across the city before surrendering. The court heard that Dominique Vilaca fired seven shots as he tried to evade capture.

What happened in the city that banned Uber,"Within 24 hours of losing a public vote, Uber had left Austin Uber's new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will be in the UK on Tuesday for a meeting with Transport for London (TfL). He hopes the negotiations will stop the imminent revoking of his companyâs license to run its ride-sharing business in the capital. When TfL, backed by Mayor Sadiq Khan, announced Uber would no longer be allowed to operate, the service's 3.5m users, and 40,000 drivers, were aghast. Despite the very best efforts of the cab trade, Uber has become a valued way for Londoners to get around, particularly late at night. The same was true in Austin, Texas. Itâs a city that shares few similarities with London, other than its own bitter tussle with Uber - the fallout from which could contain clues as to what might happen if, and it's a big if, TfL follows through with its threat. Uber had been available in Austin since 2014. But on 10 May 2016, Uber (and rival service Lyft) turned off their apps and left. Less than 24 hours earlier, Austinites had gone to the polls to vote on Proposition 1. It was a law that removed a requirement on ride-sharing companies to gather fingerprints as part of their background checks on drivers, as well as sharing more data with city officials. Uber didn't want to do this. It argued that the fingerprint database drivers would be cross-checked against would be ineffective. It's also likely - though Uber never expressed this publicly - that adding a layer to the sign-up process would make it more time-consuming, and expensive, to recruit drivers. It's something the company, in all the markets it works in, constantly seeks to avoid - and in Austin it was prepared to spend big to avoid the restrictions. David Butts, a political consultant who campaigned against Uber during the dispute, estimates that the firm spent more than $10m (Â£7.5m) fighting city officials. âWe have never seen a campaign that spent that much money, for anything,â he said. Uber did not respond to the BBCâs request to comment on this story. Whatever the size of the lobbying bill, it wasnât enough. Mr Khosrowshahi said Uberâs poor corporate reputation may have been a factor in TfL's thinking, and the same may have been true for Austinâs voters, according to Ben Wear, a reporter for the Austin American-Statesman. Uber's chief executive will be in London to discuss TfL's concerns over his company ""I think a lot of people that actually actively used their service here in Austin voted against them, knowing that theyâd leave, because of the corporate behaviour that at that time had gone on for about two years. ""They showed up and basically ignored the cityâs rules."" And so just like that, Uber and Lyft were gone. Andy Tryba and his team got to work.  ""We basically stayed up all night for about four weeks or so to kind of get it up and going,"" he told me. âItâs to my knowledge the worldâs only non-profit version of ride-share.â He's the co-founder of Ride Austin, a locally developed app that stepped in to take Uberâs place - one of about 11 eventual alternatives that popped up in the weeks and months after Uber's disappearance. Unlike Uber and Lyft, which take a percentage of a rideâs final fare, RideAustin takes a fixed $2 fee, regardless of how long or far the journey. Riders are offered the chance to round up their fare and donate the extra amount to a number of charities - it has so far raised over $250,000. âThere were 125,000 a week or so that were occurring in the city when Uber and Lyft were operating here. Obviously, the day that they pulled out there was a bit of an adjustment period. âBut within a few weeks, there were several players that came into town. Very quickly that total number of rides were filled by those other players.â There were teething problems with these new apps, said Mike Allen, who has driven in Austin for almost two years. âIt was a fun challenge to get them to a point where they were able to work for us as drivers,â he said. ""But we got there."" The real test came when it was time for the most famous event in Austinâs calendar - South by Southwest. The tech, music and film festival draws thousands to the city every year, and in 2017 it presented the new apps with their biggest challenge yet in handling the demand. South by Southwest attracts thousands every year - including Barack Obama in 2016 That challenge grew too great on the middle Saturday of the festival, when as afternoon rolled into evening, it started to pour down with rain. I was among those hopelessly opening up apps trying to find one that was still working. RideAustin buckled, as too did Fasten, another app that had moved into the city when Uber left. ""Technical issues are just part and parcel of tech businesses,"" said Vlad Christoff, co-founder of Fasten. âWe had braced for a 10x increaseâ¦ we got 17x. Yes - we had a little bit of a hiccup!â But by June, Uber and Lyft were back. There hadnât been a compromise on security or data. Instead, state power in Texas overruled Austinâs local decision by creating statewide rules on ride-sharing that did not insist on fingerprint checks. Within a week, one Austin app, Fare, had folded. RideAustin saw its bookings drop by 55% - and it hasnât ever recovered. The local apps all maintain that they have plenty of drivers, who make more money on their apps per trip than Uber or Lyft. And though it's difficult to measure independently, the fares are the same or cheaper too. Which makes you wonder - why did users go back to Uber and Lyft? ""They are very good at leveraging their cash position to do lots of free rides and promotions to get their share back,"" Mr Tryba said. Fastenâs Mr Christoff thinks brand recognition beyond the city is the problem. âThe part that weâve lost is visitors. For one year people landed at Austinâs airport, and they found out the hard way that the default ride-sharing apps on their phone didnât work. ""Once Uber and Lyft came back, business continued as usual. [But] the locals stayed with us.â Drivers too have turned more frequently to Uber and Lyft instead of the smaller apps. ""It boils down to the quantity of rides,"" says Mr Allen. ""When youâre getting 10 requests on Uber to every one request on RideAustin, youâve got to go to where the rides are. Right now Uber is paying me the most money, but per ride RideAustin is the best."" I think it's unlikely that Uber's troubles in London will reach such a breaking point that the company ends up being forced off the streets. The appeal process keeps it on the road for the foreseeable future, and when dealing with city officials, Uberâs new CEO Mr Khosrowshahi has hinted at an ever-so-slightly more understanding approach than the man he replaced, Travis Kalanick. If Uber does leave, there are already a number of apps already in play (not to mention black cabs) that would seek to pick up the extra business - and the orphaned drivers. Both RideAustin and Fasten said they would consider looking at London as a new market for them, but had no immediate plans. âThere is life after Uber,â Mr Christoff said. For political consultant David Butts, who worked with Austin City Council on the issue, the entire dispute speaks to a bigger problem of billionaire-backed start-ups believing they are free to dictate the rules. To city officials in London, he says: ""Stand up to them.â ""Donât cave in. Theyâre not as strong. Make the case to people: do you want a corporation dictating to the City of London?â ______ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres under fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

10 charts showing the scale of mental illness in the UK,"At any one time, a sixth of the population in England aged 16 to 64 have a mental health problem, according to statistics body NHS Digital. Whether it is family or friends, neighbours or work colleagues, the chances are we all know someone who is affected. And bearing in mind the figure leaves out less common conditions and is a snapshot in time, you could easily argue it is even more prevalent than that. Indeed many do. With Prime Minister Theresa May expected to announce plans to improve care next week, these 10 charts show the extent of the challenge. It seems to be getting more common - or at least among those with severe symptoms. While the proportion of people affected does not appear to have risen in the past few years, if you go back a little further there has certainly been a steady increase. Evidence from the NHS Digital study in England shows the rise has been driven by an increase in women with illness. Why is this? Undoubtedly some of it is down to people being more willing to report and admit mental health problems. Experts point to the way self-harm in particular is recognised in a way it was not 20 or 30 years ago. But it is also clear 21st Century life is taking its toll on some people. Economic uncertainty, social media, the influence of the media and rising expectations of what life should be like have all been suggested as possible causes. Women are now much more likely to have a common mental illness. One in five report they have, compared with one in eight men in England. If you include only those with severe symptoms, the difference is less acute, but still apparent. Young people are particularly susceptible. A number of theories have been put forward for this. The economic uncertainty of the past decade has particularly affected the young, making it harder to get on the career ladder. And psychiatrists and mental health campaigners are increasingly raising questions about whether social media increases peer-group pressure and online bullying. Whatever the reason, the one thing experts are agreed on is that the figures are shocking. Mental health problems prompt thousands of people to take their own lives. In fact there are about 6,000 suicides in the UK each year and it's the biggest killer of men up to the age of 49. Men account for three-quarters of the total figure. The best overall measure is the number of suicides per 100,000 people.  That's because, with a rising population, the absolute figure is almost bound to go up.  Since the 1980s, the trend is down. There's quite a big national variation, with England having the lowest suicide rate and Northern Ireland the highest. Scotland and Wales have similar rates and are in the middle. As already mentioned, mental health problems are particularly common in the young in the UK. In fact, most mental health problems develop in childhood or when a person is a young adult. Three-quarters of problems are established by the age of 24. It is why there is such an emphasis at the moment on addressing childhood mental illness. In 2015, the government promised funding for child and adolescent mental health services would increase. Extra money has also been earmarked for adult services in England. Together with the investment in children's services it means by 2020-21 Â£1.28bn more should be spent in real terms than was in 2015-16. Ministers say the money will be used to put mental health services in A&E, more crisis teams in the community and a focus on helping new mothers, with one in five reporting problems in the first year after the birth of their baby. But an analysis last year by the King's Fund health think tank found 40% of mental health trusts in England had actually seen their budgets cut in 2015-16. The government is adamant things will change. They have to. While 23% of NHS activity is taken up by mental illness, mental health trusts have been receiving only about 11% of funding in recent years. Extra investment is being made in the other parts of the UK. Wales and Scotland have both recently unveiled new plans. But like England, mental health remains the poor cousin compared to the spending on physical ailments. The promise of investment has also been accompanied by a desire to reshape services - and particularly how quickly we can access them. The government established the first set of waiting time targets for the NHS in England in 2016. They mean the health service should be providing access to talking therapies within 18 weeks and treatment for those experiencing their first episode of psychosis within two weeks for at least half of people. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all have their own targets too. But drugs are still the most common form of treatment. The number of medicines dispensed for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks has almost doubled in the past 10 years. An increase in the numbers of people getting antidepressants is clearly a factor. But so too is the fact prescribing patterns have changed. Doctors are much more likely to keep people on drugs for longer with evidence suggesting it is a more effective way of treating patients. But as common as antidepressants are, the fact remains the majority of people with mental illness report they are not getting help. Only one in three of those polled said they were receiving treatment, according to NHS Digital. With the high rates of non-treatment in mind, it perhaps should not come as a surprise that there is an upwards trend in England in the number of people being detained under the Mental Health Act. Campaigners say patients in crisis are given just enough treatment to stabilise them before being sent home too early to ease pressure on beds. What happens then? They suffer another crisis and are detained again. So some people spend years being detained over and over again without ever getting well. The pressure on the system also manifests itself in long journeys for treatment. Last year a major report looked at the issue and pointed to thousands of people being sent more than 30 miles for services like acute care, psychiatric intensive care or rehabilitation. In some rural areas, of course, travelling long distances is not that uncommon for all sorts of care. But that's not the point, said the report.  Far too many people in towns and cities, where services should be easier to access, are affected, and the situation was ""unacceptable"". Everyone knows it's a problem.  Nobody likes it, and it can be massively disruptive for patients and their families. Yet an awful lot of sufferers of mental ill health travel a long, long way to get treatment. And, according to the British Medical Association, things are getting worse not better. In fact, it says, there's been a ""startling rise"" in the number of patients being sent out of area for treatment, a rise of nearly 40% between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to 5,876 adults. One patient they found had been sent from Somerset to the Highlands, a journey of 587 miles. The use of police cells for people in mental health crisis has attracted huge disquiet, not least among officers themselves. In a rare public statement of concern from a senior police chief, Devon and Cornwall Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton tweeted ""#unacceptable"" when a 16-year-old girl was held for two days in a cell in 2015 because no beds were available. That caused quite a stir among officers, patients and distraught families who felt that police cells were the last place someone in a health crisis should be held. But now the use of police cells is down - at least in England and Wales, though figures in Scotland suggest it may have gone up. In England and Wales it has fallen by more than half from 4,500 in 2014-15 to just over 2,000 in 2015-16,  according to the National Police Chiefs' Council. The NPCC also says the downward change is even bigger for under 18s to just 43 cases in 2015-16. But perhaps the most promising development in terms of mental health is the changing attitude towards mental illness. A public campaign called Time to Change was launched in 2009 by leading charities Mind and Rethink. It has been supported by the lottery and government along the way - and seems to be working. Latest results from the National Attitudes to Mental Illness Survey, released in May, showed people's willingness to work, live with and live nearby someone with a mental health problem has been improving in England. Campaigners have described the progress as wonderful but warn against complacency. Despite the improvements, nearly nine in 10 people who have had mental health problems report they have suffered stigma and discrimination. For all the positives, there's a long way to go, it seems.

Why French magazines now say when models are Photoshopped,"It's no secret that images of models are often retouched to make their bodies look thinner or curvier in certain places, to lengthen their legs to mannequin-esque proportions, or to smooth out their skin and widen their eyes. From Sunday, in France, any commercial image that has been digitally altered to make a model look thinner will have a cigarette-packet style warning on it. ""Photographie retouchÃ©e"", it will say, which translates to ""edited photograph"". Anyone flouting the new rule could be fined â¬37,500 (Â£33,000) or 30% of the cost of creating the ad. The government is essentially trying to tackle persistent image-doctoring as a public health issue. It's hoped the change will help tackle extreme thinness among models, and body image problems among those who aspire to shapes they cannot hope to live up to because they were faked on a computer programme. ""Exposing young people to normative and unrealistic images of bodies leads to a sense of self-depreciation and poor self-esteem that can impact health-related behaviour,"" Health Minister Marisol Touraine said. France is not the first country to introduce these kinds of rules. Israel, for example, has already done so. But thinness gets a lot of attention in France. Cannes accused of slimming down classic 1959 actress photo Tens of thousands of people in the country suffer from anorexia and the average body mass index (BMI) - a measure used to determine if someone is underweight or overweight - is the lowest in Europe. In one new book, author Gabrielle Deydier makes the case that thinness is revered in her country, and fatness despised. She even lost her job in a school, she says, after a colleague took exception to her obesity. Another time, in a job interview, she was shocked to hear her interviewer say it was ""well-known"" that fatter people had lower IQs. The BBC's Tulip Mazumdar got her photos airbrushed - it made her feel she looked ""old, tired and a bit chubby"" in the originals Could a change in the way advertisements are presented make a difference to how French people see their bodies? It's a concept not entirely rejected by Tom Quinn of UK eating disorders charity Beat. He told the BBC: ""It's simplistic to suggest that looking at Photoshopped images will cause eating disorders. But many people who look at altered images have low self esteem. Tulip Mazumdar: What does it feel like to be airbrushed? ""We support any measures that contribute to a society having a healthier view of body types and everyone being more aware of which pictures have been touched up. ""Moving towards a society where there isn't the same pressure on models and the general public to be as thin as possible will be very welcome."" The veteran lecturer and campaigner Jean Kilbourne, author of Deadly Persuasion: Why Women and Girls Must Fight the Power of Advertising, has said: ""Ads sell more than products. ""They sell values, they sell images, they sell concepts of love and sexuality, of success, and perhaps most important, of normalcy. ""To a great extent, they tell us who we are and who we should be."" This video can not be played Anorexia survivor Shannon is campaigning for shops in the UK to use mannequins that reflect a healthy weight because people compare themselves to them Dr Terri Apter, psychologist and author of The Confident Child, told the BBC that while she felt ""this kind of culture"" could change, things seemed to be moving very slowly. ""There's not less anorexia than there was 25 years ago, for all the effort that many people have put in,"" she said. While the French change ""in and of itself"" won't ""have a big impact on the culture"", it will protect models, she adds. This is not the only thing the French government has done recently to try and tackle excessive thinness in the country's world-leading fashion industry. Since May, models have had to show a doctor's note to prove they are healthy, and some top companies have banned super-thin models. But it's important to remember that there are other tricks of the trade besides Photoshop alteration. Posing a certain way, taking a photo from a certain angle, lighting well or just sucking your tummy in can make a model look very different in a very short time. This applies both to thinness and the current trend of athletic-looking bodies, flat stomachs, and larger, squat-honed, buttocks. Allow Instagram content?

Who would win and lose under Corbyn's rent controls,"Simon Youel said ""radical"" measures were needed to tackle the housing crisis Simon Youel has experienced some of the perils of renting a home. In the last four years the 25-year-old has lived in six different places and experienced sudden evictions and sharp rental increases. So when Jeremy Corbyn told Labour's conference last weekend that his government would seek to reform the housing market and introduce rent controls, the comments were welcomed by Simon. But not everyone is a fan of the Labour leader's proposals. Simon thinks rent controls - measures where authorities either set rent levels or limit how much they increase - are ""long overdue"" in the UK. He has recently been told he has a month to find a new home after his landlord decided to refurbish the house in which he lives in Kilburn, north-west London. ""Any policies which can make housing more affordable for everyone would be good, but it [rent controls] still feels quite moderate. ""I think far more radical action has to happen if we're really going to tackle the root of the problem, which is the housing shortage."" Richard Blanco said rent controls could ""decimate"" his business But Richard Blanco, a private landlord who manages 13 properties across London, is against state intervention in the market. He says allowing authorities to decide what level rents should be would ""decimate"" his business and, along with capped rent rises, would ultimately hurt renters. ""I would feel very angry because I've built my business over many years with a lot of hard work. ""I house 28 adults and five children and their homes would be at risk."" Jeremy Corbyn's conference pledge to introduce rent controls is not entirely new - it was also proposed by the man he succeeded as leader, Ed Miliband, in2015,externaland was in the party's2017 manifesto,external. But whereas then Labour proposed capping how much rents can increase and making three-year tenancies the ""norm"", Mr Corbyn alluded to something more radical in his speech - that cities should have these powers devolved to them. This has led housing experts, including the charity Shelter, to question whether the Labour leader wants areas to be able to set rent levels - a more controversial policy. Mr Corbyn said cities should have rent control powers Anna Clarke, a senior research associate at the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research, said one possibility would be for local authorities to reduce rent levels from the current market rate to levels comparable to social housing. The effects of this would vary greatly around the country, she said. In some areas, such as parts of northern England, the difference between market and social housing rates is small, so the change would be negligible, whereas in others areas, like London, it would be far greater. Other European cities also provide examples of how rent controls could work. In Paris, for example, rental prices are set by a third party in areas of high demand, while in German cities like Berlin and Munich there are caps on how high rents can be. The UK's recent past also shows how rental controls can work. Before the1988 Housing Act,externalreduced regulation of the private rented sector, rents were usually decided by the Valuation Office Agency, which set a ""fair"" level of rent for the property and calculated how much that amount could increase. A number of people still live under these old arrangements, often paying well below the market rates for rent. Rents are capped in Berlin While many experts think the capping of rent rises - especially when combined with longer tenancies - could benefit renters, they are more sceptical about public authorities setting rent levels. Ms Clarke said there would be ""winners and losers"" if rent was set by cities or towns. Some would benefit from lowered rents, she said, but others might struggle to find housing because of a reduction in housing supply caused by buy-to-let landlords selling their properties or struggling to get mortgages. ""Some of the existing tenants would see a big fall in their rent and that would be a really good thing for those struggling to afford their rent. ""But there would be losers and some of those would be the poorest in society who can't get any housing at all, who can't find somewhere to rent."" Whether or not Labour win the next general election and implement rent controls, there appears to be a growing trend for the policy in other countries, Kath Scanlon, a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics says. ""It goes in cycles,"" Ms Scanlon said. ""In the late 20th Century places everywhere were removing or relaxing rent controls, but I'd say it's swinging back the other way now."" She said the policy was ""politically attractive"" because it shows governments to be tackling the problem of unaffordable housing. But Ms Scanlon said rent controls were only addressing the symptoms of a problem, caused by a lack of housing supply. ""Rather than putting all our eggs into the basket of private speculative house building, out of which we carve a little portion of affordable housing, we should be reviving the construction of public housing, of housing association affordable housing, at a much bigger scale,"" she added.
