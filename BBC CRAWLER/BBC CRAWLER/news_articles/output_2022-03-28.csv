Special needs pupils to receive earlier support,"Natasha says getting extra support for her son has been ""an impossible battle"" Children with special educational needs will receive better help at school from an earlier stage under a new national system, the government says. The Department for Education plans for England include digitising paperwork to help parents receive extra support for their children more quickly. It is part of a delayed review into the special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) support system. Critics say too little urgency has been shown to address the ""broken system"". Last year, 1.4 million pupils in England were identified as having special educational needs - the proportion has been growing since 2017. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told BBC News early intervention was a ""focus"" of the plans - and would be achieved partly by training 5,000 more early-years teachers to be SEN co-ordinators (Sencos), who monitor and assess SEN children's progress. The plans ""will give confidence to families across the country that from very early on in their child's journey through education, whatever their level of need, their local school will be equipped to offer a tailored and high-quality level of support"", he said. New funding of Â£70m would be used to back the proposals, the Department for Education said. But for some families, the review - announced in 2019 - comes too late. Natasha Balashova, from Norwich, says securing extra support for her son has been ""an impossible battle that crushes your soul and takes all of your energy"". Boris, seven, is autistic and has not been to his mainstream school for a year because he had too little support, she says. Children who need more help than is available through SEN support - such as one-to-one teaching or a place in a specialist school - must have an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) in place. ""Because the system is broken, there are delays at every step of the process,"" Ms Balashova told BBC News. While his EHCP was being processed, Boris did not receive the support he needed. And by the time it was ready to be implemented, he had become too anxious to go to school. Ms Balashova is ""sceptical"" the government's proposals will improve the EHCP process because ""there is no quick fix of this state of shambles - it has to be reorganised from the top to the bottom"". SEN schools 'forgotten' during Covid Special-needs support beyond crisis, heads say SEND family spends Â£20k fighting for school place Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders trade union, welcomed the government's focus on early intervention but said it was frustrating the review had been delayed ""and full implementation of the Green Paper is some way off"". ""In the meantime, many thousands of children and young people will continue to pass through a broken system, with schools left to pick up the pieces without sufficient resources,"" he added. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the Green Paper  - the consultation document setting out policy proposals - had some ""sensible"" ideas, but he was ""not convinced"" the plans were ambitious enough to tackle waiting lists for specialist services such as speech therapy. Mr Zahawi told MPs on Tuesday local authorities were ""in deficit and overspending on their dedicated schools grant"" and the Green Paper would build a more ""financially sustainable system"". Families are being asked to share their views on how to shape the new system, in a 13-week public consultation. Labour's shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the proposals were ""hollow, because there's no plan"" for delivery and criticised the amount of time changes were taking. ""Families have had to wait almost 1,000 days since the SEND review was announced, for the government to launch this consultation,"" she said. ""Families will wait for another 13 weeks for the consultation to close. ""They'll wait longer for a government response and then again before changes are seen in the front line."" But some children are already benefiting from early-intervention projects. Lilycroft Primary School, in Bradford, has been part of a trial where experts use data to identify children who might need more support, at a much earlier stage than usual. Head teacher Nicola Roth told BBC News it could take six years for a child in Bradford to be diagnosed as autistic - which can delay the support for which they are eligible. ""We can just get on with treating the child and getting the best education for the child as soon as possible,"" she said, adding she hoped every school could benefit from the same model. Nicola Roth's school has been part of a trial using education and health data to identify children who might benefit from early support Prof Mark Mon-Williams, a director at the Centre of Applied Education Research, based at Bradford Royal Infirmary, who ran the trial, said: ""All the evidence is that acting early is good across the board. ""That child can then thrive in the educational setting, which means that we then have less issues to deal with in terms of that child's long-term physical and mental health."" Other proposals in the SEND and alternative provision Green Paper include: publishing local dashboards to make it clearer to parents who is responsible for what part of the system launching a national framework for councils to make it clear what level of support is expected for children with the greatest additional needs spending Â£10m to train more than 200 more educational psychologists, who will graduate in 2026 and can give advice and input into EHCP assessments and offer wider support. approving up to 40 new special and alternative provision free schools Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme why the government does not ""get on with it"" rather than launching a consultation - especially after three years of delays - children's minister Will Quince said he was ""determined to get this right"". He said reforms introduced in 2014 were not implemented properly. ""It pains me, the number of people who have to fight just to get their child the education that they rightly deserve,"" he added.

Cadbury shrinks size of Dairy Milk sharing bar,"Cadbury has shrunk the size of its Dairy Milk sharing bars by 10%, but will not reduce the price for customers. Parent company Mondelez blamed costs associated with the production of its chocolate spiking, as it reduced the bars' size from 200g to 180g. They are still typically being sold at Â£2 despite the downsize. US firm Mondelez said the move was the first for that size of Dairy Milk bar in a decade. In 2020, the company was accused of ""shrinkflation"" - reducing the size of a product while keeping the price the same to boost profits. At the time, Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks, including popular treats like Crunchies, Twirls and Wispas,were reduced in size to reduce their calorie count, Mondelez said. The latest move comes as the cost of food is increasing, placing further pressure on UK households during the cost of living crisis. Last week, the rate of inflation (which tracks how the cost of living changes over time)hit a fresh 30-year-high of 6.2% for the year to February. A Mondelez spokesperson said: ""We're facing the same challenges that so many other food companies have already reported when it comes to significantly increased production costs - whether it's ingredients, energy or packaging - and rising inflation. ""This means that our products are much more expensive to make. ""We understand that consumers are faced with rising costs too, which is why we look to absorb costs wherever we can, but, in this difficult environment, we've had to make the decision to slightly reduce the weight of our medium Cadbury Dairy Milk bars for the first time since 2012, so that we can keep them competitive and ensure the great taste and quality our fans enjoy."" Cadbury accused of 'shrinkflation' as pack size cut Nestle to sell US confectionery business Wonka bar and Golden Ticket fetch Â£15k Separately, the UK's food standards watchdog warned of the sale of counterfeit ""Wonka"" chocolate bars on Monday. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the fake products were being sold online and in shops across the UK and might not be safe to eat. It said any Wonka-branded chocolate which does not feature the ""Ferrero"" or ""Ferrara Candy Company"" trademarks on the label was likely to be fake. Some had been found to contain allergens not listed on the label. The warning comes after a sharp increase in reports of counterfeit chocolate bars on sale over the past year. The agency said there was a possibility the fake bars were being produced or repackaged by unregistered businesses and individuals who could be breaking food hygiene, labelling and traceability laws. Tina Potter, Head of Incidents at the FSA, said: ""With Easter less than a month away, it is more important than ever that parents and grandparents are aware of the risks that these bogus chocolate bars could pose to their children, particularly those living with a food allergy or intolerance. ""If you have bought these knock-off bars, do not eat them or give them to friends and family."" The FSA said it was continuing to investigate further reports with support from local authorities. The Wonka brand was sold by Swiss food giant Nestle to Ferrero Group in 2018,alongside the rest of its US sweets and chocolate business. It is not the first time the brand has been targeted by fraudsters. In 2013 fake Wonka chocolate bars containing bogus ""golden tickets""were seized by trading standards officers in Suffolk. The product is based on Road Dahl's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which has also inspired two film adaptations. In the book, children who found golden tickets in the bars won a trip to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

Boris Becker reveals bankruptcy embarrassment,"Ex-tennis star Boris Becker has spoken of his shock and embarrassment at being declared bankrupt, as a trial into his alleged failure to declare assets continues. The six-time Grand Slam champion told Southwark Crown Court the bad publicity damaged ""brand Becker"" and reduced his earnings. Mr Becker was declared bankrupt in 2017 and is accused of failing to hand over assets including trophies and medals. He denies 24 charges against him. The court heard the bankruptcy decision came days before that year's two-week Wimbledon tournament, where he was working for the BBC as well as Australian and Japanese television. Becker said he felt ""very embarrassed"", adding: ""Because it was all over world news, and I walked through the gate of Wimbledon and everyone knew. I was embarrassed because I was bankrupt."" He told jurors the bankruptcy was also in the midst of a ""stressful time"" with his then wife Sharlely ""Lilly"" Becker, while they were living in ""separate quarters"" at a Â£22,000-a-month rented house in Wimbledon, south-west London. Becker, who arrived at court hand in hand with his partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, sat at the witness box on Monday to give evidence, as the jury was told he has injuries to his ankle and knees. His barrister, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, took him through his career after he was catapulted to stardom when he became the youngest player to win the Wimbledon men's singles titles, aged 17, in 1985. The court heard the former world number one earned a ""vast amount"" of money, winning about $50 million (Â£38m) in prize money and sponsorship deals. He said he helped his parents build a house in his native Germany and paid cash for a family home in Munich, a property in Miami, Florida, and an estate in Mallorca, which was worth about â¬50 million (Â£42m) at the height of the property market. But Becker, who went on to coach current world number one tennis player Novak Djokovic, work as a BBC commentator and act as a brand ambassador for firms including Puma, said his earnings ""reduced dramatically"" following his retirement in 1999. He said he was involved in an ""expensive divorce"" from ex-wife Barbara Becker in 2001, involving high maintenance payments to their two sons, and had to support his daughter Anna Ermakova and her mother, in a deal which included a Â£2.5m Chelsea flat. German national Becker, who was resident in Monte Carlo and Switzerland before moving to the UK in 2012, said he had ""expensive lifestyle commitments"", including millions owed to Swiss authorities as well as in Germany. He said the bankruptcy had restricted his ability to earn money, explaining: ""[It is] very difficult when you are bankrupt and in the headlines every week for it. [It is] very difficult to make a lot of money with my name."" The 24 charges Mr Becker has been accused of include: Nine counts of failing to deliver up trophies and other awards Seven counts of concealing property totalling more than â¬1.5m Five counts of failing to disclose estate, including the properties in Germany and London, shares and a bank account Two of removal of property amounting to almost â¬500,000 One of concealing â¬825,000 of debt The trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues.

Chief constable wants single Welsh police force,"Dyfed-Powys Police boss Richard Lewis wants a unified service by 2030 Wales' four police forces should be scrapped and replaced with a single nationwide service, according to Dyfed-Powys Police's new chief constable. Former Cleveland Police boss Dr Richard Lewis has said this should be in place by 2030. ""(If) the Americans can put a man on the moon in eight years, I think we can unify four police services,"" he said. The Home Office said the existing structure meant everyone had a direct say on policing in their area. And South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast, the idea of having one single Welsh force was ""stupid"". But Dr Lewis said merging forces into Heddlu Cymru - Welsh for Police Wales - would be more effective. It would be the third largest force in England and Wales, behind the Metropolitan Police and West Midlands Police. Ravers leave after police given extra powers South Wales Police response criticised in independent review Former PC guilty of gross misconduct Carmarthenshire-born Dr Lewis said: ""Doing away with those borders means we can provide a more effective service. ""One chief constable rather than four. One deputy chief constable. Dare I say one commissioner instead of four."" A merger would create a service with more than 7,400 police officers, according to Home Office figures. He denied combining the police would be cuts driven. The force covers an area greater than half the land mass of Wales ""What policing needs across the country is further investment,"" he said. ""We've seen the government uplift figure of 20,000 officers. I'd like to see something similar for police staff members as well."" Dr Lewis said he recognised concerns that resources could be concentrated on towns and cities under one force. He believed that could be dealt with by creating ""shadow structures"" to ensure officers working in rural areas remained there. In Scotland eight forces merged to form Police Scotland in 2013, and has faced problems. Dr Lewis said: ""Police Scotland had a difficult start but I think they're now seeing the benefits of having one national service in Scotland. ""We can learn the lessons, of course, from those early days in Scotland... creating national structures in the IT world et cetera."" Devolution of the police, he said, was a political matter. Richard Lewis denied combining the police would be cuts driven He said: ""My concern is around the way we structure our policing services in Wales. ""I understand not everybody will be of the same opinion, but Lord Thomas' report on Justice in Wales,suggested a number of changes that have now been seen, such as a national policing board for Wales. ""National structures do exist. What I'm proposing is a development of those things."" He admitted if there was a unified force, devolution of policing ""may be easier to achieve"". He's called for a national debate about whether a ""single police force is what the public want to see"". ""President Kennedy, in 1962, said that he would put a man on the moon by the end of decade,"" he said. ""If, starting from scratch, the Americans can put a man on the moon in eight years, I think we can unify four police services in Wales."" But Alun Michael said: ""It would be an idea to discuss this within the police first before coming out with a stupid idea such as this. ""I have a lot of respect for Richard Lewis, he will be successful in his own patch but... the roots of policing must be kept local. ""The reactive element of policing can be run in larger areas such as Wales-wide and in the English regions, but it would lose the Chief Constable's accountability to communities. That is what has happened in Scotland."" South Wales Police and Gwent Police declined to comment on Dr Lewis' views. North Wales Police has been asked to comment. A merger would create a service with more 7,400 than police officers, according to Home Office figures A Home Office spokesman said: ""The existing police force structure in Wales ensures everyone has a direct say on policing in their area through their locally elected and accountable police and crime commissioner. ""Chief constables and police and crime commissioners collaborate with other forces on a wide range of functions to improve the service they provide to the public.""

Community now owns Britain's remotest mainland pub,"Former owner Jean-Pierre Robinet spent 10 years as Britain's remotest mainland publican A community in Lochaber has succeeded in its bid to buy Britain's remotest mainland pub in a landmark deal. Residents of the Knoydart Peninsula in Lochaber are now the owners of The Old Forge in Inverie. The only way of reaching the village - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles (29km) or making a seven-mile (11km) sea crossing. The pub's Belgian owner Jean-Pierre Robinet put the pub on the market last year, asking for offers over Â£425,000. He had run the pub - which has the Guinness World Record for the remotest mainland pub in Britain - for 10 years. Community wins fund to buy remotest mainland pub Community in race to buy remotest mainland pub Locals bid for Britain's remote mainland bar The small community of just over 100 people held a consultation on a community buyout, with 70 taking part. Almost all of them backed the idea, and The Old Forge Community Benefit Society (CBS) was set up. Locals raised more than Â£320,000 through a community share offer and crowdfunder, and received financial support from Scottish Land Fund and Community Ownership Fund to secure enough capital to purchase the building and undertake essential renovations. Under the community ownership model, profits will be reinvested back into business, not shareholders, and to projects that deliver wider community benefit. Stephanie Harris, secretary of the CBS, said: ""We are ecstatic that after so many months of hard work we have been successful in securing the pub for the community. ""The Old Forge plays such an important role in Knoydart's social culture and economic sustainability, and with the business now in the community's hands we can steer it forward in a way that will work for the needs of the locals and the thousands of visitors who come every year."" The only way of reaching Inverie - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles or making a seven-mile sea crossing The Knoydart community has a track record of successful community ownership, having secured 17,500 acres of the Knoydart Estate in 1999 as one of the first community buyouts in Scotland. Knoydart's coast and mountains have been described as mainland Britain's last wilderness. The committee is now preparing to relaunch the pub in a few weeks' time. Ms Harris said: ""We haven't been able to access the building up to this point except for when our building inspectors were permitted entry for valuation purposes. ""The inspection identified a number of essential works to make the building safe and fit-for-purpose, so we plan to open on a drinks-only basis for the first few months until we can renovate the kitchen."" She said it was hoped the pub could reopen on Easter weekend ""all going well"". ""We're in the process of hiring staff and already have a number of local residents lined up which is great, and means we are achieving one of our goals to provide new local employment,"" she added.

Why Northern Ireland's election is very different,"There can be a very long list of candidates in assembly elections The candidates have largely been chosen, campaign posters have been printed and the countdown to 5 May is officially under way. On that day, the next Northern Ireland Assembly election will take place. As with any election, for the political parties doing battle there is much at stake. But in Northern Ireland, it's not simply winner-takes-all once votes have been counted and the final seats declared. Forming a government and deciding policy priorities are the traditional outcomes after elections, when parties have made promises to deliver on pledges. But doing that is more complicated in Northern Ireland for one big reason: no party can govern alone. There's no such thing as winning an outright majority or forming a ""coalition of the willing"", with like-minded parties. That's different from how things usually work in other parts of the UK, but it was purposefully designed this way. Often just referred to as Stormont,Northern Ireland's modern institutions were set up to ensure unionists and nationalists could share power equally, endingdecades of conflict known as the Troubles. It has operated like this since the first election to the devolved assembly took place in 1998. There are 90 seats available in the assembly, the legislative chamber where laws are scrutinised and passed. The Northern Ireland Assembly meets at Stormont But forming the government at Stormont which proposes many of the laws is less straightforward. It's a system known as mandatory coalition. Basically, it means major parties cannot be excluded from government. In practice, this sees parties with opposing political stances having to work together on everything from health to infrastructure and education. Unionist parties favour continuing the union with Britain while nationalist parties support a united Ireland. There is also a growing third bloc of non-aligned parties who, so far, have not taken a position on that issue. After an election, those parties are meant to form the executive. Similar to the cabinet at Westminster, it is the decision-making body for Northern Ireland and is often referred to as the government. Parties are entitled to hold ministerial posts in the executive based on the number of seats they win in the election. Is there an election in my area? Stormont without leadership for third of lifespan For most of the multi-party executive's lifespan, five parties have been entitled to positions. During the election campaign, parties will still publish manifestos with differing priorities on what they want to do in a future government. Stormont has powers to legislate on many areas including health, employment, education, agriculture and the environment, transport, culture, justice and policing. If the parties entitled to form a government after an election do so, it means many pledges competing within a system where any significant policy needs approval from the whole executive. Inevitably it also means other promises end up remaining long-term aspirations, stymied by opposing political perspectives. But agreeing any policy first hinges on the return of a government after the election - and that has already been made trickier due to recent events. The lead jobs in the executive - first minister and deputy first minister - are reserved for the largest party from the largest of the unionist/nationalist blocs and the largest party from the second largest of the blocs. Despite their names, the two roles are joint, and one cannot hold office without the other. Michelle O'Neill lost her position as deputy first minister when Paul Givan resigned Since 2003, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been the largest party in the assembly, followed by nationalists Sinn FÃ©in. In February, the DUP withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. It meantSinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill lost her job as deputy first ministerand that the executive could not take decisions because the first and deputy first ministers must chair all meetings of it. Recent polls have also indicated that Sinn Fein could for the first time win the most seats and be entitled to the first minister role. The DUP has refused to say whether it would agree to share power in this circumstance. After the last assembly election in March 2017, there were three years of stalemate before the executive was re-established. How long it takes this time and who wants to be part of it will factor into the debate as the parties pound the pavement for votes over the next six weeks.

"Energy strategy delayed amid Treasury concernsThe PM promised the plan ""in days"", but the BBC understands the Treasury is worried about costs.UK PoliticsComments","Plans for more renewable energy production in the UK - such as solar panels - are expected in the strategy The government's new energy supply strategy has been delayed, after reports the Treasury resisted some of the costs involved. Boris Johnson promised the plan in ""days"" on 9 March to help tackle energy prices and reduce reliance on Russia. But the date has been pushed back, with a Downing Street spokesman saying the energy strategy would not be released this week as expected. The plan will outline a range of ways to produce more energy in the UK. It is thought to include strategies for nuclear energy and renewable energy, plans to make homes more energy efficient and a route to increasing North Sea oil and gas production. But a source told the BBC that the Treasury had raised concerns about the long-term cost implications of a target Mr Johnson had outlined - producing 25% of the UK's energy through nuclear by 2050 - as nuclear power plants are extremely expensive to build. And sources close to the work said it was the primary area holding the strategy up. Asked during a committee hearing on Monday if he was blocking the strategy, Chancellor Rishi Sunak denied it, saying: ""I am certainly not blocking anything, the prime minister continues to work through the details of that. ""Given how important it is, I think it is important we get it right... and it is being worked out at pace between all the relevant ministers."" PM promises energy plan as Russia gas fears grow The race is on to solve the UK's energy crisis Cabinet split over onshore wind expansion plan The BBC understands there are split opinions over other elements of the strategy, as well as nuclear. Some ministers and Tory MPs had pushed for the government to re-examine fracking, but it is not expected to play a significant role. The government's moratorium on fracking will remain in place unless they believe the science has changed and it is deemed safe. Cabinet ministers are also split on whether planning laws in England should be reviewed to make it easier to approve new onshore wind farms. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and Levelling Up Minister Michael Gove are in favour, but some other cabinet ministers remain opposed. Because some of the targets set out in the strategy will be years - even decades - away, the cost of them would fall outside thecurrent Spending Review period,external. It's understood that commitment to longer-term funding at future spending reviews is one of the complications that has led to delay. It is also understood the strategy will outline community benefits and incentives for renewable energy sources, including onshore wind. An idea being considered by ministers ismaking energy bills cheaper depending how close people live to an onshore wind farm. The PM's official spokesman confirmed the further delay to the strategy on Monday, but said it was ""a significant piece of work"", adding: ""It is right we take the right amount of time to do it. ""We will set out plans for publication as soon as possible."" Meanwhile, the UK is facing a legal challenge from the EU for what it claimed to be ""discriminatory"" practices in the offshore wind sector. In what is thought to be the first post-Brexit case between the two sides at the World Trade Organisation, the bloc said the criteria used by the UK government in awarding subsidies for offshore wind energy projects ""favour UK over imported content"". A statement added: ""The EU has raised its concerns with the UK on several occasions, but to no avail. ""The EU is, therefore, bringing the matter to the WTO and hopes that it can be resolved swiftly."" But a Whitehall source criticised the move, saying the supply chain policy in operation was similar to many schemes in the EU. They added: ""At a time when the West should be united in defeating Putin, this act of envy by Brussels is ill-judged and ill-timed. ""We should be working together to strengthen European clean energy security, not fighting this out in court."" The source added that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng had asked officials to ""rigorously contest the EU's challenge"".

The mega-rich Russians facing sanctions,"The UK, EU, and US governments have responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with devastating sanctions against the billionaire businessmen perceived to be in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. Mr Putin has warned his allies for many years they should protect themselves against such measures, particularly as relations soured with the US and EU countries after the annexation of Crimea. But while some of those closest to him took his advice and remained invested in Russia, others kept their money in palatial properties overseas and football clubs, and their companies remained listed on foreign stock exchanges. They now find themselves scrambling to hold on to their assets amid the most comprehensive economic penalties imposed in the modern era. Here's what we know about some of them. SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK Said to be one of Mr Putin's favourite oligarchs, Alisher Usmanov is also one of the richest, worth an estimated $17.6bn, according toForbes,external. A former professional fencer, the EU describes him as a ""businessman-official"" who helps the president solve his business problems. Born in Uzbekistan while it was still part of the Soviet Union, he runs USM Holdings, a huge conglomerate that involves mining and telecoms, including Russia's second biggest mobile network MegaFon. TheEU announced sanctions against him,externalon 28 February, and theUS,externalandUK,externalhave followed suit. He has called the sanctions unfair and said all the allegations against him were false. Igor Sechin, left, with Vladimir Putin in 2017 USM Holdings appears to be hoping to avoid EU sanctions as he owns just under 50% of the shares. His superyacht Dilbar, named after his mother, is undergoing a refit in Hamburg and is at risk of being seized. In the UK, his main visible investments are in property. In London he owns Beechwood House, a Â£65m country house with grounds in the heart of the city, and just outside London in Surrey, he owns a Tudor mansion, Sutton Place. Both have been frozen by UK authorities. His business partner Farhad Moshiri owns Everton, and Mr Usmanov's companies USM, MegaFon and Yota have been key sponsors at the club, with suggestions his involvement was even closer. Everton suspended the sponsorship deal last week, and Mr Moshiri quit as a USM board member. SANCTIONED BY: UK, EU One of the most high-profile Russian billionaires because of the phenomenal success of his football club Chelsea FC, Roman Abramovich was sanctioned later than some others, possibly because he is less obviously influential than other Putin allies. How influential he is in the Kremlin is much debated. Some suggest he is merely tolerated by Mr Putin, butthe UK believes the two are close,externaland that Mr Abramovich has made money out of the relationship, being awarded lucrative contracts for the FIFA 2018 World Cup in Russia, for example. Mr Abramovich strongly denies having close ties to Mr Putin or the Kremlin, butÂ the UK portion ofÂ hisÂ estimated $12.4bn fortuneÂ isÂ now frozen. Just before the UK sanctions were announced, he put Chelsea up for sale for Â£3bn. His Â£150m house in London's Kensington Palace Gardens in London was also reportedly up for sale. Mr Abramovich made his money in the 1990s and was one of the original oligarchs during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. His biggest break was buying the oil company Sibneft at a knockdown price. His assets include the third-longest yacht in the world, Eclipse, which recently left the British Virgin Isles, heading east across the Atlantic. His otherÂ mega-yacht, Solaris, is in the Mediterranean. He had started to withdraw from the UK in recent years. In 2018 he decided not to apply to renew his UK visa, and has instead been using his newly acquired Israeli passport to visit London. And while he used to go to every Chelsea home game, in recent years he was rarely seen at Stamford Bridge - and now he is banned from entering the UK. SANCTIONED BY: US, UK When President Putin came to power, Oleg Deripaska was immensely rich, his wealth peaking at about $28bn - but he is now thought to be worth a mere$3bn,external. Oleg Deripaska, right, with Mr Putin in 2017 He fought his way to a fortune in the 1990s, coming out on top in a vicious battle for the aluminium industry. The US said he was involved in money laundering, bribery, extortion and racketeering, and reported allegations that he had ""ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group"". He denies the allegations. He suffered badly in the 2008 financial crisis and needed Mr Putin to bail him out. In 2009, President Putin humiliated him by suggesting publicly that he had stolen a pen. Since then, he seems to have worked himself back into favour and was described in the Mueller report - a US investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election - as being ""closely aligned"" with the president. When it announced its sanctions, the UK also described him as closely associated with Mr Putin. He founded a green energy and metals company, En+ Group, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, but  reduced his stake in it to below 50% when he was subjected toUS sanctions in 2018,external. At the time, one of Mr Deripaska's companies, Basic Element, released a statement calling the sanctions ""groundless, ridiculous and absurd"". He owns a vast art deco property, Hamstone House in Weybridge, Surrey, which he has been trying to sell for Â£18m but has now been taken off the market. He also owns a yacht, Clio, which was recently seen in the Maldives. Unlike many sanctioned oligarchs Mr Deripaska has been vocal about his view on the war, taking to social media to call for peace. ""Negotiations need to start as soon as possible!"" he wrote. SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK Igor Sechin's connections to Vladimir Putin run long and deep, according to the EU which announced sanctions against himon 28 February,external. He is said to be one of Mr Putin's most trusted and closest advisors, as well as a personal friend, and the two are thought to be in daily contact. His progress was made through ruthlessly pushing aside opponents - his nickname in the Russian press is Darth Vader. A leaked US embassy cable from 2008 described him as ""so shadowy that it was joked he may not actually exist but rather was a sort of urban myth, a bogeyman, invented by the Kremlin to instil fear"". The US imposed sanctions on him in 2014, which he called ""totally unjustified and illegal"". They announced newsanctions against him on 24 February,external. Mr Sechin has spent his career alternating between jobs in politics and business, sometimes holding senior jobs in both at the same time. When Putin was prime minister, he was a deputy prime minister, and now runs the state oil giant Rosneft. Mr Sechin worked with Mr Putin in the mayor's office in St Petersburg in the 1990s, and is widely believed to have been in the much-feared intelligence service, the KGB, although has never openly admitted it. Based in Russia, no-one knows how much money Mr Sechin has, but the French have seized a yacht called Amore Vero that was linked to him after his second wife Olga Sechina kept posting photographs of herself on board. They have since divorced. Beyond that there is little sign he has substantial wealth overseas that could be easily uncovered, and it may be hard to track down and freeze any more of his assets. SANCTIONED BY: US, UK Alexey Miller is another old friend of Vladimir Putin's. Something of a grey man, he too has built his career on loyalty to the president, starting when he was Mr Putin's deputy on the foreign relations committee of the St Petersburg mayor's office in the 1990s. Alexey Miller, right, with Mr Putin in February this year He has run the immensely powerful state-owned gas company Gazprom since 2001, but it was a surprise appointment and it is widely assumed that he is just carrying out the orders of his old boss. The US ambassador to Moscow in 2009 described Gazprom as ""inefficient, politically driven, and corrupt"". Mr Miller was not sanctioned after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but when he wasadded to the list in the US in 2018,external, he said he was proud. ""Not being included in the first list. I even had some doubts - maybe something is wrong? But I am finally included. This means we are doing everything right,"" he said. He does not appear to have easily traceable assets outside Russia and there is no information about his net worth. SANCTIONED BY: EU, UK The EU describes Pyotr Aven (pictured on the left) as one of President Putin's closest oligarchs, and Mikhail Fridman as an enabler of Putin's inner circle. Together the two men created Alfa-Bank, the largest private bank in Russia. The Mueller report said Mr Aven met with Putin in the Kremlin about four times a year, saying he ""understood any suggestions or critiques Putin made during these meetings were implicit directives, and there would be consequences for Aven if he did not follow through"". They were warned by Mr Putin in 2016 to protect their interests from future sanctions. This week the pair stood down from the London-headquartered LetterOne investment group they founded almost 10 years ago because their shares werefrozen by EU sanctions on 28 February,external. Mr Aven also stood down as a trustee of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. The two businessmen said they would ""contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions - vigorously and through all means available to them"". Mr Fridman, thought to be wortharound $12bn,external, lives in London in a house next to Lord's Cricket Ground and also owns a huge property, Athlone House in north London, that he paid Â£65m for in 2016. At a London press conference on 1 March, he said the Ukraine war was a ""huge tragedy"" but would not criticise the Kremlin directly saying to do so could put the jobs of hundreds of thousands of employees at risk.

Roman Abramovich: From orphan to billionaire oligarch,"He became an orphan aged three but went on to become one of the world's richest men. Now Roman Abramovich's links to Vladimir Putin have stripped him of his businesses and reputation. ""I'm sure people will focus on me for three or four days but it will pass,"" said the Russian billionaire when he bought Chelsea Football Club in 2003. ""They'll forget who I am, and I like that."" There's little chance of anonymity now, given the events of the last few weeks. Following years of demands for greater scrutiny of Mr Abramovich's dealings, the UK government has frozen his UK-held assets - including his homes, artworks and Chelsea FC - and imposed a travel ban. It has accused him of being complicit with Mr Putin in the invasion of Ukraine. This fall from grace for a man who has dominated British football but sharply divided sports fans in the process will be cheered by some. But he has overcome huge challenges before, notably in his early life. Roman Arkadyevich Abramovich was born in Saratov in south-western Russia, a few hundred miles from the border with Ukraine, in 1966. His mother, Irina, died of blood poisoning when he was one year old and his father died two years later after an accident with a construction crane. After that Mr Abramovich was raised by relatives, spending time in Komi, in north-west Russia, where money was tight and winter temperatures low. ""To tell the truth I cannot call my childhood bad,"" he once told the Guardian in a rare interview. ""In your childhood you can't compare things: one eats carrots, one eats candy, both taste good. As a child you cannot tell the difference."" As a young conscript He left school at 16, worked as a mechanic and served in the Red Army before selling plastic toys in Moscow. He moved on to perfumes and deodorants, building up his wealth as greater openness under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev allowed more scope for entrepreneurs. The disintegration of the Soviet Union, and with it state command of mineral assets, provided more opportunities, and in his mid-20s, Mr Abramovich had a further stroke of good fortune. He seized the oil company Sibneft from the Russian government in a rigged auction in 1995 for around $250m (Â£190m). He sold it back to the government for $13bn (Â£9.9bn ) in 2005. His lawyers say there is no basis for alleging he amassed very substantial wealth through criminality. However, in 2012, he admitted in a UK court that he had made corrupt payments to help get the Sibneft deal going. Abramovich, far left, with friends in Moscow in his younger days He became involved in the ""aluminium wars"" of the 1990s, in which oligarchs - those who had accrued vast fortunes and political power after the Soviet collapse - fought for control of this vast industry. ""Every three days, someone was being murdered,"" Mr Abramovich said in 2011, adding that this threat to his safety had made him a reluctant participant. But Mr Abramovich further proved his own toughness, accruing hundreds of millions of pounds amid the chaos. Secret paper highlights corrupt Abramovich deals He became an ally of President Boris Yeltsin and a player in Moscow's post-Soviet political scene, even having an apartment in the Kremlin for a while. When Mr Yeltsin resigned in 1999, Mr Abramovich was reportedly among those to back the prime minister and former KGB spy, Vladimir Putin, as his successor. As Mr Putin established himself, he sought to assert his dominance over the oligarchs. Some went to prison, and others were exiled if they failed to show allegiance. He served as governor of Chukotka in Putin's early days as president Mr Abramovich suffered neither fate. In 2000, he was elected as governor of the deprived region of Chukotka, at the north-eastern tip of Russia. He gained popularity after investing his own money in social services but stepped down in 2008. All the while, he kept his business interests going, taking on the trappings of wealth - buying up paintings, houses, cars. In an unusual move for a man widely described as quiet, even shy, in 2003 Mr Abramovich made himself famous around the footballing world when he purchased Chelsea, west London's largest club, in a deal worth Â£140m. ""My whole philosophy in life is to bring in professional teams,"" hetold the Financial Times.,external""In Chukotka I have professional teams on the ground and I will do this here too."" Under the management of Jose Mourinho and others, Mr Abramovich's wealth helped Chelsea towards five Premier Leagues, two Champions Leagues and five FA Cups. The Abramovich years have brought unprecedented success to Chelsea FC Oligarchs' money has flooded into London in recent years. Mr Abramovich's own property portfolio is believed to include a15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly worth more than Â£150m; a flat in Chelsea; a ranch in Colorado; and a holiday home on the French Riviera. His yachts - the Solaris and the Eclipse - are among the world's largest. Mr Abramovich, who has been divorced three times, also owns a personal jet. Asked by the Guardian in 2006 about what money can do for a person, he replied: ""It cannot buy you happiness. Some independence, yes."" He certainly has plenty of money. Financial media giantBloomberg estimates Mr Abramovich's fortune,externalat $13.7bn (Â£10.6bn), ranking him as the world's 128th richest person. Its rivalForbes sets it at $12.3bn (Â£9.4bn),,externalplacing him 142nd. What is under severe question, though, is the extent of his independence from Mr Putin. Last year, Mr Abramovich sued publishing House HarperCollins for libel over a book, Putin's People by Catherine Belton, that claimed the Russian president had ordered him to buy Chelsea. Roman Abramovich owns two superyachts, including Solaris (pictured here in Barcelona) The two sides settled out of court, with the publisher agreeing to make some clarifications. But Mr Abramovich's associations with Mr Putin have continued to dog him, particularly when Russian forces built up on the border with Ukraine and then invaded. When the freezing of the UK assets of Mr Abramovich and six other oligarchs was announced, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""With their close links to Putin, they are complicit in his aggression. The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands."" Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Mr Abramovich announced the sale of Chelsea eight days before the sanctions were imposed. Some fans have continued to chant Mr Abramovich's name, but many politicians are calling for his assets to be seized, not just frozen. ""I hope that I will be able to visit Stamford Bridge one last time to say goodbye to all of you in person,"" Mr Abramovich has told Chelsea supporters. But a return to west London is unlikely for some time. In a bizarre twist, it has now emerged thatMr Abramovich suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning - along with senior Ukrainian negotiators -at peace talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border in early March.

Secret hit squad linked to murdered Putin rival,"People marching in memory of Boris Nemtsov in Moscow, 2015 Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was shadowed by an agent linked to a political assassination team for almost a year before he was shot dead, an investigation has found. Nemtsov was a fierce adversary of President Vladimir Putin. His murder in 2015 is the highest-profile political killing since Putin came to power. The authorities deny any involvement. Bellingcat, The Insider and the BBC found evidence that Nemtsov was shadowed on 13 trips before his murder. Boris Nemtsov rose to prominence in the 1990s, served as deputy prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin, and was widely tipped to be Yeltsin's successor. Instead, Mr Putin came to power and Mr Nemtsov was pushed to the margins of Russian politics. He became an effective campaigner, exposing corruption and denouncing Russia's 2014 attack on eastern Ukraine. On 27 February 2015, Mr Nemtsov was shot dead just yards from the Kremlin, and just days before he was due to lead a protest against the war. Five men of Chechen origin were quickly arrested and later jailed for his murder. But the official investigation left the most urgent questions unanswered: who ordered the killing and why? Seven years later, the BBC - working with the investigative websites Bellingcat and The Insider - can reveal evidence that in the months running up to the killing, Nemtsov was being followed across Russia by a government agent linked to a secret assassination squad. Using leaked train and flight reservation data, the investigation shows that Mr Nemtsov was followed on at least 13 journeys. The last time the agent followed Mr Nemtsov was on 17 February 2015, just 10 days before the assassination. Boris Nemtsov attends a protest rally against alleged vote rigging in Russia's parliamentary elections on 10 December, 2011 in Moscow According to his documents, the agent's name is Valery Sukharev. All the evidence suggests that at the time, he served with the FSB, Russia's main security agency. One of the mandates of the FSB is to manage internal political threats on behalf of the Kremlin, including monitoring movements of people across the country. All flight and train reservations are recorded in an FSB database called Magistral. But the database not only captures the movements of people Russian agents might want to track, it can also be used to reveal the movements of the agents themselves - people like Mr Sukharev. This kind of information is often leaked on to the black market and ends up in the hands of journalists. ""In a corrupt society like Russia, [Magistral] is a double-edged sword,"" says Christo Grozev, executive director of Bellingcat. ""And it allows people like us to actually go and tail these same spies, these same FSB officers."" Watch the full investigation on BBC iPlayer Some of the original data for this investigation was bought by Bellingcat through brokers inside Russia. Those brokers acquired the data from corrupt officials who have access to Magistral. The BBC also used data that was given to us, without payment, from sources who have access to copies of Magistral. Bellingcat has previously used data from Magistral to investigate assassination attempts in Russia. Their investigations revealed evidence of the existence of a secret hit squad within the FSB, which has targeted opponents of the Kremlin. The Russian government has always denied these allegations. For this investigation, we got hold of the train and flight reservations made by Mr Sukharev - and when we compared them to the known movements of Boris Nemtsov, an unmistakable pattern emerged. This video can not be played A visualisation of the trips taken by a secret agent and opposition politician Boris Nemtsov in the year before he was murdered Most of Mr Nemtsov's trips took him from Moscow, where he lived, to Yaroslavl - 272km (169 miles) north-east of the capital - where he sat in the regional parliament. It appears that Mr Sukharev knew Mr Nemtsov's plans in advance, because he often arrived in the same city just minutes or hours ahead of Mr Nemtsov. One trip in particular reveals just how closely Mr Nemtsov was being tracked. In the summer of 2014 he travelled to Siberia. Mr Nemtsov booked his flight online on 2 July just after midnight. Exactly 10 minutes later, Mr Sukharev bought a ticket to the same destination, Novosibirsk, arriving on the same day as Mr Nemtsov. An FSB agent could use Magistral to track a target with this degree of precision, according to Mr Grozev. ""If you're an FSB officer, you would just be able to log into that database and see, for a particular person, all of the tickets that they're purchasing, have purchased, or are buying at this very moment,"" he told the BBC. It is not unusual in Russia for security agencies to keep tabs on prominent opposition leaders. But Mr Sukharev was not just a low-ranking FSB recruit on routine business. Bellingcat,in a previous investigation, linked him to two apparent assassination attempts, both aimed at prominent critics of Mr Putin. The first target was Mr Nemtsov's friend and protege Vladimir Kara-Murza, an opposition politician who, in the weeks after the shooting, was already pointing the finger of blame at the Kremlin. In May 2015, Sukharev was part of a team that went to the Russian city of Kazan at the same time as Mr Kara-Murza. Two days after Mr Kara-Murza returned to Moscow he collapsed unable to breathe. He fell into a coma and suffered multiple organ failure but recovered. He was poisoned for a second time in 2017, and once again survived. The Russian government rejects the allegation that their operatives were involved in the poisonings. Russian agent Valery Sukharev The second target was Alexei Navalny, the now-jailed opposition leader whose anti-corruption videos have reached millions of Russians. In 2020, Mr Navalny was poisoned using Novichok, a nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union and banned under international law. Bellingcat established that an FSB team tracked Mr Navalny to the eastern city of Tomsk immediately before the poisoning. It found that Mr Sukharev was not part of the ground team that physically followed Mr Navalny. But phone logs reveal that, in the months immediately before the poisoning, Mr Sukharev exchanged 145 phone calls or texts with at least four members of that team, as well as with an FSB officer further up the chain of command. Four of these men were among the seven FSB agents later sanctioned by the US and UK governments for their involvement in the attempted assassination. The Russian government has always denied any involvement in the poisoning of Mr Navalny. The BBC asked the Russian government and the FSB to comment on the evidence that Mr Nemtsov was being shadowed by an agent linked to an assassination squad. The Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: ""All of this has nothing to do with the Russian government. It looks like another fabrication."" The FSB did not respond.

Energy strategy delayed amid Treasury concerns,"Plans for more renewable energy production in the UK - such as solar panels - are expected in the strategy The government's new energy supply strategy has been delayed, after reports the Treasury resisted some of the costs involved. Boris Johnson promised the plan in ""days"" on 9 March to help tackle energy prices and reduce reliance on Russia. But the date has been pushed back, with a Downing Street spokesman saying the energy strategy would not be released this week as expected. The plan will outline a range of ways to produce more energy in the UK. It is thought to include strategies for nuclear energy and renewable energy, plans to make homes more energy efficient and a route to increasing North Sea oil and gas production. But a source told the BBC that the Treasury had raised concerns about the long-term cost implications of a target Mr Johnson had outlined - producing 25% of the UK's energy through nuclear by 2050 - as nuclear power plants are extremely expensive to build. And sources close to the work said it was the primary area holding the strategy up. Asked during a committee hearing on Monday if he was blocking the strategy, Chancellor Rishi Sunak denied it, saying: ""I am certainly not blocking anything, the prime minister continues to work through the details of that. ""Given how important it is, I think it is important we get it right... and it is being worked out at pace between all the relevant ministers."" PM promises energy plan as Russia gas fears grow The race is on to solve the UK's energy crisis Cabinet split over onshore wind expansion plan The BBC understands there are split opinions over other elements of the strategy, as well as nuclear. Some ministers and Tory MPs had pushed for the government to re-examine fracking, but it is not expected to play a significant role. The government's moratorium on fracking will remain in place unless they believe the science has changed and it is deemed safe. Cabinet ministers are also split on whether planning laws in England should be reviewed to make it easier to approve new onshore wind farms. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and Levelling Up Minister Michael Gove are in favour, but some other cabinet ministers remain opposed. Because some of the targets set out in the strategy will be years - even decades - away, the cost of them would fall outside thecurrent Spending Review period,external. It's understood that commitment to longer-term funding at future spending reviews is one of the complications that has led to delay. It is also understood the strategy will outline community benefits and incentives for renewable energy sources, including onshore wind. An idea being considered by ministers ismaking energy bills cheaper depending how close people live to an onshore wind farm. The PM's official spokesman confirmed the further delay to the strategy on Monday, but said it was ""a significant piece of work"", adding: ""It is right we take the right amount of time to do it. ""We will set out plans for publication as soon as possible."" Meanwhile, the UK is facing a legal challenge from the EU for what it claimed to be ""discriminatory"" practices in the offshore wind sector. In what is thought to be the first post-Brexit case between the two sides at the World Trade Organisation, the bloc said the criteria used by the UK government in awarding subsidies for offshore wind energy projects ""favour UK over imported content"". A statement added: ""The EU has raised its concerns with the UK on several occasions, but to no avail. ""The EU is, therefore, bringing the matter to the WTO and hopes that it can be resolved swiftly."" But a Whitehall source criticised the move, saying the supply chain policy in operation was similar to many schemes in the EU. They added: ""At a time when the West should be united in defeating Putin, this act of envy by Brussels is ill-judged and ill-timed. ""We should be working together to strengthen European clean energy security, not fighting this out in court."" The source added that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng had asked officials to ""rigorously contest the EU's challenge"".

Boris Becker reveals embarrassment over bankruptcy,"Ex-tennis star Boris Becker has spoken of his shock and embarrassment at being declared bankrupt, as a trial into his alleged failure to declare assets continues. The six-time Grand Slam champion told Southwark Crown Court the bad publicity damaged ""brand Becker"" and reduced his earnings. Mr Becker was declared bankrupt in 2017 and is accused of failing to hand over assets including trophies and medals. He denies 24 charges against him. The court heard the bankruptcy decision came days before that year's two-week Wimbledon tournament, where he was working for the BBC as well as Australian and Japanese television. Becker said he felt ""very embarrassed"", adding: ""Because it was all over world news, and I walked through the gate of Wimbledon and everyone knew. I was embarrassed because I was bankrupt."" He told jurors the bankruptcy was also in the midst of a ""stressful time"" with his then wife Sharlely ""Lilly"" Becker, while they were living in ""separate quarters"" at a Â£22,000-a-month rented house in Wimbledon, south-west London. Becker, who arrived at court hand in hand with his partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, sat at the witness box on Monday to give evidence, as the jury was told he has injuries to his ankle and knees. His barrister, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, took him through his career after he was catapulted to stardom when he became the youngest player to win the Wimbledon men's singles titles, aged 17, in 1985. The court heard the former world number one earned a ""vast amount"" of money, winning about $50 million (Â£38m) in prize money and sponsorship deals. He said he helped his parents build a house in his native Germany and paid cash for a family home in Munich, a property in Miami, Florida, and an estate in Mallorca, which was worth about â¬50 million (Â£42m) at the height of the property market. But Becker, who went on to coach current world number one tennis player Novak Djokovic, work as a BBC commentator and act as a brand ambassador for firms including Puma, said his earnings ""reduced dramatically"" following his retirement in 1999. He said he was involved in an ""expensive divorce"" from ex-wife Barbara Becker in 2001, involving high maintenance payments to their two sons, and had to support his daughter Anna Ermakova and her mother, in a deal which included a Â£2.5m Chelsea flat. German national Becker, who was resident in Monte Carlo and Switzerland before moving to the UK in 2012, said he had ""expensive lifestyle commitments"", including millions owed to Swiss authorities as well as in Germany. He said the bankruptcy had restricted his ability to earn money, explaining: ""[It is] very difficult when you are bankrupt and in the headlines every week for it. [It is] very difficult to make a lot of money with my name."" The 24 charges Mr Becker has been accused of include: Nine counts of failing to deliver up trophies and other awards Seven counts of concealing property totalling more than â¬1.5m Five counts of failing to disclose estate, including the properties in Germany and London, shares and a bank account Two of removal of property amounting to almost â¬500,000 One of concealing â¬825,000 of debt The trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues.

Sainsbury's urged to up pay to match cost of living,"A group of major investors is calling on Sainsbury's to commit to paying all its workers the Real Living Wage to tackle the rising cost of living. The Real Living Wage aims to ensure wages cover everyday needs and is voluntarily paid by around 9,500 firms. It is higher than the compulsory national minimum wage. Sainsbury's staff in inner London and outside the capital are now paid the Real Living Wage but staff in outer London are not. The supermarket has also made no commitment relating to the pay of third-party staff, such as cleaners and security guards. Sainsbury's said it had recently increased its basic hourly rate by 5.3% in recognition of the ""extraordinary work"" of its staff. The investor coalition, brought together by responsible investment charity ShareAction, includes the UK's largest asset manager, Legal and General Investment Management, and the largest workplace pension scheme, Nest. It also includes 108 individual shareholders, including Labour MPs Siobhain McDonagh and Helen Hayes. How much is the minimum wage? Why are prices rising so quickly? The group has filed a shareholder resolution calling for Sainsbury's to become an accredited Living Wage employer. Shareholders will get to vote on the proposal at the supermarket's annual general meeting in July. The resolution will be binding if investors representing 75% or more of Sainsbury's shares vote in favour of the move. The group will also write to all UK supermarkets next week urging them to take the same step. Half of the companies listed on the FTSE 100 share index areamong the more than 9,500 accredited Living Wage employers,external. Retailers such as Ikea have also committed to paying the Real Living Wage but no major supermarkets are accredited. The Real Living Wage is currently Â£11.05 in London and Â£9.90 for the rest of the UK. In January,Sainsbury's announced it was increasing its basic rate of pay from Â£9.50 to Â£10 an hourfor staff across its supermarkets and Argos stores, following competitors such as Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi who announced similar moves last year. The new rate is higher than the Real Living Wage for outside the capital. For staff in inner London it pays Â£11.05 an hour which matches the Real Living Wage. However, its rate of Â£10.50 for workers in outer London is lower than the Real Living Wage for that region. Sainsbury's, which has more than 600 supermarkets and 189,000 employees, has also made no commitment to continue increasing pay in line with the Real Living Wage in the future. The Real Living Wage is set by the Living Wage Foundation charity and is different to the national minimum wage, which sets out the minimum a worker can be paid per hour by law. The National Living Wage, which applies to workers over the age of 23, is currently Â£8.91 per hour, increasing to Â£9.50 per hour from 1 April. The National Minimum Wage, for those aged 21 to 22, will rise from Â£8.36 to Â£9.18 from 1 April. People in the UK are facing increased pressure from living costs, with inflation rising at its fastest rate for 30 years amid surging fuel, energy and food prices. The Independent Food Aid Networkhas reported that it has seen an increase in supermarket workers using its foodbanks during the pandemic,external. Martin Buttle, head of good work at ShareAction, said: ""Low paid workers in the supermarket sector are being hit incredibly hard by rising living costs, yet we all owe them so much following the pandemic. We hope this resolution will catalyse long overdue change."" A spokeswoman for Sainsbury's said: ""We pay more than many of our competitors, and across the board colleague feedback has been positive to our pay review. ""As we balance the needs of all our stakeholders, particularly in the light of the current cost of living challenges that many people in the UK face, it is vital that we not only pay our colleagues fairly but that we are able to invest significantly to offer customers great value."" Sainsbury's raises pay to Â£10 an hour Real Living Wage rises to Â£9.90 an hour Minimum wage for 23 year-olds to rise to Â£9.50 How much will the minimum wage rise by?

Civilians trapped as hospitals and schools attacked,"A school building that was partially destroyed by Russian shelling in the city earlier this month The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has been almost completely encircled by Russian forces and left without electricity, gas or running water. Tens of thousands of people remain trapped. Some have described civilian buildings and residential areas being deliberately targeted. The strikes are so frequent that Anna and her husband take turns in watching the sky. He does the nights, she does the mornings. ""The attacks are extremely loud. The building and windows shake a lot,"" she said. It is impossible to sleep. ""Only when you're exhausted, because your brain just turns off."" The couple, and probably everyone else left in Chernihiv, spend most of their time hiding behind thick walls. ""Thank God we have them,"" Anna said. Their son, who is 12, rarely ventures outside. ""He's in panic. Many children are afraid of going out."" Chernihiv, located on the banks of the Desna River, was one of the first targets for Russian troops who invaded Ukraine from Belarus, hoping to quickly reach the capital Kyiv, just 144km (90 miles) to the south. A month on, that has not happened, and they have now effectively surrounded the city. Civilians are trapped with no running water, electricity and heating, and under relentless bombing and shelling. And like Mariupol, the besieged city on the Sea of Azov that has seen the worst of Russia's brutality, very little seems to remain untouched. Hospitals. Schools. A cinema. The stadium. Historic and residential buildings. All attacked, Anna said. ""They hit [sites] two times in a row. It's obvious they do it on purpose,"" she said. ""Most of the city suburbs are completely destroyed."" A number of residential areas in Chernihiv have been heavily damaged by Russia's attacks Olena, another resident, said the only thing still standing from the cinema was its faÃ§ade. ""It's destroyed. Totally. I saw it with my own eyes"". ""In the suburbs, there were only private buildings. My friends say they are all totally destroyed,"" Olena said. (The names of the civilians interviewed for this story have been changed to protect their identities as they remain in the city.) Most days, Olena walks, sometimes for more than an hour, in search of drinkable water. She often has to endure long queues, as people bring bottles and buckets at distribution points organised by the city council. Supplies are running out, and each person is allowed to have only 10 litres. Without electricity, the only way for her and others to charge their phones and power banks is when one of her neighbours lets them use his generator. Gas has also been cut, meaning there is no heating. ""We don't even talk about it,"" she said, ""because it's now part of our routine"". Ruins of the city's historic Hotel Ukraine, which was destroyed by an airstrike Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv region, said half of the city's population of 280,000 had left since the start of the war. After Russia bombed a bridge on a road to the capital last week, Chernihiv had been ""cut off"", he said, and residents had nowhere to go, including those requiring treatment for wounds caused by the attacks. ""There is no safe way out."" Russia was attacking the city ""every 10 or 15 minutes"", Chaus said, and  civilian facilities were being hit ""on purpose"". ""They have targeted residential buildings, schools, hospitals, kindergartens and the stadium,"" he said. It is difficult to independently verify information in Chernihiv, although residents' accounts, pictures and satellite images corroborate some of his claims. Mariia, who remains in the city, said she believed there was no area that had not been hit. ""A lot of hospitals and schools were attacked,"" she said. ""A school was attacked twice in a single week."" Russia has denied targeting civilian sites in Ukraine. But its attacks on countless apartment blocks and other non-military facilities have been well documented across the country. In a single attack on 3 March, 47 people including nine women were killed as they gathered in a small square in the city, the state government said. Human rights group Amnesty International said the attack was mostly likely a Russian air strike in which at least eight unguided aerial bombs, known as ""dumb bombs"", were used. ""Amnesty International was not able to identify a legitimate military target at, or close to, the scene of the strike,"" the group said. ""[We believe] the majority of victims were queuing for food when the missiles struck."" Satellite image taken on 16 March shows a sports training centre damaged in the city This image shows a destroyed Epicenter K shopping centre on 10 March Chaus, the governor, said about 200 people had already died in Chernihiv, probably an underestimate. Some bodies were believed to remain under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, and ""we're still trying to collect them"". Mariia's family live in constant panic. ""We stay in the bunker all the time,"" she said. ""We hear the attacks very well."" Anna said she was in ""survival mode"". ""I'm just very focused. I know when there is bombing I need to get into a safer place,"" she said. ""I no longer have fear.""

No investigation for Noel Clarke harassment claims,"Actor Noel Clarke will not face a criminal investigation over sexual offence allegations, police have said. The Metropolitan Police says there is not enough evidence against him. In 2021, The Guardian newspaper published allegations of misconduct from 20 women who had worked with Clarke. The incidents included complaints of groping and sexual misconduct between 2004 and 2019.  He has denied all allegations. The Met has released a statement saying special detectives had carried out a ""thorough assessment"" of the claims, but ""determined the information would not meet the threshold for a criminal investigation"". BBC shocked by fresh Noel Clarke allegations Women make claims against Noel Clarke Clarke, who is best known for his work in Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood, has always ""vehemently"" denied ""any sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing"". The 46-year-old has previously said he was ""deeply sorry"" if some of his actions had affected people ""in ways I did not intend or realise"", and vowed to get professional help ""to educate myself and change for the better"". Last year, Sky stopped producing Clarke's series Bulletproof following the allegations. Bafta also suspended his membership after awarding him the Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema title.

Teenage social media use linked to lower wellbeing,"The more time girls aged between 11 and 13 spend on social media, the less likely they are to be satisfied with life a year later, a study suggests. The UK study,in Nature Communications,,externalshows the same pattern for boys aged 14 to 15, and 19-year-old boys and girls. Scientists speculate the vulnerability to social media at particular ages may be linked to brain, hormonal and social changes during adolescent development. They say more research is needed to fully understand and prove the link. Researchers, from the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford and the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, say social media companies need to share more of their own data with scientists to allow further research. Experts say social media can be a force for good, such as helping young people maintain social contact during the Covid pandemic. Lead researcher Dr Amy Orben said the link between social media use and mental wellbeing was very complex, with studies so far showing mixed results. She added: ""Changes within our bodies, such as brain development and puberty, and in our social circumstances appear to make us vulnerable at particular times of our lives. ""We can now focus on the periods of adolescence where we know we might be most at risk, and use this as a springboard to explore some really interesting questions."" Researchers examined a large UK household survey of more than 72,000 people, who were asked to report how satisfied they were with life and how much time they spent talking to friends on social media on a typical day. They were surveyed up to seven times between 2011 and 2018. Young adolescents showed the most negative relationship between social media use and life satisfaction overall. The self-reported survey found: The 16 to 21-year-olds who said they had no or very high (more than seven hours) daily social media use reported lower life satisfaction than those who used up to three hours Those younger than that showed a different pattern - with life satisfaction generally declining with greater social media use Scientists then focused on a smaller group of 17,409 10 to 21-year-olds to investigate whether present day social media use has an impact on future life satisfaction. They looked at snapshot surveys of each person's self-reported life-satisfaction and self-reported social media use over seven years. The study suggests among girls aged 11 to 13, those who had increased their social media in the last 12 months use were less satisfied with life a year later. Researchers say their work cannot predict which individuals are most at risk. And they say many other factors - such as the exact nature of social media content and the people they are interacting with online - will have an impact on teenage well-being too. They accept for some people, social media will have an overall positive impact, allowing them to connect with friends and find valuable support. Prof Bernadka Dubicka, an expert in child mental health at the University of Manchester, said: ""This is an interesting study, reflects the complexity seen in vulnerable adolescents in clinical practice, and finally moves away from the unhelpful dichotomy about whether social media is or isn't harmful. ""This study only covers a period up to 2018 - since then, social media use has become ever more prominent in young people's lives, particularly during the pandemic, and emotional difficulties, notably in older adolescent girls, have risen significantly. ""It will be vital to build on this research to understand both the harmful as well as supportive role of social media in young people's lives.""

Labour's Dawn Butler diagnosed with breast cancer,"This video can not be played Dawn Butler was diagnosed with breast cancer in December Labour MP Dawn Butler has told the BBC she has undergone surgery after being diagnosed with breast cancer at a routine check-up. The MP for Brent Central, 52, was given the news in December and recently had a mastectomy at Royal London Hospital. She said she had no signs or symptoms and the cancer was only picked up because of routine breast screening. ""A mammogram saved my life,"" she told the BBC. ""Without a mammogram, my cancer wouldn't have been discovered."" After a follow-up biopsy, the politician was asked to see a surgeon the next day. It was at that moment she knew she had cancer, she said. ""It was so overwhelming,"" she said. ""The first thing I thought was, 'I'm dying'. I thought, 'I've probably got 24 hours to live'. That was my first reaction."" Due to Covid, she was alone in the hospital room when the diagnosis was confirmed by the surgeon. The MP said she immediately worried she would require chemotherapy and feared: ""I'm going to lose all my hair."" However, she was told the cancer was contained in one area, and they should be able to ""just remove it"". The surgeon told her she would require an operation ""to cut it out"". The Labour politician returned to her family to tell them she had ""some bad news"", adding: ""But I'm not dying."" Public told not to delay cancer check-ups One million UK women may have missed breast scans Watch Victoria Derbyshire's full interview with Dawn Butler on BBC iPlayer Ms Butler, whose mum and sister both survived breast cancer, initially shared the diagnosis with only her partner and sister-in-law. She said the notion of sharing her diagnosis more widely led to her having a panic attack. ""I thought, 'I'm going to need to go public'. And I just had a panic attack. ""This was probably about midnight. And I'm thinking 'oh my goodness', and I just started feeling myself overheating."" Breast screening uses a breast x-ray, called a mammogram, to look for cancer that may be too small to see, or feel. In the UK, women aged 50-71 who are registered with a GP are invited for a mammogram every three years as part of a national breast-screening programme. The sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chances of survival. According to the charity Breast Cancer Now, more than 80% of breast cancers occur in women over 50 and the risk continues to increase with age. The NHS says anyone with any symptom of breast cancer should see a GP - even if you have recently had a clear breast scan. For more information visit theNHS website,external. A leading charity estimated almost one million women in the UK missed vital breast screening during the first coronavirus lockdown, when programmes were paused. At the time, Breast Cancer Now estimated around 8,600 women who had missed a scan were likely to have undetected breast cancer. Ms Butler has now urged all women to go for a mammogram as soon as they're asked to. ""There'll be women who will die if their breast cancer is not discovered, and needlessly so,"" she added. The MP said she was incredibly grateful to the NHS medics who treated her. ""I'm not going to forget what they've done for me,"" she added. ""I'm not going to forget the effort that they put in, and how they don't always feel valued. They've saved my life - I know it's what they do - but they really are sort of superheroes."" She said the operation was a ""complete success"" and that she will ""make a full recovery"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he and the party were supporting Ms Butler. ""Dawn, your bravery, strength and determination shine through,"" he said. ""I am sorry you're going through this, but know that I, and the whole party, are behind you."" Ms Butler is now taking time off work to recover from surgery, but said she plans to throw herself into more campaigning. Asked what message she wants to get across, she added: ""Please go for your mammogram. Just book it and go.""

Rules on masks and self-isolation end in Wales,"This video can not be played Dalila Tremarias fears those who have been shielding will be left behind It is no longer the law to wear a mask in shops or on buses and trains in Wales from Monday as more Covid restrictions are scrapped. Two years into the pandemic, self-isolation rules have also ended but it will still be a legal requirement to wear a mask in health and social care settings. BBC Wales visited Barry to ask people how they felt about the changes. Views were mixed, as some welcomed the move while others urged caution. Covid infections continue to rise in Wales Wales' mask law to end in shops, but not NHS Welsh mask and isolation rules could be extended Vicky McDonald owns a chocolate shop on Barry's High Street. It was her birthday on Sunday and she said the end of masks being legally required in retail ""feels like a lovely present from Drakeford"". She said it had been hard running a business through Covid ""having to keep up with constantly evolving regulations"". ""Personally I welcome the lifting of masks and restrictions just because I'm really keen to get back to normal life,"" she said. ""I find it really hard to communicate with customers with the mask on as well. ""It's hard to gauge what they're feeling about their experience in the shop."" Builders Ian Toomey and Trevor Dell say they will be keeping their masks on when they are working Down the road, builders Ian Toomey and Trevor Dell took a different view. ""We should keep the face masks in all built-up areas, football stadiums, rugby matches, everywhere where you get a good crowd,"" Mr Dell said. ""My wife's a cleaner in a school and they're still dropping off like anything with Covid. ""It hasn't gone past that peak to do away with it yet."" Mr Toomey said he thought Covid was getting less attention in the media because of Ukraine and he and Mr Dell would continue to wear masks when they are working. ""We wear masks in people's homes, we wear masks in building suppliers, wherever we go where there's other people, we wear masks,"" he said. Mr Dell was also concerned about the financial impact of catching Covid. ""What happens when you've got to take a week off work and the benefits aren't there to uphold your living standards?"" he said. ""With the price of living going up, who can afford to take time off?"" While the legal obligation to self-isolate has gone, the Welsh government is still advising people with Covid to self-isolate. The Â£500 support payments for some people isolating will remain available until June, it has been confirmed. Pauline Meyrick thinks face mask laws should have stayed Pauline Meyrick, 66, lives in Spain, but was back in Barry visiting family. She said she thought the rules on masks should have been kept in place for ""public transport, doctors, shopping"". ""I just think it's safer for everyone,"" she said. ""They're very strict in Spain, you've got to wear your mask shopping and as soon as you go out through the door."" At Barry railway station, Jen Ao Ieong was about to commute to Cardiff where she works in an art shop. Jen Ao Ieong commutes to work and has already noticed passengers not wearing masks She noticed that some passengers were already not wearing masks. ""I think people are mentally there already,"" she said. She thought others would still wear them as it had become ""part of our culture"". ""But it's nice that people don't have to implement it. For staff, it's not on them anymore."" Mauro Zeraschi, who owns Sophia's Souvenirs on Barry Island, agreed that people working in shops have often been in a difficult position. ""Trying to enforce it when you have no power to can be tricky,"" he said. He added that he thought lifting the rules was ""the right choice"". ""Majority of people I know are double-vaccinated and boosted and as long as you're careful, and if you do catch Covid you're going to isolate."" Dalia Tremarias, from Cardiff, said ""no restrictions means more restriction"" for those who are at a higher risk of Covid. Ms Tremarias haslupus,external, an auto-immune condition that attacks her body, and has been shielding for most of the pandemic. Dalila Tremarias fears those who have been shielding will be left behind ""I think that the condition should be given for everyone to move on - not just a few but everyone - don't leave anyone behind,"" she said. ""The virus is still there. You have to think about friends and family who you don't really know how they will react to the virus."" She said she would like to see mental health support for those who are ""going from shielding to being face-to-face"" with Covid. Matthew Hunt, director of Filco Supermarkets in the Vale of Glamorgan, said staff were generally relieved about restrictions easing but he feared it could be a worry for some. He toldBBC Radio Walesstaff working next to people who may have Covid and not required to self-isolate ""could create real anxiety in the team"". ""We haven't been able to adjust that yet [self-isolation changes], because we haven't seen the detail of the legislation - that's an issue."" Lewis and Gabrielle Evans, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, were on a visit to Barry Island with their six-week-old daughter Myla. Lewis said he would continue to wear a mask on public transport. ""I still don't think it's 100% safe,"" he said. Gabrielle added: ""Since having Myla I don't really want to risk giving her anything, her catching anything, so I'll still be wearing a mask."" Willadene Young feels cautious because of her health issues Willadene Young, who was on a day trip from Watchet in Somerset, was feeling cautious too. She said she felt vulnerable to the virus as she had ""a lot of medical conditions"". ""I'm basically quite well but I just don't want to risk it because I don't know what effect it would have on me,"" she said. ""I would prefer in public places and especially public transport that masks were still worn.""

"Mental health inquiry hears of 1,500 deaths","Melanie Leahy, seen here with her late son Matthew, campaigned for the public inquiry but was now leading a boycott of it A public inquiry has learned of the deaths of 1,500 people who were in the care of Essex mental health services over a 21-year period. They were either inpatients or individuals who died within three months of being discharged. Dr Geraldine Strathdee, chairwoman of the inquiry, said ""at this stage we only know the causes of death in 40% of those people"". She appealed for more people to come forward. The inquiry began taking evidence from the public in December and is ongoing. So far it has heard from 14 families of those who have died, as well as other individuals. Among the recurring themes have been concerns over patients' physical, mental and sexual safety while on wards, said Dr Strathdee. She added a lack of basic information being provided to patients and their loved ones and ""major differences in the quality of care"" were also things she had repeatedly heard. She said they had ""limited information"" about the deaths and they were ""seeking further information rapidly so that we understand which of those 1,500 people will need further investigation"". Robert and Linda Wade described their son Richard as ""a great son, a good friend. He was just a great lad"" Richard Wade was aged 30 when he died at The Linden Centre in Chelmsford in May 2015. He worked in the City of London and had a PhD in political science. Richard was admitted to the centre over fears he would harm himself after a recurrence of the depression that he had previously suffered from. His father Robert said ""they left Richard with scissors, razors, shoelaces, electrical cords and a dressing gown cord"". His room was where someone else had taken their own life three months beforehand, but hazards in the room's layout were still in place. ""It's the same errors and the same flaws, time after time,"" he added. ""People are still dying and they're still dying needlessly."" TheEssex Mental Health Independent Inquiry,externalis the first of its kind in England and is investigating deaths between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2020. It wasset up by then-health minister Nadine Dorries,externalin January 2021 following a campaign led by Melanie Leahy, whose son Matthew died while he was a patient at the Linden Centre. The Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT), which operated the unit, was prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and admitted failings in the deaths of 11 patients in the care of one of its predecessor NHS trusts. It wasfined Â£1.5m in June last yearover the deaths, which happened between 2004 and 2015. Ms Leahy criticised the decision to place the inquiry on a non-statutory footing which means it cannot compel witnesses to testify or take evidence on oath. It is being boycotted by Ms Leahy along with almost all of the families whose relatives were at the centre of the HSE prosecution. She said: ""The inquiry is futile. It doesn't even cover the community deaths. Are they not important as well? ""What about those who hadn't been an inpatient, who hadn't been discharged? Multiple people have been treated in the community and have been failed. ""We have offices in London jam packed with evidence. We urge the minister to call for the statutory powers and we will hand it all over."" Dr Strathdee said she had ""no intention"" of having an inquiry ""that does not have impact and that does not lead to the changes needed"". This inquiry into deaths at mental health trusts in Essex was announced after more than 100,000 people signed a petition calling for one on a full statutory footing. That's not what they've got and critics say there is nothing to compel former staff to give evidence if they choose not to. Its effectiveness rests on the affected relatives having faith that change will happen following inquest after inquest that have heard the same story. Some families believe the full truth can only be revealed with witnesses giving evidence under oath. Others say this non-statutory inquiry is at least a chance to ensure real change will happen. EPUT is the current provider of NHS mental health services in the county and it was formed in 2017 following the merger of two separate trusts for north and south Essex. Paul Scott, EPUT's chief executive, said: ""We continue to support the ongoing inquiry and encourage service users, family, carers and staff to share their experiences with the inquiry team so they have a full picture to draw on to make their recommendations."" Dr Strathdee said that the inquiry needed people to come forward: ""We appeal to anyone, whether in Essex or beyond. ""We want to hear your experiences and we want to hear your ideas.""

Taxpayer no longer majority Natwest shareholder,"The taxpayer is no longer the majority shareholder in Natwest after it sold Â£1.2bn worth of shares in the group. The group, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), was rescued at the height of the 2008 financial crisis with a Â£45bn government bailout. Following the sale of a chunk of its shares, government ownership in Natwest is now at 48.1% - down from 50.6%. The sale was an ""important landmark"" in its plan to return the bank to full private ownership, the Treasury said. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown said the share sale came at time when ""the government sorely needs the cash with the costs of borrowing mounting"". When the financial crisis struck in 2008, the government started to build a stake in the then RBS Group which was teetering on the brink of collapse. The initial investment, which resulted in the government owning 57% of the bank, was extended a couple of times before peaking at 84% in 2009. Since 2015, the Treasury has been selling off its stake and the process of selling off NatWest shares is likely to continue for some time to come. The government's remaining stake in NatWest, which fluctuates depending on the share price, is around Â£11bn. It has already taken considerably longer than disposal of the public ownership of Lloyds, which was finally unwound in 2017. Ms Streeter told the BBC the government had taken a hit on the price of NatWest's shares. She said the government had raised about Â£8bn so far from its stakes sold, which represented a ""huge loss"" to taxpayers, given the Â£45bn bailout. ""It's clear that bailing out the company has come at a huge cost to the taxpayer, with the government expected to be sitting on a loss of at least Â£26bn,"" she said. However, Ms Streeter said in the depths of the financial crisis, the bailout was ""considered to be the price to pay for protecting the wider economy from severe repercussions, which at the time was feared could bring the banking system crashing down, causing even further damage to the economy"". Chief executive Alison Rose was appointed in 2019 The government was first handed shares in the banks in 2008 after announcing a huge injection of cash into the sector. Gordon Brown, who was prime minister at the time of the crisis, said the investment was not an attempt to nationalise the banks and that the shares would be sold back ""at the right time"". NatWest boss Alison Rose called the latest move an ""important milestone"". Ms Rose said the deal would be a ""good use of capital for the bank and our shareholders"". ""Reducing government ownership below 50% is an important milestone for NatWest Group and a further demonstration of the progress we are making as we continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders,"" she added. NatWest Group's main banking brands are NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Coutts. It was renamed NatWest Group in 2020 after more than 40 years under the RBS Group moniker. The government has said previously it intends to sell Â£15bn worth of shares in the group by 2023. In this latest transaction, the Treasury authorised the sale of around 550 million shares. ""We will continue to prioritise delivering value for money for the taxpayer as we take forward this plan,"" it said. This is a milestone in the bank's recovery and will be seen by some as a millstone removed. The UK government's stake was at 82% for years, in the hope that its share price could recover to the breakeven price of above 500p. As Royal Bank of Scotland, and now NatWest, it never got close. For years, there were huge losses and enormous legacy costs from legal action and redress, while it was forced by regulators to shed some of its more lucrative divisions. In recent years, that state stake has been paying back dividends, but the share price has been weighed down by weakness in its customer base - that is, the UK economy. Rather than selling the government stake, some have argued that the bank should be retained in state control, to support strategic industrial investment. In any case, the Â£45bn bailout capital was not intended as an investment: it was the method used to keep the world's largest bank, measured by balance sheet in 2008, from collapsing and doing collateral damage to the British and world economies. Will it make any difference that the government no longer has a majority stake? In the bank's mindset, perhaps. Private investors will be encouraged to see it returning to market disciplines. As tranches are sold off and political oversight removed, it becomes easier for NatWest to expand from its stripped-down UK base. But it also makes it vulnerable to predators.

For years, there were huge losses and enormous legacy costs from legal action and redress, while it was forced by regulators to shed some of its more lucrative divisions. In recent years, that state stake has been paying back dividends, but the share price has been weighed down by weakness in its customer base - that is, the UK economy. Rather than selling the government stake, some have argued that the bank should be retained in state control, to support strategic industrial investment. In any case, the Â£45bn bailout capital was not intended as an investment: it was the method used to keep the world's largest bank, measured by balance sheet in 2008, from collapsing and doing collateral damage to the British and world economies. Will it make any difference that the government no longer has a majority stake? In the bank's mindset, perhaps. Private investors will be encouraged to see it returning to market disciplines. As tranches are sold off and political oversight removed, it becomes easier for NatWest to expand from its stripped-down UK base. But it also makes it vulnerable to predators.

No investigation for Noel Clarke harassment claimsThe Met Police say there is not enough evidence for a criminal investigationNewsbeat,"Actor Noel Clarke will not face a criminal investigation over sexual offence allegations, police have said. The Metropolitan Police says there is not enough evidence against him. In 2021, The Guardian newspaper published allegations of misconduct from 20 women who had worked with Clarke. The incidents included complaints of groping and sexual misconduct between 2004 and 2019.  He has denied all allegations. The Met has released a statement saying special detectives had carried out a ""thorough assessment"" of the claims, but ""determined the information would not meet the threshold for a criminal investigation"". BBC shocked by fresh Noel Clarke allegations Women make claims against Noel Clarke Clarke, who is best known for his work in Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood, has always ""vehemently"" denied ""any sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing"". The 46-year-old has previously said he was ""deeply sorry"" if some of his actions had affected people ""in ways I did not intend or realise"", and vowed to get professional help ""to educate myself and change for the better"". Last year, Sky stopped producing Clarke's series Bulletproof following the allegations. Bafta also suspended his membership after awarding him the Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema title. In their statement, the Met Police added: ""We have shared our findings with the third party organisation and updated the complainants who subsequently contacted us following the initial report"".

Sainsbury's urged to up pay to match cost of livingA group of investors wants the supermarket to ensure pay covers the rising cost of living.Business,"A group of major investors is calling on Sainsbury's to commit to paying all its workers the Real Living Wage to tackle the rising cost of living. The Real Living Wage aims to ensure wages cover everyday needs and is voluntarily paid by around 9,500 firms. It is higher than the compulsory national minimum wage. Sainsbury's staff in inner London and outside the capital are now paid the Real Living Wage but staff in outer London are not. The supermarket has also made no commitment relating to the pay of third-party staff, such as cleaners and security guards. Sainsbury's said it had recently increased its basic hourly rate by 5.3% in recognition of the ""extraordinary work"" of its staff. The investor coalition, brought together by responsible investment charity ShareAction, includes the UK's largest asset manager, Legal and General Investment Management, and the largest workplace pension scheme, Nest. It also includes 108 individual shareholders, including Labour MPs Siobhain McDonagh and Helen Hayes. How much is the minimum wage? Why are prices rising so quickly? The group has filed a shareholder resolution calling for Sainsbury's to become an accredited Living Wage employer. Shareholders will get to vote on the proposal at the supermarket's annual general meeting in July. The resolution will be binding if investors representing 75% or more of Sainsbury's shares vote in favour of the move. The group will also write to all UK supermarkets next week urging them to take the same step. Half of the companies listed on the FTSE 100 share index areamong the more than 9,500 accredited Living Wage employers,external. Retailers such as Ikea have also committed to paying the Real Living Wage but no major supermarkets are accredited. The Real Living Wage is currently Â£11.05 in London and Â£9.90 for the rest of the UK. In January,Sainsbury's announced it was increasing its basic rate of pay from Â£9.50 to Â£10 an hourfor staff across its supermarkets and Argos stores, following competitors such as Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi who announced similar moves last year. The new rate is higher than the Real Living Wage for outside the capital. For staff in inner London it pays Â£11.05 an hour which matches the Real Living Wage. However, its rate of Â£10.50 for workers in outer London is lower than the Real Living Wage for that region. Sainsbury's, which has more than 600 supermarkets and 189,000 employees, has also made no commitment to continue increasing pay in line with the Real Living Wage in the future. The Real Living Wage is set by the Living Wage Foundation charity and is different to the national minimum wage, which sets out the minimum a worker can be paid per hour by law. The National Living Wage, which applies to workers over the age of 23, is currently Â£8.91 per hour, increasing to Â£9.50 per hour from 1 April. The National Minimum Wage, for those aged 21 to 22, will rise from Â£8.36 to Â£9.18 from 1 April. People in the UK are facing increased pressure from living costs, with inflation rising at its fastest rate for 30 years amid surging fuel, energy and food prices. The Independent Food Aid Networkhas reported that it has seen an increase in supermarket workers using its foodbanks during the pandemic,external. Martin Buttle, head of good work at ShareAction, said: ""Low paid workers in the supermarket sector are being hit incredibly hard by rising living costs, yet we all owe them so much following the pandemic. We hope this resolution will catalyse long overdue change."" A spokeswoman for Sainsbury's said: ""We pay more than many of our competitors, and across the board colleague feedback has been positive to our pay review. ""As we balance the needs of all our stakeholders, particularly in the light of the current cost of living challenges that many people in the UK face, it is vital that we not only pay our colleagues fairly but that we are able to invest significantly to offer customers great value."" Sainsbury's raises pay to Â£10 an hour Real Living Wage rises to Â£9.90 an hour Minimum wage for 23 year-olds to rise to Â£9.50 How much will the minimum wage rise by?

Oil prices fall after Shanghai starts lockdownThe nine-day lockdown of Shanghai is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak began.,"A man gets tested for Covid-19 at a makeshift testing site behind barriers of an area under lockdown in Shanghai Global oil prices have fallen as China starts to implement a city-wide lockdown in Shanghai, an important financial and manufacturing hub. Brent crude lost more than $4.50 a barrel on concerns that the move would mean that demand for oil will fall. The Shanghai Composite stock index fell in early trade before regaining most of the losses later in the day. The lockdown, which began on Monday, is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak began more than two years ago. The futures contract for Brent crude - an international benchmark for oil prices - was down by 4% at $115.80 a barrel. Despite the fall, oil remains almost 80% higher than it was a year ago after the war in Ukraine helped to drive up prices. Traders were concerned about theeffectiveness of China's zero-tolerance policy towards Covid, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. Mr Innes also said in a note to investors that there were expectations of further supply chain disruptions as well as a fall in demand. ""We might be only dealing with the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. However, Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, does not expect the lockdown to have a major impact on supply chains. Most factories continue to operate as usual, and workers are either being confined on-site or given priority for testing, the Shanghai-based economist told the BBC. ""The suburbs are controlled quite well and quite tightly,"" she said. ""Supply chain stability is a priority in this round."" She added that, given the spike in Covid cases, there were expectations of more government stimulus and interest rates could be lowered ""quite significantly"" in the coming days. As long as they are passed on by banks, lower interest rates make it less costly for businesses and individuals to borrow money. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite stock index opened lower on Monday before regaining those losses to close just 0.07% higher. Until now, Chinese authorities had resisted locking down the city of almost 25 million people to avoid destabilising the world's second largest economy. The city will be locked down in two stages over nine days while authorities carry out Covid-19 testing. The key financial centre has battled a new wave of infections for nearly a month, although case numbers are not high by some international standards. It comes afterlockdowns in China affected tens of millions of people across the country earlier this month, including the entire Jilin province and the technology hub of Shenzhen. China announces Shanghai lockdown How is China's zero-Covid strategy changing? Shanghai's public transport has been suspended and firms and factories in the city have been ordered to halt operations or work remotely. The lockdown will take place in two stages, starting on Monday with the eastern side of Shanghai, which includes the city's financial centre. From Friday, the western side of Shanghai is scheduled to go into lockdown. This staggered approach means that half of the city will be able to remain open. Some businesses had already stopped operating in Shanghai, which has been battling a new wave of Covid infections for nearly a month. Last week, the Shanghai Disney Resort said it would close until further notice, citing the ""current pandemic situation"". ""We will continue to monitor the pandemic situation and consult local authorities, and will notify guests as soon as we have a confirmed date to resume operations,"" it said. China's financial capital, home to almost 25m people - Shanghai is now a divided city. Everyone east of its main river is now locked down. Another round of mass testing has started. By the week's end the western half of the city will be shut. Public transport is being closed and the city sealed off. Anyone leaving needs to show a negative test. It is all part of a huge effort to try to stop the spread of a resurgent virus that China's leaders thought they had banished. Anyone testing positive here is sent to hospital or forced quarantine. As the numbers continue to rise China's insistence on a zero-Covid strategy is being tested - but also subtly adapted.

"Rules on masks and self-isolation end in WalesSome welcome the scrapping of Covid laws, while others urge caution.","This video can not be played Dalila Tremarias fears those who have been shielding will be left behind It is no longer the law to wear a mask in shops or on buses and trains in Wales from Monday as more Covid restrictions are scrapped. Two years into the pandemic, self-isolation rules have also ended but it will still be a legal requirement to wear a mask in health and social care settings. BBC Wales visited Barry to ask people how they felt about the changes. Views were mixed, as some welcomed the move while others urged caution. Covid infections continue to rise in Wales Wales' mask law to end in shops, but not NHS Welsh mask and isolation rules could be extended Vicky McDonald owns a chocolate shop on Barry's High Street. It was her birthday on Sunday and she said the end of masks being legally required in retail ""feels like a lovely present from Drakeford"". She said it had been hard running a business through Covid ""having to keep up with constantly evolving regulations"". ""Personally I welcome the lifting of masks and restrictions just because I'm really keen to get back to normal life,"" she said. ""I find it really hard to communicate with customers with the mask on as well. ""It's hard to gauge what they're feeling about their experience in the shop."" Builders Ian Toomey and Trevor Dell say they will be keeping their masks on when they are working Down the road, builders Ian Toomey and Trevor Dell took a different view. ""We should keep the face masks in all built-up areas, football stadiums, rugby matches, everywhere where you get a good crowd,"" Mr Dell said. ""My wife's a cleaner in a school and they're still dropping off like anything with Covid. ""It hasn't gone past that peak to do away with it yet."" Mr Toomey said he thought Covid was getting less attention in the media because of Ukraine and he and Mr Dell would continue to wear masks when they are working. ""We wear masks in people's homes, we wear masks in building suppliers, wherever we go where there's other people, we wear masks,"" he said. Mr Dell was also concerned about the financial impact of catching Covid. ""What happens when you've got to take a week off work and the benefits aren't there to uphold your living standards?"" he said. ""With the price of living going up, who can afford to take time off?"" While the legal obligation to self-isolate has gone, the Welsh government is still advising people with Covid to self-isolate. The Â£500 support payments for some people isolating will remain available until June, it has been confirmed. Pauline Meyrick thinks face mask laws should have stayed Pauline Meyrick, 66, lives in Spain, but was back in Barry visiting family. She said she thought the rules on masks should have been kept in place for ""public transport, doctors, shopping"". ""I just think it's safer for everyone,"" she said. ""They're very strict in Spain, you've got to wear your mask shopping and as soon as you go out through the door."" At Barry railway station, Jen Ao Ieong was about to commute to Cardiff where she works in an art shop. Jen Ao Ieong commutes to work and has already noticed passengers not wearing masks She noticed that some passengers were already not wearing masks. ""I think people are mentally there already,"" she said. She thought others would still wear them as it had become ""part of our culture"". ""But it's nice that people don't have to implement it. For staff, it's not on them anymore."" Mauro Zeraschi, who owns Sophia's Souvenirs on Barry Island, agreed that people working in shops have often been in a difficult position. ""Trying to enforce it when you have no power to can be tricky,"" he said. He added that he thought lifting the rules was ""the right choice"". ""Majority of people I know are double-vaccinated and boosted and as long as you're careful, and if you do catch Covid you're going to isolate."" Dalia Tremarias, from Cardiff, said ""no restrictions means more restriction"" for those who are at a higher risk of Covid. Ms Tremarias haslupus,external, an auto-immune condition that attacks her body, and has been shielding for most of the pandemic. Dalila Tremarias fears those who have been shielding will be left behind ""I think that the condition should be given for everyone to move on - not just a few but everyone - don't leave anyone behind,"" she said. ""The virus is still there. You have to think about friends and family who you don't really know how they will react to the virus."" She said she would like to see mental health support for those who are ""going from shielding to being face-to-face"" with Covid. Matthew Hunt, director of Filco Supermarkets in the Vale of Glamorgan, said staff were generally relieved about restrictions easing but he feared it could be a worry for some. He toldBBC Radio Walesstaff working next to people who may have Covid and not required to self-isolate ""could create real anxiety in the team"". ""We haven't been able to adjust that yet [self-isolation changes], because we haven't seen the detail of the legislation - that's an issue."" Lewis and Gabrielle Evans, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, were on a visit to Barry Island with their six-week-old daughter Myla. Lewis said he would continue to wear a mask on public transport. ""I still don't think it's 100% safe,"" he said. Gabrielle added: ""Since having Myla I don't really want to risk giving her anything, her catching anything, so I'll still be wearing a mask."" Willadene Young feels cautious because of her health issues Willadene Young, who was on a day trip from Watchet in Somerset, was feeling cautious too. She said she felt vulnerable to the virus as she had ""a lot of medical conditions"". ""I'm basically quite well but I just don't want to risk it because I don't know what effect it would have on me,"" she said. ""I would prefer in public places and especially public transport that masks were still worn.""

She may not have taken home a trophy, but BeyoncÃ©'s performance of Be Alive, from the film King Richard, was one of the highlights of Sunday's Oscar ceremony. The pre-taped segment was recorded at the same tennis courts in Compton, California, where Richard Williams taught his daughters Venus and Serena the game of tennis when they were children. The star was joined by her own daughter, Blue Ivy, while her band and backup dancers all wore neon yellow outfits the colour of tennis balls. Before Will Smith hit Chris Rock, the comedian had just made a joke referring to the actor's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith and her shaven-head appearance. It's something Pinkett Smith has talked about and is the result of the hair loss condition alopecia. The boss of one charity which works to help people with alopecia has been talking to the BBC. Alopecia UK chief executive Sue Schilling says she was shocked to see violence unfold at the Oscars and her first thoughts were for Pinkett Smith and how she might feeling. ""Alopecia affects people emotionally as well as physically and it affects the wider family,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's not surprising to me that there was an emotional response but the violence was really surprising to me - violence is the wrong way. ""All my thoughts are with Jada Pinkett Smith - rather than Chris Rock or Will Smith."" She said the appropriateness of Rock's comments were for Pinkett Smith alone to decide on. ""I put myself in her shoes, and I would be feeling sensitive about that, given how public she has been about her journey,"" Sue adds. ""She looked amazing last night. But now the story is all about an act of violence and not a celebration - and what a shame that is."" She says people with the condition who want to find support can share their views online with the charity and it has written ablog post about the Oscars,external. Empire Magazine's Amon Warmann has been talking to Nicky Campbell on the BBC's 5 Live about the ceremony and says Will Smith showed a ""lack of judgment"" in  lashing out at Chris Rock. He says it's damaging and that it overshadowed Smith's first acting Oscar, ""something that he's been working towards for the past three decades, and something that's been very, very deserved on many levels"". ""He's wrecked it by his own actions, which is a terrible shame,"" he added, ""but you can't normalise violence because you don't like a joke."" A little more now on the film which won the crown of the night - the best picture award. According toDeadline magazine,external, Coda was the least-watched film in the running for best picture this year. In the US, it had only been streamed about 975,000 times before the ceremony, compared to 10.3 million for Netflix's eco-satire Don't Look Up. With the streaming market increasingly fragmented and confusing, it can be hard to know where the films are available. Luckily, we're here to help. Seemingly putting the events of the night behind him, Will Smith is at the Vanity Fair afterparty dancing to his own songs, and posing for photos with his Oscar. Footage of the star was captured by reporters from trade papers Variety and The Hollywood Reporter and posted online. TheLos Angeles Police Department later told Variety,externalRock had ""declined to file a police report"" after what happened Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a latertweet,external, Jaden shared a photo of himself wearing sunglasses in the back seat of a car, writing: ""My Dads Speech Made Me Cry"". That post has subsequently been deleted. Colin PatersonEntertainment Correspondent, BBC Radio 5 live Will Smith with his sons Trey Smith and Jaden Smith, daughter Willow Smith and wife Jada Pinkett Smith attending the Vanity Fair Oscar Party I've covered 19 Oscars and the only moment that comes close to this is when La La Land was wrongly announced as the Best Picture winner in 2017. I was watching the ceremony from the red carpet at the Vanity Fair party and, at first, everyone just thought it was a joke. ""What's going on here? Is this a bit of comedy? I'm not quite getting this."" Then we quickly realised what had happened. Two hours later, word came through that he was going to attend the afterparty. I thought, 'that's never going to happen', but suddenly he was here, with Jada Pinkett Smith, beaming with smiles and kissing and chatting to people. He wouldn't speak to us. He definitely heard me shout his name. But the couple obviously decided they were going to come to the party and put on a brave face. The sad thing is that, when people talk about the 2022 Oscars, they're not going to say it was the year that a film starring deaf actors won the best picture and broke all kinds of grounds. They're just going to say, 'Oh, that was the Oscars were where Will Smith hit Chris Rock'. This was the moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on-stage. There were gasps in the audience as Smith went up on to the stage, slapped Rock, and returned to his seat, where he continued to shout at the presenter. The slap came after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife and Jada's shaved hairstyle - which is a result of the hair loss condition alopecia. She has spoken publicly about her struggle with the condition. Will Smith slaps Chris Rock Will Smith became tearful as he gave his acceptance speech Will Smith went up to the stage and slapped Chris Rock after he made a joke about his wife earlier on in the ceremony. When Smith later went up to the stage, it was to collect his Academy Award for best actor. He delivered this apologetic speech, where he talked about God, love and his actions and referenced his role, as the father of tennis players Venus and Serena Williams: ""Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. Making this film, I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who is one of the most strongest, most delicate people I've ever met. I got to protect Saniyya [Sidney] and Demi [Singleton], the two actresses who played Venus and Serena. I'm being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people. I know, to do what we do, you've got to be able to take abuse. You got to be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business, you've got to be able to have people disrespecting you, and you've got to smile, you've got to pretend like that's OK. What I loved was, Denzel [Washington] said to me a few moments ago, he said, 'At your highest moment, be careful, that's when the devil comes for you'. I want to be a vessel for love. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for entrusting me with your story. That's what I want to do. I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern. I want to apologise to the Academy. I want to apologise to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment and I'm not crying for winning an award. It's not about winning an award for me. It's about being able to shine a light on all of the people - Tim [White, producer] and Trevor [White, producer] and Zach [Baylin, writer] and Saniyya and Demi and Aunjanue and the entire cast and crew of King Richard, and Venus and Serena, the entire Williams family. Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things. And my motherâ¦ a lot in this moment is really complicated for me but to my mother, she didn't want to come out. She's had her knitting crew who she's in Philly watching with. Being able to love and care for my mother, my family, my wifeâ¦ I'm taking up too much timeâ¦ Thank you for this honour. Thank you for this moment and thank you on behalf of Richard and Oracene and the entire Williams family. Thank you. I hope the Academy invites me back. Thank you."" Her film's success has been overshadowed by what happened at the ceremony - but Welsh actress Emilia Jones, who plays the lead role in Coda, says she is ""on cloud nine"" after the film won all three of the Oscars it was nominated for, including best picture. An independent film about the only hearing child of a deaf family, it had been an underdog during the entire Oscars race, but slowly emerged as a contender in recent weeks. In a touching moment, the audience applauded in sign language as it picked up the night's main award. ""It's been really beautiful watching people adapt and change and learn more signs,"" said Jones, who herself learned sign language to appear in the film. ""That's what this movie has done, I think. It's brought people together... and I'm really hoping it opens doors."" The actress also revealed that she'd received a celebratory text message from her father - the singer and radio presenter Aled Jones. ""He just said, 'wow', in all capital letters!"" We've got some more photos of Will Smith posing as he arrives at the Vanity Fair afterparty. And the mood is a world away from the moment he got up on stage and slapped Chris Rock during the Oscar awards ceremony itself. Smith smiled as he held up his best actor award at the Vanity Fair afterparty Smith arrived with wife Jada Pinkett Smith (L), daughter Willow Smith (2nd L), son Jaden Smith (2nd R) and son Trey Smith (R) Smith struck several poses with his award as other stars queued to have their photographs taken Sadly, the triumphant victory of Coda - a touching, independent film about a deaf family and their hearing daughter - has been completely eclipsed by Will Smith slapping comedian Chris Rock. On social media, it's dominating the conversation - with hashtags like ""assault"" and ""toxic masculinity"" trending. Oneuncensored clip of the altercation,externalhas been viewed 7.1m times. Another clip of Smith being comforted by Denzel Washington and Tyler Perry is also proving popular. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""There's a queue of about 30 guests unable to get into the party because this has gone on so long.""

""As a woman, who has been unprotected, for someone to say like, âKeep my wifeâs name out your mouth, leave my wife alone,â thatâs what your husband is supposed to do, right? Protect you. And that meant the world to me. ""And maybe the world might not like how it went down, but for me, it was the most beautiful thing I ever seen because it made me believe that there are still men out there that love and care about their women, their wives.â Smith later apologised on stage.

Taxpayer no longer majority Natwest shareholderThe Treasury sells Â£1.2bn of shares back to NatWest Group after it bailed out the bank in 2008.,"The taxpayer is no longer the majority shareholder in Natwest after it sold Â£1.2bn worth of shares in the group. The group, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), was rescued at the height of the 2008 financial crisis with a Â£45bn government bailout. Following the sale of a chunk of its shares, government ownership in Natwest is now at 48.1% - down from 50.6%. The sale was an ""important landmark"" in its plan to return the bank to full private ownership, the Treasury said. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown said the share sale came at time when ""the government sorely needs the cash with the costs of borrowing mounting"". When the financial crisis struck in 2008, the government started to build a stake in the then RBS Group which was teetering on the brink of collapse. The initial investment, which resulted in the government owning 57% of the bank, was extended a couple of times before peaking at 84% in 2009. Since 2015, the Treasury has been selling off its stake and the process of selling off NatWest shares is likely to continue for some time to come. The government's remaining stake in NatWest, which fluctuates depending on the share price, is around Â£11bn. It has already taken considerably longer than disposal of the public ownership of Lloyds, which was finally unwound in 2017. Ms Streeter told the BBC the government had taken a hit on the price of NatWest's shares. She said the government had raised about Â£8bn so far from its stakes sold, which represented a ""huge loss"" to taxpayers, given the Â£45bn bailout. ""It's clear that bailing out the company has come at a huge cost to the taxpayer, with the government expected to be sitting on a loss of at least Â£26bn,"" she said. However, Ms Streeter said in the depths of the financial crisis, the bailout was ""considered to be the price to pay for protecting the wider economy from severe repercussions, which at the time was feared could bring the banking system crashing down, causing even further damage to the economy"". Chief executive Alison Rose was appointed in 2019 The government was first handed shares in the banks in 2008 after announcing a huge injection of cash into the sector. Gordon Brown, who was prime minister at the time of the crisis, said the investment was not an attempt to nationalise the banks and that the shares would be sold back ""at the right time"". NatWest boss Alison Rose called the latest move an ""important milestone"". Ms Rose said the deal would be a ""good use of capital for the bank and our shareholders"". ""Reducing government ownership below 50% is an important milestone for NatWest Group and a further demonstration of the progress we are making as we continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders,"" she added. NatWest Group's main banking brands are NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Coutts. It was renamed NatWest Group in 2020 after more than 40 years under the RBS Group moniker. The government has said previously it intends to sell Â£15bn worth of shares in the group by 2023. In this latest transaction, the Treasury authorised the sale of around 550 million shares. ""We will continue to prioritise delivering value for money for the taxpayer as we take forward this plan,"" it said. This is a milestone in the bank's recovery and will be seen by some as a millstone removed. The UK government's stake was at 82% for years, in the hope that its share price could recover to the breakeven price of above 500p. As Royal Bank of Scotland, and now NatWest, it never got close. For years, there were huge losses and enormous legacy costs from legal action and redress, while it was forced by regulators to shed some of its more lucrative divisions. In recent years, that state stake has been paying back dividends, but the share price has been weighed down by weakness in its customer base - that is, the UK economy. Rather than selling the government stake, some have argued that the bank should be retained in state control, to support strategic industrial investment. In any case, the Â£45bn bailout capital was not intended as an investment: it was the method used to keep the world's largest bank, measured by balance sheet in 2008, from collapsing and doing collateral damage to the British and world economies. Will it make any difference that the government no longer has a majority stake? In the bank's mindset, perhaps. Private investors will be encouraged to see it returning to market disciplines. As tranches are sold off and political oversight removed, it becomes easier for NatWest to expand from its stripped-down UK base. But it also makes it vulnerable to predators.

Oil prices fall after Shanghai starts lockdown,"A man gets tested for Covid-19 at a makeshift testing site behind barriers of an area under lockdown in Shanghai Global oil prices have fallen as China starts to implement a city-wide lockdown in Shanghai, an important financial and manufacturing hub. Brent crude lost more than $4.50 a barrel on concerns that the move would mean that demand for oil will fall. The Shanghai Composite stock index fell in early trade before regaining most of the losses later in the day. The lockdown, which began on Monday, is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak began more than two years ago. The futures contract for Brent crude - an international benchmark for oil prices - was down by 4% at $115.80 a barrel. Despite the fall, oil remains almost 80% higher than it was a year ago after the war in Ukraine helped to drive up prices. Traders were concerned about theeffectiveness of China's zero-tolerance policy towards Covid, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. Mr Innes also said in a note to investors that there were expectations of further supply chain disruptions as well as a fall in demand. ""We might be only dealing with the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. However, Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, does not expect the lockdown to have a major impact on supply chains. Most factories continue to operate as usual, and workers are either being confined on-site or given priority for testing, the Shanghai-based economist told the BBC. ""The suburbs are controlled quite well and quite tightly,"" she said. ""Supply chain stability is a priority in this round."" She added that, given the spike in Covid cases, there were expectations of more government stimulus and interest rates could be lowered ""quite significantly"" in the coming days. As long as they are passed on by banks, lower interest rates make it less costly for businesses and individuals to borrow money. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite stock index opened lower on Monday before regaining those losses to close just 0.07% higher. Until now, Chinese authorities had resisted locking down the city of almost 25 million people to avoid destabilising the world's second largest economy. The city will be locked down in two stages over nine days while authorities carry out Covid-19 testing. The key financial centre has battled a new wave of infections for nearly a month, although case numbers are not high by some international standards. It comes afterlockdowns in China affected tens of millions of people across the country earlier this month, including the entire Jilin province and the technology hub of Shenzhen. China announces Shanghai lockdown How is China's zero-Covid strategy changing? Shanghai's public transport has been suspended and firms and factories in the city have been ordered to halt operations or work remotely. The lockdown will take place in two stages, starting on Monday with the eastern side of Shanghai, which includes the city's financial centre. From Friday, the western side of Shanghai is scheduled to go into lockdown. This staggered approach means that half of the city will be able to remain open. Some businesses had already stopped operating in Shanghai, which has been battling a new wave of Covid infections for nearly a month. Last week, the Shanghai Disney Resort said it would close until further notice, citing the ""current pandemic situation"". ""We will continue to monitor the pandemic situation and consult local authorities, and will notify guests as soon as we have a confirmed date to resume operations,"" it said. China's financial capital, home to almost 25m people - Shanghai is now a divided city. Everyone east of its main river is now locked down. Another round of mass testing has started. By the week's end the western half of the city will be shut. Public transport is being closed and the city sealed off. Anyone leaving needs to show a negative test. It is all part of a huge effort to try to stop the spread of a resurgent virus that China's leaders thought they had banished. Anyone testing positive here is sent to hospital or forced quarantine. As the numbers continue to rise China's insistence on a zero-Covid strategy is being tested - but also subtly adapted.

Where do Russia's oligarchs hide their billions?,"The Axioma, a Â£57m superyacht belonging to a sanctioned oligarch, was seized in Gibraltar For decades, Russian oligarchs have moved billions of dollars of ill-gotten money abroad - and have made it extremely hard to trace. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, countries around the world have been using sanctions and new laws to try find this ""dark money"", hoping to damage the oligarchs close to President Putin. US think tank the Atlantic Council says that Russians have about $1tn (Â£750bn) of what it calls ""dark money"" hidden abroad. Its2020 report,externalestimated that one-quarter of this amount is controlled by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his close associates - wealthy Russians known as ""oligarchs"". ""This money can be exploited and steered by the Kremlin for espionage, terrorism, industrial espionage, bribery, political manipulation, disinformation, and many other nefarious purposes,"" the report said. Another US think tank, the National Endowment for Democracy, saysPutin has encouraged close associates,external""to steal from the state budget, extort money from private businesses, and even orchestrate the outright seizure of profitable enterprises"". It says that in this way, they have built up personal fortunes running into the tens of billions. Russian opposition leaders Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Milov have claimed that between 2004 and 2007,$60bn was transferred from oil giant Gazprom's funds to Putin's cronies,external. ThePandora Papers,external, released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, note that people close to Putin have become very wealthy - and could be helping him move his own wealth around. Historically, much of this money has gone toCyprus-enticed by favourable taxes,external. To some, the island became known as ""Moscow on the Med"". According to the Atlantic Council, $36bn (Â£27bn) of Russian money went there in 2013 alone. Much of it arrived via shell companies, which are used to obscure the true owners. In 2013, the International Monetary Fund persuaded Cyprus to close tens of thousands of bank accounts held by shell companies. The British Virgin Islands is a favourite haven for Russian money British Overseas Territories such as the British Virgin Islandsand theCayman Islands, are also favourite destinations. A report byGlobal Witness,externalsaid that in 2018, Russian oligarchs had an estimated $45.5bn (Â£34bn) in these tax havens. Some of this money finds it way to financial capitals such as New York and London, where it can be invested and reap returns. The anti-corruption organisation Transparency International claims thatat least $2bn (Â£1.5bn) of UK property,externalis owned by Russians accused of financial crime, or with links to the Kremlin. The breadth of Russian money laundering was further exposed in a 2014 report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project into the""Russian Laundromat"",external. It said that between in 2011 and 2014, 19 Russian banks laundered $20.8bn (Â£15.6bn) to 5,140 companies in 96 countries. The usual way that Russian oligarchs hide their ""dark money"" abroad is through shell companies. ""These oligarchs hire the best lawyers, auditors, bankers, and lobbyists in the world to develop legal means to conceal and launder their funds,"" says the Atlantic Council. ""A serious oligarch has layers of anonymous shell companies in a score of offshore jurisdictions, and his funds move at lightning speed between them."" In 2016, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published thePanama Papers,external, which showed one company alone had set up 2,071 shell companies for wealthy Russians. Following the invasion of Ukraine, countries have announced a series of measures to track down Russian money. TheUSis setting up a new ""KleptoCapture"" task force to crack down on the the finances of Russia's oligarchs. It will be run by the Justice Department and is meant to seize assets obtained through unlawful conduct. TheUKgovernment has taken steps to increase its use of Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs), which oblige people to prove where they got the cash to buy assets in the UK. Will new legal powers find Putin's loot? The hunt for superyachts of sanctioned Russians Cyprus is such a popular destination for Russian money that it is called 'Moscow on the Med' Account Freezing Orders (AFOs) allow courts to freeze funds in a bank or building society if they suspect the money is linked to criminal activity. And the government has approved the Economic Crime Act, with a register of beneficial ownership for property owned by overseas entities. The UK also hasscrapped its ""golden visa scheme"", which gave residency rights to wealthy foreigners if they invested large amounts of money in the country. Malta, a favourite haven for Russian money, has also scrapped its ""golden passport"" scheme which allowed oligarchs to buy citizenship.CyprusandBulgariascrapped their golden passport schemes in 2020.

"UK war crimes lawyer appointed to help UkraineThe former International Criminal Court judge will advise Ukraine's prosecutor, attorney general says.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of violating international law, including targeting civilians The UK's attorney general has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine over the Russian invasion. Suella Braverman said Sir Howard Morrison would become an independent adviser to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova. Sir Howard served as a judge on the International Criminal Court in The Hague for more than 12 years. It comes as Russian forces continue to be accused of violating international law by targeting civilians. Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? Are Russia's attacks war crimes? Earlier this month,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of committing war crimesafter it launched air strikes in Kharkiv that hit an opera house, a concert hall and government offices. The ICC's chief prosecutor later said evidence was being collected on whether the Russian military had committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. But Russia is not a member of the ICC, so any Russian nationals indicted by the court would have to be extradited by the Kremlin. Asked by MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday about alternative ways of prosecuting war criminals other than the ICC, the attorney general said ""all options are on the table"", although she insisted the ICC was the UK's preferred option. ""I will always defer and support my counterpart in Ukraine, the prosecutor general, in terms of my efforts to support her in terms of her choice of route for redress,"" she said. ""But whilst we welcome the focus on accountability, we do believe that the ICC is the right place for those responsible for committing these atrocious crimes in Ukraine to be held accountable for their actions."" Announcing Sir Howard's appointment, Ms Braverman said the UK was committed to ""showing that the atrocities we see being committed day after day in Ukraine will not be forgotten"". Ms Venediktova welcomed Sir Howard's help, saying his experience and knowledge of international criminal law ""speaks louder than words"". During his time as a judge, Sir Howard oversaw cases such as that of the Serbian war criminal, Radovan Karadzic. The attorney general's office said Ms Braverman was in regular communication with Ukraine's prosecutor general and they planned to meet in person next month. On a trip to The Hague last week, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab accused Mr Putin of responding in ""ever more barbaric ways"" in Ukraine and offered the ICC financial and technical help for prosecuting alleged war crimes in the country. Boris Johnson has used similar language, describing the Russian military under Mr Putin's orders of using""barbaric and indiscriminate"" tactics. Russia denies targeting civilians and says it is carrying out a military operation against ""neo-Nazis"" in Ukraine.

'Our hospitals and schools are attacked on purpose',"A school building that was partially destroyed by Russian shelling in the city earlier this month The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has been almost completely encircled by Russian forces and left without electricity, gas or running water. Tens of thousands of people remain trapped. Some have described civilian buildings and residential areas being deliberately targeted. The strikes are so frequent that Anna and her husband take turns in watching the sky. He does the nights, she does the mornings. ""The attacks are extremely loud. The building and windows shake a lot,"" she said. It is impossible to sleep. ""Only when you're exhausted, because your brain just turns off."" The couple, and probably everyone else left in Chernihiv, spend most of their time hiding behind thick walls. ""Thank God we have them,"" Anna said. Their son, who is 12, rarely ventures outside. ""He's in panic. Many children are afraid of going out."" Chernihiv, located on the banks of the Desna River, was one of the first targets for Russian troops who invaded Ukraine from Belarus, hoping to quickly reach the capital Kyiv, just 144km (90 miles) to the south. A month on, that has not happened, and they have now effectively surrounded the city. Civilians are trapped with no running water, electricity and heating, and under relentless bombing and shelling. And like Mariupol, the besieged city on the Sea of Azov that has seen the worst of Russia's brutality, very little seems to remain untouched. Hospitals. Schools. A cinema. The stadium. Historic and residential buildings. All attacked, Anna said. ""They hit [sites] two times in a row. It's obvious they do it on purpose,"" she said. ""Most of the city suburbs are completely destroyed."" A number of residential areas in Chernihiv have been heavily damaged by Russia's attacks Olena, another resident, said the only thing still standing from the cinema was its faÃ§ade. ""It's destroyed. Totally. I saw it with my own eyes"". ""In the suburbs, there were only private buildings. My friends say they are all totally destroyed,"" Olena said. (The names of the civilians interviewed for this story have been changed to protect their identities as they remain in the city.) Most days, Olena walks, sometimes for more than an hour, in search of drinkable water. She often has to endure long queues, as people bring bottles and buckets at distribution points organised by the city council. Supplies are running out, and each person is allowed to have only 10 litres. Without electricity, the only way for her and others to charge their phones and power banks is when one of her neighbours lets them use his generator. Gas has also been cut, meaning there is no heating. ""We don't even talk about it,"" she said, ""because it's now part of our routine"". Ruins of the city's historic Hotel Ukraine, which was destroyed by an airstrike Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv region, said half of the city's population of 280,000 had left since the start of the war. After Russia bombed a bridge on a road to the capital last week, Chernihiv had been ""cut off"", he said, and residents had nowhere to go, including those requiring treatment for wounds caused by the attacks. ""There is no safe way out."" Russia was attacking the city ""every 10 or 15 minutes"", Chaus said, and  civilian facilities were being hit ""on purpose"". ""They have targeted residential buildings, schools, hospitals, kindergartens and the stadium,"" he said. It is difficult to independently verify information in Chernihiv, although residents' accounts, pictures and satellite images corroborate some of his claims. Mariia, who remains in the city, said she believed there was no area that had not been hit. ""A lot of hospitals and schools were attacked,"" she said. ""A school was attacked twice in a single week."" Russia has denied targeting civilian sites in Ukraine. But its attacks on countless apartment blocks and other non-military facilities have been well documented across the country. In a single attack on 3 March, 47 people including nine women were killed as they gathered in a small square in the city, the state government said. Human rights group Amnesty International said the attack was mostly likely a Russian air strike in which at least eight unguided aerial bombs, known as ""dumb bombs"", were used. ""Amnesty International was not able to identify a legitimate military target at, or close to, the scene of the strike,"" the group said. ""[We believe] the majority of victims were queuing for food when the missiles struck."" Satellite image taken on 16 March shows a sports training centre damaged in the city This image shows a destroyed Epicenter K shopping centre on 10 March Chaus, the governor, said about 200 people had already died in Chernihiv, probably an underestimate. Some bodies were believed to remain under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, and ""we're still trying to collect them"". Mariia's family live in constant panic. ""We stay in the bunker all the time,"" she said. ""We hear the attacks very well."" Anna said she was in ""survival mode"". ""I'm just very focused. I know when there is bombing I need to get into a safer place,"" she said. ""I no longer have fear.""

Oil prices slide after Shanghai starts lockdownThe nine-day lockdown of Shanghai is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak began.,"A man gets tested for Covid-19 at a makeshift testing site behind barriers of an area under lockdown in Shanghai Global oil prices have fallen as China starts to implement a city-wide lockdown in Shanghai, an important financial and manufacturing hub. Brent crude lost more than $4.50 a barrel on concerns that the move would mean that demand for oil will fall. The Shanghai Composite stock index fell in early trade before regaining most of the losses later in the day. The lockdown, which began on Monday, is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak began more than two years ago. The futures contract for Brent crude - an international benchmark for oil prices - was down by 4% at $115.80 a barrel. Despite the fall, oil remains almost 80% higher than it was a year ago after the war in Ukraine helped to drive up prices. Traders were concerned about theeffectiveness of China's zero-tolerance policy towards Covid, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. Mr Innes also said in a note to investors that there were expectations of further supply chain disruptions as well as a fall in demand. ""We might be only dealing with the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. However, Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, does not expect the lockdown to have a major impact on supply chains. Most factories continue to operate as usual, and workers are either being confined on-site or given priority for testing, the Shanghai-based economist told the BBC. ""The suburbs are controlled quite well and quite tightly,"" she said. ""Supply chain stability is a priority in this round."" She added that, given the spike in Covid cases, there were expectations of more government stimulus and interest rates could be lowered ""quite significantly"" in the coming days. As long as they are passed on by banks, lower interest rates make it less costly for businesses and individuals to borrow money. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite stock index opened lower on Monday before regaining those losses to close just 0.07% higher. Until now, Chinese authorities had resisted locking down the city of almost 25 million people to avoid destabilising the world's second largest economy. The city will be locked down in two stages over nine days while authorities carry out Covid-19 testing. The key financial centre has battled a new wave of infections for nearly a month, although case numbers are not high by some international standards. It comes afterlockdowns in China affected tens of millions of people across the country earlier this month, including the entire Jilin province and the technology hub of Shenzhen. China announces Shanghai lockdown How is China's zero-Covid strategy changing? Shanghai's public transport has been suspended and firms and factories in the city have been ordered to halt operations or work remotely. The lockdown will take place in two stages, starting on Monday with the eastern side of Shanghai, which includes the city's financial centre. From Friday, the western side of Shanghai is scheduled to go into lockdown. This staggered approach means that half of the city will be able to remain open. Some businesses had already stopped operating in Shanghai, which has been battling a new wave of Covid infections for nearly a month. Last week, the Shanghai Disney Resort said it would close until further notice, citing the ""current pandemic situation"". ""We will continue to monitor the pandemic situation and consult local authorities, and will notify guests as soon as we have a confirmed date to resume operations,"" it said. China's financial capital, home to almost 25m people - Shanghai is now a divided city. Everyone east of its main river is now locked down. Another round of mass testing has started. By the week's end the western half of the city will be shut. Public transport is being closed and the city sealed off. Anyone leaving needs to show a negative test. It is all part of a huge effort to try to stop the spread of a resurgent virus that China's leaders thought they had banished. Anyone testing positive here is sent to hospital or forced quarantine. As the numbers continue to rise China's insistence on a zero-Covid strategy is being tested - but also subtly adapted.

She said she had no signs or symptoms and the cancer was only picked up because of routine breast screening. ""A mammogram saved my life,"" she told the BBC. ""Without a mammogram, my cancer wouldn't have been discovered."" After a follow-up biopsy, the politician was asked to see a surgeon the next day. It was at that moment she knew she had cancer, she said. ""It was so overwhelming,"" she said. ""The first thing I thought was, 'I'm dying'. I thought, 'I've probably got 24 hours to live'. That was my first reaction."" Due to Covid, she was alone in the hospital room when the diagnosis was confirmed by the surgeon. The MP said she immediately worried she would require chemotherapy and feared: ""I'm going to lose all my hair."" However, she was told the cancer was contained in one area, and they should be able to ""just remove it"". The surgeon told her she would require an operation ""to cut it out"". The Labour politician returned to her family to tell them she had ""some bad news"", adding: ""But I'm not dying."" Public told not to delay cancer check-ups One million UK women may have missed breast scans Watch Victoria Derbyshire's full interview with Dawn Butler on BBC iPlayer Ms Butler, whose mum and sister both survived breast cancer, initially shared the diagnosis with only her partner and sister-in-law. She said the notion of sharing her diagnosis more widely led to her having a panic attack. ""I thought, 'I'm going to need to go public'. And I just had a panic attack. ""This was probably about midnight. And I'm thinking 'oh my goodness', and I just started feeling myself overheating."" Breast screening uses a breast x-ray, called a mammogram, to look for cancer that may be too small to see, or feel. In the UK, women aged 50-71 who are registered with a GP are invited for a mammogram every three years as part of a national breast-screening programme. The sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chances of survival. According to the charity Breast Cancer Now, more than 80% of breast cancers occur in women over 50 and the risk continues to increase with age. The NHS says anyone with any symptom of breast cancer should see a GP - even if you have recently had a clear breast scan. For more information visit theNHS website,external. A leading charity estimated almost one million women in the UK missed vital breast screening during the first coronavirus lockdown, when programmes were paused. At the time, Breast Cancer Now estimated around 8,600 women who had missed a scan were likely to have undetected breast cancer. Ms Butler has now urged all women to go for a mammogram as soon as they're asked to. ""There'll be women who will die if their breast cancer is not discovered, and needlessly so,"" she added. The MP said she was incredibly grateful to the NHS medics who treated her. ""I'm not going to forget what they've done for me,"" she added. ""I'm not going to forget the effort that they put in, and how they don't always feel valued. They've saved my life - I know it's what they do - but they really are sort of superheroes."" She said the operation was a ""complete success"" and that she will ""make a full recovery"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he and the party were supporting Ms Butler. ""Dawn, your bravery, strength and determination shine through,"" he said. ""I am sorry you're going through this, but know that I, and the whole party, are behind you."" Ms Butler is now taking time off work to recover from surgery, but said she plans to throw herself into more campaigning. Asked what message she wants to get across, she added: ""Please go for your mammogram. Just book it and go.""

Thank you for joining us. Updates were brought to you by Helen Bushby, Paul Glynn, Steven McIntosh, Mary O'Connor, Mark Savage and Claire Heald. The moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars It was a night where the spotlight fell on the Will Smith-Chris Rock slapping incident, overshadowing the big winners at the Academy Awards.

Stars criticise LGBTQ bill And on a night when the first openly queer woman of colour, Ariana DeBose, won an Oscar, several stars spoke out against the US state of Floridaâs so-called ""donât say gay"" bill, which would limit classroom discussions around sexual orientation or gender identity. Chastain labelled the legislation as ""discriminatory and bigotedâ, pointing to ""hate crimes"" being committed around the world. Allow YouTube content?

We'll be bringing our coverage of events at the 94th Academy Awards to a close shortly, but first there is, of course, time to share this from Queen Bey. She may not have taken home a trophy, but BeyoncÃ©'s performance of Be Alive, from the film King Richard, was one of the highlights of Sunday's Oscar ceremony. The pre-taped segment was recorded at the same tennis courts in Compton, California, where Richard Williams taught his daughters Venus and Serena the game of tennis when they were children. The star was joined by her own daughter, Blue Ivy, while her band and backup dancers all wore neon yellow outfits the colour of tennis balls. Before Will Smith hit Chris Rock, the comedian had just made a joke referring to the actor's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith and her shaven-head appearance. It's something Pinkett Smith has talked about and is the result of the hair loss condition alopecia. The boss of one charity which works to help people with alopecia has been talking to the BBC. Alopecia UK chief executive Sue Schilling says she was shocked to see violence unfold at the Oscars and her first thoughts were for Pinkett Smith and how she might feeling. ""Alopecia affects people emotionally as well as physically and it affects the wider family,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's not surprising to me that there was an emotional response but the violence was really surprising to me - violence is the wrong way. ""All my thoughts are with Jada Pinkett Smith - rather than Chris Rock or Will Smith."" She said the appropriateness of Rock's comments were for Pinkett Smith alone to decide on. ""I put myself in her shoes, and I would be feeling sensitive about that, given how public she has been about her journey,"" Sue adds. ""She looked amazing last night. But now the story is all about an act of violence and not a celebration - and what a shame that is."" She says people with the condition who want to find support can share their views online with the charity and it has written ablog post about the Oscars,external. Empire Magazine's Amon Warmann has been talking to Nicky Campbell on the BBC's 5 Live about the ceremony and says Will Smith showed a ""lack of judgment"" in  lashing out at Chris Rock. He says it's damaging and that it overshadowed Smith's first acting Oscar, ""something that he's been working towards for the past three decades, and something that's been very, very deserved on many levels"". ""He's wrecked it by his own actions, which is a terrible shame,"" he added, ""but you can't normalise violence because you don't like a joke."" A little more now on the film which won the crown of the night - the best picture award. According toDeadline magazine,external, Coda was the least-watched film in the running for best picture this year. In the US, it had only been streamed about 975,000 times before the ceremony, compared to 10.3 million for Netflix's eco-satire Don't Look Up. With the streaming market increasingly fragmented and confusing, it can be hard to know where the films are available. Luckily, we're here to help. Seemingly putting the events of the night behind him, Will Smith is at the Vanity Fair afterparty dancing to his own songs, and posing for photos with his Oscar. Footage of the star was captured by reporters from trade papers Variety and The Hollywood Reporter and posted online. TheLos Angeles Police Department later told Variety,externalRock had ""declined to file a police report"" after what happened Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a latertweet,external, Jaden shared a photo of himself wearing sunglasses in the back seat of a car, writing: ""My Dads Speech Made Me Cry"". That post has subsequently been deleted. Colin PatersonEntertainment Correspondent, BBC Radio 5 live Will Smith with his sons Trey Smith and Jaden Smith, daughter Willow Smith and wife Jada Pinkett Smith attending the Vanity Fair Oscar Party I've covered 19 Oscars and the only moment that comes close to this is when La La Land was wrongly announced as the Best Picture winner in 2017. I was watching the ceremony from the red carpet at the Vanity Fair party and, at first, everyone just thought it was a joke. ""What's going on here? Is this a bit of comedy? I'm not quite getting this."" Then we quickly realised what had happened. Two hours later, word came through that he was going to attend the afterparty. I thought, 'that's never going to happen', but suddenly he was here, with Jada Pinkett Smith, beaming with smiles and kissing and chatting to people. He wouldn't speak to us. He definitely heard me shout his name. But the couple obviously decided they were going to come to the party and put on a brave face. The sad thing is that, when people talk about the 2022 Oscars, they're not going to say it was the year that a film starring deaf actors won the best picture and broke all kinds of grounds. They're just going to say, 'Oh, that was the Oscars were where Will Smith hit Chris Rock'. This was the moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on-stage. There were gasps in the audience as Smith went up on to the stage, slapped Rock, and returned to his seat, where he continued to shout at the presenter. The slap came after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife and Jada's shaved hairstyle - which is a result of the hair loss condition alopecia. She has spoken publicly about her struggle with the condition. Will Smith slaps Chris Rock Will Smith became tearful as he gave his acceptance speech Will Smith went up to the stage and slapped Chris Rock after he made a joke about his wife earlier on in the ceremony. When Smith later went up to the stage, it was to collect his Academy Award for best actor. He delivered this apologetic speech, where he talked about God, love and his actions and referenced his role, as the father of tennis players Venus and Serena Williams: ""Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. Making this film, I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who is one of the most strongest, most delicate people I've ever met. I got to protect Saniyya [Sidney] and Demi [Singleton], the two actresses who played Venus and Serena. I'm being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people. I know, to do what we do, you've got to be able to take abuse. You got to be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business, you've got to be able to have people disrespecting you, and you've got to smile, you've got to pretend like that's OK. What I loved was, Denzel [Washington] said to me a few moments ago, he said, 'At your highest moment, be careful, that's when the devil comes for you'. I want to be a vessel for love. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for entrusting me with your story. That's what I want to do. I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern. I want to apologise to the Academy. I want to apologise to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment and I'm not crying for winning an award. It's not about winning an award for me. It's about being able to shine a light on all of the people - Tim [White, producer] and Trevor [White, producer] and Zach [Baylin, writer] and Saniyya and Demi and Aunjanue and the entire cast and crew of King Richard, and Venus and Serena, the entire Williams family. Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things. And my motherâ¦ a lot in this moment is really complicated for me but to my mother, she didn't want to come out. She's had her knitting crew who she's in Philly watching with. Being able to love and care for my mother, my family, my wifeâ¦ I'm taking up too much timeâ¦ Thank you for this honour. Thank you for this moment and thank you on behalf of Richard and Oracene and the entire Williams family. Thank you. I hope the Academy invites me back. Thank you."" Her film's success has been overshadowed by what happened at the ceremony - but Welsh actress Emilia Jones, who plays the lead role in Coda, says she is ""on cloud nine"" after the film won all three of the Oscars it was nominated for, including best picture. An independent film about the only hearing child of a deaf family, it had been an underdog during the entire Oscars race, but slowly emerged as a contender in recent weeks. In a touching moment, the audience applauded in sign language as it picked up the night's main award. ""It's been really beautiful watching people adapt and change and learn more signs,"" said Jones, who herself learned sign language to appear in the film. ""That's what this movie has done, I think. It's brought people together... and I'm really hoping it opens doors."" The actress also revealed that she'd received a celebratory text message from her father - the singer and radio presenter Aled Jones. ""He just said, 'wow', in all capital letters!"" We've got some more photos of Will Smith posing as he arrives at the Vanity Fair afterparty. And the mood is a world away from the moment he got up on stage and slapped Chris Rock during the Oscar awards ceremony itself. Smith smiled as he held up his best actor award at the Vanity Fair afterparty Smith arrived with wife Jada Pinkett Smith (L), daughter Willow Smith (2nd L), son Jaden Smith (2nd R) and son Trey Smith (R) Smith struck several poses with his award as other stars queued to have their photographs taken Sadly, the triumphant victory of Coda - a touching, independent film about a deaf family and their hearing daughter - has been completely eclipsed by Will Smith slapping comedian Chris Rock. On social media, it's dominating the conversation - with hashtags like ""assault"" and ""toxic masculinity"" trending. Oneuncensored clip of the altercation,externalhas been viewed 7.1m times. Another clip of Smith being comforted by Denzel Washington and Tyler Perry is also proving popular. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Elsewhere, there are calls for Smith to be stripped of his best actor Oscar, while some people are speculating that the whole thing was staged - not that there is any evidence of that. Photos of the audience's reaction are also going viral, with this shot of Nicole Kidman, from earlier in the night, proving particularly popular.  And Lupita Nyong'o - who was sitting directly behind Smith as he called out to Rock on stage - has also started trending. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It was a special moment,"" he told BBC 5 Live's Colin Paterson. ""It's mad to think it's his first after seven nominations and such a career."" Dornan, who plays Pa in the troubles-set drama, said the Oscar meant a lot to the whole team. ""It's all about Ken. None of us are stood here without Ken. So for us to be hanging on his shirt-tails is a very cool thing.""  Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith arrive at the Vanity Fair Oscar party Will Smith has arrived at the Vanity Fair afterparty with wife Jada Pinkett Smith after that controversial moment with Chris Rock. The actor received some cheers as he posed for photographs while showing off his award. BBC Entertainment Correspondent Colin Paterson told 5 Live Smith had taken so long, posing for every photographer, that it was causing chaos on the red carpet. ""There's a queue of about 30 guests unable to get into the party because this has gone on so long."" Comedian and actress Tiffany Haddish has called Will Smith's controversial attack on Chris Rock a ""beautiful thing"". âWhen I saw a Black man stand up for his wife,âshe told People Magazine,externalat the Governors Ball. âThat meant so much to me. ""As a woman, who has been unprotected, for someone to say like, âKeep my wifeâs name out your mouth, leave my wife alone,â thatâs what your husband is supposed to do, right? Protect you. And that meant the world to me. ""And maybe the world might not like how it went down, but for me, it was the most beautiful thing I ever seen because it made me believe that there are still men out there that love and care about their women, their wives.â Smith later apologised on stage. The Academy insisted it ""does not condone violence of any form"", while Los Angeles Police Department said Chris Rock had declined to file a police report. Allow Twitter content?

"China announces Shanghai lockdownThe financial hub will be locked down in two phases, in China's biggest city-wide lockdown yet.China","Tests take place behind the barriers of a makeshift Covid centre in Shanghai earlier this week China has announced its biggest city-wide lockdown since the Covid outbreak began more than two years ago. The city of Shanghai will be locked down in two stages over nine days while authorities carry out Covid-19 testing. The important financial hub has battled a new wave of infections for nearly a month, although case numbers are not high by some international standards. Authorities had so far resisted locking down the city of some 25 million people to avoid destabilising the economy. But after Shanghai recorded its highest daily number of cases on Saturday since the early days of the pandemic, authorities appear to have changed course. The lockdown will happen in two stages, with the eastern side of the city under restrictions from Monday until 1 April, and the western side from 1-5 April. Public transport will be suspended and firms and factories must halt operations or work remotely, authorities said. The city government published the instructions on its WeChat account, asking the public ""to support, understand and cooperate with the city's epidemic prevention and control work"". How is China's zero-Covid strategy changing? Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on? Other lockdowns during the pandemic have affected entire Chinese provinces, though people could often still travel within those regions. But Shanghai, due to its high population density, is the largest single city to be locked down to date. It is China's commercial capital and by some calculations the biggest city in the country - but is now one of the worst-hit areas as China fights to contain a resurgence of the virus with Omicron, leading to a spike in new cases. Officials had until now said the eastern Chinese port and financial hub must keep running for the good of the economy. The staggered approach to this lockdown means half the city will remain functioning at a time. Millions of residents in other Chinese cities have been subjected to citywide lockdowns,often after a relatively small number of Covid cases. In a city that's been on its knees for two weeks, parts of it reduced to something like a ghost town, the streets are now suddenly busy with panic shoppers. I've been out and seen queues stretching out of shop doors as people stock up before the lockdown starts early on Monday. The subway station at the end of my road, newly opened just a few months ago, will be shut on Monday. Public transport will stop and all residents will be subject to mass city-wide Covid testing. Almost 25 million people will be affected; the eastern side of the city first, then at the end of next week the western side. Wuhan was sealed off at the very outset of this pandemic. Before Christmas it was Xi'an. Now China's commercial and financial capital is being shut. Just a few days ago officials here said Shanghai was too big and too important to lock down. The question now on many residents' lips will be whether nine days is enough. The recent surge in cases in China, although small compared to some countries,is a significant challenge to China's ""zero-Covid"" strategy, which uses swift lockdowns and aggressive restrictions to contain any outbreak. The policy sets China apart from most other countries which are trying to live with the virus. But the increased transmissibility and milder nature of the Omicron variant has led to questions over whether the current strategy is sustainable in the long run. Some Shanghai residents have complained about the seemingly endless cycles of testing, suggesting that the cost of zero-Covid had become too high.

A really simple guide to the 2022 electionsIs there an election in my area?Cost of living likely to dominate England electionsWhy Northern Ireland's election is very differentFive things to watch in Scotland's local elections,"Elections have taken place across the UK on 5 May. Voters in England, Wales, and Scotland were picking who should run services that affect everyday life in their local area. People in Northern Ireland were choosing its government. The results are likely to reflect how people feel about Boris Johnson, the ""partygate"" scandal, how Covid has been handled and the rising cost of living.

Local councils are responsible for everything from bins, bus routes and potholes, to providing mental health services, deciding planning applications and managing schemes to tackle climate change. In England, more than 4,000 councillors in 146 councils are up for election in major cities including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs. South Yorkshire was voting for a regional mayor and 1,000 parish councils were electing about 10,000 councillors. Because of the huge number of seats being contested across England - some of them for the first time since 2018 - the results are likely to paint the clearest picture of the national mood. Read more about the English elections Cost of living likely to dominate England elections The election for Northern Ireland's government is largely a contest between the parties in two blocs - unionists, who favour remaining part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who favour a united Ireland. Since 2003, the Democratic Unionist Party has been the largest party in the national assembly, followed by nationalists Sinn FÃ©in. The two parties, along with other unionist and nationalist parties, and an increasingly popular third bloc of non-aligned parties, have governed under a mandatory power-sharing agreement that ended decades of fighting. Recent polls suggest Sinn FÃ©in could take the lead for the first time. If Sinn FÃ©in becomes the largest party, the DUP has not said whether it would agree to share power. That means it's possible that even after the election, the Assembly could remain without a devolved government for at least six months.

All seats in 22 local councils are being contested across Wales, where people can vote from the age of 16. The political make-up has been mixed since the last election in 2017 and the majority of councils are currently run by coalitions - an agreement between at least two parties to share power. Eyes will be on whether Labour can maintain its hold over Cardiff and the cities along the M4 corridor, and how the Conservatives perform in the north-east of the country, where they made gains last time. Read more about the Welsh elections There was voting in all 32 local authorities. The last election in 2017 saw the Conservatives make big gains from Labour, however they failed to gain overall control and most councils have been run by coalitions ever since. The largest cities - Glasgow and Edinburgh - are always ones to watch, but this year's results are also likely to reflect how Scots feel more generally about such issues as recent council tax changes and post-pandemic recovery.

Cost of living likely to dominate England electionsWhy Northern Ireland's election is very differentFive things to watch in Scotland's local elections,"On 5 May, there are local elections taking place in England, Scotland and Wales, while in Northern Ireland voters will elect members to the Northern Ireland Assembly. In England, the last time that most of these seats were contested, the political landscape was vastly different. It was 2018, before coronavirus, when Theresa May led a Conservative party embroiled in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, and Jeremy Corbyn was the leader of a Labour party questioning its direction. Conservatives hurt Labour in English heartlands Labour insiders on Starmer, what went wrong and how to fix it Is the Green Party on the rise - and if so, why? The six key 2021 election takeaways in maps and charts So with so much having changed, what's at stake for the parties now? For the Conservatives, this set of elections follows success at ballot box in the 2019 general election when Boris Johnson swept to power winning seats in former Labour strongholds, and in last year's local elections which saw the Tories gain councils and councillors across England. While this is a different set of elections in different parts of the country from last year, it will still be the first widespread test for Boris Johnson since the war in Ukraine, the spiralling cost of living and the so-called partygate saga. The latter has not yet been resolved; an outcome from the Met Police's investigation is still pending, and if it comes before polling day it could clearly have an impact, one way or another. But for now at least, some Tories think it has been overtaken by the conflict in Ukraine, and some believe it is the cost of living that could now prove far more challenging on the doorstep. Campaigning during the pandemic was more difficult for politicians While the sheer volume of seats in London makes it a key battleground, beyond the capital a key question for the Conservatives will be what happens in the places it won parliamentary seats for the first time in 2019. Many Conservatives have so far viewed their party leader as an electoral asset, so many will be watching closely to see whether that's still the case - and in particular, whether the tide of support Mr Johnson's won in former Labour areas continues to rise or starts to ebb. That will matter too for Labour, who are defending the most seats in these elections, having come neck-and-neck with the Tories in 2018 in terms of their overall share of the vote, and chalking up their best result in London in more than 45 years. That's support Labour will want to maintain - even build on - but doing well in the capital is not enough for party leader Sir Keir Starmer to find a way back to power in Westminster. His party needs to show whether it can reverse some of its recent electoral losses, particularly in parts of the country that voted to leave the EU. It may not be the case that swathes of councils change hands, but Labour will be looking at their share of the vote to see if they're moving in the right direction, including in the places they need to rebuild ahead of the next general election such as parts of the midlands and north of England. The Tories hurt Labour in many of their former heartlands in elections in 2021 Perhaps unsurprisingly, they will be pushing hard on the cost of living. While it's not something councils have real control over, there are few politicians from any party who don't think it's going to make a difference to the public mood. While the Lib Dems will go toe-to-toe with Labour in some areas , their priority will be winning round long-standing Conservative voters they believe to be seeking change, as well as getting a foothold back in parts of the country that were lost to them after their years as part of the coalition government. In true Lib Dem tradition, the party sees success in local elections as crucial in building the infrastructure they need to make progress on the national stage; the challenge this time is that many of the Tory seats they'll likely target at the next general election don't have local votes in May. Rather than taking control of many councils, the question for the Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey will be whether he can take more council seats to rebuild his party's base. In truth, while there will be key councils which make headlines where losses or wins will spell political success or danger, it is the detail that will matter - whether parties are inching forward or slipping back in the areas they need to make progress. Local elections in England InEnglandthere are around 4,360 seats up for grabs on 146 councils, as well as a handful of mayoral elections, so depending where you live you'll be choosing the people who run crucial services from social care to transport, recycling and planning. More than 1,800 of those seats are inLondon, where every seat in every borough will be contested - making the capital a key battleground. Outside of London, these elections are mostly in towns and cities, though there are elections for newly formed councils inSomerset,North Yorkshire,CumberlandandWestmorland & Furness. You'll be able to find details of any elections taking place in your area, as well as a list of the candidates nearer the time, on your local council website. There are places where the Greens, other smaller parties, independent candidates and residents groups will try and sweep up seats and cause political upsets. And perhaps most importantly, the elections taking place in your area are your chance to have your say over who runs key services. Local issues will undoubtedly factor, from the state of local roads to planning decisions, development proposals and the provision of care services. But elections are also a test of public opinion more broadly, and with the war in Ukraine and the cost of living starting to bite for many households, these results will offer an insight into who's trusted on some of the biggest issues of the day. Every election provides a vital measure of the public mood as the parties try to chart their path to power, and May's elections in England will be no different.

Why Northern Ireland's election is very differentFive things to watch in Scotland's local elections,"There can be a very long list of candidates in assembly elections The candidates have largely been chosen, campaign posters have been printed and the countdown to 5 May is officially under way. On that day, the next Northern Ireland Assembly election will take place. As with any election, for the political parties doing battle there is much at stake. But in Northern Ireland, it's not simply winner-takes-all once votes have been counted and the final seats declared. Forming a government and deciding policy priorities are the traditional outcomes after elections, when parties have made promises to deliver on pledges. But doing that is more complicated in Northern Ireland for one big reason: no party can govern alone. There's no such thing as winning an outright majority or forming a ""coalition of the willing"", with like-minded parties. That's different from how things usually work in other parts of the UK, but it was purposefully designed this way. Often just referred to as Stormont,Northern Ireland's modern institutions were set up to ensure unionists and nationalists could share power equally, endingdecades of conflict known as the Troubles. It has operated like this since the first election to the devolved assembly took place in 1998. There are 90 seats available in the assembly, the legislative chamber where laws are scrutinised and passed. The Northern Ireland Assembly meets at Stormont But forming the government at Stormont which proposes many of the laws is less straightforward. It's a system known as mandatory coalition. Basically, it means major parties cannot be excluded from government. In practice, this sees parties with opposing political stances having to work together on everything from health to infrastructure and education. Unionist parties favour continuing the union with Britain while nationalist parties support a united Ireland. There is also a growing third bloc of non-aligned parties who, so far, have not taken a position on that issue. After an election, those parties are meant to form the executive. Similar to the cabinet at Westminster, it is the decision-making body for Northern Ireland and is often referred to as the government. Parties are entitled to hold ministerial posts in the executive based on the number of seats they win in the election. Is there an election in my area? Stormont without leadership for third of lifespan For most of the multi-party executive's lifespan, five parties have been entitled to positions. During the election campaign, parties will still publish manifestos with differing priorities on what they want to do in a future government. Stormont has powers to legislate on many areas including health, employment, education, agriculture and the environment, transport, culture, justice and policing. If the parties entitled to form a government after an election do so, it means many pledges competing within a system where any significant policy needs approval from the whole executive. Inevitably it also means other promises end up remaining long-term aspirations, stymied by opposing political perspectives. But agreeing any policy first hinges on the return of a government after the election - and that has already been made trickier due to recent events. The lead jobs in the executive - first minister and deputy first minister - are reserved for the largest party from the largest of the unionist/nationalist blocs and the largest party from the second largest of the blocs. Despite their names, the two roles are joint, and one cannot hold office without the other. Michelle O'Neill lost her position as deputy first minister when Paul Givan resigned Since 2003, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been the largest party in the assembly, followed by nationalists Sinn FÃ©in. In February, the DUP withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. It meantSinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill lost her job as deputy first ministerand that the executive could not take decisions because the first and deputy first ministers must chair all meetings of it. Recent polls have also indicated that Sinn Fein could for the first time win the most seats and be entitled to the first minister role. The DUP has refused to say whether it would agree to share power in this circumstance. After the last assembly election in March 2017, there were three years of stalemate before the executive was re-established. How long it takes this time and who wants to be part of it will factor into the debate as the parties pound the pavement for votes over the next six weeks.

Five things to watch in Scotland's local elections,"Elections for all 32 Scottish local councils will be held on 5 May. Here are five of the factors that might make a difference come polling day. Councils are in charge of the delivery of many key local services - they are on the front lines when it comes to day-to-day issues that people really care about, some of which could ultimately be pivotal. Delivery is absolutely key when the people involved organise your local schooling and social care, housing and planning. There will be wards where the entire result will hang on how many potholes there are on the main road through a village, or on whether a town library has re-opened post-pandemic. The control of a council could hinge on how many bin collections a party is willing to offer per month, or how they propose to support local bus services. Obviously the local issues of concern vary enormously across the country, and indeed across individual councils, making top-down predictions about one race or another difficult. Personality also plays a part here - as community representatives, councillors generally need to be well known and indeed well liked in their area. This is underlined by the significant part played by independent candidates - well-kent local campaigners who can sustain a political profile without needing to tie themselves to a party. A total of 168 ""independents"" won seats in 2017, and in some areas they make up the bulk of the council. May's elections might be about local issues, but they won't happen in a bubble. Voters can still be swayed by the big political topics of the day. For example,the ""partygate"" rowhas faded from the headlines somewhat amid the war in Ukraine, but it may have made a more lasting impression in the minds of voters. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross attempted to kiss and make up with Boris Johnson at his party's spring conference, on a stage emblazoned with the words ""forward together"", but it remains to be seen if the electorate are as quick to forgive the prime minister. To take another example, the perennial question of a second independence referendum will not be settled by the result of this election, but as ever it will likely feature prominently on the doorsteps. The SNP and Conservatives both enjoy nothing more than campaigning on opposite sides of the constitutional issue, while Alex Salmond's Alba Party will be looking to siphon off Yes voters growing impatient with Nicola Sturgeon's approach. And a host of other hot topics could be playing on voters' minds - from the Covid pandemic to immigration and asylum policy, and energy security to the Scottish government's bid to reform gender recognition laws. All of these also provide opportunities for the many smaller outfits taking part in the race, like the Scottish Family Party, to campaign on issues being discussed nation-wide. They aren't standing as candidates in May, but the actions of Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson will still play a big part in the election There is one other national factor which will be inescapable in politics at every level this year - the cost of living crisis. People are facing the biggest drop in living standards since the 1950s, with warnings that1.3m people across the UK could be pushed into povertyas energy, fuel and food costs soar. This year, for the first time since the SNP came to power in 2007, town halls were given free reign to set council tax rates. In practice they didn't have total freedom, given the looming elections and the fact the finance secretary eventually provided an additional chunk of funding witha warning that it should help to hold down rate rises. Ultimatelyonly two councils levied a rise in excess of 3%, but it remains likely that candidates will be talking about money on the doorsteps once campaigning begins in earnest. It's not just about the tax burden that voters would rather escape - it's also about how much councillors will have to spend on measures to help those worst-hit by price hikes. Councils havecomplained for yearsthat they need more cash to run local services - and that extra money from Holyrood often has strings attached, being tied to specific policies like social care or early learning. So there are likely to be few of the crowd-pleasing giveaways promised in national elections over the coming weeks, as both councils and voters contemplate tightening their belts. Technically, the result of all 32 of Scotland's council elections in 2017 was the same: No Overall Control. Councillors are elected via the single transferable vote - a system of proportional representation that makes it very hard for one party to win a majority. So town halls are generally run either by a minority administration, striking deals on an issue-by-issue basis, or a coalition muddled together from several parties. Curious alliances and unusual bedfellows abound, and it will be interesting to see how the horse-trading plays out once the votes are tallied. But this is also important before polling day, because the other notable impact of the STV system is that it allows people to back multiple candidates. Voters rank them in order of preference, and a multi-stage system of counting sees three or four councillors elected for most wards. There is a fuller explanation of the maths behind the systemhere,external, but the ""transfers"" of second-preference votes in later rounds of counting are often crucial in terms of the final result. TheHolyrood election in 2021underlined that people are increasingly savvy about tactical voting. Almost every constituency became a two-horse race between the SNP and whichever other major party was most likely to put up a fight locally. This was openly encouraged by parties campaigning specifically for regional ""list"" votes - so will Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem voters prove as calculating when it comes to their local election ballots? It might seem easy to just include another party as a second or even third preference, but these parties are also in fierce competition with each other for seats. There may be 1,227 across the country, but the margins are very tight when it boils down to a three or four member ward. The same goes for the other major parties, of course. Will SNP first-preference votes trickle down to the Greens on second preferences, now the two are in government together - and vice versa? Or will the parties opt to shun their new partnership in a bid to maintain separate identities in the campaign, and seek to maximise their own returns? Despite councils dealing with many of the day-to-day issues that interest and infuriate people, less than half of them actually turn up to vote in local elections. There were a few electoral cycles where Holyrood and council elections were held on the same day, which boosted turnout somewhat - but also confused a lot of people, with the two polls using three different electoral systems. When the elections were split to separate years in 2012, 39.6% of the electorate turned out for the council race. In 2017 it was 46.9% - better, but still a long way behind the numbers who turn out for Holyrood and Westminster contests. And the picture was still very fragmented, with areas a few miles apart having very different levels of uptake - turnout in East Renfrewshire was 57.8%, while Glasgow's was 39%. The question is whether the figure will improve again in 2022, off the back of a Holyrood poll last year which smashed its own turnout record. Post-pandemic, more people are signed up for postal ballots, which tends to boost participation. It's also possible that all of the factors mentioned above mean people are quite politically engaged at the moment - although after 10 elections and two referendums over the past ten years, some may also just be a bit tired of politics.
