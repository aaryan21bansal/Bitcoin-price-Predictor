Mr Drakeford visited several homes on Monday in one of South Wales' worst hit-communities, Oxford Street in Nantgarw, which saw heavy flooding on the weekend leaving properties and businesses ruined. The Welsh Labour leader tells the PA News agency: ""There has been major investment in flood defences, and the impact of the events over the weekend would've been even worse if it weren't for the investment that had already been made. ""Of course there is more to do. We have a Â£350m investment programme over this Assembly term in flood and coastal flooding programmes. ""The impact of global warming is real and there for anyone to see, the science tells us we will have to face in greater frequency these intense weather events in future.""

""Certainly I'll be pushing the government when Parliament returns to get on and get proposed schemes in place.

BBC Radio 5 Live The village of Nantgarw near Cardiff has been badly affected. Ian Best lives there with his family and told BBC Radio 5 Live how he raised the alarm with his neighbours when he realised the water was coming in. ""It was awful,"" he said. ""I had my daughter crying upstairs. You don't know how high it's going to come, and when we could see the cars floating down the road... it just happened so quickly. ""We had a phone call at 4am - by 4.30 we were underwater."" Ian has already taken up his kitchen floor. ""I spoke to the insurers,"" he said. ""As long as we take plenty of photos we can take it up and start drying the rooms out - but the floor underneath doesn't look too good."" ""We've got another room we can't get into at the moment because the furniture's floated and I can't open the door so I'll have to take the door frame off. ""Devastated doesn't come close to it. We're looking at tens of thousands [of pounds]."" Labour leadership candidate Sir Keir Starmer says it's an ""appalling decision"" not to hold a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, to discuss the severe flooding. He tweeted: ""The recent flooding is a stark reminder that the government is not doing enough to get to grips with the climate crisis. ""Ministers should be taking a lead on this situation, not ducking their responsibilities."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not expected to visit any flood-hit areas on Monday, but Downing Street said he was being kept updated about events. The PM made visits to flood-hit Matlock in Derbyshire and Fishlake, near Doncaster, during the election campaign in November. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Saudi warplane crashes in YemenHouthi rebels say they shot down the plane, while Saudi Arabia says only that it ""fell"".Middle East","Houthi fighters say they downed the warplane (file picture) A warplane belonging to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen has crashed in the northern province of al-Jawf. A coalition spokesman confirmed that a Saudi Tornado fighter jet had ""fallen"" while carrying out a support mission near Yemeni army units, according to Saudi Arabia's state news agency SPA. Yemen's Houthi rebels said they shot down the plane on Friday night. The United Nations said 31 civilians were killed in Saudi air strikes in al-Jawf on Saturday. A statement from the office of the UN's resident coordinator for Yemen said ""preliminary field reports"" indicated that at least 12 others were injured in the strikes. The Saudi-led coalition has been battling Yemen's rebel Houthi movement since 2015. It intervened after the Houthis ousted the internationally-recognised government from power in the capital Sanaa. Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? Yemen's humanitarian crisis near breaking point Yemen's conflict in 400 words The Houthi rebels said they used ground-to-air missiles to down the warplane on Friday night. Saudi Arabia has not provided details of any casualties from the crash, or what caused it. It said it carried out a search and rescue operation on Saturday and that some civilians may have been unintentionally killed. Houthi officials said children were among the casualties of retaliatory air strikes by Saudi Arabia, which they said targeted civilians in the area where rebel forces had downed the plane. They said some of those injured were in a critical condition. In a statement on Saturday, Lise Grande, the UN's resident humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, shared ""deep condolences with the families of those killed"". ""So many people are being killed in Yemen - it's a tragedy and it's unjustified. Under international humanitarian law parties which resort to force are obligated to protect civilians. Five years into this conflict and belligerents are still failing to uphold this responsibility. It's shocking,"" she said. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and his cabinet were forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs Mr Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries in air strikes against the rebels. The coalition carries out air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. The civil war has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with an estimated 80% of the population - more than 24 million people - requiring humanitarian assistance or protection.

Sinn FÃ©in leader tells dissidents to 'pack up',"Sinn FÃ©in's leader has said the party will not be deterred bydissident republican threats made to MLAs Michelle O'Neill and Gerry Kelly. Mary Lou McDonald, speaking in Belfast on Saturday, said dissidents were ""at war with their community"". ""It's time they packed up and disbanded,"" she said. Mrs McDonald also called the Fianna FÃ¡il leader's refusal to enter talks with her in the Republic of Ireland an ""arrogant and untenable position"". Sinn FÃ©intopped the first preference poll in the Irish general election last weekend, but its total of 37 seats is one fewer than that of Fianna FÃ¡il. With 80 seats required to form a government in the DÃ¡il, no single party won enough in last weeks elections to govern on their own. Speaking to party activists, Mrs McDonald said Sinn FÃ©in was the only ""all-Ireland party resolutely committed to Irish Unity"". ""I want to stress again that unionists have nothing to fear from Irish Unity,"" she added. ""Of course some of them may see that differently. But the answer to that is to talk. ""We got the power sharing government back because we talked. We will get an agreed shared Ireland in place because we talk."" Mary Lou McDonald was speaking in Belfast for the first time since the Irish general election Fianna FÃ¡il said on Thursday that it would not enter talks with Sinn FÃ©in. ""MicheÃ¡l Martin's plan is to deny people what they voted for"". Mrs McDonald said the Irish electorate had given Sinn FÃ©in ""a chance to show that we can improve their lives"". ""A chance to shape a government that will finally do right by ordinary people. They want a government for change,"" she said. ""That's why Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael were - and are - so determined to keep us out of government."" Irish broadcaster RTÃ has reported that Mrs McDonald and Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin had a 15-minute phone conversation on Friday, in which she told him that ""people voted for change and not a grand coalition between Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael"". Before the election, Mr Martin ruled out forming a coalition with Sinn FÃ©in, citing its historic links to the IRA as a deterrent. In the wake of last Saturday's vote, he did not reject the two parties working together, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" existed. Confidence and supply There could be a lengthy wait to see the make-up of the next Irish government. That is not entirely unusual - it took 70 days for previous Taoiseach Enda Kenny to form a government in 2016. In that government, it was agreed that Fianna FÃ¡il would support Fine Gael on key votes in a confidence-and-supply agreement.

Kate 'tried hypnobirthing' for morning sickness,"The duchess appeared on Giovanna Fletcher's Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast The Duchess of Cambridge has revealed she used hypnobirthing techniques of mindfulness and meditation to cope with severe morning sickness. Catherine suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes severe vomiting, during her pregnancies. In her first podcast interview, she said the illness meant she was ""not the happiest of pregnant people"". However, she said after trying everything to overcome it she realised the importance of ""mind over the body"". The duchess joked: ""I'm not going to say that William was standing there sort of, chanting sweet nothings at me. ""He definitely wasn't. I didn't even ask him about it, but it was just something I wanted to do for myself. ""I saw the power of it really, the meditation and the deep breathing and things like that, that they teach you in hypnobirthing, when I was really sick, and actually I realised that this was something I could take control of, I suppose, during labour. It was hugely powerful."" Speaking on theHappy Mum, Happy Baby podcast,external, Catherine told author and host Giovanna Fletcher that theFive Big Questions On The Under Fives,externalsurvey she has launched aims to ask people ""what is it that matters for them in raising their children today."" ""I had an amazing granny who devoted a lot of time to us, playing with us, doing arts and crafts and going to the greenhouse to do gardening, and cooking with us,"" she said. Kate launches childhood survey to help under-fives Duchess of Cambridge in surprise NI visit Duchess's teachers delighted at surprise royal hug ""And I try and incorporate a lot of the experiences that she gave us at the time into the experiences that I give my children now."" By Daniela Relph, royal correspondent These are some of the most open and candid words we've heard from the Duchess of Cambridge. She speaks personally about her childhood and reflects on the value of her stable upbringing. There are many insights into her own experience of pregnancy and motherhood that many will recognise. She shares the misery of extreme morning sickness, the power of hypnobirthing, the uncertainty of those early days with a new baby and the guilt of working and relying on others to help you. She also describes how she felt in the moments before facing the world's media outside the hospital just a day after giving birth and holding a newborn Prince George in her arms. She said it was terrifying. It's clear the duchess felt comfortable speaking to the podcast host, Giovanna Fletcher. That ease comes from the fact this area is now a real priority for Catherine. Her royal work has a sharp focus on family and specifically early intervention - helping vulnerable parents with children under the age of five who need extra support. The Five Big Questions survey she launched last month asking for people's views on early childhood has so far drawn more than 200,000 responses. The duchess said her own priorities included providing her children with the ""happy home"" and ""safe environment"" she had enjoyed as a child. She said she was ""passionate"" about children spending a lot of time outside, adding that it was ""so great for physical and mental wellbeing"" and laying the foundations for healthy development. ""It's such a great environment to spend time in, building those quality relationships without the distractions of 'I've got to cook' and 'I've got to do this'. And actually, it's so simple,"" she said. The image of Princess Charlotte smelling a bluebell was taken by the duchess at their home in Norfolk last spring A picture of Catherine's daughter, Princess Charlotte, smelling a bluebell has been released following the duchess's interview. The image of the four-year-old was taken by the duchess at their home in Norfolk in spring last year. The month-long online poll, conducted by Ipsos Mori on behalf of Catherine's Royal Foundation, aims to ""spark a national conversation"" on early childhood, Kensington Palace has said. Launched in January, it is thought to be the biggest survey of its kind and the results are intended to guide the duchess's future work. ""It's going to take a long time, I'm talking about a generational change, but hopefully this is the first small step: to start a conversation around the importance of early childhood development,"" Catherine said. The duchess appeared on the podcast after visiting children at a nursery in south London ""It's not just about happy, healthy children. This is for lifelong consequences and outcomes."" Ms Fletcher - who is married to Tom Fletcher from McFly - said Kate seemed ""passionate"" about the subject and it was ""beyond wonderful to sit and talk further about the survey, her work - for which she has so much knowledge, and her own experiences of being a mother"". ""It doesn't matter who you are, what you have, or where you come from - we're all trying to do our best with our children while continuously doubting our decisions and wondering if we're getting it completely wrong. Talking helps unite us all,"" she said. 1.What do you believe is most important for children growing up in the UK today to live a happy adult life?Rank from most important to least important: Good physical and mental health Good friendships and relationships Access to opportunities Access to a good education 2.Which of these statements is closest to your opinion?

Australian MPs cancel UK trip amid Huawei leak row,"UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab travelled to Australia last week to discuss security and trade Senior Australian MPs have cancelled a planned trip to the UK as tensions heighten over the role of Huawei in building Britain's 5G network. Lawmakers from the intelligence and security committee had been expected to travel to the UK next month. But the trip has been postponed amid reports of a diplomatic rift. The decision follows a reported complaint from the UK over leaked details of a high-level meeting where Huawei was discussed. Australia has banned the Chinese telecommunications giant from building its next-generation 5G mobile internet networks but Britain last month decided the company could continue to play a role in its system, despite pressure and warnings from Washington. Last week, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab visited Australia, where he met members of the parliament's intelligence committee. Details of the meeting were later leaked to the Sydney Morning Herald,external, which said an MP had rebuked Mr Raab in the meeting over Britain's Huawei decision, saying Australia was very disappointed. According to Australian media that report prompted a formal complaint from Vicki Treadell, the UK's High Commissioner to Australia, to the heads of two Australian parliamentary committees. Australia and the UK are both part of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also includes the US, New Zealand and Canada. Australia's parliament on Saturday confirmed the trip to the UK had been delayed but said it was due to the fact that the counterpart parliamentary committee in the UK was yet to be appointed following December's election. What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Where is Huawei 5G being blocked? Senior Tories want Huawei excluded from UK 5G According to the Sydney Morning Herald, in the meeting with Mr Raab, Anthony Byrne, the deputy chair of Australia's intelligence committee, said that allowing China to build the UK's 5G telecoms infrastructure was equivalent to letting Russia construct it. ""How would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks? That's how we feel about Huawei,"" Mr Byrne was quoted as telling Mr Raab. In a Twitter post at the time, he said the meeting had involved a ""full and frank discussion"" over 5G and strategic challenges. Ms Treadell was present. Allow Twitter content?

One unnamed committee member was quoted by the Australian broadcaster as describing Ms Treadell's intervention as ""foolish"". Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg however sought to scotch suggestions of a rift, saying ""our relationship with the United Kingdom couldn't be stronger"". Meanwhile, senior US officials stepped up their criticism of Huawei at an international security conference in Munich, Germany on Saturday. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper warned that US alliances such as Nato were in jeopardy if European partners used Huawei technology in their 5G networks. The UK has only given Huawei partial access to its 5G network, banning it from supplying kit to ""sensitive parts"", known as the core. Nevertheless, Australia and the US are unhappy with the decision. Washington has argued that Huawei equipment could allow the Chinese state to spy via ""back-doors"". The firm strongly rejects that it poses any security threat. On a visit to the UK last month after Britain's decision, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the Five Eyes intelligence partnership would remain in place despite previous warnings from Washington that it could be affected.

"UK in talks with China over HS2 constructionChina's state railway company says it could build the line in just five years, according to reports.Business","The UK and China have held ""preliminary discussions"" over giving Beijing's state-owned railway firm a role in building the HS2 high-speed rail line. However, government officials said no ""concrete commitments"" had been made. China's state railway company said it could build the line in just five years and at a much lower cost,according to a letter seen by Building magazine,external. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat warned letting CRCC build HS2 would be ""extremely questionable"". It comes after Boris Johnson this weekapproved the controversial HS2 scheme. This was despite an official review warning costs could reach over Â£100bn, against a budget of Â£62bn. Australian MPs cancel UK trip amid Huawei leak row Mixed reaction from MPs on HS2 route How much? Six reasons why HS2 is so expensive When will HS2 actually open? HS2 in Manchester: 'Waste of money' or 'good news'? Under current plans, the final stretch of the line is not due to be completed until 2040 - although Mr Johnson has said he wants that brought forward to 2035. However, Building magazine reported that the China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) had written to HS2 Ltd's chief executive last month, saying it could build the line by the middle of the decade, for a much reduced price tag. Any move to give Beijing a further role in the UK's infrastructure would almost certainly prove controversial, after Mr Johnson reportedly incurred the wrath of US President Donald Trump -as well as upsetting many Tory MPs- with his decision to allow tech giant Huawei to supply equipment for the 5G mobile network. However, British officials are said to be sceptical that it could operate in the same way in a democracy with property rights, protected landscapes and powerful lobbying groups. By Katy Austin, BBC business correspondent An offer by an experienced railway builder to solve all of HS2's issues might sound tempting, but whether it is likely to be taken up is another question. Preparation work is under way and the vast majority of contracts have already been allocated for the project's first phase linking London and Birmingham. The letter from the China Railway Construction Corporation lacks detail on its plans. So it is unclear how seriously the approach is being taken - or whether discussions progressed beyond CRCC's interest being acknowledged and them being informed of process. Its letter claims it could bring advantages worth overcoming obstacles for. But the politics of allowing Chinese investment in further key UK infrastructure would not be straightforward. Mr Tugendhat, who is chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said the UK was in ""dire need"" of a strategy around its relationship with China. Mr Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday: ""Have we decided to take back control from Brussels only to hand it over to Beijing?"" He added that projects in China are often completed quickly ""because they don't worry about such minor matters as planning consent or workers' rights"". This video can not be played HS2: Views from along the track Mr Tugendhat is also sceptical of Mr Johnson's decision to let Huawei into the UK's 5G network, describing the Chinese tech giant's presence in the network as akin to letting a ""fox in the hen house"". The CRCC letter, also beenseen by the Financial Times,external, states: ""We are certain that we can offer a cost that is significantly lower than the projections we have seen. ""The advantages are, in our opinion, too great to dismiss on the basis that there are obstacles to overcome. ""You will find that the Chinese way is to seek solutions, not linger on obstacles and difficulties."" CRCC has transformed China's transport system, building most of the country's 15,500-mile high-speed network. Supporters of HS2 say it will improve transport times, increase capacity, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy. Once it is built, journeys will be shorter. London to Birmingham travel times will be cut from one hour, 21 minutes to 52 minutes, according to the Department for Transport. And while it is being built, it is expected to create thousands of jobs and provide a stimulus to economic growth.

Kate says 'amazing granny' inspires her parenting,"The duchess appeared on Giovanna Fletcher's Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast The Duchess of Cambridge has revealed she used hypnobirthing techniques of mindfulness and meditation to cope with severe morning sickness. Catherine suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes severe vomiting, during her pregnancies. In her first podcast interview, she said the illness meant she was ""not the happiest of pregnant people"". However, she said after trying everything to overcome it she realised the importance of ""mind over the body"". The duchess joked: ""I'm not going to say that William was standing there sort of, chanting sweet nothings at me. ""He definitely wasn't. I didn't even ask him about it, but it was just something I wanted to do for myself. ""I saw the power of it really, the meditation and the deep breathing and things like that, that they teach you in hypnobirthing, when I was really sick, and actually I realised that this was something I could take control of, I suppose, during labour. It was hugely powerful."" Speaking on theHappy Mum, Happy Baby podcast,external, Catherine told author and host Giovanna Fletcher that theFive Big Questions On The Under Fives,externalsurvey she has launched aims to ask people ""what is it that matters for them in raising their children today."" ""I had an amazing granny who devoted a lot of time to us, playing with us, doing arts and crafts and going to the greenhouse to do gardening, and cooking with us,"" she said. Kate launches childhood survey to help under-fives Duchess of Cambridge in surprise NI visit Duchess's teachers delighted at surprise royal hug ""And I try and incorporate a lot of the experiences that she gave us at the time into the experiences that I give my children now."" By Daniela Relph, royal correspondent These are some of the most open and candid words we've heard from the Duchess of Cambridge. She speaks personally about her childhood and reflects on the value of her stable upbringing. There are many insights into her own experience of pregnancy and motherhood that many will recognise. She shares the misery of extreme morning sickness, the power of hypnobirthing, the uncertainty of those early days with a new baby and the guilt of working and relying on others to help you. She also describes how she felt in the moments before facing the world's media outside the hospital just a day after giving birth and holding a newborn Prince George in her arms. She said it was terrifying. It's clear the duchess felt comfortable speaking to the podcast host, Giovanna Fletcher. That ease comes from the fact this area is now a real priority for Catherine. Her royal work has a sharp focus on family and specifically early intervention - helping vulnerable parents with children under the age of five who need extra support. The Five Big Questions survey she launched last month asking for people's views on early childhood has so far drawn more than 200,000 responses. The duchess said her own priorities included providing her children with the ""happy home"" and ""safe environment"" she had enjoyed as a child. She said she was ""passionate"" about children spending a lot of time outside, adding that it was ""so great for physical and mental wellbeing"" and laying the foundations for healthy development. ""It's such a great environment to spend time in, building those quality relationships without the distractions of 'I've got to cook' and 'I've got to do this'. And actually, it's so simple,"" she said. The image of Princess Charlotte smelling a bluebell was taken by the duchess at their home in Norfolk last spring A picture of Catherine's daughter, Princess Charlotte, smelling a bluebell has been released following the duchess's interview. The image of the four-year-old was taken by the duchess at their home in Norfolk in spring last year. The month-long online poll, conducted by Ipsos Mori on behalf of Catherine's Royal Foundation, aims to ""spark a national conversation"" on early childhood, Kensington Palace has said. Launched in January, it is thought to be the biggest survey of its kind and the results are intended to guide the duchess's future work. ""It's going to take a long time, I'm talking about a generational change, but hopefully this is the first small step: to start a conversation around the importance of early childhood development,"" Catherine said. The duchess appeared on the podcast after visiting children at a nursery in south London ""It's not just about happy, healthy children. This is for lifelong consequences and outcomes."" Ms Fletcher - who is married to Tom Fletcher from McFly - said Kate seemed ""passionate"" about the subject and it was ""beyond wonderful to sit and talk further about the survey, her work - for which she has so much knowledge, and her own experiences of being a mother"". ""It doesn't matter who you are, what you have, or where you come from - we're all trying to do our best with our children while continuously doubting our decisions and wondering if we're getting it completely wrong. Talking helps unite us all,"" she said. 1.What do you believe is most important for children growing up in the UK today to live a happy adult life?Rank from most important to least important: Good physical and mental health Good friendships and relationships Access to opportunities Access to a good education 2.Which of these statements is closest to your opinion?

How do I stay safe in a storm?,"A large trampoline blew on to tracks at Bickley during Storm Ciara As England is hit by the second stormy weekend in a row, here are some tips to stay safe and minimise the damage. Many areas are still recovering from Storm Ciara ahead of the warnings for the arrival of Storm Dennis. It is ""likely to bring very heavy rain, flooding and disruption to travel"", the Met Office says . Warnings of very heavy rain are in force,externalin some parts between noon on Saturday and 15:00 GMT on Sunday. Andwith gales of 60mph to 70mph also expected, here is the advice about staying safe and the answers to questions such as how do you stop your trampoline from blowing away? It's safer not to drive at all in a storm If your journey is not absolutely necessary then it's safest not to drive at all, police forces across England have said. If you have to drive then Ben Aldous the RAC's patrol of the year warned to take ""extreme care"" especially on coastal or exposed routes. ""Combine the strength of the wind with heavy showers, and you have a recipe for some treacherous driving conditions,"" he said. ""We strongly recommend drivers reduce their speed and leave plenty of space between their vehicle and those around them. ""Be particularly careful when passing high-sided vehicles when the potential for strong cross-winds could blow them off course. ""Drivers in rural areas should be particularly cautious of falling debris."" A trampoline was removed from train tracks at Chelsfield Photographs offlyaway trampolinescirculated on social media during Storm Ciara after several caused train delays. Network Rail asked business owners and people living near railways to secure anything outside which could be blown on to the tracks. RoSPA said,externaltrampolines should be stored safely ""particularly during winter months when the wind can force a trampoline to become airborne"". ""Tie down large trampolines - there are tether kits available that can be used for this purpose,"" it said. ""With smaller trampolines, flip them upside down. ""Remove safety netting from enclosure or cage frames to reduce the sail-like qualities of the cages during windy weather."" Many insurance companies have 24 hour helplines Home buildings, contents and commercial business policies cover storm and flood damage, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI). Malcolm Tarling, from the ABI, said: ""This latest storm comes hot on the heels of Storm Ciara, and insurers are ready for it, as they know that sometimes these storms hit in quick succession. ""They will be fully geared up to help customers hit by Storm Dennis recover as quickly as possible...most will have 24-hour emergency helplines."" He advised people not to throw away damaged items, unless they were a danger to health, as they may be able to be repaired or restored. ""For example, for damaged carpets, keeping a small portion may be sufficient for your insurer or it may be possible to keep a record by taking pictures of damaged items on your smart phone,"" he said. Comprehensive motor insurance covers the cost of repairing or replacing vehicles damaged by storms. A man suffered minor injuries when a tree fell on his car in Bedfordshire during Storm Ciara If you find a tree or other obstruction to a motorway or A road you should report it to Highways England. For most other roads it is the local council that needs to know. In both cases, the contact details can be foundhere,external. If you think there's a danger to life or safety then call emergency services. If the tree has fallen on to a power line then contact the electricity provider. A tree fell on to the tracks near Sittingbourne on the line to Chatham during Storm Ciara Storm Dennis is likely to disrupt some rail journeys between London Euston, the West Midlands and Chilterns, Manchester, Liverpool, Lancashire and Cumbria, Network Rail said. Passenger director Jake Kelly said: ""Storm Ciara dumped a month-and-a-half of rain on us last weekend, leaving ground waterlogged and rivers swollen. ""We had a lot of flooding in the North West and a lot of it disrupted the railway, for example at Todmorden and Caldew near Carlisle. ""With Storm Dennis set to bring more high winds and further rainfall this Saturday and Sunday, we're preparing for more of the same. ""Our advice to passengers is check before you travel at National Rail Enquires or with your train operator."" While most operators are planning to run normal services,National Rail has warned there could be delays,externalbecause of the weather while LNER said there would be speed restrictions in place across the network. Staff at Superdrug in Northampton spotted the badger before it hid behind the perfume counter It's not just people who need to take extra care during storms.A badger fell through the roof of a Superdrugstore in Northampton after it tried to shelter from Storm Ciara in a ventilation shaft. Jason Finch, RSPCA Inspector National Water Rescue Coordinator, warned people living in areas at risk of flooding should have an escape plan to get livestock and other animals out of danger. ""Don't put your own or another life in danger to attempt an animal rescue,"" he said. ""The RSPCA has an experienced team of 80 inspectors - trained to work in water, to rescue both people and animals - to provide assistance to communities affected by flooding."" Some pet owners have shared photographs of their animals cooped up indoors during storms. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Finch said dog owners should plan walks to avoid extreme weather. ""Two or three shorter walks may be a better option to avoid being out in the wet weather for a long period of time,"" he said. ""Cats should have constant access to the house, and outdoor cats to a warm, inside area such as an outbuilding or barn with appropriate heating."" He said it could be necessary to keep pets inside if the wind becomes very extreme so try to occupy them with toys to prevent them becoming restless.

French Asians angered by racism,"One Franco-Chinese writer referred to the hostility sparked by the coronavirus as ""China-bashing"" French Asians have taken to social media to complain of a backlash against them in response to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. Anti-Asian racism has been reported in the UK and elsewhere, and now French Asians have complained of abuse on public transport and social media. They have been using the hashtag JeNeSuisPasUnVirus (I'm not a virus). There was an outcry when local newspaper Le Courier Picard used the inflammatory headlines ""Alerte jaune"" (Yellow alert) and ""Le pÃ©ril jaune?"" (Yellow peril?), complete with an image of a Chinese woman wearing a protective mask. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The paper quickly apologised, saying it had not meant to use some of the ""worst Asian stereotypes"". StÃ©phane Nivet, head of Licra (the International League against racism and anti-Semitism), said no newspaper would have dared use the headline ""Black alert"" so it was clear there was a problem. As the hashtag spread, one woman, Cathy Tran, described hearing two men on her way to work in the eastern town of Colmar saying; ""Watch out, a Chinese girl is coming our way."" ""On my way home from work, a man on a scooter passed me by, telling me to put on a mask,"" Ms Tran told the BBC. Another hashtag user complained: ""Stop asking if we're dangerous if we cough while all the people around us are doing so."" France is planning to send a plane to Wuhan on Thursday to evacuate about 250 people, including non-French EU citizens. The fourth case in France is said to be an elderly Chinese tourist on holiday in Paris. Lou Chengwang appealed on Twitter: ""I'm Chinese, but I'm not a virus! I know everyone's scared of the virus but no prejudice, please."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many noted that it was not just French Chinese who were being stigmatised. Shana Cheng, a 17-year-old Parisian of Vietnamese and Cambodian origin, told the BBC that she had faced humiliating comments on a bus in the city on Sunday from both young and old. ""There's a Chinese woman, she is going to contaminate us, she needs to go home,"" she heard one passenger say. People looked at her ""in a disgusted way, as if I was the virus"". No-one stood up for her, she said, so she decided to ignore the comments and listen to her music. But she did cough and sniff ""so as to play on their fears"", she added. Britons on Wuhan flights to be quarantined Island quarantine plan as foreigners leave China UK boarding schools warn against virus 'xenophobia' 'Breakthrough' coronavirus copy grown in Australia Cathy Tran said she was not surprised by people's reactions and saw the coronavirus as an excuse for people to be racist. The difference this time was the degree of racism, which she had never experienced before. ""We rarely hear Asians speak about racism, because we are known to suffer in silence, but here we are all in the same basket and it's too much,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

Franco-Chinese writer-director Grace Ly describes the hostility as ""China-bashing"" and incitement to anti-Asian hatred. ""Is it so hilarious with these towns in quarantine, people isolated and deaths?"" she wrote. In Canada, there are concerns among the Chinese-Canadian community that what happened during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in Toronto could happen again. Sars, which is caused by a coronavirus, killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected in an outbreak that started in China in 2002. In Canada alone there were 438 suspected Sars cases - most in the city of Toronto - and 44 people died over the spring and summer of 2003. City councillors and Chinese community leaders in Toronto urged residents, at a news conference on Wednesday, not to cast blame or discriminate against residents of Asian descent amid fears of the spread of the coronavirus. The Sars outbreak hit Toronto financially, as tourism dropped and people stayed home. But Chinese-owned and Chinatown businesses were hit especially hard, and saw a loss of income estimated at between 40% to 80%. ""The harm was serious,"" Justin Kong, executive director of the Toronto chapter of the Chinese Canadian National Council, told the BBC. ""A loss of income, a loss of jobs, people losing their livelihood, losing their homes. Facing stigma at school, at the workplace."" Allow Twitter content?

Near the height of the outbreak, former Canadian prime minister Jean ChrÃ©tien made a point of stopping for lunch in Toronto's Chinatown, to show there was no reason to shun Asian businesses. Mr Kong says people are still trying to understand what the impact of the new coronavirus outbreak might be. But he says there is ""fear within the community about the disease and fear of the impact of discrimination in our day-to-day lives; the impact it will have on industries, workers, and small businesses and the community at large"".

Car on wrong side of road near Harry Dunn base,"This video can not be played Car seen on wrong side of road near Harry Dunn base A new video has emerged on social media of a car being driven on the wrong side of the road outside the RAF base near where 19-year-old Harry Dunn died. Mr Dunn was killed after a crash by RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire which led to suspect Anne Sacoolas leaving the UK under diplomatic immunity. The footage appears to have been recorded on Thursday.Another car was recorded being driven on the wrong side of the roadnear the base last month. Police said they would investigate. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said the emergence of the latest video near RAF Croughton was ""shocking but not a surprise"". The crash that killed Mr Dunn happened on 27 August outside the RAF base where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan worked as a US intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, is to be charged with causing death by dangerous driving. In January, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the UK's request for her extradition. Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley met the US air base's commander on Thursday to discuss safety. He said his meeting with Colonel Bridget McNamara was ""encouraging"". A joint statement released by the police and the colonel said Ms McNamara ""provided a detailed brief of all the proactive measures that the base continues to do to help those living on the base adjust to UK driving standards"". ""It was clear from the meeting that the base already had a significant number of measures in place in ensuring driver safety,"" Mr Adderley said. ""The base and the force have continued to work together."" 'No haggle' over Dunn suspect and Prince Andrew Harry Dunn police want 'wrong-way' driving talks 'No plans' for Harry Dunn death public inquiry ""Additional provisions"" are to be introduced and both parties ""are doing all that they can to prevent any future harm on the roads in and around the site"", he said. Colonel McNamara said Northamptonshire Police had been a ""steadfast partner of our base"" and she looked forward to its continued relationships. Mr Seiger said the family was ""shocked"" at the news of the meeting, and said Mr Dunn's family ""should have been there"". He said Northamptonshire Police and the US Air Force ""fail to acknowledge that there is a problem"". ""As evidenced by further video today, a further tragedy is inevitable,"" he added.

""This [storm] could be a step up from what we have seen before,"" Mr Curtin said.

UK power operators say they have employed extra engineers and call centre staff to respond to any possible impact of the storm, after widespread power cuts last weekend. Newly appointed Environment Secretary George Eustice said he had spoken to local flood response groups across the country on Friday. Highlighting the Environment Agency's preparations, he added: ""We are fully focused on ensuring that communities are protected and have access to the support and advice they need to stay safe this weekend.""

Ian Best lives there with his family and told BBC Radio 5 Live how he raised the alarm with his neighbours when he realised the water was coming in. ""It was awful,"" he said. ""I had my daughter crying upstairs. You don't know how high it's going to come, and when we could see the cars floating down the road... it just happened so quickly. ""We had a phone call at 4am - by 4.30 we were underwater."" Ian has already taken up his kitchen floor. ""I spoke to the insurers,"" he said. ""As long as we take plenty of photos we can take it up and start drying the rooms out - but the floor underneath doesn't look too good."" ""We've got another room we can't get into at the moment because the furniture's floated and I can't open the door so I'll have to take the door frame off. ""Devastated doesn't come close to it.

Stormy Daniels' ex-lawyer guilty over extortionThe lawyer was accused of seeking to extort up to $25m (Â£18.9m) from sportswear giant Nike.,"Michael Avenatti could face more than 40 years in prison Michael Avenatti, who represented porn star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against President Trump, has been found guilty of attempted extortion. The lawyer was accused of seeking to extort up to $25m (Â£18.9m) from Nike. He had threatened to release information that might be harmful to the popular sports brand. Avenatti emerged as a vocal critic of Mr Trump two years ago when he began representing Ms Daniels, and even suggested he might run for president. He was found guilty by a jury after a three-week trial and could face up to 42 years in prison when sentenced in June. Federal prosecutors in New York said Avenatti, 48, met a lawyer for Nike in March 2019. During their meeting, he threatened to release damaging information about Nike unless it paid him between $15m and $25m. At the time he approached Nike, Avenatti had been representing his then-client Gary Franklin, who ran a youth basketball league in Los Angeles. Court papers said Avenatti threatened to hold a press conference alleging Nike had made illicit payments to young basketball players in Los Angeles. Revealing this would wipe billions from Nike's stock value, he had suggested. Nike immediately reported the matter to federal prosecutors. Avenatti was arrested shortly after announcing he would hold a news conference about a scandal surrounding the company. ""This was an old-fashioned shakedown,"" prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said at the time. The jury heard that Avenatti had been at least $11m in debt. Last month,Avenatti's lawyers said he was suffering while being held in solitary confinementand under 24-hour lockdown in the same Manhattan prison cell that housed Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. Avenatti previously represented porn star Stormy Daniels Avenatti formerly represented Stormy Daniels, who tried to sue the president to get out of a non-disclosure agreement she had signed before the 2016 presidential election. The non-disclosure agreement related to an affair she said he had with Mr Trump in 2006, but the case was eventually dismissed. In May last year, Avenatti was charged with defrauding her of book proceeds, and faces trial in New York in April. He denies all the charges. He also faces another trial in Los Angeles in May on accusations he defrauded clients and others of millions of dollars.

John Curtin, the Environment Agency's executive director of flood and coastal risk management, said Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire were the areas he was most ""concerned"" about. ""This [storm] could be a step up from what we have seen before,"" Mr Curtin said. ""We had a big storm last weekend, [we now have] saturated catchments, snowmelt and rainfall, so it is a perfect storm.""

These include the Foss Barrier in York, the Thames Barrier in London and another in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on the River Severn. UK power operators say they have employed extra engineers and call centre staff to respond to any possible impact of the storm, after widespread power cuts last weekend. Newly appointed Environment Secretary George Eustice said he had spoken to local flood response groups across the country on Friday. Highlighting the Environment Agency's preparations, he added: ""We are fully focused on ensuring that communities are protected and have access to the support and advice they need to stay safe this weekend.""

"Sex video ends Paris mayor race for Macron allyBenjamin Griveaux condemns a ""torrent of mud"" after a video is apparently posted by a Russian artist.Europe","As he bowed out, Mr Griveaux said no-one should be subjected to such a ""torrent of mud"" A sex video has ended French ruling party candidate Benjamin Griveaux's hopes of becoming mayor of Paris. The ex-spokesman for President Emmanuel Macron's government, who was already trailing in the race, was apparently targeted by a Russian protest artist accusing him of hypocrisy. ""No-one should be subjected to such abuse,"" said Mr Griveaux, 42. The video, showing a man in a compromising position, quickly spread on social media late on Thursday. Petr Pavlensky, who sought asylum from Russia in 2017, said he had posted the video online. Opponents from across the political spectrum voiced their outrage. Incumbent Mayor Anne Hidalgo appealed for respect for people's private lives, while far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon condemned the attack as ""odious"". Far-right leader Marine Le Pen suggested that for the sake of democracy Mr Griveaux should perhaps not have resigned. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe expressed his support for his former colleague and Interior Minister Christophe Castaner went further, warning that publishing videos without the author's consent was an offence punishable by a significant fine and up to two years in jail. The video appeared on a little known website that featured a profile of Mr Griveaux's political ambitions and his ""fanatical faith in family values"". It then alleged that Mr Griveaux had exchanged intimate mobile phone messages with a young woman and sent her a personal video. A link to the site was shared by an MP who was forced to resign from Mr Macron's LREM (Republic on the Move) party in late 2018. Mr Griveaux told the BFMTV news channel that for the past year he and his family had been subjected to ""defamatory remarks, lies, rumours, anonymous attacks... and even death threats"". ""This torrent of mud has affected me and above all hurt the people I love."" Mr Griveaux's lawyer said he would press charges over the publication of the video, which he said violated the right to a private life. Mr Pavlensky, who says he posted the video online, first gained notoriety by nailing his scrotum to Moscow's Red Square in 2013. He fled Russia and sought asylum in France when he was accused by the authorities of a sexual assault that he denied.

He later caused minor damage to a Banque de France branch by setting that alight. This video can not be played Pyotr Pavlensky set fire to the door of the FSB, Russia's security service He told French news channel LCI that Mr Griveaux was only the first politician that he would target: he had only just begun, he claimed. Politicians had to be honest and he said he would carry on fighting the ""propaganda and puritanism of politicians"". French media have traditionally avoided prying into the private lives of people in public life and a number of figures referred distastefully to the ""Americanisation"" of politics. ""I don't like people mixing up political life with people's privacy,"" said MP Alexis CorbiÃ¨re. Lawyer Marie-Anne SoubrÃ© told a French talk show she was sick to her stomach that France had got to this point. ""To what new low have we fallen in public life that anyone is prepared to publish this kind of thing to bring down politicians?"" Mr Griveaux was not favourite to win the mayoral race in March, but he has been a very close ally of the president and his political demise is inevitably an embarrassment for the president, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris. He was trailing in third place, his campaign hampered by a dissident Macronite candidate called CÃ©dric Villani. Mr Villani described the ""outrageous attack"" on Mr Griveaux and his family as a serious threat to French democracy. Macron vows to save Mont Blanc from overcrowding French beating scandal reveals Macron's feet of clay Macron appeals to strikers not to ruin Christmas Ms Hidalgo, the current Socialist mayor, is leading in the polls, ahead of Republicans candidate Rachida Dati. Mr Macron came to power in 2017 and his new LREM party secured a majority in the National Assembly. However, the party has seen a spate of defections in recent months and now has only 299 MPs in the National Assembly, down from 314 three years ago. LREM is expected to have poor local election results next month, but its majority in parliament is safe because of its alliance with the MoDem party.
