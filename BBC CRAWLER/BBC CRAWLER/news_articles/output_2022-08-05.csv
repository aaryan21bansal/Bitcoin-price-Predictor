Sunak: I took money out of deprived urban areas,"A clip has emerged of ex-Chancellor Rishi Sunak saying he diverted public money from ""deprived urban areas"". In a video obtained bythe New Statesman,external, Mr Sunak tells an audience in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, he wanted to ensure ""areas like this"" got the funding they deserved. Defending his remarks, Mr Sunak said he was arguing that towns and rural areas needed help not just ""big urban areas"". Labour said the leadership race was revealing the Tories' ""true colours"". The party's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""It's scandalous that Rishi Sunak is openly boasting that he fixed the rules to funnel taxpayers' money to prosperous Tory shires."" Ms Nandyhas written,externalto Levelling Up Secretary Greg Clark asking him to ""urgently investigate"" the changes made by Mr Sunak to funding formulas. Pressure is on for next PM to tackle economy swiftly What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Truss and Sunak row over Bank's recession warning In the clip - filmed on 29 July - Mr Sunak says: ""I managed to start changing the funding formulas, to make sure areas like this are getting the funding they deserve. ""We inherited a bunch of formulas from Labour that shoved all the funding into deprived urban areas and that needed to be undone. ""I started the work of undoing that."" Mr Sunak's team have said his comments were in reference to the introduction of the levelling up fund and changes made to Treasury formulas on investment. The government has changed the way it assesses projects by altering the Treasury's ""green book"", which guides ministers in making investment decisions. Some submissions to a review of the ""green book"" in 2020 suggested,externalthat the old system relied too much on cost-benefit analysis (how much monetary value can be created for how many people) and that this skewed the system towards building more infrastructure in London and the South East of England. But as Tunbridge Wells is in the South East of England, changing that would not necessarily help it. It is also the least deprived local authority in Kent, according tothe index of multiple deprivation,external. The system waschanged to require projects to explain how they would promote government priorities,externalsuch as levelling up or achieving net zero emissions, before considering their costs and benefits. This means funding will not necessarily go to the ""deprived urban areas"" where the largest number of people might benefit, but can instead go to more sparsely populated ones that have not received much investment in the past. During a hustings event in Eastbourne on Friday night, Mr Sunak defended his comments by suggesting that deprivation existed across the country. Acknowledging the video clip, he explained that he wanted to ""level up everywhere"", saying that was not just about helping ""very large urban cities"". He added: ""I believe it's about investing in levelling up in small towns, in rural communities, in coastal communities like those here in the South East."" Earlier, Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen - a Sunak supporter - told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the clip had been taken out of context, adding: ""What he was getting across was why is it that poor urban areas receive significantly higher funding than poor rural or town areas."" He said places such as Devon, Teesside and parts of Tunbridge Wells needed fairer funding. But Conservative MP and Truss ally Jake Berrytweeted:,external""In public Rishi Sunak claims he wants to level up the North, but here, he boasts about trying to funnel vital investment away from deprived areas? He says one thing and does another."" A source in the rival Liz Truss campaign said: ""Levelling up isn't about pitting one area of the country against another, or laying dividing lines between urban v rural, towns v cities. ""It is about unleashing growth and making sure every individual has the chance to thrive. Liz has a plan to create an aspiration nation based on equality of opportunity, and will deliver it in a conservative way."" Rishi Sunak's comments appear to fly in the face of recent Conservative rhetoric about levelling up and securing Labour's former ""red wall"". Why would the former chancellor be boasting about diverting funding away from deprived urban areas? In short, because he was in Royal Tunbridge Wells at the time, one of his party's traditional heartlands, speaking to grassroots members. And while the Conservative party doesn't publish data on its membership, research shows most of them live in the South East of England, and are generally older and relatively wealthy. Mr Sunak's team insist he was talking about changes to ensure pockets of deprivation in towns and rural areas got the funding they deserved. His opponents will seize on his comments as not just clumsy, but another example of him appearing to be out of touch. The comments were made as part of Mr Sunak's campaign bid to replace Boris Johnson as Conservative leader and prime minister. He is competing against Ms Truss, who polls suggest is more popular among Conservative members. Friday night's hustings saw a brief disturbance when Ms Truss's opening remarks were interrupted by a small group of climate activists, who were believed to be from the Green New Deal Rising group. The protesters heckled Ms Truss over climate change and energy bills, shouting ""shame on you"". After the group was ejected from the event, Ms Truss took aim at what she called ""unfair protests"" that disrupted people's lives. She pledged to clamp down on ""militant people who try and disrupt our country"" - whether from trade unions or environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion. Another protester was later removed from the event after interrupting Ms Truss. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters interrupt Liz Truss speech by delivering speeches of their own.

Monkeypox: Can we still stop the outbreak?,"Monkeypox has caught the world by surprise. It has long been a fixture in parts of central and western Africa where people live close to the forest animals that carry the virus. But now it has gone global - it is spreading in ways that have not been seen before and on a scale that is unprecedented. There have been nearly 27,000 confirmed cases of the disease - mostly in men having sex with other men - across 88 countries. The World Health Organization says this is a global emergency. So can monkeypox be stopped? Or are we now doomed to have another virus spreading around the world? There are three things we need to consider: Is the virus particularly tricky to deal with? Do we have the ability to stop it? Is there the will to tackle a disease principally affecting gay and bisexual men? There's nothing special about the biology of monkeypox virus. It is not an unstoppable force. Covid probably was - it spreads so readily that it was arguably impossible to contain even in the earliest days of the pandemic. But monkeypox has a harder time getting from one person to the next. It needs close physical contact - such as through infected skin, prolonged face-to-face contact or contaminated surfaces like a bedsheet or a towel. The two viruses are simply in different leagues, and past monkeypox outbreaks have just fizzled out. And we have already overcome the far greater challenge of defeating the virus's deadly cousin, smallpox. ""Monkeypox is easier as it is less transmissible than smallpox so we're in a much better position,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. However, one issue is some people have mild symptoms or ones that can be easily mistaken for a sexually transmitted disease or chickenpox. That means it can be unwittingly passed on to others. Monkeypox: What are the symptoms? The virus has got into a group of people who are having enough sex or enough intimate contact with enough partners for it to overcome its own inadequacies and spread. The virus is not a classed as a sexually transmitted infection. But a studyin the New England Journal of Medicine,externalestimated 95% of monkeypox infections were being acquired through sex, particularly sex between men. Sex, obviously, is full of all the intimate skin-on-skin contact that the virus uses to spread. That leaves two options for containing the disease - persuading people to have less sex; or to reduce the risk of catching the infection when exposed. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""The easiest way to prevent it is to close down all highly active sexual networks for a couple of months until it goes away, but I don't think that will ever happen - do you?"" Some people do adjust their sex lives in response to warnings about monkeypox and advice has been targeted at those most at risk. But Prof Hunter argues the lesson of sexually transmitted infections - from syphilis in the Middle Ages through to now - is that people still have sex and ""vaccination is pretty much the only option"". Fortunately, the smallpox vaccine which was used to eradicate that virus is around 85% effective at preventing monkeypox. There are limited supplies as stockpiles are kept in case of someone weaponising smallpox, not to tackle an unprecedented monkeypox outbreak. However, not everyone at risk would need vaccinating to stop the outbreak. ""Herd immunity"" means that once a critical threshold of people are protected the virus can no longer spread. This will be much easier to achieve with monkeypox than other diseases - including Covid. While anybody can catch monkeypox, it is gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who are disproportionately affected in this outbreak. The virus can affect anyone, but the outbreak is predominantly in men having sex with men This can make it easier to control the virus as, overall, it is a group that is more clued into sexual health. It also allows resources to be targeted at those who need it - such as vaccinating men having sex with men rather than the whole population. However, stigma, discrimination and abuse can stop people seeking help, particularly in countries wheresex between men is illegal. ""Some countries don't have infrastructure in place and some may not have the will to test for monkeypox, because it's men who have sex with men,"" said Prof Francois Balloux, from University College London. There are still challenges in countries that support LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender - rights. Even policies such as asking people to isolate - which we're so familiar with from Covid - can have unintended consequences. ""That's tantamount to coming out - whether to a wife or parents [as you suddenly have to explain why] - so there is a strong pressure not to say who your contacts were,"" said Prof Hunter. Already some countries do appear to be getting on top of the virus. The UK says the number of infections appears to have levelled offat around 35-a-day,external. But cases continue to soar elsewhere, including the US whichhas declared an emergency. But it won't be enough for just rich countries to get on top of the virus when it's nowin more than 80 countries,externalthat don't have a long history of the disease. ""It's very unclear to me whether it will be controlled completely, some countries will get on top of it, some might not,"" said Prof Balloux. The WHO's technical lead for monkeypox, Dr Rosamund Lewis, says it is ""possible"" to end the outbreak but warns ""we don't have a crystal ball"" and it's not clear if the organisation will be able to ""support countries enough and communities enough to stop this outbreak."" The endemic countries in Africa - where monkeypox is always there - will continue to deal with the virus as it continually jumps from wild animals into people. Studies have shownthe problem is getting worse,externalsince the smallpox eradication programme ended, as few people under 50 will have been immunised. The only thing that would stop that is a mass vaccination campaign, ""but there's a big debate in Africa whether that is appropriate or necessary,"" says Prof Hunter. The worry is monkeypox could become a permanent presence in people around the globe rather than just in countries with infected animals. At the moment that is in men having sex with men, but the longer the outbreak goes on the more chances the virus has to establish itself more widely. There have been isolated cases in children and women, but these have not kickstarted their own outbreaks in classrooms or workplaces. However, the risks increase as the virus is given time to become better at infecting people. We have witnessed how Covid evolved and variants such as Omicron became so much better at infecting us. ""Unless the virus changes I personally doubt it will spread in children or more generally in people who don't have many sexual partners,"" said Prof Balloux. ""But the longer the wait, the higher the risk it might change,"" he said. The other issue is monkeypox has a knack for infecting a wide range of mammals including squirrels, rats, dormice and monkeys in Africa. There is a danger that the virus could get a foothold in other animals and start bouncing between species.The 2003 monkeypox outbreak in the US,external- which led to 47 cases across six states - was driven by pet prairie dogs. Tackling this outbreak of monkeypox is possible, but the longer we leave it the harder it gets and the greater the risk.

Acute drought leaves France short of drinking water,"A dried-up river in Le Broc, southern France The French government has set up a crisis team to tackle a historic drought that has left more than 100 municipalities short of drinking water. Trucks are taking water to those areas, as ""there is nothing left in the pipes"", Minister for Ecological Transition Christophe BÃ©chu said. The prime minister's office said it was France's worst recorded drought. Water use is being restricted in 93 regions. Dry conditions are expected to continue for at least the next two weeks. The state energy company EDF has had to reduce output at some nuclear power plants, as river temperatures are too high to provide sufficient cooling, AFP news agency reports. There are fears that the drought - hitting nearly all of mainland France - will reduce crop yields, exacerbating the food crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. Europeans are already struggling with higher food prices as grain exports from Russia and Ukraine - among the world's top producers - are much lower than normal. The heatwave that has baked France since June has prompted trees and bushes to shed their leaves early, creating scenes that look autumnal. In July France had just 9.7mm (0.38 inches) of rain, making it the driest month since March 1961, the national weather service Meteo-France said. Irrigation has been banned in much of the north-west and south-east of France to conserve water. A squirrel was among animals rescued in Saint-CÃ©zaire-sur-Siagne, south-east France The corn harvest, used mainly for animal feed, is expected to be 18.5% lower this year compared with 2021, the agriculture ministry said. The main corn-growing areas are Alsace in the east and western regions, and the harvest is already under way. Corn exports from France, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria are all expected to be lower this year because of the heatwave, and those lower volumes will push prices up, French BFMTV reported. Livestock farmers in the Alps are having to descend into the valleys by truck every day to collect water for their animals, which adds several hundred euros to their weekly fuel bills, Broadcaster TF1 reported.

China halts co-operation with US on key issues,"Beijing is currently holding military drills in the air and seas around Taiwan China is halting co-operation with the US in several key areas including climate change, military talks and efforts to combat international crime. The new measures follow a trip to Taiwan by a US congressional delegation led by senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi. China, which also announced it was sanctioning Ms Pelosi and her family, views the visit as a challenge to its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. The self-ruled island sees itself as distinct from the mainland. The measures were announced by China's foreign ministry on Friday. It said dialogue between US and Chinese defence officials would be cancelled, while co-operation on returning illegal immigrants, climate change, and investigating international crime would be suspended. The two major powers have maintained cordial diplomatic ties on the need to combat climate change in recent years. At last year's climate summit in Glasgow, China vowed to work ""with urgency"" with the US to cut emissions. The countries have also found rare common cause on efforts to fight the trade of illegal drugs such as fentanyl. The decision to halt co-operation was taken because Ms Pelosi visited Taiwan ""in disregard of China's strong opposition and serious representations,"" the Chinese ministry said in a statement. It also accused the US delegation and Ms Pelosi - who is the highest-ranking US politician to travel to the island in 25 years - of ""egregious provocations"". In a message posted on Twitter on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying criticised US foreign policy by comparing it to the police killing of George Floyd, the unarmed black American whose death in 2020 sparked global anti-racism protests. ""We cannot allow the US to take itself as 'world policeman' and treat other countries as George Floyd whom it can bully and strangle at will,"" she wrote. At a news conference later on Friday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Ms Pelosi ""had every right"" to go to Taiwan and said China's new measures were ""fundamentally irresponsible"". ""We'll continue our efforts to keep open lines of communications with Beijing, while defending our interests and values,"" she said. Analysis by John Sudworth, former Beijing correspondent in Washington There can be few clearer examples of just how far, and how fast, the international political landscape is shifting. The statement from Beijing marks a new low point in the defining strategic relationship of our time. The consensus, just a few years ago, was that an established superpower should build strong trade and investment ties with a newly emerging one. The ideological differences would then fade away. Instead, while China has indeed become the factory of the world, deeply integrated into global supply chains, it has grown more authoritarian at home and more assertive abroad. A 1997 trip to Taiwan by then US House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for example, was met with little opposition. The Nancy Pelosi visit has been met with missiles - flown directly over a democracy and the heads of its 24 million people - whose appetite, by the way, for China's vision for unification dwindles ever further the more authoritarian it becomes. And now, any American citizen worried about the impact of Chinese precursor chemicals - sold into Mexico and then turned into the fentanyl that is fuelling thousands of US deaths - will also feel the impact of these shifting geopolitical plates. The Chinese statement suspends counter-narcotics co-operation. China's ""shared future for mankind"" messaging on climate change is similarly put on ice, now seemingly held hostage to the precondition that its claims to Taiwan be recognised. Nancy Pelosi may have given China the pretext. But this is a shift that was already well under way. The battle over values is front and centre stage once again, and the profound challenges it presents for the existing global order are likely only to increase. Although the US does not officially recognise Taiwan, it maintains strong relations with the island - which includes selling weapons for Taiwan to defend itself. Ms Pelosi is currently in Japan on the final leg of an Asia tour, and said on Friday that China ""will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there"". ON THE GROUND:Taiwan's 'Pelosi lovefest' EXPLAINER:China and Taiwan: A really simple guide ANALYSIS:Where Taiwan crisis leaves Biden's China policy Speaking to the BBC, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu defended the visit which he said would ""raise the profile of Taiwan and... allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". He also condemned the large-scale military exercises that China began around the island on Thursday in response to Ms Pelosi's visit. This video can not be played Foreign minister, Joseph Wu, condemns China's military drills around Taiwan Beijing is currently holding military drills in the air and seas around the island and these are expected to continue until Sunday. More than 100 warplanes and 10 warships have taken part in the live-fire exercises, with many apparently crossing the unofficial buffer zone between China and Taiwan. At least one ballistic missile has flown directly over the island, according to Chinese state media. Taiwan's foreign ministry has not confirmed or denied whether that is true, but it condemned the ongoing drills as ""highly provocative acts"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken added on Friday that there was ""no justification for this extreme, disproportionate and escalatory military response"". The White House summoned China's ambassador to Washington, condemning China's escalation as ""irresponsible"". In a statement, National Security Council strategic communications co-ordinator John Kirby said the White House had made it clear that the US ""is prepared for what Beijing chooses to do. We will not seek and do not want a crisis."" Why do China and Taiwan have poor relations?China sees the self-ruled island as a part of its territory and insists it should be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary How is Taiwan governed?The island has its own constitution, democratically elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces Who recognises Taiwan?Only a few countries recognise Taiwan. Most recognise the Chinese government in Beijing instead. The US has no official ties with Taiwan but does have a law which requires it to provide the island with the means to defend itself Taiwan foreign minister defends Pelosi visit China condemns 'manic' visit as Pelosi continues tour The view from Taiwan: 'We've had this for 70 years' Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

Lee & Williams win gold after Laugher's second title,"This video can not be played Watch: England's Matty Lee and Noah Williams win gold in men's synchronised 10m platform 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. Matty Lee and Noah Williams won synchronised 10m platform gold after England team-mate Jack Laugher had clinched his second Commonwealth Games title in 24 hours. It marked Olympic champion Lee's first Commonwealth medal of any colour, as he and Williams - silver medallist in 2018 - scored a total of 429.78 points. Earlier, Laugher and partner Anthony Harding won the synchronised 3m springboard title, the third successive Games at which 27-year-old Laugher has won the event. There was also a bronze for England's Commonwealth Games debutant Amy Rollinson in the women's 1m springboard final. Commonwealth Games day-by-day guide & schedule BBC TV, radio & digital coverage times BBC Live guide for links to all live streams Matty Lee and Noah Williams finished with 429.78 points ""In the Commonwealth Games I have never done exactly what I wanted to do,"" Lee told BBC Sport. ""I missed out in 2014, had a rubbish Games in 2018 but I am so happy me and Noah have just smashed the synchro and got gold."" Lee, 24, won Olympic gold in Tokyo with Tom Daley in this event, but with Daley taking a break from the sport he teamed up with 22-year-old Williams earlier this year. Together they won silver at the World Championships in June, with gold coming in their second major competition as a pair in Birmingham. They finished 15.93 points ahead of Canada's Rylan Wiens and Nathan Zsombor-Murray in silver medal position, while Australia's Domonic Bedggood and Cassiel Rousseau took the bronze. England's Ben Cutmore and Kyle Kothari were fourth. ""This is what I do diving for. This is why I have achieved what I have. It is just competing. Especially in front of a home crowd. You don't get better than this,"" Lee added. ""You don't get a chance to do this very often. We are so lucky to be able to do it - I mean that wasn't luck out there, that was pure skill - but we are lucky to get a gold in front of a home crowd. I'm ecstatic."" This video can not be played Commonwealth Games: England's Jack Laugher & Anthony Harding dominate to win 3m synchro gold In Friday's first diving final, Laugher and 22-year-old Harding scored a total of 438.33 points to win gold, as Scotland's Ross Beattie and James Heatly finished fourth. ""Obviously two golds is amazing,"" Laugher, who won 1m springboard gold on Thursday, told BBC Sport. ""I think what me and Tony wanted to take from this was that we wanted to get another good performance under our belt. Certainly Tony achieved that. I've still got some things to improve on."" Laugher and Harding topped the standings from their very first dive, but it wasn't until their third dive - a 3.4 difficulty forward two-and-a-half somersaults with two twists in pike - that their dominance began to show. Their highest score of 88.92 points came on their penultimate dive, the same point at which the Malaysian pair of Chew Yiwei and Ooi Tze Liang - who had been on their heels in second - slipped up, eventually finishing last. Another Malaysian pair, Gabriel Gilbert Daim and Muhammad Puteh, won silver, 61.56 points behind England, while bronze went to Australia's Samuel Fricker and Li Shixin. ""This is my second international in like two or three years,"" Harding said. ""The 3m men's in Great Britain is so hard, it's so tough to get on the big stage and I've worked so hard. I've had to be patient, I've had to wait for it. It's thanks to Jack for seeing me in training, seeing how good I can be and trusting in me and believing in me."" Laugher and Harding only made their debut as a partnership at the World Championships in June, taking silver on that occasion. Their total in Birmingham was higher than Laugher's gold medal-winning totals with Mears at the previous two Commonwealth Games. Of his partnership with Harding, Laugher said: ""We're really good friends and we've got a lot in common. I think our diving styles are very similar. ""He deserves this. He's a great athlete and he's finally got his chance and he's really grabbed a hold of it, and that's something I need in my career - someone with motivation and drive to want to be the best and keep my fire ignited. ""I've been doing this for a long time and having someone new on the scene, raring to go, I think it's really good and I think the synchro partnership is obviously great and we've done some amazing performances this year and I just can't wait for the future.""

'Hungry' Arsenal enjoy perfect start at Palace,"Gabriel Martinelli became the first Brazilian player to score the first goal of a Premier League season Mikel Arteta said his Arsenal side look ""hungry"" after getting their campaign off to the perfect start with victory over Crystal Palace in an entertaining 2022-23 Premier League curtain-raiser at Selhurst Park. The Gunners maintained their impressive pre-season form with an energetic performance that was rewarded when Gabriel Martinelli nodded in a 20th-minute opener from new signing Oleksandr Zinchenko's headed assist. It took Palace most of the first half to adapt to the visitors' tempo, but once they did Odsonne Edouard forced Aaron Ramsdale into a save after Joachim Andersen's header found him in the six-yard box. Buoyed by a vibrant home crowd, the Eagles poured forward in search of a leveller but it was Arsenal who found the net again, Marc Guehi inadvertently heading Bukayo Saka's fierce cross into his own goal late on. ""I have had this feeling for the first few weeks since the boys started pre-season. They are ready, they look hungry, with that mentality that they really want to win,"" Arteta told Match of the Day. ""The team came here to play the way we wanted to play - we were dominant, we were a threat, we were really lively and sharp from the beginning. Then when we felt under pressure we coped with that with resilience.""

We may have to wait until the second series to learn whether Arteta piped Palace anthem 'Glad All Over' out during training before this one - as he did with 'You'll Never Walk Alone' before visiting Anfield last season - orwhether it was the Spaniard's artworkthat set the tone, but his side arrived with a relentless intensity that made Martinelli's opening goal feel inevitable. The 21-year-old Brazilian had earlier missed a glorious chance after Gabriel Jesus waltzed through the Palace defence, skewing wide of the far post after his compatriot's effort was blocked, but he stooped to head in from a clever corner routine. The Gunners lost their opening three league games last season, including another Friday night opener at Brentford, and ultimately narrowly missed out on a return to Champions League football. But they have strengthened with the acquisitions of Jesus and Zinchenko from Manchester City and both already look set to have a big impact on Arteta's young squad. Jesus, who scored seven goals in five pre-season games, caused Palace's back four problems with his relentless work-rate as well as his talent on the ball, and he laid on a chance for Martin Odegaard that the Gunners captain might have done better with. It was another Arsenal debutant who really impressed, with 21-year-old centre back William Saliba - who has spent most of his three years at the club out on loan, producing a fine defensive display. The Frenchman was part of a back four that had to show resilience amid the hosts' growing threat, before Guehi's own goal following a snappy Saka break made things more comfortable. It was a result and performance that will have pleased Arteta, who recorded his 50th league win as Gunners boss, while simultaneously giving Arsenal's top-four rivals a glimpse of what they are up against this term. This video can not be played Missed chances cost Palace - Patrick Vieira Palace boss Patrick Vieira was concerned this game had arrived too early after a disrupted pre-season that saw some of his squad not being able to travel to Singapore and Australia, some players remaining on the treatment table, and the Frenchman still hoping to make more transfer additions. He also said he was happy with the business the Eagles have done so far this window, although only Cheick Doucoure started after arriving from Lens, and Palace struggled to deal with an irrepressible Arsenal early on. The hosts, who took four points off Arsenal last season, did improve and Ramsdale's save from Edouard's header before the break was followed after half-time when the goalkeeper also denied Eberechi Eze following Wilfried Zaha's pass in what kick-started a dominant spell for the Eagles. Palace, who are looking to improve on their 12th-placed finish last season, were unable to capitalise on that pressure and were instead caught out on the break, but Vieira will want to wait until the end of the transfer window before giving a real assessment of where his side are.

Alex Jones must pay extra $45m for hoax claims,"This video can not be played Watch as Alex Jones is told his text messages were sent to opposing lawyers by mistake US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has been ordered to pay $49.3m (Â£41m) in damages after falsely claiming a 2012 school shooting was a hoax. A jury in Texas ruled the radio host must pay $45.2m in punitive damages, in addition to $4.1m in compensatory damages they awarded a day earlier. The two-week defamation trial was brought by the parents of a child killed in the attack. Twenty children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook in Connecticut. The lawsuit was filed by Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin, the separated parents of six-year-old Jesse Lewis, who died in the primary school shooting. The plaintiffs - who said they had endured harassment and emotional distress because of the Infowars founder's misinformation - had sought $150m. The compensatory damages issued on Thursday were meant to cover the actual costs to the family incurred by Jones' defamation, such as the private security they hired during the trial out of fear of an attack from a Jones supporter. LATEST FROM COURT:Five revealing moments from Alex Jones trial BACKGROUND:Sandy Hook: What happened that day LEGAL CASE:Sandy Hook parents sue for defamation The punitive damages are meant to act as a deterrent, and to stop Jones from repeating his offence. ""We ask that you send a very, very simple message and that is: Stop Alex Jones,"" a lawyer for the parents said in court on Friday. ""Stop the monetisation of misinformation and lies. Please."" Earlier on Friday, an economist hired by the parents testified that Jones, his media brand Infowars and parent company Free Speech Systems are worth up to $270m. Jesse Lewis, six, was killed at Sandy Hook Bernard Pettingill told the court that records indicate Jones withdrew $62m for himself from his company in 2021 as his legal troubles grew. ""That number represents, in my opinion, a value of a net worth,"" Mr Pettingill said. ""He's got money put in a bank account somewhere."" Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protections in the first week of the two-week trial. The trial heard that Jones' business had earned about $800,000 in a single day selling diet supplements, gun paraphernalia and survivalist equipment. Lawyers for the parents accused Jones of trying to hide evidence, and argued that he had committed perjury when he denied having sent any messages about the Sandy Hook attack. Earlier this week, an attorney for the plaintiffs revealed that Jones' legal representative had accidentally sent them two years of the radio host's telephone texts. The parents said Jones had made their lives ""hell"" He said that the congressional committee investigating last year's US Capitol riot had requested access to the messages as they look into Jones' alleged role. This is the first of three trials against Jones being brought by family members of Sandy Hook victims. He has already lost a series of defamation cases filed by parents of the victims by default after failing to produce documents and testimony. But this was the first trial in which financial damages were agreed by a jury. Jones appeared briefly in the court on Friday, but was not present for the final verdict. Despite retracting his claims about Sandy Hook, Jones has continued to use his media platform to argue the case was rigged against him and claimed that members of the jury pool ""don't know what planet they're on"". His Infowars website depicted the judge being consumed by flames. His behaviour triggered several rebukes from the judge, who at one point told him: ""This is not your show."" After the verdict on Friday, he posted a video where he claimed his net worth to be a fraction of what was said in court, and condemned the trial as ""beyond any kangaroo-rigged court ever"". Jones - a popular figure in US fringe conservative commentary - has repeatedly argued that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax orchestrated by the government to strip Americans of gun rights, and that the parents of the dead children were ""crisis actors"". His lawyer had cited US constitutional free speech protections and asked for leniency in the trial, saying the jury had already sent a message to all radio hosts ""that their standard of care has changed"".

The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained,"The conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is one of the longest-running and most violent disputes in the world. Its origins go back more than a century. There have been a series of wars between Israel and Arab nations. Uprisings - called intifadas - against Israeli occupation, and reprisals and crackdowns by Israel have also taken place. The consequences of the historic dispute over issues including land, borders and rights are still being felt, and include the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Britain took control of the area known as Palestine in World War One, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled that part of the Middle East. An Arab majority and a Jewish minority lived there, as well as other ethnic groups. Tensions between the Jewish and Arab populations deepened when the UK agreed in principle to the establishment of a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people. Jews had historical links to the land, but Palestinian Arabs also had a claim dating back centuries and opposed the move. The British said the rights of Palestinian Arabs already living there had to be protected. Between the 1920s and 1940s the number of Jews arriving grew, with many fleeing persecution in Europe. The murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust gave added urgency to demands for a safe haven. The Jewish population reached 630,000, just over 30% of the population, by 1947. In 1947, against a backdrop of growing violence between Jews and Arabs - and against British rule - the United Nations (UN) voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states. Jerusalem would become an international city. No Arab nations supported this. They argued the plan gave the Jews more of the land, even though their population was smaller. Britain abstained. It decided to withdraw and to hand the problem to the UN at the end of 14 May 1948. Jewish leaders in Palestine declared an independent state known as Israel hours before British rule ended. Israel was recognised by the UN the following year. The day after Israel declared independence, it was attacked and surrounded by the armies of five Arab nations. The conflict came to be known in Israel as its war of independence. A Haganah (Jewish Underground) fighter just before the start of the Israeli war of independence in 1948 By the time the fighting ended with an armistice in 1949, Israel controlled most of the territory. Agreements left Egypt occupying the Gaza Strip, Jordan occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israel occupying West Jerusalem. About 750,000 Palestinians fled, or were forced from, their homes on land which became Israel and ended up as refugees. The event is known in Arabic as the Nakba (Catastrophe). Arab Legion soldiers fire on fighters of the Haganah, the Jewish Agency self-defence force, in March 1948 In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of Jews left, or were expelled from, Muslim majority countries across the Middle East and North Africa, with many going to Israel. What is known as the Six-Day War changed boundaries in the Middle East and had major consequences for Palestinians. The war saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria and Jordan. It started when Israel, fearing an attack by Egypt and Syria, launched a strike on Egypt's air force. By the time the fighting ended, Israel had captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza from Egypt, most of the Golan Heights from Syria, and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan. About a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem came under Israel's control. Israeli military commanders arrive in East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967 Israel's occupation of these areas has lasted until this day. Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and returned the Sinai. It annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, making them part of Israel, although this has not been recognised by most of the international community. The West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians. Along with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what are widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Palestinians have always opposed Israel's presence in these areas and want them to be part of a future independent state, something backed by the vast majority of the international community. Israel still has overall control of the West Bank, but since the 1990s, a Palestinian government - known as the Palestinian Authority - has run most of its town and cities. There are about 150 Israeli settlements, housing about 700,000 Jews, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Palestinians want all Israeli settlements to be removed and they are considered illegal under international law. However, Israel's government disputes this. It says the biggest settlements at the very least are permanent and that all settlements are rooted in its historical rights. It does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to have their own state and argues that the West Bank is part of the Israeli homeland. The Israeli government announced plans to expand settlements after coming to power in 2022.  It says the creation of a Palestinian state would be a threat to Israeli security. In July 2024, the top court of the UN, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal. It said that Israel should withdraw all settlers and that it was in breach of international agreements on racism and apartheid. Israel's borders explained in maps Israel and the Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital. Israel, which already controlled West Jerusalem, occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later declared the entire city its permanent capital. It says Jerusalem cannot be divided. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Most of the population of East Jerusalem is Palestinian, only a small minority of whom have chosen to become Israeli citizens. Holy sites in Jerusalem are at the centre of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The most sacred site - known to Muslims as Al Aqsa Mosque compound, or Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and to Jews as Temple Mount - lies in East Jerusalem. The UN and most international opinion consider East Jerusalem to be Palestinian land occupied by Israel. The Gaza Strip is a stretch of land surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. It is 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide. Home to about 2.3 million people, it is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. Even before the current war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza had one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. Many people were living below the poverty line and depending on food aid to survive. Gaza's boundaries were drawn up as a result of the 1948 Middle East war, when it was occupied by Egypt. Egypt was driven out of Gaza in the 1967 war and the Strip was occupied by Israel, which built settlements and placed Gaza's Palestinian population under military rule. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods. The UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has. Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006, and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year. Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade in response, with Israel controlling most of what was allowed into the territory. In the years that followed, Hamas and Israel fought several major conflicts - including those in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014. The last major conflict between the two sides was in May 2021, which ended in a ceasefire after 11 days. Every round of fighting has seen people killed on both sides, the vast majority of them Palestinians in Gaza. On 7 October 2023, Hamas fighters launched an assault from Gaza, killing about 1,200 people in Israel and taking more than 250 hostages. This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza. More than 46,000 people have been killed, the majority of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Days before Israel marked a year since the 7 October attacks, UN humanitarian agencies signed a declaration demanding an end to ""appalling human suffering and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza"". Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Gaza in maps: How a year of war has drastically changed the territory Bowen: Year of killing and broken assumptions has taken Middle East to edge of deeper, wider war In May 2024, 143 out of 193 members of the United Nations' General Assembly voted in favour of a Palestinian bid for full UN membership, something that is only open to states. Known as the State of Palestine at the UN, it has an official status of ""Permanent Observer State"", which gives it a seat but not a vote. Some European countries, along with the US, do not recognise a Palestinian state and say they will only do so as part of a long-term political solution to the conflict in the Middle East. In the UK, MPs voted in favour of recognition in 2014, but the government has not done so. In 2021, the then Conservative government said: ""The UK will recognise a Palestinian state at a time of our choosing, and when it best serves the objective of peace."" Israel says it has a historical right to the West Bank and opposes an independent Palestinian state, saying it would pose an unacceptable threat. There are about 5.9 million Palestinians registered by the UN as refugees. They are descendants of the Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes on land which became Israel in the 1948-49 Middle East war. Most live in Jordan, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Syria and Lebanon. Palestinians insist on the right of refugees to return but Israel has refused this. It criticises the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, for allowing refugee status to be inherited by successive generations. What is Unrwa and why has Israel banned it? The ""two-state solution"" is an internationally backed formula for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. It proposes an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. It would exist alongside Israel. Israel rejects a two-state solution. It says any final settlement must be the result of negotiations with the Palestinians, and statehood should not be a precondition. The Palestinian Authority backs a two-state solution but Hamas does not because it is opposed to the existence of Israel. Hamas says that it could accept an interim Palestinian state based on 1967 de facto borders, without officially recognising Israel, if refugees were given the right to return. Earlier efforts to settle the conflict saw Israel and Palestinian leaders sign a deal called the Oslo Peace Accords, in 1993. This was intended to provide a framework for peace talks. However, talks eventually collapsed with each side blaming the other.

Mum hikes for hours searching for missing son,"Jordan Moray disappeared, along with his rucksack, trainers and headlamp in July 2019 ""Come home, everything will be fine, we love you millions. Come home."" Jordan Moray went missing from his flat in Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in July 2019 with his game console still running. Now his mother, Debbie Moray, has spoken of how the family goes hiking for hours searching for Jordan, who she believes ""left of his own accord"". ""It's like looking for a needle in a haystack but we keep doing it"", she said. Mr Moray was 33-years old when he disappeared without a trace. The door of his flat was left unlocked, his games console was running and his mobile phone had been left on charge. Despitevarious possible sightings, South Wales Police have found no signs of life in the subsequent years - no financial transactions, and no contact. Letter could hold key to hiker's disappearance 'Pain and hope' for missing hiker's family Debbie Moray has made a heartfelt plea for her son to come home, or let the family know he is safe ""I ask myself all the time, why? Why Jord? Why?"" said Ms Moray, in a public appeal to her son. ""His rucksack's gone, his headlamp's gone, his trainers... we're heartbroken,"" she said. ""He's best friends with his brother Josh, and Josh is terrible, looking over the gate constantly to see if he's coming, constantly. ""Jordan is independent and always keeps himself to himself. He's pretty quiet really. He loves the outdoor life."" In January 2021 a man reported to have seen and spoken to Mr Moray in the Stratford Upon Avon area, in Warwickshire, in September 2020. South Wales Police has said it has been working closely with Warwickshire Police since the sighting, and has ""never ruled anything out"". The force added the man was ""confident"" that he had spoken to Mr Moray, but it cannot be certain that the man was indeed Mr Moray. ""Me and my husband go up there [to Stratford] and we just walk around for hours and hours. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack but we keep doing it,"" added Ms Moray. ""I search the mountains and the forestry regularly. As soon as we hear something [possible sighting] we're there. ""My brother and his wife constantly go all around the mountains on foot and by bike. Jordan's brother does too."" Mr Moray's family have urged him to let them know he's alive and safe Det Insp Gareth Davies said: ""I am appealing to Jordan himself, and urge him to make contact, however I appreciate that if he is living off the grid, then the chances of him seeing this appeal are slim. ""Jordan's mum and his family are desperate for confirmation that he is alive and well and want Jordan to know that they are not angry for him leaving the way he did but are in despair at not knowing where he is and if he is ok. ""They appreciate that Jordan may not want to return as much as they would love him to but just ask for that confirmation."" Ms Moray added: ""It's as if sometimes I feel as though he hasn't existed."" ""Nothing's coming in with the police, and I understand if nothings coming in I can't hear anything... but nothing's come in for a while now. ""If he could go into a police station and say who is he, or just let me know somehow that he's safe and well. ""Just let somebody know. Come home.""

Call for business support amid recession fears,"Scotland's business leaders have called for more support in the face of the bleak economic outlook. The Bank of England hasincreased interest rates to 1.75% and warned inflation is now set to hit more than 13%. Retail and licence trade associations said more UK and Scottish government support is needed ahead of an expected recession. The Scottish government has said its focus is on supporting the lowest paid. Latest data from the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) showed footfall in July was 16.5% down on pre-pandemic levels and 0.7% worse than in June. The decline was larger than the UK average of 14.2%. The summer heatwave, rail strikes and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis were all blamed. Interest rate hike ahead of looming recession UK interest rates: How does a rise affect me? Was the Bank of England right to raise interest rates? Ewan MacDonald-Russell, head of policy at the SRC, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""As the year progresses, there is little evidence Scottish consumers are close to returning to pre-pandemic shopping patterns. ""The reality is big ticket items are down and we know people are trading down from premium goods to value goods and cutting back on spending now. ""We need action to tackle the high business rates burden and measures to help consumers, particularly less affluent consumers."" Mr MacDonald-Russell added that ""big and punchy"" moves to help consumers were needed, adding there was no room for ""half measures""in the UK government's autumn budget. Meanwhile, a survey of 100 businesses by the Night Time Industries Association Scotland has found 38% respondents were ""unsure"" whether they will survive the next 12 months due to soaring costs. The vast majority are trading below 2019 levels of business. The hospitality trade argues that measures like Eat Out to Help Out helped in the last economic crisis caused by the Covid pandemic Colin Wilkinson, managing director of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA), said this pressure was being felt across the hospitality sector and described the Bank of England's interest rate hike as ""very unwelcome"". He said: ""The sector continues to see a slow recovery from the pandemic and then the cost of living crisis. ""This interest rate increase could simply be too much for our smaller operators. ""The industry benefited greatly from the VAT cut in the pandemic and Eat Out To Help Out was successful. We don't have that now so we'd like to see a cut in VAT for the licensee hospitality sector and a complete review of the business rates."" Scottish government business minister Ivan McKee said he was ""continuing to call on the UK government to support the lowest paid in our communities"". He added: ""The Scottish government has put in about Â£3bn worth of support for low paid families and we would call on the UK government to do something similar. ""VAT is a reserved matter for the UK government and we've asked they consider options there to be able to support businesses at this difficult time."" Mr McKee said the Scottish government had put ""significant support"" into the business rates system to help businesses through the pandemic. On the calls for more support for the hospitality sector, a Treasury spokesman said the UK government had ""stood behind the hospitality sector throughout the pandemic with a Â£400bn package of economy-wide support that saved millions of jobs and offered a lifeline to thousands of night-time businesses up and down the country."" He added: ""At the Spring Statement we went further, announcing a Â£1,000 increase to the Employment Allowance which will cut taxes for thousands of bars, clubs and venues in Scotland.""

Ferry issues leaving visitors 'sleeping in cars',"The MV Hebrides was withdrawn from service earlier this week At a glance Islanders in the Hebrides are concerned ferry disruption is badly damaging tourism Ferry operator CalMac has had to take steps to cover for the withdrawal of its MV Hebrides after a fault Outer Hebrides Tourism says some visitors are cancelling their holidays The Scottish Lib Dems are calling for an emergency statement at Holyrood on Western Isles services Visitors to the Western Isles are having to sleep in their cars or are cancelling holidays at short notice due to ferry disruption, it has been claimed. Outer Hebrides Tourism (OHT) said shops and restaurants were also struggling to get deliveries as part of what it called a deepening crisis on state-owned CalMac's west coast network. Islanders warn repeated ferry disruption risks damaging their islands' reputation as tourist destinations. North Uist, Harris and Skye ferry the MV Hebrides was withdrawn from service on Tuesday due to a reoccurrence of a fault. CalMac has apologised and taken steps to ease disruption including offering customers alternative routes, providing additional sailings and repositioning one of Mull's ferries to provide temporary cover for the Hebrides. Tourism is important to Scottish island economies. Mull and Iona Ferry Committee has called for urgent short-term investment in CalMac so a standby relief vessel could be made available to cover for breakdowns. Scottish government agency Transport Scotland said Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth convened a resilience meeting on Thursday night to discuss the situation with the Hebrides. The Western Isles' MSP and MP along with councillors, the Ferries Communities Board and Harris Development LtdÂ were involved. Tourism is important to the Western Isles' economy OHT chief executive Sarah MacLean said disruption to ferry services was having a devastating effect on Western Isles businesses and communities. She said: ""Whilst the Scottish government must now invest in CalMac to improve fleet resilience both in the short and long term, we call on them to compensate our local businesses and invest in rebuilding confidence in the Outer Hebrides as a visitor destination after the negative economic impact of this summer's ferry fiasco and indeed this winterâs disruption."" Joe Reade, of Mull and Iona Ferry Committee, urged CalMac's bosses to look again at chartering the Pentalina, a catamaran ferry tied up in Orkney. A previous deal to hire the boat as a relief vessel collapsedlast year. Mr Reade said: ""We just urgently need additional vessels in the fleet. ""The frustrating thing is that there is one sitting waiting to be chartered or bought."" A previous deal to chart the Pentalina collapsed CalMac hopes to have Hebrides back in service on Sunday following work to its firefighting system. The ferry was hit with a similar problem last week. CalMac, which posts service updates onits website,externaland its social media, has issued an apology to its customers, and appealed for patience with its workers while they try to meet demand. Managing director Robbie Drummond said: âMoving vessels around is not ideal but without any spare tonnage to use during disruption, it is often the only available option we have to continue to operate lifeline services. ""I can assure customers that we have looked at all possible alternative options before coming to this decision. âI am deeply sorry about the effect that the loss of MV Hebrides has had on our passengers and communities.â With Scottish government support CalMac, and its parent company CMAL, have sought to ease pressure with previous charters of a freight ferry and the purchase of the MV Loch Frisa,a former Norwegian passenger ferry. On Friday, the Scottish Liberal Democrats called for the Scottish Parliament to be recalled for an emergency statement. In response, Transport Scotland said discussions had taken place about Hebrides' return to service. A spokesman said CalMac and CMAL had been asked to make a thorough investigating of the fault with the boat's CO2 firefighting system. He added: âMinisters recognise that having confidence in ferry services can impact upon peopleâs decision on whether to live and work on the islands, and impacts upon the sustainability of the island communities themselves. ""These human impacts are at the heart of Scottish ministersâ commitment to continued investment in ferry services across Scotland.â Plans in place after ferry withdrawn for repairs Skye to isles ferry hit by second fault in days New CalMac ferry starts working on Mull route Ferry deal collapses over CalMac use of catamaran Ferry service getting worse admits Calmac boss A9 closed both ways following road crash How to order a free 'gift to the nation' commemorative coin One taken to hospital after Farraline Park bus crash in Inverness Police attend two-vehicle crash at Inverness bus station with one person taken to hospital Sutherland man caught in trap by paedophile hunters admits sex talk with â13-year-oldâ decoy Highland company Norscot announces lucrative partnership deal Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

Pig farmers fear for industry over soaring costs,"A County Tyrone pig farmer has warned he is one of many considering leaving the industry, if costs don't come down significantly before winter. Roger Johnston is used to fluctuating prices, but said this year is different. ""This past three, four months, we've probably made record losses,"" he said. In June, theNational Farmers Union said farmers struggling with soaring costs are being forced to cut back on their food production. Mr Johnston said on top of staffing challenges post-Brexit and rising energy costs, his grain costs had doubled in a within a month. Feed costs make up about two-thirds of outgoings. He added that rising energy costs have had a real impact, with more than 200 breeding sows and thousands of piglets each year to house. Labour shortage human disaster for pig farms - NFU Tesco gives Â£6.6m to pig producers following plea ""We've had challenge after challenge, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought things to a different level with grain costs doubling within a month. ""About 20% of the UK herd has actually gone from going out of business,"" he added. ""So it's been very, very bad and the worst we've ever seen in financial losses. ""It's not even just with the feed side of things, everything's gone up."" Roger Johnston has 200 breeding sows on his farm Industry leaders have called for more help, as farmers also try to recoup recent losses. ""Farmers here are very resilient,"" said Deirdre McIvor, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Pork and Bacon Forum. ""They take action to try and be innovative to address any problem themselves. But this is a problem for which they just have no answer. ""These are wider issues that are out there, and we desperately need support. ""The end result for the consumer is there will be no locally produced product on the shelves ultimately, if things go to their worst endgame."" The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said it recently delivered a Pig Sector Support Scheme and has no plans at this point in time for further financial support. The forum has called on retailers to help as well. ""There's not been any sufficient increase in returns coming back up the supply chain from the retailers. ""All in all, it threatens a very, very bleak picture for the industry moving forward. ""We need strong intervention and support from government at this time to try and see us through, otherwise our industry could disappear."" Roger Johnston's farm is near Lough Neagh Grain prices have recently started to come down. But after 18 months of losses, farmers like Mr Johnston are not seeing that change having an impact on their businesses yet. ""I still think to myself: 'What am I doing here, getting up every morning, seven days a week to go and look after the animals?' ""We do have a passion for the work, but there's only so much I can do. I still need to pay my mortgage and put food on my table. ""If I can't do that with the business, I'll have to close it down.""

Cyber-security chiefs warn of malicious app risk,"From smartphones to smart speakers many devices have apps Anew report by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC),externalhas warned of the threats posed by malicious apps. While most people will be familiar with apps downloaded on to smartphones, devices from smart TVs to smart speakers now also have them. The government is consulting on new guidelines,externalon security and privacy for apps and app stores. The NCSC's technical director, Ian Levy, said there was ""more for app stores to do"" on security. Mr Levy added that cyber-criminals were ""currently using weaknesses in app stores on all types of connected devices to cause harm"". Last year, the government noted, Android phone users downloaded apps which contained the Triada and Escobar malware from various third-party app stores. ""This resulted in cyber-criminals remotely taking control of people's phones and stealing their data and money by signing them up for premium subscription services,"" it said. The NCSC's report noted that apps ""can also be installed on laptops, computers, games consoles, wearable devices (such as smartwatches or fitness trackers), smart TVs, smart speakers (such as Alexa devices), and IoT (internet of things) devices"". It includes an example of a security company demonstrating how it couldcreate a malicious app,externalfor a popular tracker from a fitness firm, that could be downloaded from a link using the company's web address to seem legitimate. The app contained ""spyware/stalkerware capable of stealing everything from location and personal body data"". The company moved to fix the problem after the security firm alerted it. The NCSC report noted that the appetite for apps had grown during the pandemic, with the UK app market now worth Â£18.6bn ($23.2bn). The cyber-security centre supports the government's proposals to ask app stores to commit to a new code of practice setting out minimum security and privacy requirements. ""Developers and store operators making apps available to UK users would be covered. This includes Apple, Google, Amazon, Huawei, Microsoft and Samsung,"" the government said. A proposed code of practice would require stores to set up processes so that security flaws can be found and fixed more quickly. Apple claims 'sideloading' apps is security risk Is that app you're using for work a security threat?

Mum urges vaccination take-up after baby lossA mother who lost her baby after having Covid-19 while pregnant urges mums-to-be to get vaccinated.,"This video can not be played Toni Dennan said though she had since had another daughter, remembering what happened ""doesn't get any easier"" A mother who lost her baby after getting Covid-19 while she was pregnant has urged other pregnant women to get vaccinated. Toni Dennan lost baby Darcey at the end of 2020, before the vaccine was available. She and husband Lee wanted to share their story so that Darcey's legacy would be to save other babies. Near the start of the pandemic, the couple found out they were having a baby. Toni said it was ""amazing"". ""It was something we were obviously really happy about and really wanted, so we were delighted."" A 20-week scan revealed they were having a girl. ""We knew we were calling her Darcey all the way through from that moment on, which we're grateful for now,"" Lee said. Covid rules meant Lee had not been allowed to go to hospital with Toni, but he was called and told to get straight there At the time, no vaccines were available, so Toni spent months shielding. But shortly before Christmas, she caught coronavirus and she became concerned about Darcey. An initial hospital check seemed to be OK, but by the next day, she was worse. ""She wasn't moving,"" she said. ""So I went back in and at that point it was a full-on emergency and straight through to an emergency C-section."" Covid in pregnancy linked to birth-related complications Pregnant women urged not to delay getting jab Pregnant women 'afterthought' in Covid jab rollout Covid restrictions meant Lee had not been allowed to go to hospital with her, but she said he was called by the medical staff and told to get there as quickly as possible. Toni was put under general anaesthetic and the hospital's medics fought to save her and Darcey. ""I came round and I was surrounded,"" she said. ""I was out of the theatre then, in a side room, and surrounded by doctors. ""That was when the doctor had told me that Darcey hadn't made it. ""Lee walked through the door and kind of looked really hopeful and I just shook my head at him."" She said remembering that moment ""doesn't get any easier"". Dr Anustha Sivananthan said ""one in five of the most seriously ill in intensive care"" were unvaccinated mums-to-be Toni did not have the option of getting vaccinated, something which is now seen as essential to protect both mother and baby. However, in some parts of North-West England, 60% of expectant mothers do not have that protection, so mobile clinics are being used to try to make it easier for them to have a jab. Dr Anustha Sivananthan, medical director atCheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,external, said one in five of the most seriously ill patients in intensive care units were pregnant women who had not been vaccinated. ""It's as high as that, which is why we're encouraging as many pregnant women or even women wanting to become pregnant to come forward and have their vaccination."" The couple have since had another daughter, Nancy, but want Darcey's legacy to be one of helping other people Seven months ago, Toni and Lee had another daughter, Nancy. Lee said it was ""amazing just hearing her cry and seeing her for the first time"". Toni added that she had ""never been so happy to hear a baby cry"". ""We know what you can lose and it's just not worth the risk, so I would urge every pregnant woman to get that vaccine."" If you have been affected by issues raised in this article, help and support is available atBBC Action Line. Clarification - 13 October 2022: While Dr Sivananthan was quoted accurately in our original story, we have established from NHS England that she was referring to one in five of patients in ECMO units, a specialised form of intensive care, rather than one in five patients in intensive care units.

In pictures: England's bare lawns and parched parks,"Dry ground and dead grass on Primrose Hill, London Recent weeks have brought record-breaking temperatures and thedriest JulyEngland has seen for more than 80 years. And it isn't only us humans who have been suffering the effects - the country's grass and plant life have also been withering in the heat. Northern areas are now getting some rain, but southern England isn't expected to see any until at least the end of next week. Hosepipe bans are nowbeing introducedin some places, for the first time this year. Pictures show the toll the heatwave is taking on the country's lawns, fields, and parks. Dried out grass in Richmond Park, London In London's Richmond Park, there is dried-out ground and dead grass - as well as a warning to the public not to drop cigarettes or light barbecues, because of the risk of fire. A sign in the park warns of the risk of fire The heat has left some sites in the capital that are normally covered in manicured grass - including Westminster's Parliament Square - completely bare. And the spot commonly recognised as the source of the River Thames, located near Cirencester, has also dried up for what is thought to be the first time. Parliament Square in Westminster has been left bare by the heat Parched grass in front of the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London At Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, the temperatures revealed the remnants of a 17th Century garden design. Aerial footage of the home's South Lawn showed straight paths and ornate swirls that previously formed walkways around the lawn. The walkways were replanted in about 1730, but the shorter roots of the newer grass means it burns more quickly, creating a contrast with the older grass around it. Aerial photos also show the impact of the heat on cricket fields and golf courses in southern England. The remnants of a 17th-century garden are visible at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire after the grass dried out in the heat A fire in a field in Kent came close to engulfing the Lenham Cross war memorial Parts of northern England, North Wales, and Scotland are already seeing some showers again, with some areas set to get more rain over the weekend, but southern England is expected to remain dry until next Thursday at the earliest, according to BBC Weather's John Hutchinson. Temperatures in the south are also set to rise next week and are likely to exceed 30C (86F) in parts. This satellite image shared by NASA shows how the UK looked on 19 July, 2021 And this satellite image from one year later shows the impact the heatwave has had on the UK A number of river beds have also dried up across the country, including in Gloucestershire and Greater Manchester. This tributary of the Dowry Reservoir, near Oldham, dried up in July The bed of the River Thames near to Somerford Keynes in Gloucestershire But don't worry if the grass in your garden is already looking worse for wear. Unlike most plants, grass grows not from its outer tips but from the base, near the roots, making it easier for it to grow back if the blades are cut or scorched. Provided the roots are still healthy, your grass should revive before long.

Workers at key UK port to strike for eight days,"Workers at the UK's biggest container port in Felixstowe are to strike for eight days in a dispute over pay. Around 1,900 members of the Unite union will walk out on 21 August after rejecting a 7% pay offer from Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company. Unite called the pay offer ""significantly below"" the rate of inflation. The announcement comes after a summer of strikes in the transport sector as the cost of living continues to rise. A Felixstowe port spokesperson said the company was ""disappointed"" and that it was ""determined"" to help workers tackle rising costs - whilst continuing to invest in the port. Unite said eight days of strike action at the port will run from Sunday 21 August ending on Monday 29 August. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Both Felixstowe docks and its parent company CK Hutchison Holding Ltd are both massively profitable and incredibly wealthy. ""They are fully able to pay the workforce a fair day's pay. The company has prioritised delivering multi-million pound dividends rather than paying its workers a decent wage,"" Ms Graham added. Around half of containers brought in to the UK are transported via the port. Unite said in a statement that the strike action will have a ""huge effect on the UK's supply chain and will also cause severe disruption to international maritime trade, as well as the UK's supply chain including the logistics and haulage sectors"". A spokesperson at Felixstowe port said: ""The port has not had a strike since 1989 and we are disappointed that the union has served notice of industrial action while talks are ongoing. The port provides secure and well-paid employment and there will be no winners from industrial action."" The port said workers involved in the dispute earned an average of Â£43,000 a year. Talks are due to resume on Monday. Workers elsewhere in the transport industry have also announced plans to strike in August, after unions said wages are not keeping pace with the rising cost of living and that their members need a pay rise. Why is everyone going on strike? Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at a 40-year-high of 9.4% and the Bank of England has warned it could reach more than 13% as energy, fuel and food prices soar higher. Train drivers at nine rail companies will walk out on 13 August in a dispute over pay, the union Aslef has said. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) is planning strikes for Thursday 18 August and Saturday 20 August. Rail passengers have already faced disruption this summer. About 40,000 RMT union members at Network Rail and 14 other train companies walked out on 27 July over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions.

'Bring me his head' - the spy sent to get Bin Laden,"Gary Schroen during a 2005 appearance on NBC On 19 September, 2001 - with the ruins of the World Trade Center and Pentagon still smouldering from the 9/11 attacks - CIA officer Gary Schroen stepped into his boss's office and received a set of orders: ""Capture Bin Laden, kill him, and bring his head back in a box on dry ice"". As for Osama Bin Laden's deputy, Ayman Al Zawahiri, and the rest of Al-Qaeda's inner circle, the orders were equally straightforward: ""Their heads up on pikes"". Within days, Schroen and a motley crew of paramilitary officers became the first Americans on the ground in Afghanistan, armed with little more than satellite phones - but also millions of dollars in cash to curry favour with potential allies. Weeks later, on 7 October, the US begins its attack on Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, sparking a nearly 20 year-long war that ended in August 2021. Bin Laden was taken out in 2011, but it took another decade to kill Zawahiri. And on 1 August - just one day after a US drone finally caught up to him in Kabul - Gary Schroen died at the age of 80, reportedly of a stroke. Was al-Qaeda leader killed by bladed missile? US kills al-Qaeda leader in Afghanistan drone strike In the wake of his death, CIA director William Burns hailed Schroen as ""a legend and inspiration"" to every officer working inside the US spy agency. ""In Afghanistan more than two decades ago and in every other role he served at CIA, Gary embodied the very best of our organisation,"" Mr Burns said. ""We will never forget his unwavering dedication, loyalty and perseverance."" Few if any officers serving in the CIA at the time were better suited to lead the initial operation. Over the course of a career that spanned decades, Schroen served as the CIA's ""station chief"" for both Afghanistan and Pakistan in the 1980s and 1990s. At that time, ""there was no interest by the US government"" in Afghanistan, he later recalled in an interview with PBS, ""The Taliban were there. Everyone knew that they were committing human rights violations and were just a miserable government, treating their people terribly,"" he said. ""But really, no one back in Washington really cared that much."" CIA officers in a helicopter with $3m cash for Afghan commanders on 19 September, 2001 in a CIA photo. By 1996, however, Schroen said that the ""equation had changed"" after US intelligence began to focus on the activities of Osama Bin Laden, a then-relatively unknown jihadist and veteran of the guerrilla war against the Soviets in the 1980s. Schroen formed part of a small group within the CIA's Counterterrorism Center that warned of the threat from the Saudi national. Schroen soon began re-establishing contact with Afghan commanders whom he had known from his time in the region. For the next three years, at Schroen's direction, the CIA repeatedly tried to kill or capture Bin Laden, with plans ranging from ambushes on his convoy and raids on his farm in southern Afghanistan to cruise missiles and bombing raids. Ultimately, Bin Laden went on to orchestrate the bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and survived a large-scale cruise missile attack on Al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan's Khost Province in August of that year. Three years later, 19 Al-Qaeda hijackers launched the 9/11 attacks. What now for al-Qaeda? The 2001 mission to Afghanistan - officially known as Operation Jawbreaker - would see Schroen and seven other Americans link up with the Northern Alliance, a coalition of groups fighting the Taliban government that had ruled Afghanistan since 1996. When he got his orders, Schroen, then 59, was already 11 days into the CIA's transition programme for employees going into retirement. ""I never expected I would get the call to go in,"" he said years later. ""I think it was the right choice, given my long relationship with those guys in the Northern Alliance."" Schroen's assessment was echoed by Michael ""Mick"" Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer, Afghan war veteran and ex-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence. Gary Schroen's 2001 mission was to link up with Northern Alliance fighters such as these. ""His experience in Afghanistan prior to September 11, 2001 was absolutely pivotal to our success there in the initial invasion, an invasion which he led,"" Mr Mulroy told the BBC. ""Being on the first team into Afghanistan, Gary set the example and exemplified the concept of leading from the front."" As a military operation, the invasion of Afghanistan was remarkably successful and drove the Taliban from power by December 2001. But Schroen's main target - Bin Laden - and other senior Al-Qaeda figures such as Al-Zawahiri escaped, while the Taliban regrouped and fought a long guerrilla war that culminated in the chaotic US withdrawal from Kabul last year. In interviews later in his life, Schroen said the failure of the US to secure Afghanistan and capture its main enemies there was, in large part, due to a drain on both CIA and military resources caused by the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Despite initial claims from the US administration of George W Bush that the Iraqi government was somehow connected to the 9/11 attacks, Schroen said he never believed in any linkage. ""The number of guys, CIA personnel, out in these little remote camps and bases were reduced in number...because of demand to staff up the Iraq effort,"" he told NPR in 2005. ""It really did cost us, I think, a lot in momentum. A loss of momentum that exists still today."" Schroen finally managed to retire in the years after the Afghan invasion, and in 2005 published a book entitled ""First In"" about the operation. Even years after his retirement, allies of bin Laden continued to see Schroen as a target. In 2013, the Somali militant group Al-Shabaab claimed on Twitter it had killed him, prompting unnamed US officials to tell NBC that such claims should be taken ""with a grain of salt"". ""Gary Schroen is alive and well,"" an NBC report at the time announced. Schroen's mission lives on at CIA headquarters in Virginia: The helicopter used in the 2001 mission remains on CIA grounds as a reminder.

LiveLiveAs it happened: How could a recession affect you?9 minutes ago,"The UK is expected to fall into its worst recession since the financial crash of 2008 later this year, according to the Bank of England The economy is forecast to shrink in the last three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023 Our experts - Simon Read, Dharshini David and Beth Timmins - are answering some of your questions A recession is linked to increased unemployment and falling sales of goods and services Yesterday, the Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% in response to soaring inflation Bank Governor Andrew Bailey has defended the rise, saying there is a real risk of soaring prices becoming ""embedded"" UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at 9.4% which the highest level for more than 40 years Edited by Andrew Humphrey We'll bring to a close today's live page on the looming recession in the UK. But before we go here are the key headlines of the day:  This afternoon's Your questions answered special page was written by Jack Burgess, Sam Hancock, Catherine Evans, Adam Durbin, Jo Couzens and James Fitzgerald. The editors were Andrew Humphrey, Nathan Williams, Chris Giles and James Harness. You can read more about the interest rate hike, recession forecast and rising cost of living here. This video can not be played Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has been speaking more today about the decision to raise interest rates, saying there is a ""real risk"" of soaring prices becoming ""embedded"". As we've been reporting, interest rates have risen to 1.75% - the biggest rise in 27 years - with inflation now set to hit more than 13%. The real risk we're responding to is that inflation becomes embedded and it doesn't come down in the way that we would otherwise expect.""  We've also heard from a couple, both pensioners, who told the BBC theyâll have to plan a tight budget then âsee how things goâ. âThereâs not a great deal we can do about it is there? The government does everything themselves. âOur savings have been eroded. âWeâre just two people with a very small voice.â A rise in interest rates has been unwelcome news for many. So what will happen if prices continue to rise? One woman who works as a care manager in Wales told the BBC: ""The income that we're getting at the moment is just not enough to afford the bills, the rent... all the food prices, the fuel prices... it's really, really difficult. ""The prices are so high now that I've had to start cutting back. So if they do keep going up we're going to see a lot more homelessness, we're going to see a lot more people applying for benefits. ""The majority of people are not gonna be able to afford to actually live a stable, normal life. ""It's going to be really bad if it keeps going up."" Last question now, coming from Aaron in Londonderry, who asked Money Saving Expert's Gareth Shaw: What does interest rates going up mean for the price of my borrowing? I have an outstanding balance on my credit card, which I'm only able to pay off slowly due to the rising cost of living. Does this mean I will end up paying more? It really depends on the terms of your credit card. Some credit card providers are pretty explicit that their interest rates will be tied to the Bank of England base rate. Others do not tie it to the Bank of England base rate. There are products out there that can help you minimise the amount of interest that you pay on credit card debt. They're called 0% balance transfer credit cards. If you're paying interest on your credit card debt you cannot afford not to look at these types of cards because your repayments are currently paying off interest and debt. When you shift your debt to a 0% balance transfer credit card, all of your repayments are reducing your debt. There are ways to find out if you're eligible before you apply. I would strongly suggest looking at those. This video can not be played It is market day in Loughborough. We've been in the Leicestershire town finding
out how people are coping with the rising cost of living. Many seem to be taking it in their stride. One resident says his vehicle ""costs a small fortune"" to fill with petrol, but is managing to get by on his pension, ""just"". Another tells us he's just going ""to live with it"", and the government isn't able to do anything to help: ""They just keep talking."" Another question now from BBC viewer Christine, who asks Prof Hilary Ingham: Is it purely the effect of the war in Ukraine that's affecting so many economies and people? No, it's not solely Ukraine - but obviously that is having a big impact. Ukraine is a very big producer of grain and this also feeds into animal feed. Things like chickens are becoming more expensive. But obviously there's the gas problem, in particular with Russia cutting back on what it's sending through Nordstream 1, so that is affecting energy prices severely. Brexit has caused labour shortages, so in some sectors, employers are having to raise wages to attract employees. So it's a combination of factors - all are working against the consumer at this point in time. Not everyone sees the rise in interest rates as bad news. A small business owner in Cardiff told the BBC he welcomes the news, as the prices of his materials have all gone up. âWhatever the government is trying to do to cushion inflation is greatly appreciated because everything right now is just spiralling out of control,"" he said. âI look at it as any help I can get to bring down the costs, I can pass the savings on to my customers.â But if thereâs a recession, as the Bank predicts, he said heâs going to âlose businessâ¦ I might be queuing up at the unemployment centreâ. The prime minister and chancellor have been accused of being 'missing in action' The head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents the interests of business-owners, is warning of a ""vacuum"" in government at a time of economic crisis. ""We cannot wait until 5 September for action,"" Tony Danker tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. He's referring to the date on which the country's next prime minister will be known, following the conclusion of the Conservative leadership contest. ""We need the current prime minister and the current chancellor to fill that vacuum,"" Danker adds. Both Boris Johnson and Nadhim Zahawi are currently on holiday - although Zahawi insisted yesterday that he was continuing to work while abroad. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Stephen from Nottingham wants to know whether big businesses are profiting at the expense of individuals. The BBC and other media seem to be pinning the inflation rate on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and due to the economy largely shutting down over
Covid. But on social media, there is a discussion around
corporations making huge profits. People say this is causing inflation because a lot of these businesses face little competition and can raise prices whenever they want. Is this
true? When inflation bites and things become more expensive, people
naturally look around for somebody to blame. Big corporates posting massive profits are easy targets. âIf
theyâre making that much money, why canât they cut prices,â consumers ask. Meanwhile I've seen growing use on social media of phrases such
as ""pandemic profiteers"" or ""greedflation"". But the accusations don't seem to hold up when you look at the
economics behind the profits. Profits help companies grow, which in turn helps other companies
and suppliers, investors, as well as workers and the wider economy. In short the current global system needs businesses to be
successful to keep economies on track. Forcing them to reduce prices or cut profits could stifle growth
and investment which, in turn, could lead to economic contraction. The reason why Russia's invasion of Ukraine is more likely to be
mentioned in relation to inflation is that it has massively disrupted energy
supplies, and gas and electricity are a major part of consumer expenditure. Another issue to bear in mind is the UKâs skills shortage after
Brexit, which has left many industry sectors facing problems because of a lack
of workers. Meanwhile, supply chain problems caused by ongoing global
uncertainty are hitting many companies' products. That leads to a scarcity which puts up prices as demand
outstrips the available supply. A fall in living costs can't come soon enough for Lucy Cogle
from Yorkshire. The pensioner already switched off her heating last winter
because she couldnât afford the bills. She says this winter she'll again be relying on her dogs to keep
her warm. ""It was absolutely freezing,"" she says. ""We had damp coming up through the windows and I made
patchwork blankets for us. ""We're just struggling to live."" Money Saving Expert's deputy editor Gareth Shaw and professor of economics Hilary Ingham have joined the BBC's Martine Croxall to answer more of your questions on the BBC News Channel. The first is from Martine herself, who asks Prof Ingham: What does the Bank of England governor mean when he talks about embedded inflation? It means there's inflationary pressure in the economy which is embedded in that we don't expect it to go away any time soon. A few months back, the governor was actually talking about inflation being transitory, ie. something that was only temporary, that he was expecting to turn back to much lower levels. But now what they're thinking is are these pressures for prices to keep on rising, so we have got embedded inflation, ie. it's not something that is just going to disappear overnight. Raising taxes while interest rates are rising ""doesn't make any sense"", insists Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. He said Liz Truss, who he is backing in the Tory party leadership contest, has been talking about the risk of recession since the start. ""[It] means that you canât have rising interest rates, which we saw yesterday, and also have tighter fiscal policy,"" he said. ""Inflation means you have less of your money to spend â your income is being squeezed â nobody Iâve ever spoken to until about a week ago has said the way to deal with that is to take even more of peopleâs money through tax, that doesnât make any sense."" He said one of Truss's proposals was not having a tax cut but ""actually not having a tax increase"". ""Thatâs not inflationary, essentially saying that a tax cut
that has been pencilled in wonât happen,"" said Kwarteng. He pointed out no other G7 countries were raising both interest rates and tax to deal with inflation. Kwarteng also says he expects there will be an emergency Budget to help people - although it probably won't happen not until September. He insisted he was in constant contact with the prime minister and chancellor while they both were abroad. Former housing secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC earlier that the ""overwhelming
priority"" for the government must be tackling inflation. Jenrick, who is backing Rishi Sunak for prime minister, repeated his favoured candidate's line that the âdashboard
is flashing red on the British economyâ. In an apparent reference to Sunakâs opponent Liz Trussâ statement
that a recession isnât inevitable, he also said that âwe shouldn't fool
ourselves into believing that all is going to be fineâ. Jenrick also argued that while âunfunded tax cutsâ now were âattractiveâ, they âseem less relevant"" in the context of the overall state of the economy. He said the government must work out if there was anything more that can be done can do to reduce inflation, beyond the actions already taken by the
Bank of England to hike interest rates. In a further critique of Trussâ policy platform, Jenrick reiterated
the Sunak campâs belief that âthe one thing we certainly can do is to do no
further harm and not to do any tax rises that might add to inflationâ. Jenrick also said the movement must âthink very deeply about what
we can do to help the poorest and most vulnerable households through the winterâ. Let's get some more reaction from the political world now, with Paul Johnson, a leading economist and director of the
independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, saying thereshould be a focus on tackling inflationrather than tax cuts during the Tory leadership race. ""Many more billions [will be needed] to support
households"" through current inflation rates, hetold the BBC earlier. Johnson also rejected the idea cuts could be funded in part by
""fiscal headroom"", as suggested by a number of the MPs who battled it
out to become the next PM â andincluding Liz Truss, who's still in the race. ""What [the leadership candidates are] talking about is that
the Office for Budget Responsibility [in March] said we'd be borrowing about
Â£30bn less than we absolutely could to meet the fiscal target of a balanced
current budget in a few years' time,"" he said. But he added that this was ""highly uncertain"" and now
""massively out of date"", given the economy was heading for recession. Rishi Sunak, who has trailed in recent polls, has repeatedly said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he became PM. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter A question now from Susan Ward, who asks: How much is
Brexit contributing to the economic problems in the UK? There are a number
of factors to bear in mind. One direct impact of
Brexit was the number of EU migrants who left the UK, leaving the
country with a shortage of skilled workers across a number of industries. The hospitality
industry has been particularly badly hit but other sectors have also reported
problems, such as construction and haulage. A shortage of workers
has led to cutbacks or reduced service, which has hit profits and had a
knock-on effect across the economy. The new hard border
introduced between Britain and the EU has also had a detrimental effect on
business with delays affecting deliveries and therefore profits. Red tape and new
restrictions have been bad news for many British companies which report losing
customers and orders and, in the worst case, having to go out of business. Thereâs also the
rising cost of the UK's Brexit divorce bill from leaving the EU. The latest government estimate last month put it at Â£42.5bn. Thatâs cash
taken out of the UK economy. Beth TimminsFinance reporter Next, another question relating to using interest rates to control inflation, from Kevin Fryers in Hampshire: If inflation is caused largely by the war in Ukraine and not the economy being overheated, how does putting interest rates up help? Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living rises over time, is now set to hit more than 13% in the UK. This inflation rise has been reflected in major Western economies, as the cost of energy and food has been pushed up by dwindling supplies caused by the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Such a figure has encouraged the Bank of England to increase interest rates. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stop rising as fast. Increasing interest rates is one way to try and control inflation as it raises borrowing costs. But in the UK, for example, about 2.2 million homeowners with mortgages linked to the Bank of England's base rate would see repayments go up, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already being squeezed by the cost of living. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Mortgage borrowers are always faced with the perennial question
of when is a good time to fix their rate. The advantage of a fixed rate is that you know how much monthly
repayments will be for the length of the fix, which can really help with
budgeting. But the danger is of fixing at too high a rate when you could be
saving money every month with a cheaper variable deal. The average five-year fixed rate mortgage has now breached 4%,
according to rates analysts Moneyfacts.co.uk. Experts expect rates to climb even more after yesterdayâs half a
percentage point rise in the Bank rate. Does that mean you should look to get a decent fix rate now? Yes, reckons Rachel Springall, finance expert at
Moneyfacts.co.uk. ""Borrowers who have not locked into a fixed rate would be
wise to move quickly to secure a new deal as interest rates continue to climb,""
she said. The Bank of England has warned Britain will lurch into recession later this year, but how will that affect the housing market? It will be the first UK recession since 2020 - at the height of the Covid crisis. That actually boosted property prices as working from home encouraged both house movers and buyers in a race for space. The housing market has been rampant ever since as people taking out a mortgage took advantage of low interest rates and a stamp duty holiday, but a recession could finally put the brakes on it. The latest figures from the Halifax bank published on Friday showed that prices climbed 11.8% in the 12 months to July. However, they slipped by 0.1% month-on-month in July - and that was before the Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% to tackle soaring inflation. Read more on this story here. Beth TimminsBBC News Tony Hall wants to know in what way people are going to be assisted by yesterday's announcements from the Bank of England. How does increasing interest rates - affecting mortgages and other loans - help the population cope with a higher cost of living? The Bank has introduced the biggest interest hike since 1995 to try to tackle inflation. This adds significant costs to borrowers but is meant to subdue the fast pace of price growth and wage increases. However, as the energy price increases are largely a supply problem, the Bank has less power to control this factor which is driving up the cost of living. Â© 2025 BBC.

Bank's recession warning matters to everyone,"We don't need the Bank of England to tell us times are hard. Even before its recession warning on Thursday, the typical person's finances were already stretched as prices, particularly for food and fuel, soared. Half of households cut back on energy usage over the spring, while a third were curbing their spending on food and other staples. Our living standards were going into reverse, on course to do so by the greatest degree since the 1950s. What the Bank underlined yesterday, though, was how much worse things are going to get - and for much longer than previously thought, with the warning that activity across the UK economy is set to go into reverse until the end of 2023. The factors behind that have been both largely beyond its control and unpredictable. Bank defends rate hike ahead of looming recession What is a recession and how could it affect me? Front and centre are those energy bills. By next February, the domestic price cap could be twice what it is right now - and that is largely due to the fallout from the war in Ukraine. We may not source much gas (less than 5% of our supply) from Russia, but that country restricting the amount of gas it's pumping to Europe has caused alarm and so global wholesale prices are spiking once again. Those energy bills directly account for about half of the increase in our living costs, some of the rest reflects higher global food prices, which is also a knock on effect of war. It's this external source of inflation which makes it hard for the Bank of England to get a grip on the problem. Its main tool - raising interest rates - works by engineering a slowdown, leaving borrowers with less money to spend so that businesses have less scope to raise prices. That's not only less effective when the key source of inflation is rising global costs rather than strong demand, but also means that interest rates add to the pain. How much can the government help? There's already billions of pounds of public money being channelled to households but even with the extra pledges made by those vying to be the next prime minister, that won't compensate for the rise in bills we're facing. Rishi Sunak's promised cut to VAT on energy bills will only plug part of the increase in the price cap. Liz Truss's tax cuts are likely to be too late to avert recession - and some economists warn, could actually prolong the era of heightened inflation - and so possibly higher interest rates - by allowing for extra spending on non-essentials. What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? As for the impact on jobs, in the short term, the main challenge for businesses remains filling vacancies in the face of staff shortages. As the squeeze continues, their hiring plans and their ability to retain staff may change. The Bank of England does expect unemployment to rise, but gradually. By its reckoning, 800,000 people could lose their jobs over the next couple of years. If we've learnt anything over the last few years, it's that the economic landscape can be widely unpredictable. But this crisis will burn itself out. The wholesale prices of foodstuffs such as wheat and cooking oils are already settling as Ukraine starts to resume exporting goods by sea. At some point, energy prices will stabilise, even fall: quite when though is the big question. The squeeze on household finances engineered by higher interest rates will curb spending in a way that limits other price increases and interest rates will decline once again. In the meantime, the next person to move into No 10 will have an almighty challenge to navigate, and it doesn't end there. Economists, including those at the International Monetary Fund, have highlighted that the UK's growth in prosperity has lagged behind many competitors on average for several years. The Resolution thinktank highlights that this has coincided with an increase in inequality. Getting us back on track in the longer term, they argue, will involve hefty investment and effort to make us a more highly skilled, efficient economy. The hard work is far from over.

Bank defends rate hike ahead of looming recession,"This video can not be played Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, says there is a ""real risk"" of soaring prices becoming ""embedded"" The governor of the Bank of England has defended its decision to raise interest rates, saying there is a ""real risk"" of soaring prices becoming ""embedded"". Interest rates rose to 1.75% - the biggest rise in 27 years - with inflation now set to hit more than 13%. The UK is forecast to fall into recession this year, with the longest downturn since 2008 predicted. Increasing interest rates is one way to try and control inflation as it raises borrowing costs. This should encourage people to borrow less and spend less. It can also encourage people to save more. However, many households will be squeezed further following the interest rate rise, including some mortgage-holders. How does an interest rate rise affect me? Did the Bank of England make the right call? What is a recession and how could it affect me? 'Rate rise means I owe Â£250 a year more on loans' The Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The real risk we're responding to is that inflation becomes embedded and it doesn't come down in the way that we would otherwise expect."" ""We've had a domestic shock, we've had a shrinkage in the labour force over the last two years or so,"" he said. ""The first thing that businesses want to talk to me about is the problems they're having hiring people... They're also saying to us, actually they're not finding it difficult to raise prices at the moment. Now we think that can't go on."" He also warned against high pay rises, saying this would make inflation worse and ""it's the people who are least well off who are worse affected because they don't have the bargaining power"". However, Attorney General Suella Braverman said interest rates ""should have been raised a long time ago"". In response, Mr Bailey said: ""If you go back two years... given the situation we were facing at that point in the context of Covid, in the context of the labour market, the idea that at that point we would have tightened monetary policy, you know I don't remember there were many people saying that."" UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at 9.4%, which is the highest level for more than 40 years. But the Bank has warned it could peak at more than 13% and stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, before eventually returning to the Bank's 2% target in 2024. The main reason for high inflation and low growth is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Households have also been hit by higher petrol, diesel and food costs. Real post-tax household incomes - after taking account of inflation - are forecast to fall this year and next year. Andrew Sentance, who was a member of the Bank's rates-setting committee during the 2008 financial crisis, told BBC Breakfast: ""We're going to see a couple of yearsâ¦ when household incomes in real terms are squeezed much more severely than we've seen in other times since the Second World War."" The economy is forecast to shrink in the final three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. The expected recession would be the longest downturn since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse, bringing lending to a halt. The slump is not set to be as deep as 14 years ago but may last just as long. Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the economic situation would mean there would have to be ""many more billions to support households"" and more money for public services. He told the BBC that the Tory leadership candidates, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, should be focused on tackling inflation rather than tax cuts. Mr Johnson rejected the idea tax cuts could be funded in part by ""fiscal headroom"". ""What [the leadership candidates are] talking about is that the Office for Budget Responsibility [in March] said we'd be borrowing about Â£30bn less than we absolutely could to meet the fiscal target of a balanced current budget in a few years' time,"" he said. But he added that this was ""highly uncertain"" and now ""massively out of date"", given the economy was heading for recession. The worsening state of the UK economydominated a Sky News TV debate between the two Conservative leadership candidates on Thursday. Former Chancellor Mr Sunak, who has trailed Ms Truss in recent polls, has repeatedly said he would prioritise bringing inflation down before cutting taxes if he became prime minister. This video can not be played Watch: Business-as-usual policies won't stop recession, Liz Truss says Meanwhile, Ms Truss has pledged a package of tax cuts worth Â£30bn soon after she enters office, which Mr Sunak has argued would increase inflation and the cost of borrowing. But Ms Truss said cutting taxes would stimulate economic growth and prevent a recession. Ms Truss, who has been critical of the Bank, has suggested she is considering taking more control over it if she becomes prime minister. Mr Bailey said the Bank's independence was ""critically important"" and he did not think there was a ""large desire"" in the country to question this. However, he added he was happy to discuss the issue with the new government. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said the cost of living support measures announced by the government so far were ""clearly not enough"". ""There will be families and pensioners across the country waking up this morning, reading the news, who are absolutely terrified because a juggernaut is heading [their] way which will smash through family finances,"" the shadow work and pensions secretary told the BBC.

How will a recession hit the UK housing market?,"The Bank of England has warned that Britain will lurch into recession later this year, but how will that affect the housing market? It will be the first UK recession since 2020 - at the height of the Covid crisis. That actually boosted property prices as working from home encouraged both house movers and buyers in a race for space. The housing market has been rampant ever since as people taking out a mortgage took advantage of low interest rates and a stamp duty holiday, but a recession could finally put the brakes on. Latest figures from the Halifax bank, published on Friday, showed that house prices climbed 11.8% in the 12 months to July. However, they slipped by 0.1% month-on-month in July - and that was before the Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% to tackle soaring inflation. ""While we shouldn't read too much into any single month, especially as the fall is only fractional, a slowdown in annual house price growth has been expected for some time,"" said Halifax managing director Russell Galley. What a recession could do is tackle the main driver of rising house prices which is lack of supply. But getting to the point where there are plenty of home available to buy at lower prices might not be pleasant. ""Repossessions may increase as people struggle to pay for the increased cost of living and mortgage payments and therefore more stock may find its way onto the market,"" said Karen Noye, mortgage expert at Quilter. The biggest risk for hopeful homebuyers in a recession is losing their job. Assuming work remains steady, then a recession could actually help some people climb onto the property ladder if it pushes property prices down, as some experts predict. That would lead to smaller deposits being needed and lower total amounts borrowed. But that must be balanced against rising mortgage rates. Property website Rightmove has calculated that first-time homebuyers would see their monthly mortgage payments climb to an average of 40% of their gross salary after this week's rate rise. That's a level not seen since 2012, it said. It calculates that the average monthly mortgage payment for a new homeowner will increase to more than Â£1,000, up from Â£813 in January. The figures are based on the average asking price of a first-time buyer's home being Â£224,943. Against that background, forecasts that inflation is set to climb even higher will pile more pressure on people who are saving for a deposit while grappling with a cost-of-living squeeze. If they're forced into cutting back on non-essentials then their monthly savings towards a deposit may have to be curtailed. The Bank of England's rate hike leaves borrowers on tracker mortgages or standard variable rates (SVR) needing to find extra cash to meet their monthly mortgage repayments. According to UK Finance, there are 1.9 million borrowers affected, with almost two-thirds on SVR. Based on a typical 25-year Â£200,000 mortgage those on an SVR will end up paying an extra Â£59, according to August figures published by rates analysts Moneyfacts.co.uk. Those with a tracker mortgage will face an extra monthly charge of Â£52. Most won't be hit immediately, with only online bank First Direct changing rates immediately after the Bank's announcement. Others said the new higher rates will hit borrowers from the start of September. One simple way to help with potential future rate rises is to fix your mortgage. The advantage of a fixed-rate is knowing how much monthly repayments will be for the length of the loan, which can help with budgeting. The average five-year fixed rate mortgage has now breached 4%, according to Moneyfacts.co.uk, but experts expect rates to climb even more after the 0.5% base rate hike. Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk, reckons finding a low fixed rate now could make sense. ""Borrowers who have not locked into a fixed rate would be wise to move quickly to secure a new deal as interest rates continue to climb,"" she said. The biggest risk anyone faces during a recession is losing their job. That sudden loss of income can mean being unable to meet monthly mortgage repayments and if you miss payments your lender could take steps to repossess your property. Thankfully lenders aren't keen to do that so anyone finding themselves in that position does have options. Borrowers with mortgage payment protection insurance should dig out their policy documents and make a claim as soon as possible. Most policies will cover payments for up to 12 months, giving you some breathing space till you find a new job. If you don't have insurance and think you may struggle to afford your mortgage payments, it's essential to talk to your lender as soon as possible to discuss your options. To ease your short-term financial worries you may be able to move to an interest-only loan, for instance, or take a mortgage payment holiday. Another option could be to extend the term of the mortgage to reduce monthly repayments. While any of these will help take some of the pressure off you while you're living on a reduced income, it's important to put your mortgage plans back on track when you find work. If you remain out of work for some time and are claiming benefits, you may be able to claim Support for Mortgage Interest payments from the government. If property prices fall then, in isolation, that could be good news for potential homebuyers. But existing homebuyers face the potential risk that their value of their home could end up lower than the amount they've borrowed on a mortgage. That could leave them in what is known as negative equity. Long-term homeowners should be immune from that risk as their property value will have far outstripped their mortgage in recent years. More recent homebuyers who may have taken out a 95% mortgage to buy their dream property, could well see the value dipping below the purchase price if there is a slump in the market. But, frankly, that only becomes a problem if you want to sell. Keeping a property for a few years has historically helped people ride out the occasional dips in the market. The last time the property market crashed was after the financial crisis in 2008. Then the average house price in England fell from Â£188,657 to Â£159,340 according to Land Registry figures - a drop of 15% in a year. But by a year later average prices had recovered to Â£174,765, about 7% lower than two years earlier which would have eased negative equity worries for most homeowners assuming they had kept up with mortgage repayments and reduced the amount borrowed. One way to ease negative equity fears is to over-pay on your mortgage, if you can afford it. What is a recession and how could one affect me? Why has the Bank of England been so dramatic?

UK hiring slowing down amid economic uncertainty,"Candidates Hiring in the UK has slowed amidst uncertainty over the economy, according to a report. July saw the slowest increase in the number of permanent jobs filled for 17 months. KPMG said recruiters are becoming more tentative over hiring new staff. The consultancy added that ongoing skills shortages, a drop in foreign workers and hesitancy from candidates to move jobs had all led to a tighter supply of suitable staff. The slowing down of the hiring spree that followed the pandemic comes as the Bank of England warned the UK will fall into recession in the final quarter of this year. The bank raised interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75%, in a bid to curb soaring prices. The jobs report by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation suggested rising operating costs and uncertainty over the UK's economic outlook is leading some firms to put the brakes on recruitment, at least for permanent roles. But the soaring cost of living and tougher competition for a smaller pool of qualified candidates has also meant that the rate of starting pay continued to rise in July. ""The trend of uncertainty in the UK jobs market of the last few months continues,"" said KPMG's Claire Warnes. ""Employers are rightly hesitant about their hiring plans... So, a focus on up-skilling existing workers and attracting talent, remains absolutely essential for UK business to play its part in driving forward the economy."" It is still a good time to be a jobseeker - the number of vacancies advertised has continued to grow. Although the fastest rate of growth in vacancies was for temporary posts in the hospitality sector. ""Given the outlook being painted by the Bank of England... one might wonder why anyone would consider switching jobs at all,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. ""Consumer confidence is already at record lows, and prices look set to rise further, so business and consumers are likely to face further challenges. Let's see what the government has in mind to help navigate us through the winter months."" The Bank of England said it expects the economy to shrink in the final three months of this year, and keep shrinking until the end of 2023, signalling the longest downturn for the UK economy since the 2008 financial crisis. Jeevun Sandher, economist at Kings College London said ""those who are able and willing to work are, generally, working. That is great news"". But he added: ""The problem we face is that having a job does not mean you will earn enough to escape poverty. Even before this cost-of-living crisis, almost 70% of adults in poverty lived in working households. That has gotten significantly worse - half of us are now cutting back on food."" He added that workers should be asking for ""the highest salaries possible"". More than a third cut back on food and essentials When will interest rates fall?

The editors were Andrew Humphrey, Nathan Williams, Chris Giles and James Harness. You can read more about the interest rate hike, recession forecast and rising cost of living here. This video can not be played Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has been speaking more today about the decision to raise interest rates, saying there is a ""real risk"" of soaring prices becoming ""embedded"". As we've been reporting, interest rates have risen to 1.75% - the biggest rise in 27 years - with inflation now set to hit more than 13%. The real risk we're responding to is that inflation becomes embedded and it doesn't come down in the way that we would otherwise expect.""  We've also heard from a couple, both pensioners, who told the BBC theyâll have to plan a tight budget then âsee how things goâ. âThereâs not a great deal we can do about it is there? The government does everything themselves. âOur savings have been eroded. âWeâre just two people with a very small voice.â A rise in interest rates has been unwelcome news for many. So what will happen if prices continue to rise? One woman who works as a care manager in Wales told the BBC: ""The income that we're getting at the moment is just not enough to afford the bills, the rent... all the food prices, the fuel prices... it's really, really difficult. ""The prices are so high now that I've had to start cutting back. So if they do keep going up we're going to see a lot more homelessness, we're going to see a lot more people applying for benefits. ""The majority of people are not gonna be able to afford to actually live a stable, normal life. ""It's going to be really bad if it keeps going up."" Last question now, coming from Aaron in Londonderry, who asked Money Saving Expert's Gareth Shaw: What does interest rates going up mean for the price of my borrowing? I have an outstanding balance on my credit card, which I'm only able to pay off slowly due to the rising cost of living. Does this mean I will end up paying more? It really depends on the terms of your credit card. Some credit card providers are pretty explicit that their interest rates will be tied to the Bank of England base rate. Others do not tie it to the Bank of England base rate. There are products out there that can help you minimise the amount of interest that you pay on credit card debt. They're called 0% balance transfer credit cards. If you're paying interest on your credit card debt you cannot afford not to look at these types of cards because your repayments are currently paying off interest and debt. When you shift your debt to a 0% balance transfer credit card, all of your repayments are reducing your debt. There are ways to find out if you're eligible before you apply. I would strongly suggest looking at those. This video can not be played It is market day in Loughborough. We've been in the Leicestershire town finding
out how people are coping with the rising cost of living. Many seem to be taking it in their stride. One resident says his vehicle ""costs a small fortune"" to fill with petrol, but is managing to get by on his pension, ""just"". Another tells us he's just going ""to live with it"", and the government isn't able to do anything to help: ""They just keep talking."" Another question now from BBC viewer Christine, who asks Prof Hilary Ingham: Is it purely the effect of the war in Ukraine that's affecting so many economies and people? No, it's not solely Ukraine - but obviously that is having a big impact. Ukraine is a very big producer of grain and this also feeds into animal feed. Things like chickens are becoming more expensive. But obviously there's the gas problem, in particular with Russia cutting back on what it's sending through Nordstream 1, so that is affecting energy prices severely. Brexit has caused labour shortages, so in some sectors, employers are having to raise wages to attract employees. So it's a combination of factors - all are working against the consumer at this point in time. Not everyone sees the rise in interest rates as bad news. A small business owner in Cardiff told the BBC he welcomes the news, as the prices of his materials have all gone up. âWhatever the government is trying to do to cushion inflation is greatly appreciated because everything right now is just spiralling out of control,"" he said. âI look at it as any help I can get to bring down the costs, I can pass the savings on to my customers.â But if thereâs a recession, as the Bank predicts, he said heâs going to âlose businessâ¦ I might be queuing up at the unemployment centreâ. The prime minister and chancellor have been accused of being 'missing in action' The head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents the interests of business-owners, is warning of a ""vacuum"" in government at a time of economic crisis. ""We cannot wait until 5 September for action,"" Tony Danker tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. He's referring to the date on which the country's next prime minister will be known, following the conclusion of the Conservative leadership contest. ""We need the current prime minister and the current chancellor to fill that vacuum,"" Danker adds. Both Boris Johnson and Nadhim Zahawi are currently on holiday - although Zahawi insisted yesterday that he was continuing to work while abroad. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Stephen from Nottingham wants to know whether big businesses are profiting at the expense of individuals. The BBC and other media seem to be pinning the inflation rate on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and due to the economy largely shutting down over
Covid. But on social media, there is a discussion around
corporations making huge profits. People say this is causing inflation because a lot of these businesses face little competition and can raise prices whenever they want. Is this
true? When inflation bites and things become more expensive, people
naturally look around for somebody to blame. Big corporates posting massive profits are easy targets. âIf
theyâre making that much money, why canât they cut prices,â consumers ask. Meanwhile I've seen growing use on social media of phrases such
as ""pandemic profiteers"" or ""greedflation"". But the accusations don't seem to hold up when you look at the
economics behind the profits. Profits help companies grow, which in turn helps other companies
and suppliers, investors, as well as workers and the wider economy. In short the current global system needs businesses to be
successful to keep economies on track. Forcing them to reduce prices or cut profits could stifle growth
and investment which, in turn, could lead to economic contraction. The reason why Russia's invasion of Ukraine is more likely to be
mentioned in relation to inflation is that it has massively disrupted energy
supplies, and gas and electricity are a major part of consumer expenditure. Another issue to bear in mind is the UKâs skills shortage after
Brexit, which has left many industry sectors facing problems because of a lack
of workers. Meanwhile, supply chain problems caused by ongoing global
uncertainty are hitting many companies' products. That leads to a scarcity which puts up prices as demand
outstrips the available supply. A fall in living costs can't come soon enough for Lucy Cogle
from Yorkshire. The pensioner already switched off her heating last winter
because she couldnât afford the bills. She says this winter she'll again be relying on her dogs to keep
her warm. ""It was absolutely freezing,"" she says. ""We had damp coming up through the windows and I made
patchwork blankets for us. ""We're just struggling to live."" Money Saving Expert's deputy editor Gareth Shaw and professor of economics Hilary Ingham have joined the BBC's Martine Croxall to answer more of your questions on the BBC News Channel. The first is from Martine herself, who asks Prof Ingham: What does the Bank of England governor mean when he talks about embedded inflation? It means there's inflationary pressure in the economy which is embedded in that we don't expect it to go away any time soon. A few months back, the governor was actually talking about inflation being transitory, ie. something that was only temporary, that he was expecting to turn back to much lower levels. But now what they're thinking is are these pressures for prices to keep on rising, so we have got embedded inflation, ie. it's not something that is just going to disappear overnight. Raising taxes while interest rates are rising ""doesn't make any sense"", insists Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. He said Liz Truss, who he is backing in the Tory party leadership contest, has been talking about the risk of recession since the start. ""[It] means that you canât have rising interest rates, which we saw yesterday, and also have tighter fiscal policy,"" he said. ""Inflation means you have less of your money to spend â your income is being squeezed â nobody Iâve ever spoken to until about a week ago has said the way to deal with that is to take even more of peopleâs money through tax, that doesnât make any sense."" He said one of Truss's proposals was not having a tax cut but ""actually not having a tax increase"". ""Thatâs not inflationary, essentially saying that a tax cut
that has been pencilled in wonât happen,"" said Kwarteng. He pointed out no other G7 countries were raising both interest rates and tax to deal with inflation. Kwarteng also says he expects there will be an emergency Budget to help people - although it probably won't happen not until September. He insisted he was in constant contact with the prime minister and chancellor while they both were abroad. Former housing secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC earlier that the ""overwhelming
priority"" for the government must be tackling inflation. Jenrick, who is backing Rishi Sunak for prime minister, repeated his favoured candidate's line that the âdashboard
is flashing red on the British economyâ. In an apparent reference to Sunakâs opponent Liz Trussâ statement
that a recession isnât inevitable, he also said that âwe shouldn't fool
ourselves into believing that all is going to be fineâ. Jenrick also argued that while âunfunded tax cutsâ now were âattractiveâ, they âseem less relevant"" in the context of the overall state of the economy. He said the government must work out if there was anything more that can be done can do to reduce inflation, beyond the actions already taken by the
Bank of England to hike interest rates. In a further critique of Trussâ policy platform, Jenrick reiterated
the Sunak campâs belief that âthe one thing we certainly can do is to do no
further harm and not to do any tax rises that might add to inflationâ. Jenrick also said the movement must âthink very deeply about what
we can do to help the poorest and most vulnerable households through the winterâ. Let's get some more reaction from the political world now, with Paul Johnson, a leading economist and director of the
independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, saying thereshould be a focus on tackling inflationrather than tax cuts during the Tory leadership race. ""Many more billions [will be needed] to support
households"" through current inflation rates, hetold the BBC earlier. Johnson also rejected the idea cuts could be funded in part by
""fiscal headroom"", as suggested by a number of the MPs who battled it
out to become the next PM â andincluding Liz Truss, who's still in the race. ""What [the leadership candidates are] talking about is that
the Office for Budget Responsibility [in March] said we'd be borrowing about
Â£30bn less than we absolutely could to meet the fiscal target of a balanced
current budget in a few years' time,"" he said. But he added that this was ""highly uncertain"" and now
""massively out of date"", given the economy was heading for recession. Rishi Sunak, who has trailed in recent polls, has repeatedly said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he became PM. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter A question now from Susan Ward, who asks: How much is
Brexit contributing to the economic problems in the UK? There are a number
of factors to bear in mind. One direct impact of
Brexit was the number of EU migrants who left the UK, leaving the
country with a shortage of skilled workers across a number of industries. The hospitality
industry has been particularly badly hit but other sectors have also reported
problems, such as construction and haulage. A shortage of workers
has led to cutbacks or reduced service, which has hit profits and had a
knock-on effect across the economy. The new hard border
introduced between Britain and the EU has also had a detrimental effect on
business with delays affecting deliveries and therefore profits. Red tape and new
restrictions have been bad news for many British companies which report losing
customers and orders and, in the worst case, having to go out of business. Thereâs also the
rising cost of the UK's Brexit divorce bill from leaving the EU. The latest government estimate last month put it at Â£42.5bn. Thatâs cash
taken out of the UK economy. Beth TimminsFinance reporter Next, another question relating to using interest rates to control inflation, from Kevin Fryers in Hampshire: If inflation is caused largely by the war in Ukraine and not the economy being overheated, how does putting interest rates up help? Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living rises over time, is now set to hit more than 13% in the UK. This inflation rise has been reflected in major Western economies, as the cost of energy and food has been pushed up by dwindling supplies caused by the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Such a figure has encouraged the Bank of England to increase interest rates. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stop rising as fast. Increasing interest rates is one way to try and control inflation as it raises borrowing costs. But in the UK, for example, about 2.2 million homeowners with mortgages linked to the Bank of England's base rate would see repayments go up, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already being squeezed by the cost of living. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Mortgage borrowers are always faced with the perennial question
of when is a good time to fix their rate. The advantage of a fixed rate is that you know how much monthly
repayments will be for the length of the fix, which can really help with
budgeting. But the danger is of fixing at too high a rate when you could be
saving money every month with a cheaper variable deal. The average five-year fixed rate mortgage has now breached 4%,
according to rates analysts Moneyfacts.co.uk. Experts expect rates to climb even more after yesterdayâs half a
percentage point rise in the Bank rate. Does that mean you should look to get a decent fix rate now? Yes, reckons Rachel Springall, finance expert at
Moneyfacts.co.uk. ""Borrowers who have not locked into a fixed rate would be
wise to move quickly to secure a new deal as interest rates continue to climb,""
she said. The Bank of England has warned Britain will lurch into recession later this year, but how will that affect the housing market? It will be the first UK recession since 2020 - at the height of the Covid crisis. That actually boosted property prices as working from home encouraged both house movers and buyers in a race for space. The housing market has been rampant ever since as people taking out a mortgage took advantage of low interest rates and a stamp duty holiday, but a recession could finally put the brakes on it. The latest figures from the Halifax bank published on Friday showed that prices climbed 11.8% in the 12 months to July. However, they slipped by 0.1% month-on-month in July - and that was before the Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% to tackle soaring inflation. Read more on this story here. Beth TimminsBBC News Tony Hall wants to know in what way people are going to be assisted by yesterday's announcements from the Bank of England. How does increasing interest rates - affecting mortgages and other loans - help the population cope with a higher cost of living? The Bank has introduced the biggest interest hike since 1995 to try to tackle inflation. This adds significant costs to borrowers but is meant to subdue the fast pace of price growth and wage increases. However, as the energy price increases are largely a supply problem, the Bank has less power to control this factor which is driving up the cost of living. Â© 2025 BBC.

Others do not tie it to the Bank of England base rate. There are products out there that can help you minimise the amount of interest that you pay on credit card debt. They're called 0% balance transfer credit cards. If you're paying interest on your credit card debt you cannot afford not to look at these types of cards because your repayments are currently paying off interest and debt. When you shift your debt to a 0% balance transfer credit card, all of your repayments are reducing your debt. There are ways to find out if you're eligible before you apply. I would strongly suggest looking at those. This video can not be played It is market day in Loughborough. We've been in the Leicestershire town finding
out how people are coping with the rising cost of living. Many seem to be taking it in their stride. One resident says his vehicle ""costs a small fortune"" to fill with petrol, but is managing to get by on his pension, ""just"". Another tells us he's just going ""to live with it"", and the government isn't able to do anything to help: ""They just keep talking."" Another question now from BBC viewer Christine, who asks Prof Hilary Ingham: Is it purely the effect of the war in Ukraine that's affecting so many economies and people? No, it's not solely Ukraine - but obviously that is having a big impact. Ukraine is a very big producer of grain and this also feeds into animal feed. Things like chickens are becoming more expensive. But obviously there's the gas problem, in particular with Russia cutting back on what it's sending through Nordstream 1, so that is affecting energy prices severely. Brexit has caused labour shortages, so in some sectors, employers are having to raise wages to attract employees. So it's a combination of factors - all are working against the consumer at this point in time. Not everyone sees the rise in interest rates as bad news. A small business owner in Cardiff told the BBC he welcomes the news, as the prices of his materials have all gone up. âWhatever the government is trying to do to cushion inflation is greatly appreciated because everything right now is just spiralling out of control,"" he said. âI look at it as any help I can get to bring down the costs, I can pass the savings on to my customers.â But if thereâs a recession, as the Bank predicts, he said heâs going to âlose businessâ¦ I might be queuing up at the unemployment centreâ. The prime minister and chancellor have been accused of being 'missing in action' The head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents the interests of business-owners, is warning of a ""vacuum"" in government at a time of economic crisis. ""We cannot wait until 5 September for action,"" Tony Danker tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. He's referring to the date on which the country's next prime minister will be known, following the conclusion of the Conservative leadership contest. ""We need the current prime minister and the current chancellor to fill that vacuum,"" Danker adds. Both Boris Johnson and Nadhim Zahawi are currently on holiday - although Zahawi insisted yesterday that he was continuing to work while abroad. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Stephen from Nottingham wants to know whether big businesses are profiting at the expense of individuals. The BBC and other media seem to be pinning the inflation rate on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and due to the economy largely shutting down over
Covid. But on social media, there is a discussion around
corporations making huge profits. People say this is causing inflation because a lot of these businesses face little competition and can raise prices whenever they want. Is this
true? When inflation bites and things become more expensive, people
naturally look around for somebody to blame. Big corporates posting massive profits are easy targets. âIf
theyâre making that much money, why canât they cut prices,â consumers ask. Meanwhile I've seen growing use on social media of phrases such
as ""pandemic profiteers"" or ""greedflation"". But the accusations don't seem to hold up when you look at the
economics behind the profits. Profits help companies grow, which in turn helps other companies
and suppliers, investors, as well as workers and the wider economy. In short the current global system needs businesses to be
successful to keep economies on track. Forcing them to reduce prices or cut profits could stifle growth
and investment which, in turn, could lead to economic contraction. The reason why Russia's invasion of Ukraine is more likely to be
mentioned in relation to inflation is that it has massively disrupted energy
supplies, and gas and electricity are a major part of consumer expenditure. Another issue to bear in mind is the UKâs skills shortage after
Brexit, which has left many industry sectors facing problems because of a lack
of workers. Meanwhile, supply chain problems caused by ongoing global
uncertainty are hitting many companies' products. That leads to a scarcity which puts up prices as demand
outstrips the available supply. A fall in living costs can't come soon enough for Lucy Cogle
from Yorkshire. The pensioner already switched off her heating last winter
because she couldnât afford the bills. She says this winter she'll again be relying on her dogs to keep
her warm. ""It was absolutely freezing,"" she says. ""We had damp coming up through the windows and I made
patchwork blankets for us. ""We're just struggling to live."" Money Saving Expert's deputy editor Gareth Shaw and professor of economics Hilary Ingham have joined the BBC's Martine Croxall to answer more of your questions on the BBC News Channel. The first is from Martine herself, who asks Prof Ingham: What does the Bank of England governor mean when he talks about embedded inflation? It means there's inflationary pressure in the economy which is embedded in that we don't expect it to go away any time soon. A few months back, the governor was actually talking about inflation being transitory, ie. something that was only temporary, that he was expecting to turn back to much lower levels. But now what they're thinking is are these pressures for prices to keep on rising, so we have got embedded inflation, ie. it's not something that is just going to disappear overnight. Raising taxes while interest rates are rising ""doesn't make any sense"", insists Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. He said Liz Truss, who he is backing in the Tory party leadership contest, has been talking about the risk of recession since the start. ""[It] means that you canât have rising interest rates, which we saw yesterday, and also have tighter fiscal policy,"" he said. ""Inflation means you have less of your money to spend â your income is being squeezed â nobody Iâve ever spoken to until about a week ago has said the way to deal with that is to take even more of peopleâs money through tax, that doesnât make any sense."" He said one of Truss's proposals was not having a tax cut but ""actually not having a tax increase"". ""Thatâs not inflationary, essentially saying that a tax cut
that has been pencilled in wonât happen,"" said Kwarteng. He pointed out no other G7 countries were raising both interest rates and tax to deal with inflation. Kwarteng also says he expects there will be an emergency Budget to help people - although it probably won't happen not until September. He insisted he was in constant contact with the prime minister and chancellor while they both were abroad. Former housing secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC earlier that the ""overwhelming
priority"" for the government must be tackling inflation. Jenrick, who is backing Rishi Sunak for prime minister, repeated his favoured candidate's line that the âdashboard
is flashing red on the British economyâ. In an apparent reference to Sunakâs opponent Liz Trussâ statement
that a recession isnât inevitable, he also said that âwe shouldn't fool
ourselves into believing that all is going to be fineâ. Jenrick also argued that while âunfunded tax cutsâ now were âattractiveâ, they âseem less relevant"" in the context of the overall state of the economy. He said the government must work out if there was anything more that can be done can do to reduce inflation, beyond the actions already taken by the
Bank of England to hike interest rates. In a further critique of Trussâ policy platform, Jenrick reiterated
the Sunak campâs belief that âthe one thing we certainly can do is to do no
further harm and not to do any tax rises that might add to inflationâ. Jenrick also said the movement must âthink very deeply about what
we can do to help the poorest and most vulnerable households through the winterâ. Let's get some more reaction from the political world now, with Paul Johnson, a leading economist and director of the
independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, saying thereshould be a focus on tackling inflationrather than tax cuts during the Tory leadership race. ""Many more billions [will be needed] to support
households"" through current inflation rates, hetold the BBC earlier. Johnson also rejected the idea cuts could be funded in part by
""fiscal headroom"", as suggested by a number of the MPs who battled it
out to become the next PM â andincluding Liz Truss, who's still in the race. ""What [the leadership candidates are] talking about is that
the Office for Budget Responsibility [in March] said we'd be borrowing about
Â£30bn less than we absolutely could to meet the fiscal target of a balanced
current budget in a few years' time,"" he said. But he added that this was ""highly uncertain"" and now
""massively out of date"", given the economy was heading for recession. Rishi Sunak, who has trailed in recent polls, has repeatedly said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he became PM. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter A question now from Susan Ward, who asks: How much is
Brexit contributing to the economic problems in the UK? There are a number
of factors to bear in mind. One direct impact of
Brexit was the number of EU migrants who left the UK, leaving the
country with a shortage of skilled workers across a number of industries. The hospitality
industry has been particularly badly hit but other sectors have also reported
problems, such as construction and haulage. A shortage of workers
has led to cutbacks or reduced service, which has hit profits and had a
knock-on effect across the economy. The new hard border
introduced between Britain and the EU has also had a detrimental effect on
business with delays affecting deliveries and therefore profits. Red tape and new
restrictions have been bad news for many British companies which report losing
customers and orders and, in the worst case, having to go out of business. Thereâs also the
rising cost of the UK's Brexit divorce bill from leaving the EU. The latest government estimate last month put it at Â£42.5bn. Thatâs cash
taken out of the UK economy. Beth TimminsFinance reporter Next, another question relating to using interest rates to control inflation, from Kevin Fryers in Hampshire: If inflation is caused largely by the war in Ukraine and not the economy being overheated, how does putting interest rates up help? Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living rises over time, is now set to hit more than 13% in the UK. This inflation rise has been reflected in major Western economies, as the cost of energy and food has been pushed up by dwindling supplies caused by the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Such a figure has encouraged the Bank of England to increase interest rates. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stop rising as fast. Increasing interest rates is one way to try and control inflation as it raises borrowing costs. But in the UK, for example, about 2.2 million homeowners with mortgages linked to the Bank of England's base rate would see repayments go up, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already being squeezed by the cost of living. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Mortgage borrowers are always faced with the perennial question
of when is a good time to fix their rate. The advantage of a fixed rate is that you know how much monthly
repayments will be for the length of the fix, which can really help with
budgeting. But the danger is of fixing at too high a rate when you could be
saving money every month with a cheaper variable deal. The average five-year fixed rate mortgage has now breached 4%,
according to rates analysts Moneyfacts.co.uk. Experts expect rates to climb even more after yesterdayâs half a
percentage point rise in the Bank rate. Does that mean you should look to get a decent fix rate now? Yes, reckons Rachel Springall, finance expert at
Moneyfacts.co.uk. ""Borrowers who have not locked into a fixed rate would be
wise to move quickly to secure a new deal as interest rates continue to climb,""
she said. The Bank of England has warned Britain will lurch into recession later this year, but how will that affect the housing market? It will be the first UK recession since 2020 - at the height of the Covid crisis. That actually boosted property prices as working from home encouraged both house movers and buyers in a race for space. The housing market has been rampant ever since as people taking out a mortgage took advantage of low interest rates and a stamp duty holiday, but a recession could finally put the brakes on it. The latest figures from the Halifax bank published on Friday showed that prices climbed 11.8% in the 12 months to July. However, they slipped by 0.1% month-on-month in July - and that was before the Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% to tackle soaring inflation. Read more on this story here. Beth TimminsBBC News Tony Hall wants to know in what way people are going to be assisted by yesterday's announcements from the Bank of England. How does increasing interest rates - affecting mortgages and other loans - help the population cope with a higher cost of living? The Bank has introduced the biggest interest hike since 1995 to try to tackle inflation. This adds significant costs to borrowers but is meant to subdue the fast pace of price growth and wage increases. However, as the energy price increases are largely a supply problem, the Bank has less power to control this factor which is driving up the cost of living. Â© 2025 BBC.

This video can not be played Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has been speaking more today about the decision to raise interest rates, saying there is a ""real risk"" of soaring prices becoming ""embedded"". As we've been reporting, interest rates have risen to 1.75% - the biggest rise in 27 years - with inflation now set to hit more than 13%. The real risk we're responding to is that inflation becomes embedded and it doesn't come down in the way that we would otherwise expect.""  We've also heard from a couple, both pensioners, who told the BBC theyâll have to plan a tight budget then âsee how things goâ. âThereâs not a great deal we can do about it is there? The government does everything themselves. âOur savings have been eroded. âWeâre just two people with a very small voice.â A rise in interest rates has been unwelcome news for many. So what will happen if prices continue to rise? One woman who works as a care manager in Wales told the BBC: ""The income that we're getting at the moment is just not enough to afford the bills, the rent... all the food prices, the fuel prices... it's really, really difficult. ""The prices are so high now that I've had to start cutting back. So if they do keep going up we're going to see a lot more homelessness, we're going to see a lot more people applying for benefits. ""The majority of people are not gonna be able to afford to actually live a stable, normal life. ""It's going to be really bad if it keeps going up."" Last question now, coming from Aaron in Londonderry, who asked Money Saving Expert's Gareth Shaw: What does interest rates going up mean for the price of my borrowing?

Covid infections continuing to fall around the UK,"Covid infections are continuing to fall in the UK, dropping by more than half a million in a week, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS). Roughly 2.6 million people had the virus in the week to 26 July, compared to 3.2 million the previous week. The number of people in hospital with the virus is also decreasing. But experts warn there is still a lot of Covid around, with data estimating one in 25 people in England currently have the virus. Vaccines are helping protect people from severe illness, however. The ONS data is collated by testing thousands of people from UK households - whether or not they have symptoms - to estimate how much virus is circulating. In the latest ONS report, for the week ending 26 July , the estimated Covid rates were: One in 25  in England - down from one in 20 the week before One in 30 in Wales - down from one in 19 One in 17 in Northern Ireland - down from one in 16 (although experts say the trend is uncertain) One in 20 in Scotland - down from one in 19 ""Our most recent data suggests that infection rates have continued to decrease across much of the UK, although rates still remain high,"" said Dr Rhiannon Yapp, co-lead for the ONS survey. ""We have seen continued decreases in all regions and age groups in England. ""With the summer holidays and more people travelling, we will continue to closely monitor the data,"" she added. Many of the recent cases have been linked to fast-spreading sub-variants of Omicron, called BA.4 and BA.5. People are still able to become infected, even if they have had Covid before - but vaccines are helping to protect people from becoming severely ill.

China halts co-operation with US on key issuesBeijing has reacted angrily after senior US Democrat Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan earlier this week.,"Beijing is currently holding military drills in the air and seas around Taiwan China is halting co-operation with the US in several key areas including climate change, military talks and efforts to combat international crime. The new measures follow a trip to Taiwan by a US congressional delegation led by senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi. China, which also announced it was sanctioning Ms Pelosi and her family, views the visit as a challenge to its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. The self-ruled island sees itself as distinct from the mainland. The measures were announced by China's foreign ministry on Friday. It said dialogue between US and Chinese defence officials would be cancelled, while co-operation on returning illegal immigrants, climate change, and investigating international crime would be suspended. The two major powers have maintained cordial diplomatic ties on the need to combat climate change in recent years. At last year's climate summit in Glasgow, China vowed to work ""with urgency"" with the US to cut emissions. The countries have also found rare common cause on efforts to fight the trade of illegal drugs such as fentanyl. The decision to halt co-operation was taken because Ms Pelosi visited Taiwan ""in disregard of China's strong opposition and serious representations,"" the Chinese ministry said in a statement. It also accused the US delegation and Ms Pelosi - who is the highest-ranking US politician to travel to the island in 25 years - of ""egregious provocations"". In a message posted on Twitter on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying criticised US foreign policy by comparing it to the police killing of George Floyd, the unarmed black American whose death in 2020 sparked global anti-racism protests. ""We cannot allow the US to take itself as 'world policeman' and treat other countries as George Floyd whom it can bully and strangle at will,"" she wrote. At a news conference later on Friday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Ms Pelosi ""had every right"" to go to Taiwan and said China's new measures were ""fundamentally irresponsible"". ""We'll continue our efforts to keep open lines of communications with Beijing, while defending our interests and values,"" she said. Analysis by John Sudworth, former Beijing correspondent in Washington There can be few clearer examples of just how far, and how fast, the international political landscape is shifting. The statement from Beijing marks a new low point in the defining strategic relationship of our time. The consensus, just a few years ago, was that an established superpower should build strong trade and investment ties with a newly emerging one. The ideological differences would then fade away. Instead, while China has indeed become the factory of the world, deeply integrated into global supply chains, it has grown more authoritarian at home and more assertive abroad. A 1997 trip to Taiwan by then US House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for example, was met with little opposition. The Nancy Pelosi visit has been met with missiles - flown directly over a democracy and the heads of its 24 million people - whose appetite, by the way, for China's vision for unification dwindles ever further the more authoritarian it becomes. And now, any American citizen worried about the impact of Chinese precursor chemicals - sold into Mexico and then turned into the fentanyl that is fuelling thousands of US deaths - will also feel the impact of these shifting geopolitical plates. The Chinese statement suspends counter-narcotics co-operation. China's ""shared future for mankind"" messaging on climate change is similarly put on ice, now seemingly held hostage to the precondition that its claims to Taiwan be recognised. Nancy Pelosi may have given China the pretext. But this is a shift that was already well under way. The battle over values is front and centre stage once again, and the profound challenges it presents for the existing global order are likely only to increase. Although the US does not officially recognise Taiwan, it maintains strong relations with the island - which includes selling weapons for Taiwan to defend itself. Ms Pelosi is currently in Japan on the final leg of an Asia tour, and said on Friday that China ""will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there"". ON THE GROUND:Taiwan's 'Pelosi lovefest' EXPLAINER:China and Taiwan: A really simple guide ANALYSIS:Where Taiwan crisis leaves Biden's China policy Speaking to the BBC, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu defended the visit which he said would ""raise the profile of Taiwan and... allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". He also condemned the large-scale military exercises that China began around the island on Thursday in response to Ms Pelosi's visit. This video can not be played Foreign minister, Joseph Wu, condemns China's military drills around Taiwan Beijing is currently holding military drills in the air and seas around the island and these are expected to continue until Sunday. More than 100 warplanes and 10 warships have taken part in the live-fire exercises, with many apparently crossing the unofficial buffer zone between China and Taiwan. At least one ballistic missile has flown directly over the island, according to Chinese state media. Taiwan's foreign ministry has not confirmed or denied whether that is true, but it condemned the ongoing drills as ""highly provocative acts"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken added on Friday that there was ""no justification for this extreme, disproportionate and escalatory military response"". The White House summoned China's ambassador to Washington, condemning China's escalation as ""irresponsible"". In a statement, National Security Council strategic communications co-ordinator John Kirby said the White House had made it clear that the US ""is prepared for what Beijing chooses to do. We will not seek and do not want a crisis."" Why do China and Taiwan have poor relations?China sees the self-ruled island as a part of its territory and insists it should be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary How is Taiwan governed?The island has its own constitution, democratically elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces Who recognises Taiwan?Only a few countries recognise Taiwan. Most recognise the Chinese government in Beijing instead. The US has no official ties with Taiwan but does have a law which requires it to provide the island with the means to defend itself Taiwan foreign minister defends Pelosi visit China condemns 'manic' visit as Pelosi continues tour The view from Taiwan: 'We've had this for 70 years' Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

Truss and Sunak row over Bank's recession warning,"This video can not be played WATCH: The Battle for Number 10 - Moments from the Sky News special Tory leadership rivals Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have set out competing plans to deal with the economic recession forecast by the Bank of England in their latest TV clash. Ms Truss said a recession was ""not inevitable"" if ""bold"" action was taken. But Mr Sunak said the foreign secretary's ""unfunded"" tax cuts would pour ""fuel on the fire"" of inflation. The Bank's gloomy forecast of a recession this year loomed large in the TV special, hosted by Sky News. It earlierraised interest rates by the steepest amount in almost three decades, from 1.25% to 1.75%, in an attempt to curb soaring prices. The inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high of 13.3% this year, while the UK economy is expected to shrink for more than a year. The Bank said the main reason for high inflation and low growth was rising energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The worsening state of the UK economy has dominated the Tory leadership campaign, with both candidates putting forward rival visions to deal with the fallout. Pressure on for next PM to deliver on economy When will we know who the new PM is? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Sajid Javid endorses Liz Truss's bid to be PM Mr Sunak, who has trailed in recent polls, has repeatedly said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he became prime minister. Ms Truss has pledged a package of tax cuts worth Â£30bn soon after she enters office, which Mr Sunak has argued would increase inflation and the cost of borrowing. The former chancellor told the Sky News programme: ""We in the Conservative Party need to get real and fast - because the lights on the economy are flashing red and the root cause is inflation."" Ms Truss reiterated her pledge to immediately reverse April's increase in National Insurance and cut other taxes, which she claimed would stimulate economic growth and prevent a recession. ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable,"" she said. ""We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, an ally of Ms Truss, has criticised the Bank of England's performance. He told Sky News there was a ""strong argument"" interest rates should have been raised ""slightly sooner"". ""The job of the Bank was to deal with the inflation,"" he said. ""They have got a 2% inflation target. That's actually their mandate."" He said the predicted inflation rate peak showed ""clearly something has gone wrong"". But former cabinet minister Liam Fox - who is supporting Mr Sunak - said the Truss campaign needed to be ""more precise"" about how their proposed changes to the Bank of England's mandate would work. He said: ""The Bank of England's going to be independent or not. The government's going to maintain its 2% inflation target or not."" While the governor of the Bank of England gave a sombre press conference, the candidates to be the next prime minister were preparing for their next turn in a TV studio. The two candidates - once again - took the chance to have a pop at each other's economic plans. Liz Truss claimed the tax levels Rishi Sunak advocates will lead to recession, not growth; Rishi Sunak claimed Liz Truss' plan to cut taxes will exacerbate inflation and prolong economic pain. It is territory the two have clashed over before, but while the wannabe PMs keep exchanging blows on the finer points of fiscal policy, there will be many worried families and businesses simply wondering whether the help on offer will be anywhere near enough - or what more may come. Read more from Alex. The pair are vying to win over Conservative Party members, whose votes will determine which of them will become the next Tory leader and prime minister. The party's roughly 160,000 members started receiving ballot papers on Monday, with the result due on 5 September, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson will leave office. Despite trailing in many polls of members, Mr Sunak appeared to win the most support among the Sky News audience members in a show of hands. The programme saw an audience made up of Conservative members grill the candidates on a range of issues, including NHS funding, immigration and climate change. The worsening state of the UK economy has dominated the Tory leadership campaign In one testy exchange, Ms Truss disagreed with an audience member who expressed concerns about debt that would be incurred by the foreign secretary's tax plans. Ms Truss said in response that ""trying to balance the books prematurely is actually counterproductive"" and growing the economy was more important. Asked if she was happy with the answer, the Conservative member said she was not. She told Ms Truss that what former Tory prime minister Margaret Thatcher ""believed in was sound money"", adding ""this is not sound economics"". Liz Truss insisted her regional pay policy was ""misrepresented by various people"" Ms Truss was also put on the back foot by programme host Kay Burley, who repeatedly asked the foreign secretary if hernow-scrapped proposal to link public sector pay to local living costswas ""a mistake"". But Ms Truss resisted such an admission, and instead insisted her regional pay policy was ""misrepresented by various people"". At times, Mr Sunak looked uncomfortable when pressed by Ms Burley, too. She asked how he felt about so many former cabinet colleagues - including Nadhim Zahawi, Ben Wallace and Sajid Javid - backing Ms Truss's campaign and not his. ""Plenty of people who have sat around the cabinet table also support me,"" Mr Sunak said, highlighting Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab as one of his supporters. On whether there was nothing he could do about a recession, Mr Sunak said: ""Of course, there is, of course."" He said Ms Truss was wrong to suggest the tax burden was causing the recession, pointing instead to inflation. In other parts of the TV programme,Ms Truss: said she wanted to encourage doctors who came out of retirement to help the NHS during the pandemic ""to come back into the profession"" refused to say whether she would suspend Boris Johnson as a Tory MP if he was found to have lied to Parliament insisted she has nothing to hide, telling the audience ""there are no skeletons in my closet"" AndMr Sunak: insisted he would ""fight incredibly hard 'til the last day"" of the leadership campaign and not quit before results day said an ""enormous difference"" can be made between now and next winter to reduce the UK's dependence on Russian energy defended an old video where he claimed not to have any working-class friends, saying ""we all say silly things when we are younger"" Speaking after the debate, Labour shadow minister without portfolio Conor McGinn said whichever candidate won their ""low-growth, low-wage plans"" would not fix the economic crisis. ""The two continuity candidates have no answers to sky-high inflation, rocketing energy bills and the lengthy recession the Bank of England has warned is on the horizon,"" he said. Asked about energy bills on Friday morning, Ms Truss acknowledged it was ""going to be a tough winter"" and pledged to release reserves of gas in the North Sea, as well as supporting fracking and nuclear power.

Ferry issues leaving visitors 'sleeping in cars'A Western Isles tourism group said other visitors were cancelling their holidays completely.,"The MV Hebrides was withdrawn from service earlier this week At a glance Islanders in the Hebrides are concerned ferry disruption is badly damaging tourism Ferry operator CalMac has had to take steps to cover for the withdrawal of its MV Hebrides after a fault Outer Hebrides Tourism says some visitors are cancelling their holidays The Scottish Lib Dems are calling for an emergency statement at Holyrood on Western Isles services Visitors to the Western Isles are having to sleep in their cars or are cancelling holidays at short notice due to ferry disruption, it has been claimed. Outer Hebrides Tourism (OHT) said shops and restaurants were also struggling to get deliveries as part of what it called a deepening crisis on state-owned CalMac's west coast network. Islanders warn repeated ferry disruption risks damaging their islands' reputation as tourist destinations. North Uist, Harris and Skye ferry the MV Hebrides was withdrawn from service on Tuesday due to a reoccurrence of a fault. CalMac has apologised and taken steps to ease disruption including offering customers alternative routes, providing additional sailings and repositioning one of Mull's ferries to provide temporary cover for the Hebrides. Tourism is important to Scottish island economies. Mull and Iona Ferry Committee has called for urgent short-term investment in CalMac so a standby relief vessel could be made available to cover for breakdowns. Scottish government agency Transport Scotland said Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth convened a resilience meeting on Thursday night to discuss the situation with the Hebrides. The Western Isles' MSP and MP along with councillors, the Ferries Communities Board and Harris Development LtdÂ were involved. Tourism is important to the Western Isles' economy OHT chief executive Sarah MacLean said disruption to ferry services was having a devastating effect on Western Isles businesses and communities. She said: ""Whilst the Scottish government must now invest in CalMac to improve fleet resilience both in the short and long term, we call on them to compensate our local businesses and invest in rebuilding confidence in the Outer Hebrides as a visitor destination after the negative economic impact of this summer's ferry fiasco and indeed this winterâs disruption."" Joe Reade, of Mull and Iona Ferry Committee, urged CalMac's bosses to look again at chartering the Pentalina, a catamaran ferry tied up in Orkney. A previous deal to hire the boat as a relief vessel collapsedlast year. Mr Reade said: ""We just urgently need additional vessels in the fleet. ""The frustrating thing is that there is one sitting waiting to be chartered or bought."" A previous deal to chart the Pentalina collapsed CalMac hopes to have Hebrides back in service on Sunday following work to its firefighting system. The ferry was hit with a similar problem last week. CalMac, which posts service updates onits website,externaland its social media, has issued an apology to its customers, and appealed for patience with its workers while they try to meet demand. Managing director Robbie Drummond said: âMoving vessels around is not ideal but without any spare tonnage to use during disruption, it is often the only available option we have to continue to operate lifeline services. ""I can assure customers that we have looked at all possible alternative options before coming to this decision. âI am deeply sorry about the effect that the loss of MV Hebrides has had on our passengers and communities.â With Scottish government support CalMac, and its parent company CMAL, have sought to ease pressure with previous charters of a freight ferry and the purchase of the MV Loch Frisa,a former Norwegian passenger ferry. On Friday, the Scottish Liberal Democrats called for the Scottish Parliament to be recalled for an emergency statement. In response, Transport Scotland said discussions had taken place about Hebrides' return to service. A spokesman said CalMac and CMAL had been asked to make a thorough investigating of the fault with the boat's CO2 firefighting system. He added: âMinisters recognise that having confidence in ferry services can impact upon peopleâs decision on whether to live and work on the islands, and impacts upon the sustainability of the island communities themselves. ""These human impacts are at the heart of Scottish ministersâ commitment to continued investment in ferry services across Scotland.â Plans in place after ferry withdrawn for repairs Skye to isles ferry hit by second fault in days New CalMac ferry starts working on Mull route Ferry deal collapses over CalMac use of catamaran Ferry service getting worse admits Calmac boss A9 closed both ways following road crash How to order a free 'gift to the nation' commemorative coin One taken to hospital after Farraline Park bus crash in Inverness Police attend two-vehicle crash at Inverness bus station with one person taken to hospital Sutherland man caught in trap by paedophile hunters admits sex talk with â13-year-oldâ decoy Highland company Norscot announces lucrative partnership deal Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

"NHS too reliant on overseas recruits, says unionBBC research shows one-in-three new doctors in England last year came from outside the UK and EU.UK","The BMA doctors' union said government must do more to reduce reliance on foreign medics The NHS in England is increasingly reliant on doctors and nurses recruited from outside the UK and EU, analysis has found. Some 34% of doctors joining the health service last year came from overseas, a rise from 18% in 2014. The government said overseas recruitment had always been part of its strategy. But unions have warned it is an unsustainable way of recruiting in the long-term. A total of 39,558 domestically trained doctors and nurses joined the NHS in 2020-21, which is just over 3,200 more than in 2014-15. But UK medics have been occupying a decreasing proportion of the overall 1.35 million workforce during that period. The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed workforce data provided by NHS Digital from 2015 to 2021. That analysis found: The share of UK doctors joining the health service had fallen from 69% in 2015 to 58% last year. Over the same period, the share of new UK nurses fell from 74% to 61% The share of doctors recruited from outside of the UK and the EU rose from 18% to 34% while the share of nurses rose from 7% to 34% Patricia Marquis, Royal College of Nursing (RCN) director for England, said ministers must do more to reduce the ""disproportionate reliance"" on international recruits. The government is funding an additional 1,500 undergraduate medical school places each year for domestic students in England - a 25% increase over three years. However, last week a report by MPs concluded the large number of unfilled NHS job vacancies, about 110,000 in total, was posing a serious risk to patient safety. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said it was ""high time for the government to commit to a fully-funded, long-term workforce plan for the NHS"" to tackle ""chronic workforce shortages"". Radiologist Sumaira Babar says she has no plans to leave the UK having moved to Huddersfield in October Consultant radiologist Sumaira Babar is just one of the growing proportion to join the NHS from overseas. She moved from Karachi in Pakistan to Huddersfield with her young family last October. ""I thought why not, it'll be an adventure, it'd be something different,"" she said. ""It'll be a change from what I'm used to. It will be good for the children as well. They'll be exposed to a new culture, new environment, you know, they learn how the world works."" Yet the British Medical Association said that while the NHS is recruiting more people from abroad it also faced a challenge retaining them. It cited ""punishing workloads"" and the cost of visas. Doctors have told the BBC that many are training in the UK before moving abroad where immigration laws and working conditions are more favourable. The percentage of doctors leaving the NHS from non-UK and EU countries also rose from 15% in 2015 to 25% in 2021. Dr Amit Kochhar, its international committee deputy chair, said medical graduates were charged up to Â£2,400 to apply for indefinite leave to remain, with each of their dependants facing the same fee. Dr Hajra Usmani, left, said she knew of many overseas doctors who had left the NHS That was a problem for Dr Hajra Usmani, who worked in the NHS for 18 years but decided to leave her post as an A&E consultant in Frimley, Surrey, last year. The mother-of-two, aged 46, who is now working in a similar role in Medina, Saudi Arabia, said she was deterred by visa costs to bring her elderly parents to England. ""My mum has been diagnosed with severe dementia and my dad has cognitive impairment,"" she said. ""I cannot leave them on their own. ""They would have had to pay a surcharge to the NHS, but I stopped the application last September because it was coming up to Â£6,000 for the visas plus the legal fees before the Home Office would even consider the applications. ""We're now in Saudi Arabia where they have visa extensions for dependents."" Dr Usmani said she knew of many fellow doctors taking a similar path. ""Most of my colleagues here are ex-UK trained NHS staff. This is an exodus. The NHS is crumbling at the moment."" From within the EU, the share of recruits joining England's NHS each year fell from 11% in 2015 to 6% last year. Alexia Tsigka said there was a ""shortage worldwide"" of histopathologists Dr Alexia Tsigka, a consultant histopathologist at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals, said her specialism ""is a shortage occupation... according to the Royal College of Pathologists only 3% of UK departments are fully staffed. ""And I haven't seen anyone European coming after Brexit, at least in our department. Doctors that have applied to our department mostly come from India, Egypt and some from Sri Lanka. ""Post-Covid, we've also lost quite a few colleagues. We're facing an exodus."" The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the percentage decline in EU nationals joining the health service could have been down to more rigorous language tests introduced by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). A spokesman said the government supported the tests as ""an important patient safety measure"". Another possible factor was the economic recovery of southern European countries, as many nurses had come to the UK when work at home was limited. International recruitment has ""long been part of the NHS workforce strategy"", the spokesman added, with around one-in-seven staff reporting as non-British. The department spokesman rejected the claim that ""immigration restrictions were a key reason for healthcare staff leaving the UK"". There was ""no obligation on healthcare professionals to apply for [Indefinite Leave to Remain],"" he said, ""and they could, under the new points-based system, remain in the UK on a health and care visa which was a key promise of the government's manifesto"".

'Rate rise means I owe Â£250 a year more on loans',"Patrick Reid owes Â£25,000 in loans and credit cards The Bank of England has increased interest rates by half a percentage point - the biggest amount for 27 years. Rising interest rates can affect people in different ways, often creating extra costs and worries. But while it can increase the cost of borrowing, hitting business plans or mortgage hopes, savers may give a small cheer. The BBC spoke to five people about how higher interest rates would change their circumstances. London-based Patrick Reid owes thousands on credit cards and loans and fears an interest rate rise will cost him. ""I have personal loans and credit cards totalling Â£25,000 so any increase will be hugely noticeable. ""At present I repay around Â£1,800 a month but I have worked out that I will conservatively need to pay another Â£250 a year to keep up with the debts. ""My income is good as I own my own business and hopefully that will continue - but if my customers drop off it will be financially painful. ""I will simply have to tighten my belt and be extra cautious in my spending, which means all of those non-essential items will be cut from my budget. ""I'm very worried about future rate rises. I honestly don't think the UK can take another hike. It will cripple the economic outlook and businesses will suffer."" Correction 5 August: This story has been updated to clarify that the Â£250 owed was per year not per month. Wayne Trim, 38, works as a customer services manager at Morrison's in Verwood, Dorset. He's worried about the impact of rising interest rates on his mortgage. ""My mortgage payments were Â£416 last year and now they're Â£515 and will keep going up. ""That could start hindering my commute to work. I moved to a new store a little while ago. It's an hour's drive. They did give me a pay rise to move stores, but I needed a new car, which took a fair chunk of my pay rise. ""I bought a hybrid. I'm spending about Â£200 a month filling it up. ""If you look at everything globally, everything is going up. Fuel, food. We can look at the food shop and be a bit more crafty with that. I do get a discount for working at Morrison's. ""You think you're in a position where you're financially comfortable and then all these things start. It's like a never-ending cycle of trying to make ends meet. ""I'm also repaying some loans, that's about Â£270 a month. That finishes in April, so I'm looking forward to that. ""I'm a simple person. I don't understand why they're doing the rate increases. They tell us it's to curb borrowing but all it means for me is I'm cancelling Netflix and Amazon."" Louise Parker and her husband have been saving to move home in Brighton since 2020, but are having to have a major rethink because of rising interest rates. ""I know that we are in a very privileged position to be in a home that we own in the first place with a decent mortgage rate fixed for two years. ""But we've had to substantially reconsider the amount of money we can borrow. It's meant we're looking at smaller houses which, considering we were wanting to move to start a family, is making us wonder whether we should bother moving at all. Interest rates widely expected to go up again ""Our options are either to stay put where we are or move to something about Â£200,000 cheaper than we had hoped. ""We're also worried about how long we should fix for if we move. We don't want to be stung after two years if rates have gone up even more, or have to downsize because we can no longer afford the repayments. ""It's just such an adjustment to have to think about interest rates. It's a new hurdle in the mix."" Edmund Wood is saving to buy a home close to London so hopes the interest rate rise will help his deposit grow more quickly. He also hopes rising rates will help the rum business that he owns. ""An increase in interest rates is good for me. I'm saving up a deposit, so more interest will mean my savings will go up quicker. ""And as I look further ahead to actually buying a house, I've been worried about rising property prices - they have climbed every month for the last 12 months in a row. ""That wouldn't be good if I was ready to buy now, but in two years when I've saved up during a period of increasing interest rates, hopefully house prices will fall again, which will leave me in a better position to buy. ""Also hopefully by then interest rates will have stabilised somewhat, meaning I'll be able to get a stable interest rate on a mortgage. ""I think rising interest rates will also be good for my rum business if they bring inflation down. That in turn should reduce the cost of living, leaving people having more money in their pocket at the end of the month."" Paola Dyboski runs a small manufacturing business in North Wales called Dr Zigs Extraordinary Bubbles and fears the rate rise will put her expansion plans in jeopardy. ""We're ambitious and currently expanding globally and finding growth in export markets. ""But, with expansion on the cards we would look to borrow to increase production and outputs and manage this growth. ""Increased interest rates will make this hugely more risky and challenging. It will bring into question the viability of our UK manufacturing base. ""I am also concerned that if our trade customers can't borrow, they will then cut on their spending and their purchases from us. We will all be affected.""

"NHS too reliant on overseas recruits, says union","The BMA doctors' union said government must do more to reduce reliance on foreign medics The NHS in England is increasingly reliant on doctors and nurses recruited from outside the UK and EU, analysis has found. Some 34% of doctors joining the health service last year came from overseas, a rise from 18% in 2014. The government said overseas recruitment had always been part of its strategy. But unions have warned it is an unsustainable way of recruiting in the long-term. A total of 39,558 domestically trained doctors and nurses joined the NHS in 2020-21, which is just over 3,200 more than in 2014-15. But UK medics have been occupying a decreasing proportion of the overall 1.35 million workforce during that period. The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed workforce data provided by NHS Digital from 2015 to 2021. That analysis found: The share of UK doctors joining the health service had fallen from 69% in 2015 to 58% last year. Over the same period, the share of new UK nurses fell from 74% to 61% The share of doctors recruited from outside of the UK and the EU rose from 18% to 34% while the share of nurses rose from 7% to 34% Patricia Marquis, Royal College of Nursing (RCN) director for England, said ministers must do more to reduce the ""disproportionate reliance"" on international recruits. The government is funding an additional 1,500 undergraduate medical school places each year for domestic students in England - a 25% increase over three years. However, last week a report by MPs concluded the large number of unfilled NHS job vacancies, about 110,000 in total, was posing a serious risk to patient safety. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said it was ""high time for the government to commit to a fully-funded, long-term workforce plan for the NHS"" to tackle ""chronic workforce shortages"". Radiologist Sumaira Babar says she has no plans to leave the UK having moved to Huddersfield in October Consultant radiologist Sumaira Babar is just one of the growing proportion to join the NHS from overseas. She moved from Karachi in Pakistan to Huddersfield with her young family last October. ""I thought why not, it'll be an adventure, it'd be something different,"" she said. ""It'll be a change from what I'm used to. It will be good for the children as well. They'll be exposed to a new culture, new environment, you know, they learn how the world works."" Yet the British Medical Association said that while the NHS is recruiting more people from abroad it also faced a challenge retaining them. It cited ""punishing workloads"" and the cost of visas. Doctors have told the BBC that many are training in the UK before moving abroad where immigration laws and working conditions are more favourable. The percentage of doctors leaving the NHS from non-UK and EU countries also rose from 15% in 2015 to 25% in 2021. Dr Amit Kochhar, its international committee deputy chair, said medical graduates were charged up to Â£2,400 to apply for indefinite leave to remain, with each of their dependants facing the same fee. Dr Hajra Usmani, left, said she knew of many overseas doctors who had left the NHS That was a problem for Dr Hajra Usmani, who worked in the NHS for 18 years but decided to leave her post as an A&E consultant in Frimley, Surrey, last year. The mother-of-two, aged 46, who is now working in a similar role in Medina, Saudi Arabia, said she was deterred by visa costs to bring her elderly parents to England. ""My mum has been diagnosed with severe dementia and my dad has cognitive impairment,"" she said. ""I cannot leave them on their own. ""They would have had to pay a surcharge to the NHS, but I stopped the application last September because it was coming up to Â£6,000 for the visas plus the legal fees before the Home Office would even consider the applications. ""We're now in Saudi Arabia where they have visa extensions for dependents."" Dr Usmani said she knew of many fellow doctors taking a similar path. ""Most of my colleagues here are ex-UK trained NHS staff. This is an exodus. The NHS is crumbling at the moment."" From within the EU, the share of recruits joining England's NHS each year fell from 11% in 2015 to 6% last year. Alexia Tsigka said there was a ""shortage worldwide"" of histopathologists Dr Alexia Tsigka, a consultant histopathologist at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals, said her specialism ""is a shortage occupation... according to the Royal College of Pathologists only 3% of UK departments are fully staffed. ""And I haven't seen anyone European coming after Brexit, at least in our department. Doctors that have applied to our department mostly come from India, Egypt and some from Sri Lanka. ""Post-Covid, we've also lost quite a few colleagues. We're facing an exodus."" The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the percentage decline in EU nationals joining the health service could have been down to more rigorous language tests introduced by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). A spokesman said the government supported the tests as ""an important patient safety measure"". Another possible factor was the economic recovery of southern European countries, as many nurses had come to the UK when work at home was limited. International recruitment has ""long been part of the NHS workforce strategy"", the spokesman added, with around one-in-seven staff reporting as non-British. The department spokesman rejected the claim that ""immigration restrictions were a key reason for healthcare staff leaving the UK"". There was ""no obligation on healthcare professionals to apply for [Indefinite Leave to Remain],"" he said, ""and they could, under the new points-based system, remain in the UK on a health and care visa which was a key promise of the government's manifesto"".

Hosepipe ban by Southern Water to come into force,"Berkshire won't be included in any hosepipe ban yet - but customers are being asked to use water wisely A hosepipe ban has come into force in parts of southern England. The move was imposed on Southern Water customers in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight from 17:00 BST. This means that using hosepipes to water gardens, clean cars, fill ornamental ponds and swimming pools will not be allowed. The restrictions are expected to last for three weeks. Similar measures are being introduced across Kent and Sussex after the driest July since 1935. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Southern Water said the decision to introduce the ban - which is the first in England this year - was a ""vital step"" to protect the habitats of the River Test and the River Itchen, where it extracts water. Last month the company saidriver flows were about 25% lowerthan they should be for July. Alison Hoyle, director of risk and compliance at Southern Water, said the ban could be in place for three weeks Alison Hoyle, the company's director of risk and compliance, told the BBC she wanted to remind customers that there would be no restrictions on essential water use. ""We are hoping for substantial rain,"" she said. ""At the moment we're saying we expect [the hosepipe ban] to be three weeks but we will need to monitor this closely depending on rainfall and river levels."" Portsmouth Water is not introducing a hosepipe ban but it urged its customers not to waste water. The firm said it was keeping its position ""under review"" and monitoring the situation ""on a daily basis"". How will you be affected by the hosepipe ban? You can share your thoughts by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Thames Water's customers have also been asked to use water ""wisely"". The company said the next stage of its statutory drought plan would be to introduce a temporary use ban ""which is likely to include hosepipes"". In a statement it added: ""The timing will depend on the amount of water used by our customers, which determines the speed at which reservoir storage declines, and the amount of flow in the rivers, which determines how much water we can take to refill them."" Water is being transferred to Berkshire from north London to stop a hosepipe ban being introduced in the county,Thames Water previously said. At an emergency meeting held last month, the National Drought Group moved England into ""prolonged dry weather"" status - the stage before a drought. InKent and Sussex about one million South East Water customerswill face measures from 12 August. Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"Mum issues renewed appeal over son killed in arsonOn the fourth anniversary of Joel Uhrie's death, a fresh appeal is launched by his mother.London","Joel's body was found in the upstairs bedroom he shared with his mother The mother of a seven-year-old boy who died in an arson attack has appealed for help in finding her son's killers. Joel Urhie's body was foundin the bedroom he shared with his mother at the house in Adolphus Street, Deptford, south-east London, on 7 August 2018. Detectives suspect his brother Sam, who was stabbed outside the home in June, was the target of a criminal gang. Iroroefe O Edu said: ""The perpetrators of this atrocity and dastardly crime have not been unearthed."" She added: ""If you have any information or know anything, or anyone, who may be responsible for causing the fire, can you come forward please?"" Joel was found dead in the upstairs bedroom, but Miss Edu and his 19-year-old sister escaped by jumping out of a first-floor window. The plan was for Miss Edu to cushion his fall, but the youngster never followed. The ground floor, first floor and stairs were badly damaged Joel's murder investigation is ongoing amid reports that his brother might have been the target and the arson attack was gang-related. Sam Uhrie, 21, was stabbed in a fight outside the property on 11 June. Concernswere raised at the timeover whether enough was done to safeguard the family. The family's home could have been fitted with a panic alarm and a fire-proof letterbox if the family were at risk, sources previously told the theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). A year after the attack two men were arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life although both were released with no further action. Two years later in August 2020, three further men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder but were released under investigation. Joel dreamed of becoming a firefighter, his family said Detectives believe that the amount of time since the attack means witnesses are more likely to speak up. Throughout the investigation, detectives have had a ""suspicion that it might be related to gang membership,"" according to Det Ch Insp Mark Rogers, who admitted that they ""can't say for sure"". He said: ""Someone knows why this happened; I would ask that you search your conscience and do what is right.""

LiveLiveChina restarts drills as Pelosi vows Taiwan won't be isolated7 minutes ago,"Chinese planes and ships have again crossed the median line in the strait between the mainland and Taiwan It comes as China holds its second day of military drills around the island, Beijing's main response to Nancy Pelosi's visit Japan has demanded China cease the drills, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called them an ""unjustified escalation"" Taiwan's foreign minister has told the BBC that Taiwan won't be the ""last piece in [the] Chinese dream of expansionism"" China has not commented on reports it may have fired a missile over Taiwan on Thursday China sees self-ruled Taiwan - which lies 100 miles from the mainland - as a breakaway province that will eventually be under its control Edited by Nathan Williams It's early evening in Taiwan and we'll be pausing our live coverage soon. But before we go
here's a recap of today's key developments:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Thomas Spender, Yvette Tan, Melissa Zhu, Nathan Williams, Jack Burgess and Sam Hancock. Let's head to Taiwan, where the defence ministry has spoken out
about the action of the Chinese military. In a statement, officials condemned Chinese vessels crossing the
Taiwan Strait and ""harassing"" the island's surrounding waters and air
space, Reuters reports. Chinese aircraft had crossed the median line a total of 68 times
by 17:00 local time (10:00 BST), the ministry reportedly said - before warning
its military would defend Taiwan's national security ""with firm
action"". It added China had ""seriously damaged"" the status quo
of the strait, which separates the island of Taiwan and mainland China. Reality Check There have been some more cyber-attacks reported against
official websites in Taiwan. The Ministry of National Defence was one target, as well as the
Environment Protection Bureau in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan,
according to local media. The Defence Ministry's website went offline
temporarily and on the environment bureau's website, the cyber-attackers put up
five Chinese national flags. The website of Taiwan's presidential office, the Foreign
Ministry and the governing party have all been targeted this week. Taiwan says the identities of
those responsible for the latest attacks remains unknown. We reported earlier on Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu'sinterview with the BBC- and here's some more. Refusing to apologise for US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's brief but controversial trip to the island, Wu said visits from high profile figures are key to ""raise the profile of Taiwan and to allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". ""China has long been trying to isolate Taiwan internationally,"" he added. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control again. One poll suggests most Taiwanese are not
confident that the US would help defend the island. Some78.4%of those polled said they werenot at allornot very confidentthat theUS would provide assistance to defend
Taiwan. While 19.2% of the 19,500 questioned - between Wednesday and Friday - said
they were very or somewhat confident. The rest had no opinion. The share of Taiwanese people who believe that the US military
would provide support against a Chinese invasion appears to have been dropping
for some time. A poll in March, by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF)
think tank, found that 55.9% of more than a thousand respondents did
not believe at all or did not fully believe that the US would defend Taiwan if
China invaded. While 34.5% somewhat or fully believed it would. This was a sharp drop from just six months before - prior to the
Ukraine war - when a similar survey by TPOF found that 65% believed the US
would send troops to defend Taiwan and only 29% did not think it would. Reality Check Taipei's international airport was not hit by a missile Misleading information has been circulating in recent days as
tensions have surged. Reports emerged incorrectly claiming that the international
airport near Taiwanâs capital, Taipei, was hit by a missile on 2 August. But Taiwanâs Ministry of National Defencedenied this had happened,,externaland
pointed out the airport was working normally. There've also been claims in some Chinese-language media that
Taiwan has cancelled all leave for its military. But as yet this has not
happened, although personnel have been asked to remain ""on alert."" There's also been misleading video shared claiming to show
Chinese warships in the waters around Taiwan in recent days. But it uses old
footage of events held to mark the 73rd anniversary of the Chinese navy in
April. Similarly, social media users
have shared video said to show a recent Chinese military exercise, which was
actually a Taiwanese drill from nearly two years ago. Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan has left Joe Biden with a serious headache as he tries to manage ties with America's biggest global rival. The relationship between China and the United States was founded on deliberate ambiguity over Taiwan. Maintaining the status quo - in which Beijing says Taiwan is part of China, Taiwan says it's independent, the US says it's not but treats it like an ally, and no one makes aggressive moves on their claims - has been the least-worst option of keeping a tenuous peace. But the US House Speaker has shone a harsh spotlight on the contradictions of this arrangement - which had already become strained. Read more Beijing has announced it is halting key climate talks with the US, and co-operation across multiple other areas. China and America unveiled a climate pact at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year. China's foreign ministry says the country is also suspending dialogue between senior military commanders, talks over cross-border crime prevention and repatriating illegal migrants. All this follows US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan which angered China. Penny Wong, Australia's foreign minister, has had her say on the situation in Taiwan. Speaking to reporters in Cambodia, she says Australia is ""deeply concerned"" about China's launch of ballistic missiles into waters around Taiwan's coastline. She also brands the military drills encircling the island ""disproportionate and destabilising"". Wong joins the likes of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who've both expressed concern over China's actions. In its own statement, Australiaâs foreign ministry adds: This is a serious matter for the region, including for our close strategic partner, Japan. Australia shares the regionâs concerns about this escalating military activity, especially the risks of miscalculation.  We urge restraint and de-escalation. It is in all our interests to have a region at peace and not in conflict. Australia does not want to see any unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. There is no change to Australia's bipartisan One China policy.  Rupert Wingfield-HayesReporting from Taiwan That's how a Taiwanese retired navy captain Lu Li-Shin described
the military drills taking place around the island. ""What China is engaged in is psychological warfare,""
he said. ""All the missiles being fired, all the explosions - it's to
show China's domestic audience how tough Beijing is being while at the same
time intimidating the people of Taiwan."" It is nevertheless an impressive show and illustrates how far
China's military has come in the last two decades. Captain Lu says China's next step might be to fire a missile
over Taiwan. It appears that might have happened on Thursday - Japanese
officials suspect it did - but China is yet to confirm it. If that's true, this is something China has never done before. As the graphic shows, several of the zones where China has been conducting military exercises verge into Taiwan's territorial waters. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command claims the sea combat drills are for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces. Chinese jets have also been spotted flying above the mainland's Pingtan island - which lies across the water from northern Taiwan and is one of the closest points to Taiwan. This video can not be played Two fishermen have spoken about the impact China's military drills are having on their daily lives. One said the atmosphere this time was ""abnormal"" while another insisted they had to keep using Taiwan waters or they would not survive. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command said that it continued military exercises in the north, southwest and east of Taiwan Island as planned on Friday. The air and sea combat drills were for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces, it said in a post on Weibo, the Chinese social media site. There's more from the US now, where areport in the Washington Post,externalreveals
China's ambassador to the US was called to the White House yesterday. ""After Chinaâs actions overnight, we summoned [Peopleâs
Republic of China] Ambassador Qin Gang to the White House to dÃ©marche him about
the PRCâs provocative actions,"" White House spokesman John Kirby says in a
statement provided to the newspaper. A dÃ©marche is a protest lodged through diplomatic channels. Kirby adds that the Biden administration condemned the PRCâs
military actions, ""which are irresponsible and at odds with our
long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait"". The meeting was between Kurt Campbell, US President Joe Biden's
Asia tsar, and Qin, according to a White House official who spoke to the Post
anonymously. News of the meeting - which took place on Thursday - came
shortly after Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, wassanctioned by China for her visit to
Taiwan. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting in English and Japanese - affirming the values Taiwan shares with democratic countries and asking the international community to ""halt escalation of the security situation"". In English, she said China's military threat was ""irresponsible to Taiwan and the international community"". Taiwan's government and military are closely monitoring China's military drills and are ready to respond as necessary, she said. Allow Twitter content?

China's foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying did not offer a comment when asked about whether missiles fired by China yesterday passed above Taiwan.

It is the diplomatic acknowledgement of China's position that there is only one Chinese government. Under the policy, the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. TheOne China policyis a key cornerstone of Sino-US relations. It is also a fundamental bedrock of Chinese policy-making and diplomacy. However, it is distinct from theOne China principle- referred to in the Chinese statement sanctioning Pelosi - whereby China insists Taiwan is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day. The US policy is not an endorsement of Beijing's position and indeed as part of the policy, Washington maintains a""robust unofficial"" relationship with Taiwan,external, including continued arms sales to the island so that it can defend itself. Read more Chinese state media has not yet released information about
Friday's military drill. A video was published showing Chinese army medics conducting a
drill for sending wounded soldiers by a high speed train with surgery facilities. On China's Twitter-like Weibo the hashtag ""second day of
military drill"" is being promoted and people are asking: ""What's for
today?"" and ""Why so quiet today?"" In general, the feeling on Chinese social media is mixed. Some
people are impressed by the drills so far, others seem disappointed by what
they've seen. China has announced it is sanctioning US Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her immediate family over her visit to Taiwan. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Pelosi had ""seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, seriously damaged China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampled on the one-China principle, and seriously threatened peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"", according to a statement.

Bank defends rate hike ahead of looming recessionBank of England governor Andrew Bailey warns price rises would be long-term if Bank did not act.Business,"This video can not be played Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, says there is a ""real risk"" of soaring prices becoming ""embedded"" The governor of the Bank of England has defended its decision to raise interest rates, saying there is a ""real risk"" of soaring prices becoming ""embedded"". Interest rates rose to 1.75% - the biggest rise in 27 years - with inflation now set to hit more than 13%. The UK is forecast to fall into recession this year, with the longest downturn since 2008 predicted. Increasing interest rates is one way to try and control inflation as it raises borrowing costs. This should encourage people to borrow less and spend less. It can also encourage people to save more. However, many households will be squeezed further following the interest rate rise, including some mortgage-holders. How does an interest rate rise affect me? Did the Bank of England make the right call? What is a recession and how could it affect me? 'Rate rise means I owe Â£250 a year more on loans' The Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The real risk we're responding to is that inflation becomes embedded and it doesn't come down in the way that we would otherwise expect."" ""We've had a domestic shock, we've had a shrinkage in the labour force over the last two years or so,"" he said. ""The first thing that businesses want to talk to me about is the problems they're having hiring people... They're also saying to us, actually they're not finding it difficult to raise prices at the moment. Now we think that can't go on."" He also warned against high pay rises, saying this would make inflation worse and ""it's the people who are least well off who are worse affected because they don't have the bargaining power"". However, Attorney General Suella Braverman said interest rates ""should have been raised a long time ago"". In response, Mr Bailey said: ""If you go back two years... given the situation we were facing at that point in the context of Covid, in the context of the labour market, the idea that at that point we would have tightened monetary policy, you know I don't remember there were many people saying that."" UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at 9.4%, which is the highest level for more than 40 years. But the Bank has warned it could peak at more than 13% and stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, before eventually returning to the Bank's 2% target in 2024. The main reason for high inflation and low growth is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Households have also been hit by higher petrol, diesel and food costs. Real post-tax household incomes - after taking account of inflation - are forecast to fall this year and next year. Andrew Sentance, who was a member of the Bank's rates-setting committee during the 2008 financial crisis, told BBC Breakfast: ""We're going to see a couple of yearsâ¦ when household incomes in real terms are squeezed much more severely than we've seen in other times since the Second World War."" The economy is forecast to shrink in the final three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. The expected recession would be the longest downturn since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse, bringing lending to a halt. The slump is not set to be as deep as 14 years ago but may last just as long. Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the economic situation would mean there would have to be ""many more billions to support households"" and more money for public services. He told the BBC that the Tory leadership candidates, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, should be focused on tackling inflation rather than tax cuts. Mr Johnson rejected the idea tax cuts could be funded in part by ""fiscal headroom"". ""What [the leadership candidates are] talking about is that the Office for Budget Responsibility [in March] said we'd be borrowing about Â£30bn less than we absolutely could to meet the fiscal target of a balanced current budget in a few years' time,"" he said. But he added that this was ""highly uncertain"" and now ""massively out of date"", given the economy was heading for recession. The worsening state of the UK economydominated a Sky News TV debate between the two Conservative leadership candidates on Thursday. Former Chancellor Mr Sunak, who has trailed Ms Truss in recent polls, has repeatedly said he would prioritise bringing inflation down before cutting taxes if he became prime minister. This video can not be played Watch: Business-as-usual policies won't stop recession, Liz Truss says Meanwhile, Ms Truss has pledged a package of tax cuts worth Â£30bn soon after she enters office, which Mr Sunak has argued would increase inflation and the cost of borrowing. But Ms Truss said cutting taxes would stimulate economic growth and prevent a recession. Ms Truss, who has been critical of the Bank, has suggested she is considering taking more control over it if she becomes prime minister. Mr Bailey said the Bank's independence was ""critically important"" and he did not think there was a ""large desire"" in the country to question this. However, he added he was happy to discuss the issue with the new government. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said the cost of living support measures announced by the government so far were ""clearly not enough"". ""There will be families and pensioners across the country waking up this morning, reading the news, who are absolutely terrified because a juggernaut is heading [their] way which will smash through family finances,"" the shadow work and pensions secretary told the BBC.

Hosepipe ban by Southern Water to come into forceHampshire and the Isle of Wight residents are the first in England to face water restrictions this year.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"Berkshire won't be included in any hosepipe ban yet - but customers are being asked to use water wisely A hosepipe ban has come into force in parts of southern England. The move was imposed on Southern Water customers in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight from 17:00 BST. This means that using hosepipes to water gardens, clean cars, fill ornamental ponds and swimming pools will not be allowed. The restrictions are expected to last for three weeks. Similar measures are being introduced across Kent and Sussex after the driest July since 1935. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Southern Water said the decision to introduce the ban - which is the first in England this year - was a ""vital step"" to protect the habitats of the River Test and the River Itchen, where it extracts water. Last month the company saidriver flows were about 25% lowerthan they should be for July. Alison Hoyle, director of risk and compliance at Southern Water, said the ban could be in place for three weeks Alison Hoyle, the company's director of risk and compliance, told the BBC she wanted to remind customers that there would be no restrictions on essential water use. ""We are hoping for substantial rain,"" she said. ""At the moment we're saying we expect [the hosepipe ban] to be three weeks but we will need to monitor this closely depending on rainfall and river levels."" Portsmouth Water is not introducing a hosepipe ban but it urged its customers not to waste water. The firm said it was keeping its position ""under review"" and monitoring the situation ""on a daily basis"". How will you be affected by the hosepipe ban? You can share your thoughts by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Thames Water's customers have also been asked to use water ""wisely"". The company said the next stage of its statutory drought plan would be to introduce a temporary use ban ""which is likely to include hosepipes"". In a statement it added: ""The timing will depend on the amount of water used by our customers, which determines the speed at which reservoir storage declines, and the amount of flow in the rivers, which determines how much water we can take to refill them."" Water is being transferred to Berkshire from north London to stop a hosepipe ban being introduced in the county,Thames Water previously said. At an emergency meeting held last month, the National Drought Group moved England into ""prolonged dry weather"" status - the stage before a drought. InKent and Sussex about one million South East Water customerswill face measures from 12 August. Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

Mum issues renewed appeal over son killed in arson,"Joel's body was found in the upstairs bedroom he shared with his mother The mother of a seven-year-old boy who died in an arson attack has appealed for help in finding her son's killers. Joel Urhie's body was foundin the bedroom he shared with his mother at the house in Adolphus Street, Deptford, south-east London, on 7 August 2018. Detectives suspect his brother Sam, who was stabbed outside the home in June, was the target of a criminal gang. Iroroefe O Edu said: ""The perpetrators of this atrocity and dastardly crime have not been unearthed."" She added: ""If you have any information or know anything, or anyone, who may be responsible for causing the fire, can you come forward please?"" Joel was found dead in the upstairs bedroom, but Miss Edu and his 19-year-old sister escaped by jumping out of a first-floor window. The plan was for Miss Edu to cushion his fall, but the youngster never followed. The ground floor, first floor and stairs were badly damaged Joel's murder investigation is ongoing amid reports that his brother might have been the target and the arson attack was gang-related. Sam Uhrie, 21, was stabbed in a fight outside the property on 11 June. Concernswere raised at the timeover whether enough was done to safeguard the family. The family's home could have been fitted with a panic alarm and a fire-proof letterbox if the family were at risk, sources previously told the theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). A year after the attack two men were arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life although both were released with no further action. Two years later in August 2020, three further men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder but were released under investigation. Joel dreamed of becoming a firefighter, his family said Detectives believe that the amount of time since the attack means witnesses are more likely to speak up. Throughout the investigation, detectives have had a ""suspicion that it might be related to gang membership,"" according to Det Ch Insp Mark Rogers, who admitted that they ""can't say for sure"". He said: ""Someone knows why this happened; I would ask that you search your conscience and do what is right.""

"Truss and Sunak row over Bank's recession warningLiz Truss says a recession can be averted, while Rishi Sunak argues tax cuts would fuel inflationUK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played WATCH: The Battle for Number 10 - Moments from the Sky News special Tory leadership rivals Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have set out competing plans to deal with the economic recession forecast by the Bank of England in their latest TV clash. Ms Truss said a recession was ""not inevitable"" if ""bold"" action was taken. But Mr Sunak said the foreign secretary's ""unfunded"" tax cuts would pour ""fuel on the fire"" of inflation. The Bank's gloomy forecast of a recession this year loomed large in the TV special, hosted by Sky News. It earlierraised interest rates by the steepest amount in almost three decades, from 1.25% to 1.75%, in an attempt to curb soaring prices. The inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high of 13.3% this year, while the UK economy is expected to shrink for more than a year. The Bank said the main reason for high inflation and low growth was rising energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The worsening state of the UK economy has dominated the Tory leadership campaign, with both candidates putting forward rival visions to deal with the fallout. Pressure on for next PM to deliver on economy When will we know who the new PM is? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Sajid Javid endorses Liz Truss's bid to be PM Mr Sunak, who has trailed in recent polls, has repeatedly said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he became prime minister. Ms Truss has pledged a package of tax cuts worth Â£30bn soon after she enters office, which Mr Sunak has argued would increase inflation and the cost of borrowing. The former chancellor told the Sky News programme: ""We in the Conservative Party need to get real and fast - because the lights on the economy are flashing red and the root cause is inflation."" Ms Truss reiterated her pledge to immediately reverse April's increase in National Insurance and cut other taxes, which she claimed would stimulate economic growth and prevent a recession. ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable,"" she said. ""We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, an ally of Ms Truss, has criticised the Bank of England's performance. He told Sky News there was a ""strong argument"" interest rates should have been raised ""slightly sooner"". ""The job of the Bank was to deal with the inflation,"" he said. ""They have got a 2% inflation target. That's actually their mandate."" He said the predicted inflation rate peak showed ""clearly something has gone wrong"". But former cabinet minister Liam Fox - who is supporting Mr Sunak - said the Truss campaign needed to be ""more precise"" about how their proposed changes to the Bank of England's mandate would work. He said: ""The Bank of England's going to be independent or not. The government's going to maintain its 2% inflation target or not."" While the governor of the Bank of England gave a sombre press conference, the candidates to be the next prime minister were preparing for their next turn in a TV studio. The two candidates - once again - took the chance to have a pop at each other's economic plans. Liz Truss claimed the tax levels Rishi Sunak advocates will lead to recession, not growth; Rishi Sunak claimed Liz Truss' plan to cut taxes will exacerbate inflation and prolong economic pain. It is territory the two have clashed over before, but while the wannabe PMs keep exchanging blows on the finer points of fiscal policy, there will be many worried families and businesses simply wondering whether the help on offer will be anywhere near enough - or what more may come. Read more from Alex. The pair are vying to win over Conservative Party members, whose votes will determine which of them will become the next Tory leader and prime minister. The party's roughly 160,000 members started receiving ballot papers on Monday, with the result due on 5 September, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson will leave office. Despite trailing in many polls of members, Mr Sunak appeared to win the most support among the Sky News audience members in a show of hands. The programme saw an audience made up of Conservative members grill the candidates on a range of issues, including NHS funding, immigration and climate change. The worsening state of the UK economy has dominated the Tory leadership campaign In one testy exchange, Ms Truss disagreed with an audience member who expressed concerns about debt that would be incurred by the foreign secretary's tax plans. Ms Truss said in response that ""trying to balance the books prematurely is actually counterproductive"" and growing the economy was more important. Asked if she was happy with the answer, the Conservative member said she was not. She told Ms Truss that what former Tory prime minister Margaret Thatcher ""believed in was sound money"", adding ""this is not sound economics"". Liz Truss insisted her regional pay policy was ""misrepresented by various people"" Ms Truss was also put on the back foot by programme host Kay Burley, who repeatedly asked the foreign secretary if hernow-scrapped proposal to link public sector pay to local living costswas ""a mistake"". But Ms Truss resisted such an admission, and instead insisted her regional pay policy was ""misrepresented by various people"". At times, Mr Sunak looked uncomfortable when pressed by Ms Burley, too. She asked how he felt about so many former cabinet colleagues - including Nadhim Zahawi, Ben Wallace and Sajid Javid - backing Ms Truss's campaign and not his. ""Plenty of people who have sat around the cabinet table also support me,"" Mr Sunak said, highlighting Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab as one of his supporters. On whether there was nothing he could do about a recession, Mr Sunak said: ""Of course, there is, of course."" He said Ms Truss was wrong to suggest the tax burden was causing the recession, pointing instead to inflation. In other parts of the TV programme,Ms Truss: said she wanted to encourage doctors who came out of retirement to help the NHS during the pandemic ""to come back into the profession"" refused to say whether she would suspend Boris Johnson as a Tory MP if he was found to have lied to Parliament insisted she has nothing to hide, telling the audience ""there are no skeletons in my closet"" AndMr Sunak: insisted he would ""fight incredibly hard 'til the last day"" of the leadership campaign and not quit before results day said an ""enormous difference"" can be made between now and next winter to reduce the UK's dependence on Russian energy defended an old video where he claimed not to have any working-class friends, saying ""we all say silly things when we are younger"" Speaking after the debate, Labour shadow minister without portfolio Conor McGinn said whichever candidate won their ""low-growth, low-wage plans"" would not fix the economic crisis. ""The two continuity candidates have no answers to sky-high inflation, rocketing energy bills and the lengthy recession the Bank of England has warned is on the horizon,"" he said. Asked about energy bills on Friday morning, Ms Truss acknowledged it was ""going to be a tough winter"" and pledged to release reserves of gas in the North Sea, as well as supporting fracking and nuclear power.

Alex Jones must pay $4m for Sandy Hook hoax claims,"This video can not be played Watch as Alex Jones is told his text messages were sent to opposing lawyers by mistake Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has been ordered to pay $4.1m (Â£3.3m) in damages after falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax. The parents of a victim have sought at least $150m in the Texas defamation trial against the Infowars founder. They said they endured harassment and emotional distress because of the right-wing host's misinformation. Twenty children and six adults were shot dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The jury in the city of Austin decided compensatory damages on Thursday, and must still determine any punitive damages. BACKGROUND:Sandy Hook: What happened that day LEGAL CASE:Sandy Hook parents sue for defamation Jones - who was not in court when the outcome was announced - has repeatedly argued that the shooting was a hoax organised by the government in order to strip Americans of gun ownership rights, and that the parents of the dead children were ""crisis actors"". He has already lost a series of defamation cases brought by parents of the victims by default after failing to produce documents and testimony. But this is the first in which financial damages were agreed by a jury. The case was brought by Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin, the separated parents of six-year-old Jesse Lewis, who died in the school shooting. Ahead of Thursday's decision, a lawyer for the plaintiffs revealed that Jones' lawyer had inadvertently sent him two years of texts from his client's phone. The attorney said a congressional panel investigating last year's US Capitol riot had already requested access to the messages. The committee has said Jones helped organise a rally that took place just before the riot. Despite retracting his claims about Sandy Hook, Jones has continued to use his platform to attack jurors and the judge in this case. Jesse Lewis, six, was killed at Sandy Hook He also claimed he was bankrupt despite evidence that his companies were earning about $800,000 a day selling diet supplements, gun paraphernalia and survivalist equipment. During the emotionally charged two-week trial, Jones portrayed the case as an attack on his free speech rights under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. ""Speech is free, but lies you have to pay for,"" lawyers for the families countered in their opening arguments. Testifying on Wednesday, Jones acknowledged the Sandy Hook attack was ""100% real"" and apologised for having ""hurt these people's feelings"". But in her testimony, Mrs Lewis addressed Jones in court, saying: ""Jesse was realâ¦ I'm a real mom."" She went on to say it is ""incredible to me that we have to do this"". ""That we have to implore you - not just implore you, punish you - to get you to stop lying,"" she continued, adding: ""It is surreal what is going on in here."" Mr Heslin said that Jones' lies ""tarnished the honour and legacy"" of his son, adding that he had gone through nearly 10 years of ""hell"" since the attack. According to lawyers for the parents, they were forced to hire private security for the trial out of concern that followers of Jones could seek to harm them. The parents said Jones had made their lives ""hell"" One forensic psychiatrist testified that the parents were suffering from ""complex post-traumatic stress disorder"" similar to what battlefield soldiers or victims of child abuse endure. Lawyers for the parents accused Jones of trying to hide evidence, and argued that he had committed perjury when he denied sending messages related to the Sandy Hook attack. Jones' Infowars parent company, Free Speech Systems LLC, declared bankruptcy last week. The outlet has been banned by YouTube, Spotify and Twitter for hate speech, but continues to operate. Other wild conspiracies pushed by Jones include that the US government is creating floods and tornados as ""weather weapons"" and that chemicals in drinking water are making frogs homosexual. Lawyer Mark Banston, who represented the parents in the case, told reporters outside court on Thursday that his clients were not disappointed with the sum awarded by the jury. ""We aren't done folks,"" the attorney was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. ""We knew coming into this case it was necessary to shoot for the moon to get the jury to understand we were serious and passionate. After tomorrow, he's going to owe a lot more.""

Starmer breached MPs' code of conduct eight times,"Sir Keir Starmer has been found to have breached the MPs' code of conduct by failing to register eight interests on time, including gifts from football teams and the sale of a plot of land. The standards commissioner launched an investigation in June after complaints the Labour leader had been late to register income and hospitality. Kathryn Stone said the breaches were ""minor and/or inadvertent"". A Labour spokesperson said Sir Keir had apologised for the errors. The commissioner initially began to investigate after complaints Sir Keir had failed to register three instances of income and hospitality and then found four further instances of late entries. When writing to Ms Stone to ""offer explanation, apology and reassurances that measures had been put in place to prevent any reoccurrence"", Sir Keir also raised another instance of the sale of a plot of land that exceeded the Â£100,000 threshold for registration to the House authorities. She said that although he said ""he was waiting for the sale to complete so he could register the correct value"", she decided to include it in her report. Â Under the House of Commons' Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament MPs are required to register interests within 28 days. Gifts and payments received by MPs are regularly published fortnightly in theRegister of Members' Financial Interests,external. Ms Stone said the eight breaches ""were minor and/or inadvertent"", and ""there was no attempt to mislead"". But she has asked Sir Keir to meet the registrar of members' financial interests to discuss his obligations within Parliamentary rules - which he will do on on 25 August. In a letter to Ms Stone, the Labour leader wrote that the late declarations were the ""result of an administrative error within my office"" and said he took full responsibility and apologised. A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""Keir Starmer takes his responsibilities to the Register very seriously and has apologised to the Commissioner for this inadvertent error. ""He has assured the Commissioner that his office processes have been reviewed to ensure this doesn't happen again."" Speaking at the time the investigation was launched Sir Keir had said he was ""absolutely confident"" he had not broken the MPs' code of conduct. Among the interests declared late by Sir Keir was an Â£18,450 advance from publisher HarperCollins in April for a book he is writing. He has pledged to donate the sum, which was declared a day late, to charitable causes while royalties for two legal books were also delayed in being registered. Sir Keir also received a directors' box for two people at Crystal Palace worth Â£720, when they beat his club Arsenal 3-0 on 4 April, but this was not registered until 5 May. And he received four tickets for Watford vs Arsenal, worth a total of Â£1,416, for their 6 March match - which were registered on 6 May. Just Eat gave tickets to staff for the Taste of London festival and the British Kebab awards in October, but these were not declared until 23 December. Outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson was found by the standards commissioner to have breached the rules on late declarations in 2018 and 2019.

Pig farmers fear for industry over spiralling costs,"A County Tyrone pig farmer has warned he is one of many considering leaving the industry, if costs don't come down significantly before winter. Roger Johnston is used to fluctuating prices, but said this year is different. ""This past three, four months, we've probably made record losses,"" he said. In June, theNational Farmers Union said farmers struggling with soaring costs are being forced to cut back on their food production. Mr Johnston said on top of staffing challenges post-Brexit and rising energy costs, his grain costs had doubled in a within a month. Feed costs make up about two-thirds of outgoings. He added that rising energy costs have had a real impact, with more than 200 breeding sows and thousands of piglets each year to house. Labour shortage human disaster for pig farms - NFU Tesco gives Â£6.6m to pig producers following plea ""We've had challenge after challenge, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought things to a different level with grain costs doubling within a month. ""About 20% of the UK herd has actually gone from going out of business,"" he added. ""So it's been very, very bad and the worst we've ever seen in financial losses. ""It's not even just with the feed side of things, everything's gone up."" Roger Johnston has 200 breeding sows on his farm Industry leaders have called for more help, as farmers also try to recoup recent losses. ""Farmers here are very resilient,"" said Deirdre McIvor, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Pork and Bacon Forum. ""They take action to try and be innovative to address any problem themselves. But this is a problem for which they just have no answer. ""These are wider issues that are out there, and we desperately need support. ""The end result for the consumer is there will be no locally produced product on the shelves ultimately, if things go to their worst endgame."" The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said it recently delivered a Pig Sector Support Scheme and has no plans at this point in time for further financial support. The forum has called on retailers to help as well. ""There's not been any sufficient increase in returns coming back up the supply chain from the retailers. ""All in all, it threatens a very, very bleak picture for the industry moving forward. ""We need strong intervention and support from government at this time to try and see us through, otherwise our industry could disappear."" Roger Johnston's farm is near Lough Neagh Grain prices have recently started to come down. But after 18 months of losses, farmers like Mr Johnston are not seeing that change having an impact on their businesses yet. ""I still think to myself: 'What am I doing here, getting up every morning, seven days a week to go and look after the animals?' ""We do have a passion for the work, but there's only so much I can do. I still need to pay my mortgage and put food on my table. ""If I can't do that with the business, I'll have to close it down.""

"Rise in overseas medics is risk to NHS, says unionBBC research shows one-in-three new doctors in England last year came from outside the UK and EU.UK","The BMA doctors' union said government must do more to reduce reliance on foreign medics The NHS in England is increasingly reliant on doctors and nurses recruited from outside the UK and EU, analysis has found. Some 34% of doctors joining the health service last year came from overseas, a rise from 18% in 2014. The government said overseas recruitment had always been part of its strategy. But unions have warned it is an unsustainable way of recruiting in the long-term. A total of 39,558 domestically trained doctors and nurses joined the NHS in 2020-21, which is just over 3,200 more than in 2014-15. But UK medics have been occupying a decreasing proportion of the overall 1.35 million workforce during that period. The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed workforce data provided by NHS Digital from 2015 to 2021. That analysis found: The share of UK doctors joining the health service had fallen from 69% in 2015 to 58% last year. Over the same period, the share of new UK nurses fell from 74% to 61% The share of doctors recruited from outside of the UK and the EU rose from 18% to 34% while the share of nurses rose from 7% to 34% Patricia Marquis, Royal College of Nursing (RCN) director for England, said ministers must do more to reduce the ""disproportionate reliance"" on international recruits. The government is funding an additional 1,500 undergraduate medical school places each year for domestic students in England - a 25% increase over three years. However, last week a report by MPs concluded the large number of unfilled NHS job vacancies, about 110,000 in total, was posing a serious risk to patient safety. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said it was ""high time for the government to commit to a fully-funded, long-term workforce plan for the NHS"" to tackle ""chronic workforce shortages"". Radiologist Sumaira Babar says she has no plans to leave the UK having moved to Huddersfield in October Consultant radiologist Sumaira Babar is just one of the growing proportion to join the NHS from overseas. She moved from Karachi in Pakistan to Huddersfield with her young family last October. ""I thought why not, it'll be an adventure, it'd be something different,"" she said. ""It'll be a change from what I'm used to. It will be good for the children as well. They'll be exposed to a new culture, new environment, you know, they learn how the world works."" Yet the British Medical Association said that while the NHS is recruiting more people from abroad it also faced a challenge retaining them. It cited ""punishing workloads"" and the cost of visas. Doctors have told the BBC that many are training in the UK before moving abroad where immigration laws and working conditions are more favourable. The percentage of doctors leaving the NHS from non-UK and EU countries also rose from 15% in 2015 to 25% in 2021. Dr Amit Kochhar, its international committee deputy chair, said medical graduates were charged up to Â£2,400 to apply for indefinite leave to remain, with each of their dependants facing the same fee. Dr Hajra Usmani, left, said she knew of many overseas doctors who had left the NHS That was a problem for Dr Hajra Usmani, who worked in the NHS for 18 years but decided to leave her post as an A&E consultant in Frimley, Surrey, last year. The mother-of-two, aged 46, who is now working in a similar role in Medina, Saudi Arabia, said she was deterred by visa costs to bring her elderly parents to England. ""My mum has been diagnosed with severe dementia and my dad has cognitive impairment,"" she said. ""I cannot leave them on their own. ""They would have had to pay a surcharge to the NHS, but I stopped the application last September because it was coming up to Â£6,000 for the visas plus the legal fees before the Home Office would even consider the applications. ""We're now in Saudi Arabia where they have visa extensions for dependents."" Dr Usmani said she knew of many fellow doctors taking a similar path. ""Most of my colleagues here are ex-UK trained NHS staff. This is an exodus. The NHS is crumbling at the moment."" From within the EU, the share of recruits joining England's NHS each year fell from 11% in 2015 to 6% last year.

""Post-Covid, we've also lost quite a few colleagues. We're facing an exodus.""

UK hiring slowing down as recession looms,"Candidates Hiring in the UK has slowed amidst uncertainty over the economy, according to a report. July saw the slowest increase in the number of permanent jobs filled for 17 months. KPMG said recruiters are becoming more tentative over hiring new staff. The consultancy added that ongoing skills shortages, a drop in foreign workers and hesitancy from candidates to move jobs had all led to a tighter supply of suitable staff. The slowing down of the hiring spree that followed the pandemic comes as the Bank of England warned the UK will fall into recession in the final quarter of this year. The bank raised interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75%, in a bid to curb soaring prices. The jobs report by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation suggested rising operating costs and uncertainty over the UK's economic outlook is leading some firms to put the brakes on recruitment, at least for permanent roles. But the soaring cost of living and tougher competition for a smaller pool of qualified candidates has also meant that the rate of starting pay continued to rise in July. ""The trend of uncertainty in the UK jobs market of the last few months continues,"" said KPMG's Claire Warnes. ""Employers are rightly hesitant about their hiring plans... So, a focus on up-skilling existing workers and attracting talent, remains absolutely essential for UK business to play its part in driving forward the economy."" It is still a good time to be a jobseeker - the number of vacancies advertised has continued to grow. Although the fastest rate of growth in vacancies was for temporary posts in the hospitality sector. ""Given the outlook being painted by the Bank of England... one might wonder why anyone would consider switching jobs at all,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. ""Consumer confidence is already at record lows, and prices look set to rise further, so business and consumers are likely to face further challenges. Let's see what the government has in mind to help navigate us through the winter months."" The Bank of England said it expects the economy to shrink in the final three months of this year, and keep shrinking until the end of 2023, signalling the longest downturn for the UK economy since the 2008 financial crisis. Jeevun Sandher, economist at Kings College London said ""those who are able and willing to work are, generally, working. That is great news"". But he added: ""The problem we face is that having a job does not mean you will earn enough to escape poverty. Even before this cost-of-living crisis, almost 70% of adults in poverty lived in working households. That has gotten significantly worse - half of us are now cutting back on food."" He added that workers should be asking for ""the highest salaries possible"". More than a third cut back on food and essentials When will interest rates fall?

"UK will fall into recession this year, warns Bank","This video can not be played In a 'blunt message"" the Bank of England governor warns interest rates may have to rise even higher The Bank of England has warned the UK will fall into recession as it raised interest rates by the most in 27 years. The economy is forecast to shrink in the last three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. Interest rates rose to 1.75% as the Bank battles to stem soaring prices, with inflation now set to hit over 13%. Governor Andrew Bailey said he knew the cost of living squeeze was difficult but if it didn't raise interest rates it would get ""even worse"". The main reason for high inflation and low growth is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A typical household will be paying almost Â£300 a month for their energy by October, the Bank warned. The expected recession would be the longest downturn since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse, bringing lending to a halt. The slump is not set to be as deep as 14 years ago but may last just as long. The Bank's governor Andrew Bailey said he had ""huge sympathy and huge understanding for those who are struggling most"" with the cost of living. ""I know that they will feel, 'Well, why have you raised interest rates today, doesn't that make it worse from that perspective in terms of consumption?', I'm afraid my answer to that is, it doesn't because I'm afraid the alternative is even worse in terms of persistent inflation."" Increasing interest rates is one way to try and control inflation as it raises borrowing costs and should encourage people to borrow and spend less. It can also encourage people to save more. However, many households will be squeezed further following the interest rate rise including some mortgage-holders. How does an interest rate rise affect me? 'Rate rise means I owe Â£250 a month more on loans' Did the Bank of England make the right call? What is a recession and how could it affect me? Now rates have gone up to 1.75%, homeowners on a typical tracker mortgage will have to pay about Â£52 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages will see a Â£59 increase. It means tracker mortgage holders could be paying about Â£167 more a month compared to pre-December 2021, with variable mortgage holders paying up to Â£132 more. Interest rates have risen six times in a row since the end of last year. Higher interest rates also mean higher charges on things like credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Patrick Reid, a business owner in London, owesÂ£25,000 on credit cards and loans and fears an interest rate rise will cost him. Patrick Reid owes Â£25,000 in loans and credit cards ""At present I repay around Â£1,800 a month but I have worked out that I will conservatively need to pay another Â£250 a month to keep up with the debts,"" he said. ""I will simply have to tighten my belt and be extra cautious in my spending, which means all of those non-essential items will be cut from my budget."" Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said ""staggeringly"" high inflation was ""going to hit low income families hard"". ""Many took on credit to pay their bills and are falling behind on their payments. This will be much harder to pay off with higher interest rates putting more families in financial peril."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the cost of living support announced so far was ""clearly not enough"". ""There will be families and pensioners across the country waking up this morning, reading the news, who are absolutely terrified because a juggernaut is heading [their] way which will smash through family finances,"" he said. He said a Labour government would reduce VAT on energy bills, abolish the tax relief currently offered to oil and gas companies who invest, and provide support to help people retrofit their homes to make them more energy efficient. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said he was confident the action the government was taking meant it could overcome the economic challenges. Both Mr Zahawi and Boris Johnson have also been criticised by Labour for being on holiday when the Bank detailed its gloomy outlook. Mr Zahawi insisted he was still working and had a call with Governor Andrew Bailey after the interest rate announcement. ""For me, like I'm sure lots of others, there is no such thing as a holiday and not working. I never had that in the private sector, not in government,"" he said. He added: ""The privilege and responsibility of public service means that you never get to switch off, that's why I have had calls and briefings every day and continue to do so."" It is the most piercing of warning sirens set off by the Bank of England. Announcing the largest rate rise in more than a quarter of a century in an attempt to temper even higher peaks in inflation of an incredible 13% is what the Bank of England actually did. But it is its prediction of a recession as long as the great financial crisis and as deep as that seen in the early 1990s that is the big shock here. This is a proper full fat recession at the same time as the inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high. It is a textbook example of the combination of a stagnating economy and high inflation - stagflation. It obviously will raise questions as to why rates are being hiked into a recession at a time when consumers are already pulling back from spending. Read more from Faisal here Energy bills have already risen sharply this year, squeezing household incomes and leading to slower growth for the UK economy. Russia has reduced supplies to Europe as it wages war in Ukraine and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. As well as energy, households have been hit by higher petrol and diesel costs and food prices. The Bank warned UK economic growth was already slowing, adding: ""The latest rise in gas prices has led to another significant deterioration in the outlook for the UK and the rest of Europe"". The rate of inflation is expected to stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, the Bank said. It will eventually return to the Bank's 2% target the following year.

""We've had a domestic shock, we've had a shrinkage in the labour force over the last two years or so,"" he said. ""The first thing that businesses want to talk to me about is the problems they're having hiring people... They're also saying to us, actually they're not finding it difficult to raise prices at the moment. Now we think that can't go on."" He also warned against high pay rises, saying this would make inflation worse and ""it's the people who are least well off who are worse affected because they don't have the bargaining power"". However, Attorney General Suella Braverman said interest rates ""should have been raised a long time ago"". In response, Mr Bailey said: ""If you go back two years... given the situation we were facing at that point in the context of Covid, in the context of the labour market, the idea that at that point we would have tightened monetary policy, you know I don't remember there were many people saying that."" UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at 9.4%, which is the highest level for more than 40 years. But the Bank has warned it could peak at more than 13% and stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, before eventually returning to the Bank's 2% target in 2024. The main reason for high inflation and low growth is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Households have also been hit by higher petrol, diesel and food costs. Real post-tax household incomes - after taking account of inflation - are forecast to fall this year and next year. Andrew Sentance, who was a member of the Bank's rates-setting committee during the 2008 financial crisis, told BBC Breakfast: ""We're going to see a couple of yearsâ¦ when household incomes in real terms are squeezed much more severely than we've seen in other times since the Second World War."" The economy is forecast to shrink in the final three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. The expected recession would be the longest downturn since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse, bringing lending to a halt. The slump is not set to be as deep as 14 years ago but may last just as long. Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the economic situation would mean there would have to be ""many more billions to support households"" and more money for public services. He told the BBC that the Tory leadership candidates, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, should be focused on tackling inflation rather than tax cuts. Mr Johnson rejected the idea tax cuts could be funded in part by ""fiscal headroom"". ""What [the leadership candidates are] talking about is that the Office for Budget Responsibility [in March] said we'd be borrowing about Â£30bn less than we absolutely could to meet the fiscal target of a balanced current budget in a few years' time,"" he said. But he added that this was ""highly uncertain"" and now ""massively out of date"", given the economy was heading for recession. The worsening state of the UK economydominated a Sky News TV debate between the two Conservative leadership candidates on Thursday. Former Chancellor Mr Sunak, who has trailed Ms Truss in recent polls, has repeatedly said he would prioritise bringing inflation down before cutting taxes if he became prime minister. This video can not be played Watch: Business-as-usual policies won't stop recession, Liz Truss says Meanwhile, Ms Truss has pledged a package of tax cuts worth Â£30bn soon after she enters office, which Mr Sunak has argued would increase inflation and the cost of borrowing. But Ms Truss said cutting taxes would stimulate economic growth and prevent a recession. Ms Truss, who has been critical of the Bank, has suggested she is considering taking more control over it if she becomes prime minister. Mr Bailey said the Bank's independence was ""critically important"" and he did not think there was a ""large desire"" in the country to question this. However, he added he was happy to discuss the issue with the new government. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said the cost of living support measures announced by the government so far were ""clearly not enough"". ""There will be families and pensioners across the country waking up this morning, reading the news, who are absolutely terrified because a juggernaut is heading [their] way which will smash through family finances,"" the shadow work and pensions secretary told the BBC.

But before we go
here's a recap of today's key developments:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Thomas Spender, Yvette Tan, Melissa Zhu, Nathan Williams, Jack Burgess and Sam Hancock. Let's head to Taiwan, where the defence ministry has spoken out
about the action of the Chinese military. In a statement, officials condemned Chinese vessels crossing the
Taiwan Strait and ""harassing"" the island's surrounding waters and air
space, Reuters reports. Chinese aircraft had crossed the median line a total of 68 times
by 17:00 local time (10:00 BST), the ministry reportedly said - before warning
its military would defend Taiwan's national security ""with firm
action"". It added China had ""seriously damaged"" the status quo
of the strait, which separates the island of Taiwan and mainland China. Reality Check There have been some more cyber-attacks reported against
official websites in Taiwan. The Ministry of National Defence was one target, as well as the
Environment Protection Bureau in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan,
according to local media. The Defence Ministry's website went offline
temporarily and on the environment bureau's website, the cyber-attackers put up
five Chinese national flags. The website of Taiwan's presidential office, the Foreign
Ministry and the governing party have all been targeted this week. Taiwan says the identities of
those responsible for the latest attacks remains unknown. We reported earlier on Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu'sinterview with the BBC- and here's some more. Refusing to apologise for US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's brief but controversial trip to the island, Wu said visits from high profile figures are key to ""raise the profile of Taiwan and to allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". ""China has long been trying to isolate Taiwan internationally,"" he added. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control again. One poll suggests most Taiwanese are not
confident that the US would help defend the island. Some78.4%of those polled said they werenot at allornot very confidentthat theUS would provide assistance to defend
Taiwan. While 19.2% of the 19,500 questioned - between Wednesday and Friday - said
they were very or somewhat confident. The rest had no opinion. The share of Taiwanese people who believe that the US military
would provide support against a Chinese invasion appears to have been dropping
for some time. A poll in March, by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF)
think tank, found that 55.9% of more than a thousand respondents did
not believe at all or did not fully believe that the US would defend Taiwan if
China invaded. While 34.5% somewhat or fully believed it would. This was a sharp drop from just six months before - prior to the
Ukraine war - when a similar survey by TPOF found that 65% believed the US
would send troops to defend Taiwan and only 29% did not think it would. Reality Check Taipei's international airport was not hit by a missile Misleading information has been circulating in recent days as
tensions have surged. Reports emerged incorrectly claiming that the international
airport near Taiwanâs capital, Taipei, was hit by a missile on 2 August. But Taiwanâs Ministry of National Defencedenied this had happened,,externaland
pointed out the airport was working normally. There've also been claims in some Chinese-language media that
Taiwan has cancelled all leave for its military. But as yet this has not
happened, although personnel have been asked to remain ""on alert."" There's also been misleading video shared claiming to show
Chinese warships in the waters around Taiwan in recent days. But it uses old
footage of events held to mark the 73rd anniversary of the Chinese navy in
April. Similarly, social media users
have shared video said to show a recent Chinese military exercise, which was
actually a Taiwanese drill from nearly two years ago. Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan has left Joe Biden with a serious headache as he tries to manage ties with America's biggest global rival. The relationship between China and the United States was founded on deliberate ambiguity over Taiwan. Maintaining the status quo - in which Beijing says Taiwan is part of China, Taiwan says it's independent, the US says it's not but treats it like an ally, and no one makes aggressive moves on their claims - has been the least-worst option of keeping a tenuous peace. But the US House Speaker has shone a harsh spotlight on the contradictions of this arrangement - which had already become strained. Read more Beijing has announced it is halting key climate talks with the US, and co-operation across multiple other areas. China and America unveiled a climate pact at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year. China's foreign ministry says the country is also suspending dialogue between senior military commanders, talks over cross-border crime prevention and repatriating illegal migrants. All this follows US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan which angered China. Penny Wong, Australia's foreign minister, has had her say on the situation in Taiwan. Speaking to reporters in Cambodia, she says Australia is ""deeply concerned"" about China's launch of ballistic missiles into waters around Taiwan's coastline. She also brands the military drills encircling the island ""disproportionate and destabilising"". Wong joins the likes of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who've both expressed concern over China's actions. In its own statement, Australiaâs foreign ministry adds: This is a serious matter for the region, including for our close strategic partner, Japan. Australia shares the regionâs concerns about this escalating military activity, especially the risks of miscalculation.  We urge restraint and de-escalation. It is in all our interests to have a region at peace and not in conflict. Australia does not want to see any unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. There is no change to Australia's bipartisan One China policy.  Rupert Wingfield-HayesReporting from Taiwan That's how a Taiwanese retired navy captain Lu Li-Shin described
the military drills taking place around the island. ""What China is engaged in is psychological warfare,""
he said. ""All the missiles being fired, all the explosions - it's to
show China's domestic audience how tough Beijing is being while at the same
time intimidating the people of Taiwan."" It is nevertheless an impressive show and illustrates how far
China's military has come in the last two decades. Captain Lu says China's next step might be to fire a missile
over Taiwan. It appears that might have happened on Thursday - Japanese
officials suspect it did - but China is yet to confirm it. If that's true, this is something China has never done before. As the graphic shows, several of the zones where China has been conducting military exercises verge into Taiwan's territorial waters. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command claims the sea combat drills are for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces. Chinese jets have also been spotted flying above the mainland's Pingtan island - which lies across the water from northern Taiwan and is one of the closest points to Taiwan. This video can not be played Two fishermen have spoken about the impact China's military drills are having on their daily lives. One said the atmosphere this time was ""abnormal"" while another insisted they had to keep using Taiwan waters or they would not survive. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command said that it continued military exercises in the north, southwest and east of Taiwan Island as planned on Friday. The air and sea combat drills were for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces, it said in a post on Weibo, the Chinese social media site. There's more from the US now, where areport in the Washington Post,externalreveals
China's ambassador to the US was called to the White House yesterday. ""After Chinaâs actions overnight, we summoned [Peopleâs
Republic of China] Ambassador Qin Gang to the White House to dÃ©marche him about
the PRCâs provocative actions,"" White House spokesman John Kirby says in a
statement provided to the newspaper. A dÃ©marche is a protest lodged through diplomatic channels. Kirby adds that the Biden administration condemned the PRCâs
military actions, ""which are irresponsible and at odds with our
long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait"". The meeting was between Kurt Campbell, US President Joe Biden's
Asia tsar, and Qin, according to a White House official who spoke to the Post
anonymously. News of the meeting - which took place on Thursday - came
shortly after Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, wassanctioned by China for her visit to
Taiwan. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting in English and Japanese - affirming the values Taiwan shares with democratic countries and asking the international community to ""halt escalation of the security situation"". In English, she said China's military threat was ""irresponsible to Taiwan and the international community"". Taiwan's government and military are closely monitoring China's military drills and are ready to respond as necessary, she said. Allow Twitter content?

China's foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying did not offer a comment when asked about whether missiles fired by China yesterday passed above Taiwan. The Japanese embassy in Washington said it believed four missiles fired by China had passed over the island's capital Taipei. But Hua said: ""I have no comment. Pelosi triggered the current tensions.

It is the diplomatic acknowledgement of China's position that there is only one Chinese government. Under the policy, the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. TheOne China policyis a key cornerstone of Sino-US relations. It is also a fundamental bedrock of Chinese policy-making and diplomacy. However, it is distinct from theOne China principle- referred to in the Chinese statement sanctioning Pelosi - whereby China insists Taiwan is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day. The US policy is not an endorsement of Beijing's position and indeed as part of the policy, Washington maintains a""robust unofficial"" relationship with Taiwan,external, including continued arms sales to the island so that it can defend itself. Read more Chinese state media has not yet released information about
Friday's military drill. A video was published showing Chinese army medics conducting a
drill for sending wounded soldiers by a high speed train with surgery facilities. On China's Twitter-like Weibo the hashtag ""second day of
military drill"" is being promoted and people are asking: ""What's for
today?"" and ""Why so quiet today?"" In general, the feeling on Chinese social media is mixed. Some
people are impressed by the drills so far, others seem disappointed by what
they've seen. China has announced it is sanctioning US Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her immediate family over her visit to Taiwan. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Pelosi had ""seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, seriously damaged China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampled on the one-China principle, and seriously threatened peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"", according to a statement. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Â© 2025 BBC.

But before we go
here's a recap of today's key developments:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Thomas Spender, Yvette Tan, Melissa Zhu, Nathan Williams, Jack Burgess and Sam Hancock. Let's head to Taiwan, where the defence ministry has spoken out
about the action of the Chinese military. In a statement, officials condemned Chinese vessels crossing the
Taiwan Strait and ""harassing"" the island's surrounding waters and air
space, Reuters reports. Chinese aircraft had crossed the median line a total of 68 times
by 17:00 local time (10:00 BST), the ministry reportedly said - before warning
its military would defend Taiwan's national security ""with firm
action"". It added China had ""seriously damaged"" the status quo
of the strait, which separates the island of Taiwan and mainland China. Reality Check There have been some more cyber-attacks reported against
official websites in Taiwan. The Ministry of National Defence was one target, as well as the
Environment Protection Bureau in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan,
according to local media. The Defence Ministry's website went offline
temporarily and on the environment bureau's website, the cyber-attackers put up
five Chinese national flags. The website of Taiwan's presidential office, the Foreign
Ministry and the governing party have all been targeted this week. Taiwan says the identities of
those responsible for the latest attacks remains unknown. We reported earlier on Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu'sinterview with the BBC- and here's some more. Refusing to apologise for US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's brief but controversial trip to the island, Wu said visits from high profile figures are key to ""raise the profile of Taiwan and to allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". ""China has long been trying to isolate Taiwan internationally,"" he added. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control again. One poll suggests most Taiwanese are not
confident that the US would help defend the island. Some78.4%of those polled said they werenot at allornot very confidentthat theUS would provide assistance to defend
Taiwan. While 19.2% of the 19,500 questioned - between Wednesday and Friday - said
they were very or somewhat confident. The rest had no opinion. The share of Taiwanese people who believe that the US military
would provide support against a Chinese invasion appears to have been dropping
for some time. A poll in March, by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF)
think tank, found that 55.9% of more than a thousand respondents did
not believe at all or did not fully believe that the US would defend Taiwan if
China invaded. While 34.5% somewhat or fully believed it would. This was a sharp drop from just six months before - prior to the
Ukraine war - when a similar survey by TPOF found that 65% believed the US
would send troops to defend Taiwan and only 29% did not think it would. Reality Check Taipei's international airport was not hit by a missile Misleading information has been circulating in recent days as
tensions have surged. Reports emerged incorrectly claiming that the international
airport near Taiwanâs capital, Taipei, was hit by a missile on 2 August. But Taiwanâs Ministry of National Defencedenied this had happened,,externaland
pointed out the airport was working normally. There've also been claims in some Chinese-language media that
Taiwan has cancelled all leave for its military. But as yet this has not
happened, although personnel have been asked to remain ""on alert."" There's also been misleading video shared claiming to show
Chinese warships in the waters around Taiwan in recent days. But it uses old
footage of events held to mark the 73rd anniversary of the Chinese navy in
April. Similarly, social media users
have shared video said to show a recent Chinese military exercise, which was
actually a Taiwanese drill from nearly two years ago. Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan has left Joe Biden with a serious headache as he tries to manage ties with America's biggest global rival. The relationship between China and the United States was founded on deliberate ambiguity over Taiwan. Maintaining the status quo - in which Beijing says Taiwan is part of China, Taiwan says it's independent, the US says it's not but treats it like an ally, and no one makes aggressive moves on their claims - has been the least-worst option of keeping a tenuous peace. But the US House Speaker has shone a harsh spotlight on the contradictions of this arrangement - which had already become strained. Read more Beijing has announced it is halting key climate talks with the US, and co-operation across multiple other areas. China and America unveiled a climate pact at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year. China's foreign ministry says the country is also suspending dialogue between senior military commanders, talks over cross-border crime prevention and repatriating illegal migrants. All this follows US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan which angered China. Penny Wong, Australia's foreign minister, has had her say on the situation in Taiwan. Speaking to reporters in Cambodia, she says Australia is ""deeply concerned"" about China's launch of ballistic missiles into waters around Taiwan's coastline.

Wong joins the likes of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who've both expressed concern over China's actions. In its own statement, Australiaâs foreign ministry adds: This is a serious matter for the region, including for our close strategic partner, Japan. Australia shares the regionâs concerns about this escalating military activity, especially the risks of miscalculation.  We urge restraint and de-escalation. It is in all our interests to have a region at peace and not in conflict. Australia does not want to see any unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. There is no change to Australia's bipartisan One China policy.  Rupert Wingfield-HayesReporting from Taiwan That's how a Taiwanese retired navy captain Lu Li-Shin described
the military drills taking place around the island. ""What China is engaged in is psychological warfare,""
he said. ""All the missiles being fired, all the explosions - it's to
show China's domestic audience how tough Beijing is being while at the same
time intimidating the people of Taiwan."" It is nevertheless an impressive show and illustrates how far
China's military has come in the last two decades. Captain Lu says China's next step might be to fire a missile
over Taiwan. It appears that might have happened on Thursday - Japanese
officials suspect it did - but China is yet to confirm it. If that's true, this is something China has never done before. As the graphic shows, several of the zones where China has been conducting military exercises verge into Taiwan's territorial waters. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command claims the sea combat drills are for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces. Chinese jets have also been spotted flying above the mainland's Pingtan island - which lies across the water from northern Taiwan and is one of the closest points to Taiwan. This video can not be played Two fishermen have spoken about the impact China's military drills are having on their daily lives. One said the atmosphere this time was ""abnormal"" while another insisted they had to keep using Taiwan waters or they would not survive. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command said that it continued military exercises in the north, southwest and east of Taiwan Island as planned on Friday. The air and sea combat drills were for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces, it said in a post on Weibo, the Chinese social media site. There's more from the US now, where areport in the Washington Post,externalreveals
China's ambassador to the US was called to the White House yesterday. ""After Chinaâs actions overnight, we summoned [Peopleâs
Republic of China] Ambassador Qin Gang to the White House to dÃ©marche him about
the PRCâs provocative actions,"" White House spokesman John Kirby says in a
statement provided to the newspaper. A dÃ©marche is a protest lodged through diplomatic channels. Kirby adds that the Biden administration condemned the PRCâs
military actions, ""which are irresponsible and at odds with our
long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait"". The meeting was between Kurt Campbell, US President Joe Biden's
Asia tsar, and Qin, according to a White House official who spoke to the Post
anonymously. News of the meeting - which took place on Thursday - came
shortly after Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, wassanctioned by China for her visit to
Taiwan. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting in English and Japanese - affirming the values Taiwan shares with democratic countries and asking the international community to ""halt escalation of the security situation"". In English, she said China's military threat was ""irresponsible to Taiwan and the international community"". Taiwan's government and military are closely monitoring China's military drills and are ready to respond as necessary, she said. Allow Twitter content?

He says the military drills are a threat to peace and stability in Asia. China's foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying did not offer a comment when asked about whether missiles fired by China yesterday passed above Taiwan. The Japanese embassy in Washington said it believed four missiles fired by China had passed over the island's capital Taipei. But Hua said: ""I have no comment. Pelosi triggered the current tensions.

It is the diplomatic acknowledgement of China's position that there is only one Chinese government. Under the policy, the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. TheOne China policyis a key cornerstone of Sino-US relations. It is also a fundamental bedrock of Chinese policy-making and diplomacy. However, it is distinct from theOne China principle- referred to in the Chinese statement sanctioning Pelosi - whereby China insists Taiwan is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day. The US policy is not an endorsement of Beijing's position and indeed as part of the policy, Washington maintains a""robust unofficial"" relationship with Taiwan,external, including continued arms sales to the island so that it can defend itself. Read more Chinese state media has not yet released information about
Friday's military drill. A video was published showing Chinese army medics conducting a
drill for sending wounded soldiers by a high speed train with surgery facilities. On China's Twitter-like Weibo the hashtag ""second day of
military drill"" is being promoted and people are asking: ""What's for
today?"" and ""Why so quiet today?"" In general, the feeling on Chinese social media is mixed. Some
people are impressed by the drills so far, others seem disappointed by what
they've seen. China has announced it is sanctioning US Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her immediate family over her visit to Taiwan. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Pelosi had ""seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, seriously damaged China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampled on the one-China principle, and seriously threatened peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"", according to a statement. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Starmer breached MPs' code of conduct eight timesThe Labour leader failed to register eight interests on time, the standards commissioner finds.","Sir Keir Starmer has been found to have breached the MPs' code of conduct by failing to register eight interests on time, including gifts from football teams and the sale of a plot of land. The standards commissioner launched an investigation in June after complaints the Labour leader had been late to register income and hospitality. Kathryn Stone said the breaches were ""minor and/or inadvertent"". A Labour spokesperson said Sir Keir had apologised for the errors. The commissioner initially began to investigate after complaints Sir Keir had failed to register three instances of income and hospitality and then found four further instances of late entries. When writing to Ms Stone to ""offer explanation, apology and reassurances that measures had been put in place to prevent any reoccurrence"", Sir Keir also raised another instance of the sale of a plot of land that exceeded the Â£100,000 threshold for registration to the House authorities. She said that although he said ""he was waiting for the sale to complete so he could register the correct value"", she decided to include it in her report. Â Under the House of Commons' Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament MPs are required to register interests within 28 days. Gifts and payments received by MPs are regularly published fortnightly in theRegister of Members' Financial Interests,external. Ms Stone said the eight breaches ""were minor and/or inadvertent"", and ""there was no attempt to mislead"". But she has asked Sir Keir to meet the registrar of members' financial interests to discuss his obligations within Parliamentary rules - which he will do on on 25 August. In a letter to Ms Stone, the Labour leader wrote that the late declarations were the ""result of an administrative error within my office"" and said he took full responsibility and apologised. A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""Keir Starmer takes his responsibilities to the Register very seriously and has apologised to the Commissioner for this inadvertent error. ""He has assured the Commissioner that his office processes have been reviewed to ensure this doesn't happen again."" Speaking at the time the investigation was launched Sir Keir had said he was ""absolutely confident"" he had not broken the MPs' code of conduct. Among the interests declared late by Sir Keir was an Â£18,450 advance from publisher HarperCollins in April for a book he is writing. He has pledged to donate the sum, which was declared a day late, to charitable causes while royalties for two legal books were also delayed in being registered. Sir Keir also received a directors' box for two people at Crystal Palace worth Â£720, when they beat his club Arsenal 3-0 on 4 April, but this was not registered until 5 May. And he received four tickets for Watford vs Arsenal, worth a total of Â£1,416, for their 6 March match - which were registered on 6 May. Just Eat gave tickets to staff for the Taste of London festival and the British Kebab awards in October, but these were not declared until 23 December. Outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson was found by the standards commissioner to have breached the rules on late declarations in 2018 and 2019.

Hosepipe ban set to come into force,"Berkshire won't be included in any hosepipe ban yet - but customers are being asked to use water wisely A hosepipe ban has come into force in parts of southern England. The move was imposed on Southern Water customers in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight from 17:00 BST. This means that using hosepipes to water gardens, clean cars, fill ornamental ponds and swimming pools will not be allowed. The restrictions are expected to last for three weeks. Similar measures are being introduced across Kent and Sussex after the driest July since 1935. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Southern Water said the decision to introduce the ban - which is the first in England this year - was a ""vital step"" to protect the habitats of the River Test and the River Itchen, where it extracts water. Last month the company saidriver flows were about 25% lowerthan they should be for July. Alison Hoyle, director of risk and compliance at Southern Water, said the ban could be in place for three weeks Alison Hoyle, the company's director of risk and compliance, told the BBC she wanted to remind customers that there would be no restrictions on essential water use. ""We are hoping for substantial rain,"" she said. ""At the moment we're saying we expect [the hosepipe ban] to be three weeks but we will need to monitor this closely depending on rainfall and river levels."" Portsmouth Water is not introducing a hosepipe ban but it urged its customers not to waste water. The firm said it was keeping its position ""under review"" and monitoring the situation ""on a daily basis"". How will you be affected by the hosepipe ban? You can share your thoughts by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Thames Water's customers have also been asked to use water ""wisely"". The company said the next stage of its statutory drought plan would be to introduce a temporary use ban ""which is likely to include hosepipes"". In a statement it added: ""The timing will depend on the amount of water used by our customers, which determines the speed at which reservoir storage declines, and the amount of flow in the rivers, which determines how much water we can take to refill them."" Water is being transferred to Berkshire from north London to stop a hosepipe ban being introduced in the county,Thames Water previously said. At an emergency meeting held last month, the National Drought Group moved England into ""prolonged dry weather"" status - the stage before a drought. InKent and Sussex about one million South East Water customerswill face measures from 12 August. Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

LiveLiveChina to restart drills as Pelosi vows Taiwan won't be isolated5 minutes ago,"Chinese planes and ships have again crossed the median line in the strait between the mainland and Taiwan It comes as China holds its second day of military drills around the island, Beijing's main response to Nancy Pelosi's visit Japan has demanded China cease the drills, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called them an ""unjustified escalation"" Taiwan's foreign minister has told the BBC that Taiwan won't be the ""last piece in [the] Chinese dream of expansionism"" China has not commented on reports it may have fired a missile over Taiwan on Thursday China sees self-ruled Taiwan - which lies 100 miles from the mainland - as a breakaway province that will eventually be under its control Edited by Nathan Williams It's early evening in Taiwan and we'll be pausing our live coverage soon. But before we go
here's a recap of today's key developments:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Thomas Spender, Yvette Tan, Melissa Zhu, Nathan Williams, Jack Burgess and Sam Hancock. Let's head to Taiwan, where the defence ministry has spoken out
about the action of the Chinese military. In a statement, officials condemned Chinese vessels crossing the
Taiwan Strait and ""harassing"" the island's surrounding waters and air
space, Reuters reports. Chinese aircraft had crossed the median line a total of 68 times
by 17:00 local time (10:00 BST), the ministry reportedly said - before warning
its military would defend Taiwan's national security ""with firm
action"". It added China had ""seriously damaged"" the status quo
of the strait, which separates the island of Taiwan and mainland China. Reality Check There have been some more cyber-attacks reported against
official websites in Taiwan. The Ministry of National Defence was one target, as well as the
Environment Protection Bureau in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan,
according to local media. The Defence Ministry's website went offline
temporarily and on the environment bureau's website, the cyber-attackers put up
five Chinese national flags. The website of Taiwan's presidential office, the Foreign
Ministry and the governing party have all been targeted this week. Taiwan says the identities of
those responsible for the latest attacks remains unknown. We reported earlier on Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu'sinterview with the BBC- and here's some more. Refusing to apologise for US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's brief but controversial trip to the island, Wu said visits from high profile figures are key to ""raise the profile of Taiwan and to allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". ""China has long been trying to isolate Taiwan internationally,"" he added. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control again. One poll suggests most Taiwanese are not
confident that the US would help defend the island. Some78.4%of those polled said they werenot at allornot very confidentthat theUS would provide assistance to defend
Taiwan. While 19.2% of the 19,500 questioned - between Wednesday and Friday - said
they were very or somewhat confident. The rest had no opinion. The share of Taiwanese people who believe that the US military
would provide support against a Chinese invasion appears to have been dropping
for some time. A poll in March, by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF)
think tank, found that 55.9% of more than a thousand respondents did
not believe at all or did not fully believe that the US would defend Taiwan if
China invaded. While 34.5% somewhat or fully believed it would. This was a sharp drop from just six months before - prior to the
Ukraine war - when a similar survey by TPOF found that 65% believed the US
would send troops to defend Taiwan and only 29% did not think it would. Reality Check Taipei's international airport was not hit by a missile Misleading information has been circulating in recent days as
tensions have surged. Reports emerged incorrectly claiming that the international
airport near Taiwanâs capital, Taipei, was hit by a missile on 2 August. But Taiwanâs Ministry of National Defencedenied this had happened,,externaland
pointed out the airport was working normally. There've also been claims in some Chinese-language media that
Taiwan has cancelled all leave for its military. But as yet this has not
happened, although personnel have been asked to remain ""on alert."" There's also been misleading video shared claiming to show
Chinese warships in the waters around Taiwan in recent days. But it uses old
footage of events held to mark the 73rd anniversary of the Chinese navy in
April. Similarly, social media users
have shared video said to show a recent Chinese military exercise, which was
actually a Taiwanese drill from nearly two years ago. Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan has left Joe Biden with a serious headache as he tries to manage ties with America's biggest global rival. The relationship between China and the United States was founded on deliberate ambiguity over Taiwan. Maintaining the status quo - in which Beijing says Taiwan is part of China, Taiwan says it's independent, the US says it's not but treats it like an ally, and no one makes aggressive moves on their claims - has been the least-worst option of keeping a tenuous peace. But the US House Speaker has shone a harsh spotlight on the contradictions of this arrangement - which had already become strained. Read more Beijing has announced it is halting key climate talks with the US, and co-operation across multiple other areas. China and America unveiled a climate pact at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year. China's foreign ministry says the country is also suspending dialogue between senior military commanders, talks over cross-border crime prevention and repatriating illegal migrants. All this follows US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan which angered China. Penny Wong, Australia's foreign minister, has had her say on the situation in Taiwan. Speaking to reporters in Cambodia, she says Australia is ""deeply concerned"" about China's launch of ballistic missiles into waters around Taiwan's coastline. She also brands the military drills encircling the island ""disproportionate and destabilising"". Wong joins the likes of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who've both expressed concern over China's actions. In its own statement, Australiaâs foreign ministry adds: This is a serious matter for the region, including for our close strategic partner, Japan. Australia shares the regionâs concerns about this escalating military activity, especially the risks of miscalculation.  We urge restraint and de-escalation. It is in all our interests to have a region at peace and not in conflict. Australia does not want to see any unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. There is no change to Australia's bipartisan One China policy.  Rupert Wingfield-HayesReporting from Taiwan That's how a Taiwanese retired navy captain Lu Li-Shin described
the military drills taking place around the island. ""What China is engaged in is psychological warfare,""
he said. ""All the missiles being fired, all the explosions - it's to
show China's domestic audience how tough Beijing is being while at the same
time intimidating the people of Taiwan."" It is nevertheless an impressive show and illustrates how far
China's military has come in the last two decades. Captain Lu says China's next step might be to fire a missile
over Taiwan. It appears that might have happened on Thursday - Japanese
officials suspect it did - but China is yet to confirm it. If that's true, this is something China has never done before. As the graphic shows, several of the zones where China has been conducting military exercises verge into Taiwan's territorial waters. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command claims the sea combat drills are for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces. Chinese jets have also been spotted flying above the mainland's Pingtan island - which lies across the water from northern Taiwan and is one of the closest points to Taiwan.

There is no change to Australia's bipartisan One China policy.  Rupert Wingfield-HayesReporting from Taiwan That's how a Taiwanese retired navy captain Lu Li-Shin described
the military drills taking place around the island. ""What China is engaged in is psychological warfare,""
he said. ""All the missiles being fired, all the explosions - it's to
show China's domestic audience how tough Beijing is being while at the same
time intimidating the people of Taiwan."" It is nevertheless an impressive show and illustrates how far
China's military has come in the last two decades. Captain Lu says China's next step might be to fire a missile
over Taiwan. It appears that might have happened on Thursday - Japanese
officials suspect it did - but China is yet to confirm it. If that's true, this is something China has never done before. As the graphic shows, several of the zones where China has been conducting military exercises verge into Taiwan's territorial waters. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command claims the sea combat drills are for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces. Chinese jets have also been spotted flying above the mainland's Pingtan island - which lies across the water from northern Taiwan and is one of the closest points to Taiwan. This video can not be played Two fishermen have spoken about the impact China's military drills are having on their daily lives. One said the atmosphere this time was ""abnormal"" while another insisted they had to keep using Taiwan waters or they would not survive. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command said that it continued military exercises in the north, southwest and east of Taiwan Island as planned on Friday. The air and sea combat drills were for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces, it said in a post on Weibo, the Chinese social media site. There's more from the US now, where areport in the Washington Post,externalreveals
China's ambassador to the US was called to the White House yesterday. ""After Chinaâs actions overnight, we summoned [Peopleâs
Republic of China] Ambassador Qin Gang to the White House to dÃ©marche him about
the PRCâs provocative actions,"" White House spokesman John Kirby says in a
statement provided to the newspaper. A dÃ©marche is a protest lodged through diplomatic channels. Kirby adds that the Biden administration condemned the PRCâs
military actions, ""which are irresponsible and at odds with our
long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait"". The meeting was between Kurt Campbell, US President Joe Biden's
Asia tsar, and Qin, according to a White House official who spoke to the Post
anonymously. News of the meeting - which took place on Thursday - came
shortly after Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, wassanctioned by China for her visit to
Taiwan. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting in English and Japanese - affirming the values Taiwan shares with democratic countries and asking the international community to ""halt escalation of the security situation"". In English, she said China's military threat was ""irresponsible to Taiwan and the international community"". Taiwan's government and military are closely monitoring China's military drills and are ready to respond as necessary, she said. Allow Twitter content?

China's foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying did not offer a comment when asked about whether missiles fired by China yesterday passed above Taiwan. The Japanese embassy in Washington said it believed four missiles fired by China had passed over the island's capital Taipei. But Hua said: ""I have no comment. Pelosi triggered the current tensions.

It is the diplomatic acknowledgement of China's position that there is only one Chinese government. Under the policy, the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. TheOne China policyis a key cornerstone of Sino-US relations. It is also a fundamental bedrock of Chinese policy-making and diplomacy. However, it is distinct from theOne China principle- referred to in the Chinese statement sanctioning Pelosi - whereby China insists Taiwan is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day. The US policy is not an endorsement of Beijing's position and indeed as part of the policy, Washington maintains a""robust unofficial"" relationship with Taiwan,external, including continued arms sales to the island so that it can defend itself. Read more Chinese state media has not yet released information about
Friday's military drill. A video was published showing Chinese army medics conducting a
drill for sending wounded soldiers by a high speed train with surgery facilities. On China's Twitter-like Weibo the hashtag ""second day of
military drill"" is being promoted and people are asking: ""What's for
today?"" and ""Why so quiet today?"" In general, the feeling on Chinese social media is mixed. Some
people are impressed by the drills so far, others seem disappointed by what
they've seen. China has announced it is sanctioning US Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her immediate family over her visit to Taiwan. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Pelosi had ""seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, seriously damaged China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampled on the one-China principle, and seriously threatened peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"", according to a statement. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Â© 2025 BBC.

But before we go
here's a recap of today's key developments:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Thomas Spender, Yvette Tan, Melissa Zhu, Nathan Williams, Jack Burgess and Sam Hancock. Let's head to Taiwan, where the defence ministry has spoken out
about the action of the Chinese military. In a statement, officials condemned Chinese vessels crossing the
Taiwan Strait and ""harassing"" the island's surrounding waters and air
space, Reuters reports. Chinese aircraft had crossed the median line a total of 68 times
by 17:00 local time (10:00 BST), the ministry reportedly said - before warning
its military would defend Taiwan's national security ""with firm
action"". It added China had ""seriously damaged"" the status quo
of the strait, which separates the island of Taiwan and mainland China. Reality Check There have been some more cyber-attacks reported against
official websites in Taiwan. The Ministry of National Defence was one target, as well as the
Environment Protection Bureau in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan,
according to local media. The Defence Ministry's website went offline
temporarily and on the environment bureau's website, the cyber-attackers put up
five Chinese national flags. The website of Taiwan's presidential office, the Foreign
Ministry and the governing party have all been targeted this week. Taiwan says the identities of
those responsible for the latest attacks remains unknown. We reported earlier on Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu'sinterview with the BBC- and here's some more. Refusing to apologise for US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's brief but controversial trip to the island, Wu said visits from high profile figures are key to ""raise the profile of Taiwan and to allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". ""China has long been trying to isolate Taiwan internationally,"" he added. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control again. One poll suggests most Taiwanese are not
confident that the US would help defend the island. Some78.4%of those polled said they werenot at allornot very confidentthat theUS would provide assistance to defend
Taiwan. While 19.2% of the 19,500 questioned - between Wednesday and Friday - said
they were very or somewhat confident. The rest had no opinion. The share of Taiwanese people who believe that the US military
would provide support against a Chinese invasion appears to have been dropping
for some time. A poll in March, by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF)
think tank, found that 55.9% of more than a thousand respondents did
not believe at all or did not fully believe that the US would defend Taiwan if
China invaded. While 34.5% somewhat or fully believed it would. This was a sharp drop from just six months before - prior to the
Ukraine war - when a similar survey by TPOF found that 65% believed the US
would send troops to defend Taiwan and only 29% did not think it would. Reality Check Taipei's international airport was not hit by a missile Misleading information has been circulating in recent days as
tensions have surged. Reports emerged incorrectly claiming that the international
airport near Taiwanâs capital, Taipei, was hit by a missile on 2 August. But Taiwanâs Ministry of National Defencedenied this had happened,,externaland
pointed out the airport was working normally. There've also been claims in some Chinese-language media that
Taiwan has cancelled all leave for its military. But as yet this has not
happened, although personnel have been asked to remain ""on alert."" There's also been misleading video shared claiming to show
Chinese warships in the waters around Taiwan in recent days. But it uses old
footage of events held to mark the 73rd anniversary of the Chinese navy in
April. Similarly, social media users
have shared video said to show a recent Chinese military exercise, which was
actually a Taiwanese drill from nearly two years ago. Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan has left Joe Biden with a serious headache as he tries to manage ties with America's biggest global rival. The relationship between China and the United States was founded on deliberate ambiguity over Taiwan. Maintaining the status quo - in which Beijing says Taiwan is part of China, Taiwan says it's independent, the US says it's not but treats it like an ally, and no one makes aggressive moves on their claims - has been the least-worst option of keeping a tenuous peace. But the US House Speaker has shone a harsh spotlight on the contradictions of this arrangement - which had already become strained. Read more Beijing has announced it is halting key climate talks with the US, and co-operation across multiple other areas. China and America unveiled a climate pact at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year. China's foreign ministry says the country is also suspending dialogue between senior military commanders, talks over cross-border crime prevention and repatriating illegal migrants. All this follows US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan which angered China. Penny Wong, Australia's foreign minister, has had her say on the situation in Taiwan. Speaking to reporters in Cambodia, she says Australia is ""deeply concerned"" about China's launch of ballistic missiles into waters around Taiwan's coastline. She also brands the military drills encircling the island ""disproportionate and destabilising"". Wong joins the likes of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who've both expressed concern over China's actions. In its own statement, Australiaâs foreign ministry adds: This is a serious matter for the region, including for our close strategic partner, Japan. Australia shares the regionâs concerns about this escalating military activity, especially the risks of miscalculation.  We urge restraint and de-escalation. It is in all our interests to have a region at peace and not in conflict. Australia does not want to see any unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.
