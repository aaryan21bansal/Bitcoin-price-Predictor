Two of them were taken to hospital after receiving cuts to their hands and forearms. Prime Minister Theresa Maytweeted,externalto praise the officers for acting ""quickly and bravely"", and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan thanked the officers for ""ensuring that not a single member of the public was injured"".

No members of the Royal Family were in Buckingham Palace, which is the Queen's official London residence, at the time.

Cdr Haydon said the struggle was ""quickly brought under control"" and that they are treating it as an isolated incident. ""It was quickly declared a terrorist incident last night,"" he said.

""They were trying to get the man out of the car, shouting; more police were arriving on to the scene and the man was fighting back. ""I saw one injured policeman with an injury to his arm, although it didn't look severe. ""He was being tended to by another officer. ""The man had been restrained and looked almost unconscious by the side of the road.""

She told the Press Association: ""The police didn't just run up to the car. There was some shouting prior to this; I couldn't tell you what, I was a bit panicked... ""My partner saw a sword, which I didn't see, as well as a policeman with blood on him, looking like his hand or chest was injured. ""The police officer had it in his hand, walking away with it.""

North Korea fires 'several projectiles',"North Korea has tested a number of missiles in recent months North Korea has fired three short-range ballistic missiles, the US military says. They were launched from a site in the North Korean province of Gangwon and flew for about 250km (150 miles), officials in South Korea said. Since firing an intercontinental ballistic weapon last month, Pyongyang has threatened to aim missiles at the US Pacific territory of Guam. But this latest test did not threaten the US or Guam, the US military said. North Korean missile tests often come in response to South Korean military exercises involving the US. Thousands of US and South Korean troops are currently taking part in joint military drills, which are mainly largely computer-simulated exercises. The projectiles were launched at 06:49 on Saturday (21:49 GMT Friday), South Korea's defence ministry said. The US military initially reported that two of the missiles had failed but, according to its later assessment, one appears to have blown up almost immediately while two flew about 250km (155 miles) in a north-easterly direction. The launches were spread over a period of 30 minutes, an official said. The South Korean defence ministry said: ""The military is keeping a tight surveillance over the North to cope with further provocations."" The two Koreas are technically still at war as the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice. Read more: Is the new missile test a game-changer? Can the US defend itself against North Korea?

Hurricane Harvey 'will be major disaster',"This video can not be played Parts of the central Texas coast have been battered by hurricane winds Texas is facing a ""very major disaster"" as Hurricane Harvey approaches its coastline, the state's governor says. It is now a category four storm as it powers across the Gulf of Mexico. It is due to make landfall on Texas' central coast very late on Friday. Greg Abbott has asked for more federal aid to cope with the storm, which may be the worst to hit the US in 12 years. The National Hurricane Center said storm surges may bring life-threatening floods in and around Houston. At 18:00 (23:00 GMT), the storm was 45 miles (70 km) east of Corpus Christi,  with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (215 km/h), the NHC said. The storm may bring 40in (102cm) of rain and 12ft (3.5m) storm surges, say forecasters. Mr Abbott said Harvey was now ""turning into a very complex and dangerous hurricane"". It is likely to strike at the heart of Texas's oil refining industry, with Corpus Christi, a port city of 320,000 people, in the path of the storm. Ina letter to President Donald Trump,externalrequesting federal aid, Mr Abbott said: ""The storm surge, coupled with the deluge of rain, could easily lead to billions of dollars of property damage and almost certainly loss of life."" The White House said Mr Trump is likely to visit Texas early next week. In pictures: Texas braces for Hurricane Harvey This video can not be played Nick Miller has the forecast for Texas as Harvey hits The National Weather Servicesaid on Friday,externalit expected Harvey to make landfall as a category three hurricane, out of a maximum of five.  Storms usually lose force when they reach land. If it does, it will be the strongest storm to hit the US since October 2005, when Hurricane Wilmastruck the coast of Florida,external. Wilma left 87 people dead, and was part of a record-breaking hurricane season that included Katrina, which devastated New Orleans and killed nearly 2,000 people in August of that year. However, Mr Abbott warned it could even make landfall as a category four. The last category four storm to hit the US was Charley in August 2004. Animated guide: Hurricanes,external What is storm surge? According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Harvey's wind speed is currently 130mph, though gusts are even stronger. While Harvey is packing strong and potentially devastating winds, the biggest threats to Texas are rainfall and the storm surge. Meteorologists are warning of extremely high volumes of rainfall as the storm stalls over the middle Texas coast. They say Harvey could remain in the area, dumping rain until the middle of next week. Oil-rich Houston, the fourth biggest city in the US, could face up to 20in of rain over the coming days, officials there said. On top of that, the central Texas coast is likely to see a significant storm surge - this happens when low pressure at sea ""lifts"" tides to a level higher than normal, up to 12ft in this case, and high winds then blow the water inland. The NHC said it expected ""catastrophic flooding"" across the coast and in some inland areas throughout south-east Texas. Parts of Texas arealready seeing,externala storm surge 2.5ft above normal. This video can not be played Tomasz Schafernaker takes a look at the formation of Cape Verde-type hurricanes and where their energy comes from. About 45% of US oil refinery takes place on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and Corpus Christi is an important port for the industry. Crude oil production has slowed down by about 20% to prepare for the storm, and fears Harvey could lead to a shortfall in fuel have helped drive up prices. While no mandatory evacuations have taken place, Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb encouraged people living in low-lying areas to leave. President Trump has also been urging people to heed the advice of authorities. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Blind Date couple reunite on Tube,"This video can not be played Howard Griffiths was won over by Ms Bard's Italian-speaking skills in 1992 Two former Blind Date contestants have had an unexpected reunion on a London Tube train - 25 years on. Howard Griffiths could not believe it when Brigette Bard approached him to ask if he was the man who had picked her on the ITV show hosted by Cilla Black in October 1992. Howard recorded the Central Line encounter on his phone, and atweet,externalof the video has since gone viral. They now plan to meet for a proper catch-up in the coming weeks. ""I said 'It's notâ¦ Oh my god - you're not Bridget, or Brigette as Cilla used to say?'"" Howard, 48, from Llantrisant, south Wales, told BBC News. ""She hadn't changed, she looked amazing."" He added: ""Thinking about it now, I don't know why I didn't stay on the Tube but it was my stop. It was like a scene from a film. Everyone on the Tube was saying: Don't go!"" For her part Brigette, 45, has described being ""completely astounded"" by their latest meeting. She says she recognised Howard within ""literally a few seconds"", but it took her a moment to remember where they had met. Back in 1992, the couple spent a romantic weekend in Germany, travelling on the oldest double-decker aircraft, watching horse races and gambling, but, despite speaking on the phone a few weeks later, nothing blossomed. Howard and Brigette on their Germany date in 1992 In the intervening years, Brigette has had three children, but they are now both single once again. Luckily, they exchanged phone numbers before Howard dashed from the Tube. ""You won't believe this! Just randomly met Brigette who I picked on ITV Blind Date 25 years ago, on the Central Line #SmallWorld,"" he wrote in his Tweet. When the media began to express interest in their reunion, he rang Brigette to let her know and they ended up agreeing to meet soon. Both have expressed enthusiasm for keeping in touch. ""I want to find out everything that's happened in the last 25 years,"" Howard said. The pair's appearance on Blind Date was hailed by fans as one of the show's best episodes. Howard said the audience ""went crazy"" for them - and Cilla Black, whose hosting of Blind Date became an iconic part of the show, was in ""hysterics"" over their banter. Howard said Cilla Black enjoyed his pairing with Brigette He said Cilla sent a handwritten note backstage after the show to thank him for his appearance, explaining she ""really, really enjoyed it"". Howard says he originally chose Brigette - who, according to the show's format, he could not see because she was seated behind a screen - because they had managed to exchange a conversation in Welsh and Italian. And the video of the latest meeting shows he managed to reprise the memories of the day by repeating the phrase he said to her in Italian all those years ago: ""I would like to be able to speak Italian fluently"".

Orchestra shuts after fat-shaming singers,"Victoria Leone performing with the Sheraton Cadwell Orchestras in Toronto A Toronto orchestra has shut down after ""fat-shaming"" volunteer singers who wore body-hugging dresses. The Sheraton Cadwell Orchestras asked women who were not ""fit & slim"" to use loose dresses that hide their ""dietary indulgences"". Many singers who had performed with the symphony expressed disgust at the email. The management has since apologised and resigned, telling singers the orchestra would no longer be funded. The controversy began on Monday when singer Victoria Leone, 23, received an email from Sheraton Cadwell Orchestras that left her astonished. Email from Sheraton Cadwell Orchestras ""Although almost all of our vocalists are fit and slim - the way our boutique orchestra would like our front line performing artists to beâ¦ two of our featured singers were not,"" the email read. ""We hope that they would, as such, refrain from using tight-fitting dresses and use loose (less physically-revealing, less physically-accentuating) dresses instead."" The email went on at length to detail that they were only concerned with vocalists, not instrumentalists, because instrumentalists were ""background"". Ms Leone had performed with the orchestra once two weeks beforehand as a volunteer at a local street festival. Shetold the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,externalthat as someone who was bullied as a child for being a bit ""curvy"", she felt personally attacked. The email, which was signed by ""the management"", also said that in the future, only ""fit and slim"" women would be hired. Victoria Leone is a jazz singer who says she felt targeted by an orchestra's body-shaming email ""As per our highly selective casting requirements for vocal artists taking on a prominent leading role on stage, only singers who are physically fit and slim (or at the very least, those who know how to dress strategically/suitably in order to not bring attention to their temporary physical/dietary indulgences) would be showcased with our boutique orchestras."" Ms Leone says she sent an email back to the orchestra, expressing her frustration and quitting the organisation. Instead of apologising, she said they simply thanked her for her time and asked her to reread certain parts about dressing less revealingly, which it highlighted in red. Miss Universe Canada slams body shamers 'Curvy' wife tribute sparks backlash Two women share their stories of fat shaming After news of this message went public, and many other singers complained, the management sent her a follow-up email notifying her that the orchestra would be shutting down. ""We sincerely apologize for any embarrassment/harassment that you may experience from media representatives or other individuals/parties as a result of misconstrued/malicious allegations and extremely negative/destructive/evil intent,""the email read,external. Speaking to the CBC, Ms Leone said she did not feel like that was the apology she was looking for. ""It does suck for all the young women, all the young girls who are trying to aspire to anything,"" she said.

VW engineer jailed for emissions scandal,"Diesel Volkswagen and Audi vehicles that VW bought back from consumers sit in Pontiac, Michigan. A former Volkswagen engineer who helped develop a device that enabled cars to evade US pollution rules has been sentenced to more than three years in prison and ordered to pay $200,000. James Liang, 63, was the first person prosecuted in the emissions scandal. The US investigation has led to charges against seven others in the US and sparked probes in other countries. Volkswagen has admitted guilt, agreeing to spend as much as $25bn to address US claims. Liang co-operated with prosecutors, who argued that his help with the investigation warranted a reduction in the possible punishment to three years in prison and a $20,000 fine. But US District Court Judge Sean Cox opted for a harsher penalty of 40 months and a $200,000 penalty, saying he wanted to send a message to others in the car industry. ""This is a very serious and troubling crime against our economic system,"" he said. Volkswagen has admitted that it used software installed in diesel vehicles to deceive environmental regulators in the US and Europe between 2006-15. The German company sold about 11 million such vehicles globally, including almost 600,000 in the US. The devices, which allowed vehicles to perform better in test conditions than they did on the road, came to light after a study of emissions by researchers at West Virginia University. In a memo submitted to the court last week, prosecutors acknowledged that Liang did not ""mastermind"" the plan, but argued that he abdicated his responsibility to speak out. They wrote: ""Unless individual actors are also punished, future corporate employees and contractors may be tempted to justify their criminal behavior as just 'doing their jobs' or 'following orders'. ""Sentencing Liang to a three-year term of imprisonment will deter others from making similar rationalizations."" Liang's lawyer had urged the judge to consider a lighter penalty in recognition of his assistance with other cases. Liang, who is still employed by Volkswagen but does not work as an engineer, can appeal.

EU applications for UK citizenship up 80%,"Nearly 30,000 EU nationals applied to become British citizens in the 12 months after last summer's Brexit vote - almost double the number of the previous year. Home Office statistics show 28,502 such applications between July 2016 and June 2017, up 80% from 15,871 in 2015-16. The total number of applications, from all nationalities, fell by 8%. The rise comes asONS figures showed a fall in net migration- partly due to a rise in EU nationals leaving the UK. Jonathan Portes, a professor at King's College London, said: ""Historically, immigrants from outside the EU have been much more likely than EU migrants to apply for UK citizenship."" But the uncertainty over EU citizens' rights in the UK after Brexit means ""many EU citizens living here are seeking UK citizenship, at least as an insurance policy"", he added. One of the most noticeable changes was among Germans, with applications almost tripling. Applications from nationals of eight eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004 rose by 45% to 9,841 - Poland had the highest with 6,179. The Home Office report said increases in applications from EU nationals in recent years are ""likely to reflect immigration in earlier years while the most recent rise may be partly due to the impact of rule changes and recent events"". The rights of the three million EU citizens living in the UK following Brexit is one of the key issues in the UK government's negotiations with Brussels. While there has been a rise in applications from EU nationals, the number from the rest of the world has fallen by 18% in the last 12 months - from 131,266 to 107,410. Meanwhile, ONS figures released on Thursday showed net migration - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK - fell 81,000 to 246,000 in the year to March 2017. That was partly because the number of EU citizens who decided to leave the UK increased by 33,000 year-on-year to 122,000 - the highest departure number for nearly a decade. Marianne Kaufmann, an EU national with dual French and German citizenship, has lived in the UK for 24 years and recently became a British citizen. ""Had it not been for the fact that my (unmarried) partner is British, and that our daughter, too, is British, I would have liked to leave the UK after the referendum,"" she said. ""I felt unwelcome and unwanted. ""As it was, I felt forced to apply for British citizenship, which was tedious, lengthy and difficult, as well as an expensive process. ""Due to my partner's work there is the possibility that we may need to move abroad for several years, and I was worried that I would lose my permanent residency status. ""Last week I became a British citizen, while keeping my French and German nationality. ""While I am relieved and pleased that my application was successful and proud that I am now a British citizen, I am saddened that it was necessary for me to apply in the first place."" An application costs Â£1,282 Applicants must fulfilcertain requirements,,externalsuch as having lived in the UK for at least five years Successful applicants are invited to a citizenship ceremony where they make an oath of allegiance and a pledge to respect the rights, freedoms and laws of the UK.

DVLA bans 'offensive' number plates,"Do these ""suppressed"" vehicle registration marks cause ""upset or offence""? More than 300 number plates have been banned from use when the 67 vehicle registrations are released next week. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has withheld them because they are deemed potentially offensive. Among those are MU67 DER, BU67 GER, DO67 GER, BA67 ARD, MU67 GER, HU67 WLY and OR67 SAM. Other ""words"" like AF67 HAN and NE67 ECT also make the list. A DVLA spokesman said it had a responsibility to ensure plates do not ""cause upset or offence"". In June, the Swansea-based agency admitted that a plate JH11 HAD ""slipped through the net"". To certain eyes, or on some deliberately-designed plates, a 6 can look like a ""G"" or an ""S"" A 7 can be read as a ""T"" or even an ""L"" And when put together, the number 67 can be read by some as an ""R"" - but only if you look really, really hard Words which look as if they spell the word jihad among the new plates have also been banned, information supplied under the Freedom of Information Act to BBC Wales has shown. Also on the list are a range of plates that start with the word NO and end with another complete three-letter word (and the 67 is irrelevant), including NO67 DAD,  NO67 FUN, NO67 MUM and NO67 SON. The spokesman said: ""The agency applies a clear policy of withholding potentially offensive registration numbers equally to normal issue series and those made available to purchase from our sales team. ""Such numbers are withheld if they are likely to cause offence or embarrassment to the general population in this country on the grounds of political, racial and religious sensitivities or simply because they are in poor taste when displayed correctly on a number plate.""

Man shot after attacking Brussels troops,"This video can not be played Police cordon off the street where troops were attacked A man has been shot dead after attacking soldiers with a machete in Brussels, in what prosecutors are treating as a terror attack. The Somali attacker, aged 30, died in hospital. One of the soldiers suffered a hand injury. Photographs show the street cordoned off with police and troops in the area. Soldiers have become a familiar sight on the streets of the Belgian capital since terror attacks which killed more than 30 people last year. The attack took place on Boulevard Emile Jacqmain in the centre of the city. Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said the attacker had not been ""known for terrorist activities"" but had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic) during the assault. The man attacked two soldiers with a large knife in the centre of Brussels The area on Boulevard Emile Jacqmain has been cordoned off by police Witness Ryan MacDonaldâwrote,externalon Twitter that he had heard the sound of a gunshot before seeing a ""heavy police presence outside"".

He came to Belgium in 2004 and was granted asylum after five years, followed by citizenship in 2015, prosecutors say. He had been living in the city of Bruges. Not known for any terror-related activities, he was charged with assault and battery in February. No details were given. A fake firearm and two copies of the Koran were found among his possessions. The presence of soldiers on the streets of Brussels is part of a large-scale security operation designed to reassure the public in the wake of terrorist attacks in the city in March 2016 in which 32 people were killed.

Police attacked outside Buckingham Palace,"A man arrested outside Buckingham Palace on Friday night was brandishing a 4ft sword as he repeatedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"", police say. Dean Haydon, head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, said the man drove at a police vehicle before stopping and being confronted by three officers. CS gas was used to ""quickly"" restrain the 26-year-old, from the Luton area, who is now in custody, Cdr Haydon said. The three unarmed Westminster police officers received minor injuries. Two of them were taken to hospital after receiving cuts to their hands and forearms. Prime Minister Theresa Maytweeted,externalto praise the officers for acting ""quickly and bravely"", and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan thanked the officers for ""ensuring that not a single member of the public was injured"". Counter-terror police are investigating after the man was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and assault, and under the Terrorism Act. No members of the Royal Family were in Buckingham Palace, which is the Queen's official London residence, at the time. The incident happened outside the Mall roundabout near Spur Road - which runs along the corner of the palace grounds - at about 20:35 BST on Friday, police said. This video can not be played Video captures the police arriving on the scene A man drove a blue Toyota Prius into a restricted area near the palace and ""deliberately drove at a marked police vehicle and stopped in front of it"", Cdr Haydon said. When police confronted the man, he reached for a 4ft (122cm) sword in the passenger footwell of the car. Cdr Haydon said the struggle was ""quickly brought under control"" and that they are treating it as an isolated incident. ""It was quickly declared a terrorist incident last night,"" he said. The Met is now investigating the suspect's background and is carrying out searches in the Luton area. This video can not be played Commander Dean Haydon recounts Friday's incident in London Eye-witness Kiana Williamson said: ""We turned up and there was one police van and one car; there was also a civilian's car that had veered towards the police car. ""They were trying to get the man out of the car, shouting; more police were arriving on to the scene and the man was fighting back. ""I saw one injured policeman with an injury to his arm, although it didn't look severe. ""He was being tended to by another officer. ""The man had been restrained and looked almost unconscious by the side of the road."" The scene on Friday night Another passer-by, who did not want to be named, said her partner initially thought he had seen a sword. She told the Press Association: ""The police didn't just run up to the car. There was some shouting prior to this; I couldn't tell you what, I was a bit panicked... ""My partner saw a sword, which I didn't see, as well as a policeman with blood on him, looking like his hand or chest was injured. ""The police officer had it in his hand, walking away with it.""

RBS 'mistreated business customers',"The RBS department set up to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients, a leaked report for the Financial Conduct Authority says. It found some ""inappropriate action"" - such as interest charges being raised or unnecessary fees added - was experienced by 92% of viable firms seen by RBS's Global Restructuring Group. GRG operated from 2005 to 2013 and at its peak handled 16,000 companies. The banking giant denies systematic abuse of its customers. GRG would step in when businesses had skipped a loan repayment, or seen their sales and profits dip notably and was marketed as an expert service that would turn around a business. But the report, seen by the BBC, commissioned for the City watchdog, the FCA, found struggling companies that were placed in the recovery group had a slim chance of emerging from it. It said just 10% returned intact to the main RBS bank. As of the end of 2014, 69% of firms, were still in the successor to GRG, which was supposed to return them to health. Many of those businesses remained tied into complex loans with the bank in the form of derivatives linked to interest rates, from which it is often too expensive to leave. Others ended up in administration, liquidation or a trade sale.  According to one BBC source, instead of getting firms back on their feet, GRG was more like their ""undertaker"". The 361 page leaked report also says the bank provided only ""narrow compliance"" to investigators. Sources told the BBC investigators would regularly ask for details from the bank on certain matters and RBS would only provide the absolute minimum information. RBS disputes this though. It says it provided investigators with ""circa 323 gigabytes of data, comprising more than 15 million physical pages and 270,000 emails."" Mr Standish said he was ""completely lost"" when RBS took an 80% stake of his business Tracy Standish ran a chain of 18 bowling complexes nationwide and banked with RBS for decades. When sales dipped during the recession from 2008, his business was placed into the hands of GRG. It applied a default charge of Â£100,000 to be paid immediately and raised the interest rate on some of his existing loans to 15% - greatly exacerbating Mr Standish's financial burden. Mr Standish and his family had to surrender 80% of their company to the bank. He's now suing RBS. He said he was ""devastated"" by the actions of the bank. ""It was to suddenly not know where to go, to be completely lost. It was like an out of body experience. I just really didn't know what had happened to my world, and where to go next."" said Mr Standish, from Poole. ""I must have been in shock maybe for a month... That just descended into full blown depression. ""I had to be referred to a counsellor for treatment, I was prescribed anti-depressants. And I became suicidal, and was so, for some period."" RBS says that the Standish case was currently the subject of litigation and that the bank would be ""vigorously defending these claims"". The FCA provided a summary of the main findings last November. The full report calls for a fundamental review by RBS of how it handles its SME customers in financial distress' and RBS has already set up a Â£400m fund to compensate those customers mistreated by GRG. The bank, which is 73% owned by the government, said it had apologised for previous mistreatment of some customers and had taken steps - agreed with the FCA- to put things right. That included a new complaints process overseen by a retired High Court Judge - and an automatic refund of complex fees paid by these customers. The City watchdog also admitted that it may in fact lack the powers to take action when SMEs face mistreatment: ""The activities carried out by GRG are largely unregulated; therefore, the FCA's powers are limited in this area. ""However, we are investigating issues raised by the Report which fall within our remit."" The issue of RBS's treatment of business customers was first raised in 2013 by Lawrence Tomlinson, the 'Enterprise Czar' for the then Business Secretary Vince Cable. Sir Vince, now the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: ""The story of GRG and RBS is a dreadful legacy. ""This happened a decade ago but the banks continued refusal to accept copious evidence that good firms were driven out of business to boost the profits of the bank by acquiring their property is to its great discredit."" At its peak in 2011 and 2012, it handled 16,000 companies, with total assets worth Â£65bn. RBS set up a Â£400m compensation fund to make redress. But some campaigners have suggested that the final figure could be closer to Â£2bn. A separate BBC investigation last year found that that GRG earned profits of Â£1.2bn in 2011 and was a major contributor to RBS profits while its investment banking division was posting record losses. RBS was and still is the UK's biggest business bank.  It lends to more companies than any other financial institution and this report adds to the reputational and financial issues already in play at RBS. Only last month, it agreed to pay Â£3.7bn in fines for misselling mortgage-backed assets in the run up to the financial crisis in 2007-08. The bank itself expects to have to pay further multi billion pound fines over the coming year. Now, it faces a number of private lawsuits from current and former business customers who may feel they were mistreated by their own bank.

US braces for worst hurricane in years,"This video can not be played Nick Miller has the forecast for Texas as Harvey hits Texas is bracing itself for Hurricane Harvey, which may be the worst storm to hit the US mainland in 12 years. Harvey, currently a category two storm in the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to make landfall on Texas' central coast late on Friday or early Saturday. The National Hurricane Center said storm surges may bring life-threatening floods in and around Houston. The storm may bring 35in (97cm) of rain, 130mph (210km/h) winds and 12ft (3.5m) storm surges, say forecasters. At 10:00 local time (15:00 GMT), the eye of Harvey was about 115 miles south-east of the Texas coastal city of Corpus Christi, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. It had sustained winds of 110mph. Harvey - which has been gaining strength - is likely to strike at the heart of Texas's oil refining industry. Oil-rich Houston, the fourth biggest city in the US, could face up to 20in of rain over the coming days, officials there said. Animated guide: Hurricanes,external What is storm surge? Meteorologists are warning of extremely high volumes of rainfall as the storm stalls over the middle Texas coast. They say Harvey could remain in the area, dumping rain until the middle of next week. On top of that, the central Texas coast is likely to see a significant storm surge - this happens when low pressure at sea ""lifts"" tides to a level higher than normal, up to 12ft in this case, and high winds then blow the water in land. The NHC said it expected ""catastrophic flooding"" across the coast and in some inland areas throughout south-east Texas. Energy companies have been evacuating staff from offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Texan oil refineries on land are also shutting down in preparation for the storm. As a result, US fuel prices have reached a three-week high. In the latest developments: Texas Governor Greg Abbot hasdeclared a state of emergency,externalin 30 counties More than 700 members of the Texas Army and Air National Guards have been activated Mandatory evacuations have been issued in some coastal areas Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi has flown at least 10 babies from its neonatal intensive care unit to hospitals further inland, due to fear of power failures ""Now is the time to urgently hide from the wind,"" the National Weather Service (NWS) said in a bulletin. ""Failure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury, loss of life or immense human suffering."" This video can not be played Tomasz Schafernaker takes a look at the formation of Cape Verde-type hurricanes and where their energy comes from. Joe McComb, mayor of Corpus Christi, a coastal city of more than 300,000 people, urged householders to take the warnings seriously and evacuate low-lying areas. ""I hope people will listen to forecasters when they say 'beware of flash floods',"" he said. ""Flash floods can come quickly, and they can be deadly."" According to the NHC, the wind speed is currently almost 110mph, though gusts are even stronger. The NWSsaid on Friday,externalit expected Harvey to make landfall as a Category Three hurricane, out of a maximum of five. If it does, it will be the strongest to hit the US since October 2005, when Hurricane Wilmastruck the coast of Florida,external. Wilma left 87 people dead, and was part of a record-breaking hurricane season that included Katrina, which devastated New Orleans and killed nearly 2,000 people in August of that year.

Teenager raped three schoolgirls,"The teenager was convicted at the High Court in Glasgow A teenager has been convicted of raping three schoolgirls in Dumfries. The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged after an 11-year-old girl told the school nurse that she had had sex with him. His victims were aged 11, 13 and 16. The offences took place at various locations in Dumfries between March and August last year. A charge of raping a fourth girl when she was 15 was found not proven by a jury at the High Court in Glasgow. Judge Lord Arthurson told the 17-year-old: ""You will be receiving a significant custodial sentence. ""You have been convicted of these offences involving three young girls, one of whom is 11. ""I'm concerned about the risk of sexual harm you appear to present to young females."" Lord Arthurson deferred sentence until next month at the High Court in Edinburgh and ordered a background report and risk assessment report. The court heard that the accused met the 16-year-old on Facebook and asked to meet up with her. They went for a walk in Dumfries and she said she could smell alcohol from him and told him there would be no sex. The girl said: ""I said no, but it was like an obsession. It was all he wanted to do."" She told the jury she was shouting ""No,"" and said the accused called her ""a dirty slag"". The girl added: ""I was crying my eyes out and screaming."" She said the accused apologised to her the following day. The youth was accused of raping the 11-year-old girl on one occasion after contacting her on Snapchat. She told the court that she had sex with him and said it was as much her idea as his. Prosecutor Gillian Ross said: ""It does not matter that she was willing to have sex with him. She was 11 and that makes it statutory rape."" The 13-year-old claimed that the accused had raped her, but she admitted that she had continued to see him for some time afterwards. The 15-year-old girl told the court that she met the accused on Snapchat and he told her he fancied her. When they met, she said he wanted sex and would not take no for an answer and became aggressive. The jury found the charge of raping her not proven. The accused denied all the charges. He did not give evidence, but in a police interview accused the girls of telling lies about him and said: ""I never raped anybody."" The court heard that the youth, from Dumfries, had previous convictions for possessing a knife, wilful and culpable fire raising and assault.

BA attacks Border Force for long delays,"BA has called out Border Force over closed ePassport gates causing huge delays to travellers British Airways has criticised Border Force over ""serious inefficiencies"" that have caused both citizens and visitors to endure long delays at UK airports. The airline is concerned that only a third of the 29 electronic passport gates are open at Heathrow Terminal 5. BA says the gates shut prematurely at 23:00 while customers are still disembarking, causing huge queues. The Home Office has said it strongly disagrees with BA's remarks. Back in 2015, when the electronic gates at Terminal 5 were opened, the Home Office said that the technology would help the Border Force to process a higher number of low risk passengers ""more quickly and using less resources"" toreduce queuing times. The electronic gates were meant to help border control officers to focus on ""more priority work"" like cracking down on people trafficking and drug smuggling. However, since many of the gates are often closed, families returning from holidays have been facing long queues to pass through immigration, particularly late at night. ""It is a constant frustration to us and to our customers that after a long flight they have to stand in queues, sometimes for over an hour, just to get back into the country,"" said Raghbir Pattar, British Airways' director of Heathrow. ""And it is a dreadful welcome for visitors to the UK... It adds insult to injury when you're stuck in a queue but can see numerous gates which just aren't being used."" British Airways has submitted its concerns to the Home Office and hopes that action can be taken to reduce unnecessary delays. Mr Pattar said: ""We recognise some of the steps being taken by Border Force to improve the service they provide to travellers. However more focus must be put on operating in the most efficient and flexible way and ensuring that passengers' needs are put first."" Heathrow Terminal 5 currently only serves BA and Spanish airline Iberia. A spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic told the BBC: ""This hasn't been a particular issue for our customers as all our flights land before 10pm."" The Home Office strongly disagrees with British Airways' comments. ""This statement significantly misrepresents the experience of the vast majority of passengers arriving at Heathrow this summer,"" a spokesperson said. ""More than 99% of British and European passengers arriving at Heathrow are dealt with within 25 minutes. For passengers from outside the European Economic Area, 87% of passengers have been dealt with within 45 minutes. ""Border Force and British Airways have an agreement to close the Terminal 5 ePassport gates at 11pm every evening. In recent months, Border Force has kept the gates open beyond 11pm - often to accommodate passengers arriving on delayed British Airways flights. ""The security of our border is paramount - which is why 100% of scheduled passengers are checked when arriving in the UK. While every effort is made to keep delays for passengers to a minimum, we make no apology for carrying out this important work.""

Right Said Fred credited on Swift single,"Look What You Made Me do follows the same rhythmic pattern as I'm Too Sexy Right Said Fred have been credited as writers on Taylor Swift's new single in one of the most bizarre musical combinations of the year. The chorus of Taylor's new single Look What You Made Me Do follows the same rhythmic pattern asI'm Too Sexy,external. After the song was released overnight, the duotweeted,external: ""Thank you Taylor Swift, what a marvellous reinvention!"" The group's spokesman confirmed to the BBC they were approached by Taylor's team in advance of the release. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The band gave their permission for the song to be used and they've received an acknowledgement from Taylor as a result. The track's credits list three members of Right Said Fred - Richard Fairbrass, Fred Fairbrass and Rob Manzoli - as songwriters alongside Swift and Jack Antonoff. Is Taylor Swift's single about Kanye West? (If you're having trouble, try singing ""I'm too sexy for my shirt"" when Taylor sings ""Ooh, look what you made me do"" and you'll hear the similarities.) But the nod to the single wasn't enough to save it from some lukewarm reviews from critics. Perez Hilton,externaldescribed the song as ""seriously lacking"". ""Overall, we are NOT impressed with TayTay's new tune. We're not feeling the chorus, the lyrics (which are not relatable in the slightest), or the overall production/structure,"" he said. Writing inNME,external, Dan Stubbs said: ""The sound is hard-edged pop - like her smash 1989 album, but darker, more electronic. ""If people have had their claws out for Taylor following that album's success and the reign of her and her squad, the message is clear: this new incarnation is going to bite back."" The Telegraph,external's Sarah Carson said: ""Taylor Swift is a force to be reckoned with... this is a comeback laden with vengeance."" The cover for Reputation is darker and edgier than Taylor's previous albums ""Look What You Made Me Do is a ruthless rebuttal to anyone who had foolishly expected a redemptive return from Swift. Instead, it explains how she has become the 'snake' she has been billed as through the betrayal of others. ""What is missing, however, is the musical reinvention some may have expected. Forget the rumours of a return to country or a foray into rap or dubstep; Swift's in her own well-trodden and inevitably chart-topping territory."" Writing forThe Evening Standard,external, David Smyth said: ""The edgy music suits the fist-swinging tone: industrial electronic drums, low, nasty synth sounds and high strings and piano which give a sense of unhinged threat rather than beauty."" ""There's not much in the way of a tune but it's naggingly memorable nonetheless. It's unlikely to be many people's new favourite Swift song, demanded in encores for years hence. ""To Swift, who no doubt has plenty of catchier singles ready to go, that's less important than the statement it makes."" The Guardian,external's Maura Johnston wrote: ""Swift's lyrics are visceral and almost sloppy, with her rhyming 'time' and 'time' on the Lorde-channelling pre-chorus, and melodramatically declaring that ""the old Taylor"" is 'dead!'. ""The chorus borrows its cadence from Right Said Fred's 1992 body-shaker I'm Too Sexy, a ridiculous touch that at least cuts the acid a bit.""

Is the fun being sucked out of Notting Hill Carnival?,"For 50 years, jerk chicken, reggae, soca and sound systems, a touch of rain and a colourful parade have made up Notting Hill Carnival in west London. Its history is rooted in celebrating African-Caribbean culture and community cohesion over the August bank holiday weekend. But headlines in the run-up to this year's event have appeared to focus on crime and violence instead of calypso and costumes. ""Prior to Notting Hill Carnival, we're disrupting gang crime, drug supply, knife crime and offences that could impact the safety of the weekend,"" said the Met Police. It revealed officers made 290 arrests, recovered 190 knives and 18 firearms and seized a kilogram of suspected heroin before the two-day event. Fears have beenexpressed on social media,externalpeople might take acid to the event and police havereportedly warned business owners,externalto prepare for trouble. Former Kensington MP Victoria Boricktold LBC radio,externalorganisers need to tell revellers ""don't bring your knives, don't bring your guns, don't bring your acid this year"". However, the focus on crime and violence has led to a social media backlash with many questioning whether the carnival is being unfairly portrayed. Allow Twitter content?

""How many drugs did you lot seize in the run up to Glastonbury or we only doing tweets like this for black events?"" grime artist Stormzyasked,external. Those on the ground at the carnival say the atmosphere is ""positive"". ""After carnival you hear about all these madnesses, but we've never experienced or seen it because we don't have that sort of atmosphere,"" says Errol Smith, from King SSP Sound System - one of more than 30 that play at the carnival. ""It's peaceful - everyone jumping up and down and having fun. We've never had any issues or problems in the eight years we've been there. From where I've been, people are just enjoying themselves."" The 2016 Notting Hill Carnival was policed by 7,000 Met officers on the August bank holiday Monday Carnival has experienced trouble over the years including a riot in 1976 and five deaths between 1987 and 2004. At last year's event, police made 454 arrests - the highest for 10 years - with 90 being for possession of an offensive weapon, 17 for assault and 169 for drugs. Two people suffered serious injuries after being stabbed. The Metropolitan Police Federation has said its rank-and-file officers ""dread"" working at the carnival. Speaking after last year's event, federation chairman Ken Marsh saidthe carnival was being ""hijacked""by troublemakers intent on ""turning it into a bank holiday battleground"". ""Last year we had an officer stabbed. This year colleagues were assaulted, abused and spat at,"" he said.  ""Forty-three were injured - with eight needing hospital treatment. How can that be right? It's completely and utterly unacceptable."" Met carnival tweet sparks backlash Fifty years of carnival Carnival to hold a minute's silence Meanwhile,a reportby the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee in January said the carnival posed a ""real risk to public safety"" due to violent crime and overcrowding. Statistics for 2013-16 show the proportion of arrests at the Notting Hill Carnival was only half that at Glastonbury - one of the UK's other biggest outdoor events. Notting Hill saw an average of 3.5 arrests for every 10,000 people who attended over those years. Glastonbury's corresponding figure was 7.4. However, the data does not reveal whether the arrests were for low-level or more serious crimes. George Ruddock, editor and managing director of black newspaper The Voice, says there is a ""stigma"" attached to the carnival. ""It's targeted because it's got its origin as being a black cultural event,"" he said. ""Fifty-one years later the police still think it's predominantly black people who will be there but surprise, surprise, it won't be. There will be a mixture of cultures there. ""I think if there's any kind of event which has predominantly black entertainment and attracts a crowd, there would still be this kind of focus."" Ben Wilson from the London School of Samba, which has been performing at the carnival for 34 years, says the stories which focus on crime at the event are ""unfair"". ""I think there are definitely racial undertones. It's not white people portrayed in these crimes. It is black gangs portrayed, and of course the carnival is next to many million-pound houses who would love to see us get out of town and go to a park."" Jo Jordan, 23, was attacked by a gang who stabbed him in the arm and stole his watch at the carnival last August. This video can not be played Jo Jordan says the number of people enjoying carnival outweighs those making trouble Despite his injury, he believes the number of arrests at carnival represents ""the small minority who go for the wrong reasons"". ""It's a scary world we live in - I could be walking down the street and someone could try and rob me so you need to be careful. If I'm going to go [this year] I won't wear something expensive and attract attention. ""But there's still so much positive thing to gain from carnival, I feel like something needs to be done to stop the bad outweighing the good."" Lucy Knight, 46, from Shepherd's Bush, has been been to every carnival since she was 13. ""I can't say carnival doesn't have a problem because that would be to ignore the fact that when you have a million people in one area you're going to have crime rates and when you have people drinking and got people doing drugs there is going to be crime. ""But you have to look at the statistics when held against other festivals and events. If you look at any town on a Saturday night and you will find more crime there than carnival statistically speaking."" About a million people attended last year's carnival The carnival's organiser, London Notting Hill Carnival Enterprises Trust, says its focus is on ""our community, our culture and having a celebration"". Trustee Kemi Sobers said: ""There is this relentlessness on crime which we find is deeply unfortunate. If there was no crime in the wider society and there was crime at carnival then perhaps we focus on that. ""We do our utmost to ensure the safety and security of the million people that come to our event and try to stress policing yourself. ""We have 1,000 stewards there to help us and as back-up we have the Met Police as part of a range of emergency services that support our event. ""There are 10,000 narratives that you could extrapolate from carnival and its preparation this week. Some choose to concentrate on policing and crime and we choose to concentrate on our community.""

My partner vanished without warning. I had to find him,"Every year, thousands of Britons vanish from their lives. Kirsty and Zack had just celebrated the birth of their son when Zack suddenly walked out of their home. This is the story of how Kirsty tried to track him down. It's breakfast time and Zack, 28, is running late for his job in a High Street bank.  His partner, 34-year-old Kirsty, tells him to hurry up, but he's laughing. He gives Kirsty a kiss and says goodbye to the children - a seven-year-old and a baby of just five weeks. As he walks out to the street, the eldest child goes to the window and makes heart shapes with her hands to Zack below.  It's an ordinary morning. A couple of hours later, Kirsty receives a text message from Zack to say he's not coming back. The morning he disappears, Zack phones his work to say he can't come in. Instead, he walks into a police station and tells them if anyone reports him missing, he doesn't want to be found. Kirsty discovers this when she fills in a missing person form. It's immediately sent out to police stations around the country. A few minutes later, Kirsty is told that Zack is, in fact, alive and well but doesn't want her to know where he is. ""It made me cry because it was so cold,"" says Kirsty. Kirsty told her story to producer Georgia Catt on BBC Radio 4'sThe Untold.  Kirsty's story can be heardhereandhereon iPlayer. She's particularly worried because Zack has been diagnosed as bipolar. ""I knew he wasn't well,"" she says. But he would have appeared in control when the police saw him. When Zack walked out of their flat, he took nothing with him - including the medicine he'd been prescribed. Kirsty knows that without it he'll suffer cold sweats and depression. At this point, her thoughts are swinging wildly from worrying about Zack's health to wondering if he just walked out on them all. Is he ill? Or has he done a runner? The couple have been together for five years. They first met at university, where Kirsty remembers Zack as a brilliant student who spent his spare time writing plays. Kirsty's eldest child, her seven-year old daughter, is from another relationship. Before their son was born, they had all been staying with her parents, but had recently found a flat to move into. Zack had only been in the new flat for two nights before he disappeared. Their home is full of piles of books scattered around the floor, waiting to be put up on shelves. But Kirsty's mind is preoccupied with her search for Zack. She makes a missing poster with his photograph and contacts local doctors to see if he has registered anywhere. She deposits small amounts of money into his bank account - just so she can write short messages in the 15-character reference field. She feels she's clutching at straws. Most of all, she's concerned about his health. ""If he's in a little studio apartment somewhere and he's done himself in, who actually is going to find him?"" she asks. Zack has now been missing for 34 days. Kirsty still has no idea where he is, but a routine call to the Child Support Agency leaves her wondering if he's ill. To her surprise, she's told they have a reliable address for Zack. Her first feeling is shock as she realises her partner is probably safe and well. And then frustration sinks in - everyone else seems to have access to Zack's address and new life apart from her. ""I thought we were planning on this future together,"" she says. ""It didn't involve him doing a runner. I feel cheated. He's left me with all this responsibility."" Then, to add to her sense of alienation, she discovers several email accounts Zack has set up using both their names together. ""Is this a game of cat and mouse?"" she wonders. ""Is he getting a little bit of sick pleasure knowing that he is traceable, but it's all very vague?"" She's able to hack into one of the accounts because Zack has used a password she knows. Inside she finds an email that includes part of a postcode which she tracks down to a village outside Nottingham. Kirsty believes her husband is renting a cheap flat there and thinks about confronting him. Zack has now been missing for 41 days. Kirsty discusses her plan to go to Nottingham with her brother. He tries to talk her out of it. ""We just don't know why he left or anything that was going on in his head,"" he says. About six months ago, Kirsty noticed money was going missing from Zack's account. He admitted he'd been gambling online. Kirsty's brother thinks he may have an addiction problem - something Kirsty finds hard to believe. ""I think he was gambling and you've got a new kid and the rent was due and he was too scared to explain to you he didn't have it, so he ran away,"" says her brother. But Kirsty's mind is made up. It takes her eight hours to reach the village, driving through heavy traffic with her baby in the back seat of her car. She's booked a room in a hotel on the road where she thinks Zack is living. And she's made a flyer with pictures of her and Zack, and Zack with her daughter - Zack as a family man - which she plans to distribute on the road. She admits she included pictures of herself and her children just in case Zack is with another woman - she wants that woman to know they exist. The flyer also has a personal message on. ""I've said it's the hardest letter I've ever had to write, and I've only got one shot at getting it right,"" says Kirsty. ""I've said I'm staying up the road in this hotel until tomorrow afternoon and I'd really like to see him."" The next morning, there's a man waiting to see her in the hotel lobby. For a moment, Kirsty thinks it could be Zack. But it's a stranger who tells her he's read her flyer and hasn't seen her partner. He just wanted to let her know so she wouldn't hold out false hope. Kirsty returns home. ""I just think I've got to not expect to hear anything for a long time,"" she says. Zack has now been missing for 45 days. Suddenly Kirsty receives a message from the NHS advice service, 111. A woman working there says she has received a call from a man in the city of Bath who said he could only remember his name and age. The woman Googled this information and saw that Kirsty was searching for him. This seems like the first concrete lead.  But if it is Zack, he appears to be suffering from amnesia. Kirsty decides to take this information to the police. She's armed with further confirmation that Zack is in Bath. After posting a message on Facebook, she hears from two Bath-based hairdressers who say they are convinced that Zack was in their salon. But her meeting with the police doesn't go well and Kirsty doesn't think they believe her. ""They look at you as though you've got no right to be here,"" she says. And then the station sergeant says he wants to speak to her in private. He tells her that Zack has been in touch. Police officers went to see him this morning and he told them he doesn't want Kirsty to know where he is. He says he's not ready to come back. Kirsty is devastated. She doesn't understand why Zack would phone 111 and say he's confused, but then tell the police he's ok. At the back of her mind is the thought that she must have been a really bad girlfriend. This is Zack's first serious relationship and she wonders whether she forced too much responsibility on him too early. When they first got together, her little girl was still a baby so they couldn't do the things that new couples often do - enjoy lie-ins, go away for the weekend. But at the same time, she remembers what it was like when Zack last experienced a bipolar episode. Then he said he wanted to hurt her because she was so good. She wonders if he's trying to hurt her now. Then, that night, Kirsty gets a text message from an unknown number. Whoever it is knows about the messages she's been leaving in Zack's bank account. This person says they're confused and they're planning to go to the police. They say they'll call Kirsty straight afterwards.  It's 11pm. Kirsty doesn't hear from them again. She's convinced the person is Zack, but she doesn't believe he has amnesia. The next night she receives a phone call. For a couple of seconds there's silence, then the caller hangs up. The phone rings again and it's Zack. Finally Kirsty has some answers. During their hour-and-a-half conversation Zack says he's trying to remember things. He knows his name and age but only vaguely remembers Kirsty.  They agree that Kirsty will pick him up the next day. But Kirsty doesn't hear from him again. Christmas comes and goes without Zack. Kirsty keeps checking his email accounts and sees that he has been using online gambling sites frequently. He's been placing small bets of Â£5 and Â£6, but he's been placing a lot of them, sometimes 20 a day. Then suddenly she sees that Zack has started betting Â£500 in one day. Zack has now been missing for 69 days. Out of the blue, Kirsty receives a call from an unknown doctor saying Zack has been with him for the past 10 days. Zack was placed in his care by an outreach charity who picked him up off the streets. ""I'm so relieved tonight to know that people are looking after him now,"" she says. Kirsty finds out Zack has been in Bath, and then Hertfordshire, and Essex. There's no mention of Nottingham. Some of the time he's been working and paying for accommodation. Other times he's been loitering, unclear of where to go. The doctor tells her that he's very unwell, flipping between personalities and he genuinely can't remember things. ""He wasn't lying,"" says Kirsty, relieved. Finally she has a number she can call Zack on. When they talk he asks her lots of questions about how they met and what their life was like. Zack describes how he has been wandering around following a voice inside his head that said it could take him home. But each time he followed it, he became more lost. Then, 76 days after he walked out of her life, Kirsty is told that Zack is well enough to go home. A month later, Kirsty is still getting used to having Zack back. She believes the reason he left was because of the upheaval of having a new baby and moving house at the same time. ""It's all really hazy,"" says Zack. ""It was Bath first of all, then it was Canada Water [in London], then after that Essex. I know that things would have been going on, but I don't remember them and it's all really grey."" He does remember bits of being away - going to the police station, and being on a bus - but feels disconnected from himself. At one point, he remembers living outside in the woods with nothing but a coat to protect him. He describes the experience as being ""split"". It was as if he was standing outside himself looking in. Especially when he was making bets with huge sums of money. ""I would have made lots of plans,"" he says. ""But shortly after leaving, I found myself homeless. So how planned was it?"" If you have been affected by the disappearance of a loved one, the following charities can offer support and advice: Missing People,external- a charity dedicated to bringing missing children and adults back together with their families. The Samaritans,external- offer a safe place to talk about issues at any time. UK Missing Persons Bureau,external- the UK national and international point of contact for all missing person and unidentified body investigations. Even though Zack still suffers from what he describes as a weird energy in his mind, he says he can distract himself from it. Being back on medication has helped. ""I'm seeing doctors and I'm seeing a psychiatrist who's very good. My concern now is being a good dad and a good partner,"" he says. But Kirsty and Zack's relationship remains fragile. She says she's worried he might leave again and if he does, this time she won't try to find him. She finds it hard to trust him, especially after reading the emails in his secret accounts which she was clearly not meant to see. One of the saddest things is how some of her family and friends are still suspicious of her partner.

Charlie Gard: How conflicts can be defused,"In his final ruling on the distressing and tortuous legal case of baby Charlie Gard, the High Court judge said last month that mediation should be tried in all such cases. Is it possible to defuse conflict between parents and hospital staff in these highly charged situations? A project that began at Evelina Children's Hospital, in London, might hold some answers. It has also been applied in Southampton, where the children's hospital was at the centre of a political and media firestorm three years ago. Staff received hate mail and abusive phone calls after police were asked to search for a five-year-old boy with a brain tumour, who had been taken out of hospital by his parents. Ashya King's family had wanted him to have treatment abroad. This was later paid for by the NHS - and his father has since announced Ashya is free of cancer. Picking up the pieces from this crisis led to a lot of soul-searching in Southampton. Dr Peter Wilson, the trust's clinical director of women's and children's services, told me: ""We are seeing a rise in these kind of conflicts. ""Ten years ago, they were almost unheard of in paediatrics. ""But most NHS trusts at the moment will be dealing with something like this, as best they can, with the families. ""This isn't an isolated problem in Southampton. It's about how we do better as a healthcare system."" They are still analysing data from the six-month trial - but he thinks staff are now spotting five times more cases where there are early, subtle signs of discord with families. Other children's hospitals are already hungry to learn from this work, which Southampton hopes to expand in the coming months. Maureen Wiltshire, who has 30 years' experience of nursing children, shows me a flowchart nurses and other staff use to identify warning signs of conflict. It has two pages - but the second page of actions to help resolve problems has never been reached, because the first page has worked every time. Charlie Gard's parents fought Great Ormond Street Hospital in the courts Ms Wiltshire said: ""It might be a situation where staff would prefer not to look after that child because they feel they're being watched by the parent, or challenged all the time. ""We had a family of a young patient who was being moved to our ward. ""They were against the move, because they'd built up a relationship on the previous ward. ""One of the physios came to us and said the mum was worried her child wouldn't be safe. ""That was a real alarm bell that this was a situation with potential for breakdown. ""In the past, we'd have felt it was enough to get on with showing her that we were caring for her child safely. ""But we actually went in and had an early conversation which cleared up her worries, and stopped the problem getting any bigger."" It sounds obvious, but this vital communication can get lost in an increasingly busy hospital environment. The approach also includes asking parents whether they agree with notes recording difficult meetings. The heartbreak in cases such as those of Charlie Gard and Ashya King is obvious - let alone the time and money involved. Former BBC journalist Sarah Barclay set up a foundation specialising in medical mediation and training. She has led the work at Evelina and in Southampton - and helps by bringing both sides together with mediation sessions if earlier steps to resolve the situation have failed. Sarah said: ""These situations can feel really tense. ""Parents are living out some of their most painful and difficult moments, in the hospital - a public space. ""So, everyone is under enormous pressure and sometimes it just boils over."" About 1,200 clinical and administrative staff at Evelina have had training as part of the Resolution Project. Medical director Dr Sara Hanna said: ""It might surprise people that children can spend more than a year in hospital continually. ""Once the trust is broken between the family and clinicians, it's almost impossible to get back. ""And then it's very dangerous for the child - because who is keeping their needs central at that point?"" The story of baby Charlie Gard.

US rhetoric on Pakistan raises serious questions,"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and President Donald Trump have both threatened Pakistan On Monday night, President Donald Trump unveiled the long awaited results of his policy review of the Afghanistan war. He announced that US troops would remain in the country without a timetable for withdrawal, with other reports suggesting that 4,000 further troops would be added. This would boost present numbers by around a third, although it would leave the American presence far short of its peak of 100,000 in 2010-11. But Mr Trump's speech also included two important new elements. He launched a blistering attack on Pakistan, publicly articulating what his predecessors only said in private. ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,"" declared the president. ""It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace"". This was followed by more threats from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the National Security Council spokesman. And if this were not bad enough for Pakistan, Mr Trump then applauded India's ""important contributions to stability in Afghanistan"", urging New Delhi to play a larger role. Since the beginning of the war, Pakistan has allowed the use of its territory to supply international troops in landlocked Afghanistan, tacitly accepted American drones over its airspace, and co-operated with Western intelligence agencies against some terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. However, Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, has also given shelter and support to Afghan insurgents from the 1970sto the present,including the especially virulent Haqqani network. Its aim has been to limit India's influence - but is also influenced by its disagreements with Kabul. Ever since partition, Afghan governments of all stripes have rejected the border known as the Durand Line, laying claim to some Pashtun areas inside Pakistan. There are three big questions around Trump's approach to Pakistan. The first is whether his words will translate into action. After all, we've been here before. ""We need to make clear to people that the cancer is in Pakistan"", President Barack Obama told advisers in 2009, sending his CIA chief and national security adviser to Islamabad to deliver the message. ""You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours"", warned then Secretary of StateHilary Clinton in 2011.The same year, America's top military officer publicly declared that the Haqqani network was ""a veritable arm"" of Pakistani intelligence. However, these warnings did not translate into action. Pakistan continued to receive around $1bn per year in so-called Coalition Support Funds, as well as other hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. The Trump administration has threatened a range of punishments, including sanctions on Pakistani officials. But will they follow through? This is what Pakistani officials will hope to establish in the coming weeks. Hilary Clinton, pictured here on a visit to Afghanistan in 2011, warned Pakistan about ""snakes in your backyard"" The second question is how Pakistan will respond. In past crises, Pakistan has blocked Nato supply routes into Afghanistan, such as the Khyber Pass. There are alternative routes via Iran and Russia-dominated Central Asia, but the Trump administration's relations with Tehran and Moscow are even worse. Beyond this, Pakistan could also shoot American drones out of the sky, ramp up its support for the Taliban, or halt intelligence co-operation entirely. Of course, Pakistan would have to consider the consequences, from losing out on IMF bailouts to provoking open US air strikes. The third question is whether Pakistan can be coerced into abandoning a policy that has taken shape over 40 years. Both Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson declared their openness to peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Pakistan's concern is that if such talks result in its Taliban allies sharing power in Afghanistan, this would reduce the Taliban's dependence on Pakistan. Taliban leaders who have explored peace talks independently of their Pakistani patrons haveended up arrestedor dead. It is possible that Pakistan will decide that it's worth maintaining influence over the Taliban, whatever the cost. Domestically, Pakistan has continued supporting militants despite the death of 20,000 civilians in terrorist attacks over the past 15 years. It's also notable that a meeting of Pakistani military and political leaders on Thursday concluded that the foreign minister should immediately set off on a tour of ""friendly states"", beginning with China. Pakistan is increasingly confident in the support of Beijing, which is investing tens of billions of dollars in the country as part of the ambitious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, it's not entirely clear how far China is willing to go to bail out Pakistan, financially or politically. The aftermath of the 2008 suicide bomb attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul Finally, what should we make of Trump's effort to enlist Indian support? Some critics have argued that this is likely to provoke Pakistan into expanding its support for the Taliban. However, we should bear in mind that the US tried to restrict India's role in Afghanistan through the 2000s, with no positive change in Pakistan's behaviour. Instead, Pakistan is believed to have sponsored the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008, though Islamabad denies this. India expanded its security role in Afghanistan from 2011 onwards, when it signed astrategic partnershipwith Kabul. It expanded its training of Afghan military officers, 4,000 so far, and gave second-hand attack helicopters to the struggling Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). This, too, had no apparent impact on Pakistan's policy. We should be realistic about India's potential role. Delhi does not have the capacity to do too much more. It requires co-operation with its old partners Russia or Iran to send military supplies, but both those countries have expanded their own ties with parts of the Taliban in recent years. We should also note that President Trump emphasised India's role in the specific areas of ""economic assistance and development"". This assistance, to the tune of $2bn (Â£1.56bn), has contributed to India's popularity amongst Afghans. Delhi would not want military support to put that soft power at risk. But on balance, as Western countries focus on terrorist threats from the Middle East and North Africa, and grow more weary of the longest war in their modern history, India's support to a weak Afghan state and its army should probably be welcomed. Update 25 August 2017: The text referring to the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008 has been updated to include Islamabad's denial of involvement.

Right Said Fred credited on Taylor Swift single,"Look What You Made Me do follows the same rhythmic pattern as I'm Too Sexy Right Said Fred have been credited as writers on Taylor Swift's new single in one of the most bizarre musical combinations of the year. The chorus of Taylor's new single Look What You Made Me Do follows the same rhythmic pattern asI'm Too Sexy,external. After the song was released overnight, the duotweeted,external: ""Thank you Taylor Swift, what a marvellous reinvention!""

The band gave their permission for the song to be used and they've received an acknowledgement from Taylor as a result. The track's credits list three members of Right Said Fred - Richard Fairbrass, Fred Fairbrass and Rob Manzoli - as songwriters alongside Swift and Jack Antonoff. Is Taylor Swift's single about Kanye West? (If you're having trouble, try singing ""I'm too sexy for my shirt"" when Taylor sings ""Ooh, look what you made me do"" and you'll hear the similarities.) But the nod to the single wasn't enough to save it from some lukewarm reviews from critics. Perez Hilton,externaldescribed the song as ""seriously lacking"". ""Overall, we are NOT impressed with TayTay's new tune. We're not feeling the chorus, the lyrics (which are not relatable in the slightest), or the overall production/structure,"" he said. Writing inNME,external, Dan Stubbs said: ""The sound is hard-edged pop - like her smash 1989 album, but darker, more electronic. ""If people have had their claws out for Taylor following that album's success and the reign of her and her squad, the message is clear: this new incarnation is going to bite back."" The Telegraph,external's Sarah Carson said: ""Taylor Swift is a force to be reckoned with... this is a comeback laden with vengeance."" The cover for Reputation is darker and edgier than Taylor's previous albums ""Look What You Made Me Do is a ruthless rebuttal to anyone who had foolishly expected a redemptive return from Swift. Instead, it explains how she has become the 'snake' she has been billed as through the betrayal of others. ""What is missing, however, is the musical reinvention some may have expected. Forget the rumours of a return to country or a foray into rap or dubstep; Swift's in her own well-trodden and inevitably chart-topping territory."" Writing forThe Evening Standard,external, David Smyth said: ""The edgy music suits the fist-swinging tone: industrial electronic drums, low, nasty synth sounds and high strings and piano which give a sense of unhinged threat rather than beauty."" ""There's not much in the way of a tune but it's naggingly memorable nonetheless. It's unlikely to be many people's new favourite Swift song, demanded in encores for years hence. ""To Swift, who no doubt has plenty of catchier singles ready to go, that's less important than the statement it makes."" The Guardian,external's Maura Johnston wrote: ""Swift's lyrics are visceral and almost sloppy, with her rhyming 'time' and 'time' on the Lorde-channelling pre-chorus, and melodramatically declaring that ""the old Taylor"" is 'dead!'. ""The chorus borrows its cadence from Right Said Fred's 1992 body-shaker I'm Too Sexy, a ridiculous touch that at least cuts the acid a bit.""

Which are worst airports to fly home from?,"Sorry your browser is not supported Summer holidaymakers returning to the UK from the world's busiest airports have suffered the longest average delays from Rome, BBC analysis shows. Passengers waited an average of nearly 29 extra minutes to travel back to the UK from Rome Fiumicino Airport. Venice, Nice and Barcelona were next on the list of longest UK-inbound delays among the 50 airports with the most flights on these routes. The data comes from figures collected by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The analysis, by the BBC's data journalism team, is based on the last two years of CAA data for all flights from or to UK airports during June to August. Earlier analysisshowed that, on flights leaving the UK, holidaymakers heading from Gatwick Airport and on Easyjet flights suffered the longest delays. Flight calculator: At the top of the page you can enter your UK departure city, and your destination, to find average delays for the airlines serving this route in the last two summers. Now, data on the routes used by UK residents returning home, show that six of the 50 airports with the most flights back to the UK had typical delays of more than 25 minutes. This even included internal flights from Gatwick. If the less frequently flown routes are included in the data, then flights to UK airports from Kingston, Jamaica, had the longest average delay of nearly 53 minutes. Six airports on this list recorded average delays of more than 45 minutes in the last two summers. On specific routes, travellers flying from Keflavik Airport in Iceland to Glasgow saw the longest average delay of 55 minutes, followed by Malaga in Spain to Heathrow (54 minutes) and Kingston, Jamaica, to Gatwick (53 minutes). Among the 50 busiest airports for flights to the UK, the worst delays were from Barcelona to Gatwick (31 minutes), followed by Chicago O'Hare Airport to Heathrow (30 minutes) and Palma de Mallorca Airport to Gatwick (30 minutes). Travellers flying from the EU or on European airlines do have a right to compensation. This means: If your flight departed the European Union or was with a European airline, you might have rights under EU law to claim if the delay or cancellation was within the airline's control If your flight's delayed for two or more hours the airline must offer food and drink, access to phone calls and emails, and accommodation if you're delayed overnight - including transfers between the airport and the hotel If you arrive more than three hours late in a journey of less than 1,500km (932 miles) you are entitled to 250 euros (Â£225) in compensation from the airline If you arrive more than three hours late in a journey spanning more than 1,500km, but within the EU, you can get 400 euros in compensation from the carrier Journeys to non-EU destinations more than 3,000km away that arrive between three and four hours late put you in line for 300 euros in airline payouts, while delays longer than four hours to these destinations are due 600 euros in compensation This video can not be played Flight delay compensation: When can you claim? All data used on this page is compiled andmade available by the Civil Aviation Authority,external, which publishes aggregated statistics on punctuality for all flights taking off or landing at major UK airports. The BBC has combined the CAA's data for June, July and August of 2015 and 2016 and used this to calculate the average (i.e. mean) delay per flight across these months for all routes listed in the data. Routes with fewer than 50 flights over this period were excluded, as were airlines that registered no flight data for the summer months of 2016 (even if they had been active in 2015). Chartered flights were not distinguished from scheduled flights in the calculations for airlines that fly both categories on the same route. The data for outbound delays is based on the time the aeroplane takes off from the UK runway, and the data for return delays is based on the time the aeroplane arrives back on the UK runway. Flights that take off or land early are recorded as having a delay of zero minutes.

Jailed viscount abandons Facebook appeal,"Rhodri Colwyn Philipps called Gina Miller a ""troublesome first generation immigrant"" A viscount has abandoned an appeal against his sentence for posting malicious Facebook messages after a judge warned the 12-week prison term could be increased. Rhodri Colwyn Philipps was last monthfound guilty on two countsof making malicious communications. An online post offered Â£5,000 to anyone who ran over businesswoman Gina Miller, and another related to an immigrant. A judge said there was a ""risk"" his sentence could increase if he appealed. Judge Deborah Taylor told Southwark Crown Court it was the court's ""preliminary view"" the viscount's sentence could be increased, and Philipps abandoned his appeal about 15 minutes later. Philipps  - the 4th Viscount St Davids - was sentenced on 13 July, but was released five days later pending the appeal and will now serve the remainder of the prison term. One of the counts related to a post Philipps published on Facebook on 7 November 2016, which referred to Ms Miller, saying: ""Â£5,000 for the first person to 'accidentally' run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant."" Ms Miller was the figurehead for a successful legal challenge which, on 3 November,resulted in the government being told to consult Parliamentbefore formally beginning the Brexit process. In another post, Philipps offered Â£2,000 to the first person to have an immigrant ""carved into pieces"".

Directors clash over Wonder Woman row,"Patty Jenkins says she was not surprised James Cameron didn't get Wonder Woman Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins has hit back after James Cameron called the film a ""step backwards"" for women. The Titanic director has called Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, an ""objectified icon"". Patty Jenkins has responded saying ""there is no right or wrong kind of powerful woman"". She pointed out the film's ""massive female audience who made the film a hit... can surely choose and judge their own icons of progress."" Wonder Woman has broken box office records and is the highest-ever grossing film directed by a woman. Butin an interview with The Guardian,externalJames Cameron said ""the self-congratulatory back-patting"" Hollywood has been doing over Wonder Woman was ""misguided"". ""She's an objectified icon, and it's just male Hollywood doing the same old thing! I'm not saying I didn't like the movie but, to me, it's a step backwards."" The Oscar-winning director compared the character of Wonder Woman to Sarah Connor, the lead role in his Terminator films. ""Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit."" Gal Gadot takes the leading role in Patty Jenkins' film Responding on Twitter,externalPatty Jenkins said that there is not only one way to be a strong woman in film. ""If women always have to be hard, tough and troubled to be strong, and we aren't free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving, then we haven't come very far have we. ""I believe women can and should be EVERYTHING just like male lead characters should be."" And she admitted she wasn't surprised by his reaction. ""James Cameron's inability to understand what Wonder Woman is, or stands for, to women all over the world is unsurprising as, though he is a great film maker he is not a woman.""

Farmers convicted in SA coffin case,"Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson denied any wrongdoing Two white South African farmers who forced a black man into a coffin have been convicted of attempted murder and kidnapping. Victor Mlotshwa, 27, was beaten and made to get into the coffin by Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen in August 2016. The pair will be sentenced on 23 October. They had denied the charges. The case has caused outrage in South Africa and highlighted racial tensions in some farming communities. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Mr Mlotshwa only reported the matter after footage of the assault emerged on YouTube months later. His attackers threatened to douse him in petrol and burn him alive. This video can not be played Convicted SA farmers sadistic - judge In a court affidavit, Jackson and Oosthuizen said they did not mean to harm Mr Mlotshwa but merely wanted to ""teach him a lesson"". They claimed that Mr Mlotshwa had been trespassing on their land. He denied this, saying he was taking a short cut to the shops, where he had been sent by his mother. As Judge Segopotje Mphahlele read out the guilty verdict in Middelburg Magistrates Court on Friday, supporters of the victim burst into songs of celebration. ""I'm relieved that justice has been served,"" Mr Mlotshwa told the BBC. Victor Mlotshwa was walking home when he was kidnapped and assaulted Judge Mphahlele told the court she was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it was clear that the convicted men intended to kill the victim. The prosecutor has asked the court to revoke their bail for security reasons. Shortly after the guilty verdict was delivered to a packed courtroom, the visibly emotional victim, Victor Mlotshwa, told me he was relieved: ""I feel good about the outcome. I'm not saying all white South Africans are racist, but the court must set an example to those who commit such acts."" The video of the assault caused outrage here in South Africa. At one point during Mr Mlotshwa's ordeal, his attackers threatened to bury him alive, even going as far as asking him if he wanted to die fast or slowly. Mr Mlotshwa's mother, Malehlohonolo, also welcomed the ruling. ""The ordeal left my son deeply traumatised... and I'm happy that his attackers have been found guilty,"" she said. ""All I'm asking is for harsh prison sentences for these men."" Family members of the convicted men were also in court. Willem Oosthuizen's wife broke down, saying she was shocked by the outcome. The victim and his attackers live in the same province of Mpumalanga, which is seen as synonymous with such attacks, and many of these incidents go unreported due to fear or intimidation. It is believed that some white farmers attack their black employees, who never report them to police because they fear losing their jobs. This incident lays bare the discrimination that still runs deep in South African society. Many hope that those who commit such crimes will be harshly dealt with by the law.

The man behind Conor McGregor,"With just hours to go before he makes his professional boxing debut, Conor McGregor's coach invites us to his training camp. John Kavanagh's been working with the Irishman for 12 years. On Saturday, the mixed martial artist will make his boxing debut against one of the sport's greatest,Floyd Mayweather. At his Las Vegas base, John Kavanagh tells us how they've been preparing for the fight and what Conor's really like. ""Nothing crazy stood out on day one"", says John. He gets asked a lot whether he could tell if Conor had something special when they first began working together, but the answer is no. ""He walked in just like a couple of hundred fighters before him and a couple of hundred fighters since. ""We've been behind the scene for 10 years before he got noticed and now the last couple of years I'm told he's an overnight success."" Watch a behind the scenes video with John.,external John is based in Dublin and has been working with Conor from the beginning. ""We've been together 12 years now. It sounds like a marriage doesn't it? ""He's like my kid brother. We have our disagreements but the big picture is we're laser focused on the same thing. We both are very passionate about what we do, we both love our sport, and we're very close."" Conor McGregor has posted a picture on Instagram of him training for the fight.,external Conor McGregor is a star of the Ultimate Fighting Championship but when it comes to his personality, what you see is what you get - according to John. ""Honestly, go onto YouTube, put in his name and watch a few interviews, better still watch his interviews from 10 years ago. You will see the same individual, very self-assured (some might say cocky), very confident. ""He makes bold predictions but he backs it up with very, very hard training."" John says Conor is a dream to coach because rather than having to encourage him in the gym, he has to do the opposite. ""I've been doing the sport [MMA] quite a while now, about 20 years and I've never met somebody who trains like him."" John posted a picture of a training session with Conor on Instagram.,external The team has been studying Conor's opponent, Floyd Mayweather, to help prepare for Saturday's fight. ""One good thing I guess we have in our favour is we have 49 boxing fights to study of his and he's got zero boxing fights to study of ours. ""It's kind of like cheating for an exam. We got the exam paper a little bit early. ""We won't make the same mistake as the other 49 guys."" And that's because Floyd Mayweather is unbeaten in all of his 49 professional boxing matches. Despite that, John's feeling confident going into the fight. ""I don't think Conor will edge him by a point or two, I believe he'll stop him and I've said I think he'll stop him in round six.""

Which are the worst airports to fly home from?,"Sorry your browser is not supported Summer holidaymakers returning to the UK from the world's busiest airports have suffered the longest average delays from Rome, BBC analysis shows. Passengers waited an average of nearly 29 extra minutes to travel back to the UK from Rome Fiumicino Airport. Venice, Nice and Barcelona were next on the list of longest UK-inbound delays among the 50 airports with the most flights on these routes. The data comes from figures collected by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The analysis, by the BBC's data journalism team, is based on the last two years of CAA data for all flights from or to UK airports during June to August. Earlier analysisshowed that, on flights leaving the UK, holidaymakers heading from Gatwick Airport and on Easyjet flights suffered the longest delays. Flight calculator: At the top of the page you can enter your UK departure city, and your destination, to find average delays for the airlines serving this route in the last two summers. Now, data on the routes used by UK residents returning home, show that six of the 50 airports with the most flights back to the UK had typical delays of more than 25 minutes. This even included internal flights from Gatwick. If the less frequently flown routes are included in the data, then flights to UK airports from Kingston, Jamaica, had the longest average delay of nearly 53 minutes. Six airports on this list recorded average delays of more than 45 minutes in the last two summers. On specific routes, travellers flying from Keflavik Airport in Iceland to Glasgow saw the longest average delay of 55 minutes, followed by Malaga in Spain to Heathrow (54 minutes) and Kingston, Jamaica, to Gatwick (53 minutes). Among the 50 busiest airports for flights to the UK, the worst delays were from Barcelona to Gatwick (31 minutes), followed by Chicago O'Hare Airport to Heathrow (30 minutes) and Palma de Mallorca Airport to Gatwick (30 minutes). Travellers flying from the EU or on European airlines do have a right to compensation. This means: If your flight departed the European Union or was with a European airline, you might have rights under EU law to claim if the delay or cancellation was within the airline's control If your flight's delayed for two or more hours the airline must offer food and drink, access to phone calls and emails, and accommodation if you're delayed overnight - including transfers between the airport and the hotel If you arrive more than three hours late in a journey of less than 1,500km (932 miles) you are entitled to 250 euros (Â£225) in compensation from the airline If you arrive more than three hours late in a journey spanning more than 1,500km, but within the EU, you can get 400 euros in compensation from the carrier Journeys to non-EU destinations more than 3,000km away that arrive between three and four hours late put you in line for 300 euros in airline payouts, while delays longer than four hours to these destinations are due 600 euros in compensation This video can not be played Flight delay compensation: When can you claim? All data used on this page is compiled andmade available by the Civil Aviation Authority,external, which publishes aggregated statistics on punctuality for all flights taking off or landing at major UK airports. The BBC has combined the CAA's data for June, July and August of 2015 and 2016 and used this to calculate the average (i.e. mean) delay per flight across these months for all routes listed in the data. Routes with fewer than 50 flights over this period were excluded, as were airlines that registered no flight data for the summer months of 2016 (even if they had been active in 2015). Chartered flights were not distinguished from scheduled flights in the calculations for airlines that fly both categories on the same route. The data for outbound delays is based on the time the aeroplane takes off from the UK runway, and the data for return delays is based on the time the aeroplane arrives back on the UK runway. Flights that take off or land early are recorded as having a delay of zero minutes.

Three die as India guru convicted of rape,"This video can not be played Violent clashes have taken place in Panchkula (footage by Sudeep Sachdeva) At least 23 people have been killed in violent protests over the rape conviction of a popular religious leader in north India. The victims are believed to be Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's followers. Angry supporters rampaged through Panchkula town, near Chandigarh. About 2,500 of Singh's followers have been arrested, police said. Earlier, his devotees smashed cars and set media vans alight, saying he was innocent. More than 200,000 of his followers had flocked to the Chandigarh area ahead of Friday's verdict.

They fired tear-gas canisters and water cannon into the crowd to try to restore control, says the BBC's Ravinder Singh Robin in Panchkula. However, the region's police chief BS Sandhu said the violence was now under control.

Flying home: The longest delays revealed,"Sorry your browser is not supported Summer holidaymakers returning to the UK from the world's busiest airports have suffered the longest average delays from Rome, BBC analysis shows. Passengers waited an average of nearly 29 extra minutes to travel back to the UK from Rome Fiumicino Airport. Venice, Nice and Barcelona were next on the list of longest UK-inbound delays among the 50 airports with the most flights on these routes. The data comes from figures collected by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The analysis, by the BBC's data journalism team, is based on the last two years of CAA data for all flights from or to UK airports during June to August. Earlier analysisshowed that, on flights leaving the UK, holidaymakers heading from Gatwick Airport and on Easyjet flights suffered the longest delays. Flight calculator: At the top of the page you can enter your UK departure city, and your destination, to find average delays for the airlines serving this route in the last two summers. Now, data on the routes used by UK residents returning home, show that six of the 50 airports with the most flights back to the UK had typical delays of more than 25 minutes. This even included internal flights from Gatwick. If the less frequently flown routes are included in the data, then flights to UK airports from Kingston, Jamaica, had the longest average delay of nearly 53 minutes. Six airports on this list recorded average delays of more than 45 minutes in the last two summers. On specific routes, travellers flying from Keflavik Airport in Iceland to Glasgow saw the longest average delay of 55 minutes, followed by Malaga in Spain to Heathrow (54 minutes) and Kingston, Jamaica, to Gatwick (53 minutes). Among the 50 busiest airports for flights to the UK, the worst delays were from Barcelona to Gatwick (31 minutes), followed by Chicago O'Hare Airport to Heathrow (30 minutes) and Palma de Mallorca Airport to Gatwick (30 minutes). Travellers flying from the EU or on European airlines do have a right to compensation. This means: If your flight departed the European Union or was with a European airline, you might have rights under EU law to claim if the delay or cancellation was within the airline's control If your flight's delayed for two or more hours the airline must offer food and drink, access to phone calls and emails, and accommodation if you're delayed overnight - including transfers between the airport and the hotel If you arrive more than three hours late in a journey of less than 1,500km (932 miles) you are entitled to 250 euros (Â£225) in compensation from the airline If you arrive more than three hours late in a journey spanning more than 1,500km, but within the EU, you can get 400 euros in compensation from the carrier Journeys to non-EU destinations more than 3,000km away that arrive between three and four hours late put you in line for 300 euros in airline payouts, while delays longer than four hours to these destinations are due 600 euros in compensation This video can not be played Flight delay compensation: When can you claim? All data used on this page is compiled andmade available by the Civil Aviation Authority,external, which publishes aggregated statistics on punctuality for all flights taking off or landing at major UK airports. The BBC has combined the CAA's data for June, July and August of 2015 and 2016 and used this to calculate the average (i.e. mean) delay per flight across these months for all routes listed in the data. Routes with fewer than 50 flights over this period were excluded, as were airlines that registered no flight data for the summer months of 2016 (even if they had been active in 2015). Chartered flights were not distinguished from scheduled flights in the calculations for airlines that fly both categories on the same route. The data for outbound delays is based on the time the aeroplane takes off from the UK runway, and the data for return delays is based on the time the aeroplane arrives back on the UK runway. Flights that take off or land early are recorded as having a delay of zero minutes. Produced by Ryan Watts, Ed Lowther, Nassos Stylianou, Ransome Mpini, Daniel Dunford, Gerry Fletcher, Becky Rush, Joe Reed, and Kevin Peachey. Where in UK are worst flight delays?

Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think?,"""Killer robots"" may seem like something from a sci-fi film, but reality is catching up More than 100 of the world's top robotics experts wrote a letter to the United Nations recently calling for a ban on the development of ""killer robots"" and warning of a new arms race. But are their fears really justified? Entire regiments of unmanned tanks; drones that can spot an insurgent in a crowd of civilians; and weapons controlled by computerised ""brains"" that learn like we do, are all among the ""smart"" tech being unleashed by an arms industry many believe is now entering a""third revolution in warfare"". ""In every sphere of the battlefield - in the air, on the sea, under the sea or on the land - the military around the world are now demonstrating prototype autonomous weapons,"" says Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence at Sydney's New South Wales University. ""New technologies like deep learning are helping drive this revolution. The tech space is clearly leading the charge, and the military is playing catch-up."" Russian arms maker Kalashnikov is developing a suite of fully automated weapons One reported breakthrough giving killer machine opponents sleepless nights is Kalashnikov's ""neural net"" combat module. It features a 7.62mm machine gun and a camera attached to a computer system that its makers claim can make its own targeting judgements without any human control. AI fighter pilot wins in combat simulation According to Russia's state-run Tass news agency it uses ""neural network technologies that enable it to identify targets and make decisions"". Unlike a conventional computer that uses pre-programmed instructions to tackle a specific but limited range of predictable possibilities, a neural network is designed to learn from previous examples then adapt to circumstances it may not have encountered before. Would robot combat systems make fewer mistakes than humans? And it is this supposed ability to make its own decisions that is worrying to many. ""If weapons are using neural networks and advanced artificial intelligence then we wouldn't necessarily know the basis on which they made the decision to attack - and that's very dangerous,"" says Andrew Nanson, chief technology officer at defence specialist Ultra Electronics. But he remains sceptical about some of the claims arms manufacturers are making. Automated defence systems can already make decisions based on an analysis of a threat - the shape, size, speed and trajectory of an incoming missile, for example - and choose an appropriate response much faster than humans can. But what happens when such systems encounter something they have no experience of, but are still given the freedom to act using a ""best guess"" approach? Mistakes could be disastrous - the killing of innocent civilians; the destruction of non-military targets;  ""friendly fire"" attacks on your own side. Remotely piloted drones have been used to carry out missile attacks since 2001 And this is what many experts fear, not that AI will become too smart - taking over the world like the Skynet supercomputer from the Terminator films - but that it's too stupid. ""The current problems are not with super-intelligent robots but with pretty dumb ones that cannot flexibly discriminate between civilian targets and military targets except in very narrowly contained settings,"" says Noel Sharkey, professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at Sheffield University. Despite such concerns, Kalashnikov's latest products are not the only autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons being trialled in Russia. The Uran-9 is an unmanned ground combat vehicle and features a machine gun and 30mm cannon. It can be remotely controlled at distances of up to 10km. How your digital self could 'live' on after you die Is 'tap and go' a better way to give to charity? Can hi-res music hit the right note? Better drugs, faster: The potential of AI-powered humans And the diminutive Platform-M combat robot boasts automated targeting and can operate in extremes of heat and cold. Meanwhile the Armata T-14 ""super tank"" has an autonomous turret that designer Andrei Terlikov claims will pave the way for fully autonomous tanks on the battlefield. Manufacturer Uralvagonzavod also didn't respond to BBC requests for an interview, but Prof Sharkey - who is a member of pressure group The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots - is wary of its potential. ""The T-14 is years ahead of the West, and the idea of thousands of autonomous T-14s sitting on the border with Europe does not bear thinking about,"" he says. And it's not just Russia developing such weapons. Prof Toby Walsh says all militaries are developing autonomous weapons Last summer, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) equipped an ordinary surveillance drone with advanced AI designed to discern between civilians and insurgents during a test over a replica Middle Eastern village in Massachusetts. And Samsung's SGR-A1 sentry gun, capable of firing autonomously, has been deployed along the South Korean side of the Korean Demilitarised Zone. The UK's Taranis drone - which is roughly the size of a Red Arrow Hawk fighter jet - is being developed by BAE Systems. It is designed to carry a myriad of weapons long distances and will have ""elements"" of full autonomy, BAE says. At sea, the USA's Sea Hunter autonomous warship is designed to operate for extended periods at sea without a single crew member, and to even guide itself in and out of port. The Sea Hunter can operate without a single crew member All the Western arms manufacturers contacted by the BBC, including Boeing's Phantom Works,  Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, refused to co-operate with this feature, an indication perhaps of the controversial nature of this technology. But could autonomous military technology also be used simply as support for human military operations? Roland Sonnenberg, head of defence at consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, says combat simulation, logistics, threat analysis and back office functions are the more mundane - but equally important - aspects of warfare that robots and AI could perform. ""The benefits that AI has to offer are only useful if they can be applied effectively in the real world and will only be broadly adopted if companies, consumers and society trust the technology and take a responsible approach,"" he says. BAE Systems says its Taranis unmanned military drone will include ""full autonomy elements"" And some argue that autonomous weapons could actually reduce the number of human casualties. But Elizabeth Quintana, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, disagrees. ""Deploying robotic systems might be more attractive to politicians because there would be fewer body bags coming home. ""My view is that war is an inherently human activity and that if you wage war from a distance at another group or country, they will find a way to hurt you at home because that is the only way that they can retaliate."" The prospect of autonomous weapons systems inadvertently leading to an escalation in domestic terrorism or cyber-warfare is perhaps another reason to treat this new tech with caution.

DVLA bans 'offensive' licence plates,"Do these ""suppressed"" vehicle registration marks cause ""upset or offence""? More than 300 number plates have been banned from use when the 67 vehicle registrations are released next week. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has withheld them because they are deemed potentially offensive. Among those are MU67 DER, BU67 GER, DO67 GER, BA67 ARD, MU67 GER, HU67 WLY and OR67 SAM. Other ""words"" like AF67 HAN and NE67 ECT also make the list. A DVLA spokesman said it had a responsibility to ensure plates do not ""cause upset or offence"". In June, the Swansea-based agency admitted that a plate JH11 HAD ""slipped through the net"". To certain eyes, or on some deliberately-designed plates, a 6 can look like a ""G"" or an ""S"" A 7 can be read as a ""T"" or even an ""L"" And when put together, the number 67 can be read by some as an ""R"" - but only if you look really, really hard Words which look as if they spell the word jihad among the new plates have also been banned, information supplied under the Freedom of Information Act to BBC Wales has shown. Also on the list are a range of plates that start with the word NO and end with another complete three-letter word (and the 67 is irrelevant), including NO67 DAD,  NO67 FUN, NO67 MUM and NO67 SON. The spokesman said: ""The agency applies a clear policy of withholding potentially offensive registration numbers equally to normal issue series and those made available to purchase from our sales team. ""Such numbers are withheld if they are likely to cause offence or embarrassment to the general population in this country on the grounds of political, racial and religious sensitivities or simply because they are in poor taste when displayed correctly on a number plate.""

Trainor's anger over anti-gay marriage ad,"Pop star Meghan Trainor has said it is ""so wrong"" that her face has been used in an anti-gay marriage campaign in Australia without her consent. Australia is set to hold a non-binding postal vote on whether same-sex marriage should be made legal. The ad, on a Facebook page, featured her image and lyrics from her 2016 song No, urging people to vote against it. Trainor, a vocal supporter of gay marriage, was alerted to the poster by a fan. The American singer condemned the ad's message and stressed her support for marriage equality. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The administrators of a Facebook page that shared the image have since taken it down and issued an apology, saying it was sent in by a contributor and they had not recognised Trainor in the image. When asked by a newspaper in 2015, Trainor said if she could pass any law she wanted she ""would pass gay marriage everywhere. Everyone should be able to love who they want"". The issue of legalising same-sex marriage has dominated the Australian political scene over the past month, with both sides lobbying hard. How will the postal vote work? Why is there talk of a boycott? One of the country's most high-profile business leaders, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce,reiterated his supportthis week, saying he would be campaigning strongly for a ""Yes"" vote. Hollywood stars including Chris Hemsworth, Miley Cyrus and Margot Robbie have also pledged their support for same-sex marriage. The $A122m (Â£74m; $96m) postal vote has been criticised for being expensive and a waste of resources, as government MPs will not be bound to vote in line with the public when it comes to legislating any changes. The mail method of voting has also been criticised for potentially alienating younger voters, sparking a concerted ""get the vote out"" campaign from same-sex marriage lobby over the past few weeks. On Friday, the Australian Electoral Commission revealed that more than 90,000 new voters had enrolled in the past fortnight. The commission says it has processed more than 765,000 enrolment transactions since the announcement of the vote. More than 16 million Australians will be able to vote. The first survey forms will be sent out from 12 September and are to be returned by 27 October. The results are due to be announced on 15 November.

Samsung heir jailed for corruption,"This video can not be played Lee Jae-yong was led away from the court in Seoul and onto a bus to prison A court in South Korea has sentenced Samsung's billionaire heir-apparent Lee Jae-yong to five years in prison for corruption. Lee was convicted of bribery in a scandal that also saw the impeachment of South Korea's former president. The case has gripped the public amid growing anger against South Korea's biggest companies, known as chaebols. Lee, who denied all charges, had faced a jail sentence of up to 12 years. Also known as Jay Y Lee, the de facto head of the world's largest smartphone maker had been detained since February on a string of corruption charges. These included bribery, embezzlement and hiding assets overseas. What did he do? The 49-year-old is accused of giving donations worth 41bn won ($36m; Â£29m) to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of South Korea's former President Park Geun-hye, in return for political favours. Prosecutors said the donations were made to Ms Park's confidante to win government support for a big restructuring of Samsung that would strengthen Lee's control over Samsung Electronics. But Lee's defence team said that the payments were signed off without his knowledge. Lee has previously admitted that the firm also gave a horse and money to help the equestrian career of Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, but denied seeking favours. What does the jailing of its heir mean for Samsung? Samsung scandal: Who is Lee Jae-yong? Is real reform possible at South Korea's chaebols? The tragedy of South Korea's Park Geun-hye Samsung says sorry for scandal His lawyer said on Friday they would appeal against the court's decision. ""We are confident the ruling will be overturned,"" Song Wu-cheol said. The case contributed to President Park's eventual impeachment and she now faces trial for corruption herself, something she denies. Her friend Choi has already been jailed forthree years after being found guiltyof using her position of influence to solicit favours for her daughter. Chung Yoo-ra won a gold medal for dressage in the 2014 Asian Games On Friday, two other Samsung executives, Choi Gee-sung and Chang Choong-ki, were also convicted in the same trial as Lee and sentenced to four years in prison. Former Samsung Electronics president Park Sang-jin and executive vice-president Hwang Sung-soo were handed suspended sentences. Analysis - by the BBC's Yogita Limaye in Seoul This isn't the first time a top executive of a big conglomerate has been convicted for corruption in South Korea. But in the past, they've either been given suspended sentences or have been pardoned by the president. The new president, Moon Jae-in, has already said there will be no more presidential pardons. South Korean protesters shouted slogans against Mr Lee in front of the court in Seoul So if Lee's sentence is upheld by higher courts and he ends up serving his complete sentence in jail or a significant part of it, that will be a departure from what we've seen in South Korea in the past. And the new government says that will be a strong message to chaebols that they need to clean up the way they do business. The conviction represents a huge blow to South Korea's biggest and most well-known business empire. Since the verdict, Samsung shares fell by 1%. It also raises questions about the future leadership of the family-run conglomerate. Lee has been standing in as chairman since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack in 2014. Lee has two sisters, who are in management roles in different parts of the Samsung group, but it is unclear whether they could be brought in to higher positions. Since Lee's arrest six months ago, the group's business operations have continued largely unaffected. Samsung Electronics posted a record profitof 11tn won for the latest quarter and the firm has released itsnew flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone, closing the book on the disastrous recall of the exploding Galaxy Note 7. The Samsung Group, made up of 60 interlinked companies, is crucial to the South Korean economy, with sales equivalent to about a fifth of the national GDP. The chaebol includes a shipbuilding division, a construction company, and pharmaceuticals and advertising arms. The word chaebol is a combination of the Korean words for clan and wealth It is the name given to South Korea's massive family-run business empires that wield huge influence in the country They normally own numerous international enterprises Other examples include LG, Lotte and Hyundai Read more:Chaebols: S Korea's corporate fiefdoms South Korea's presidential scandal Galaxy Note 8: Samsung's phoenix phone?

Watkins abuse case police criticised,"This video can not be played How police missed chances in Ian Watkins child abuse case Police missed a number of chances to bring paedophile Ian Watkins to justice sooner, an investigation has found. Between 2008 and 2012, South Wales Police failed to adequately act on eight reports and three intelligence logs from six people about the former Lostprophets frontman's intentions. Watkins received a35-year sentencein 2013 for 13 child sex offences. The force accepted the Independent Police Complaints Commission's (IPCC) findings and ""serious concern"" raised. IPCC Commissioner for Wales Jan Williams said the way the reports were handled was subject to conscious or unconscious bias. This video can not be played IPCC Commissioner for Wales Jan Williams said the case was the most ""disturbing and distressing"" she had dealt with ""This investigation raised the most disturbing concerns about the way in which reports of Ian Watkins' sickening child abuse were handled between 2008 and 2012,"" she said. ""Watkins' arrest for his depraved activities followed only after an arrest for drugs offences, an added cause for serious concern."" The IPCC investigation was launched in 2013 following a referral by South Wales Police. It found the force did not examine the mobile phone of Watkins' ex-girlfriend Joanne Mjadzelics in 2009, which had a message revealing his wish to have sex with children, and provided corroboration to other reports. This video can not be played Joanne Mjedzelics says she repeatedly reported Watkins to police There was no evidence to show there was a lack of police action because of Watkins' celebrity status, however the belief that Ms Mjadzelics lacked credibility led to adequate steps not being taken to progress reports. Several other individuals also came forward, some through Crimestoppers, with disturbing information about Watkins' behaviour, the IPCC found. But it was the drugs arrest which led to further action. Watkins admitted the child sex offences and was told he must serve at least 29 years in prison. ""In my view, all the reports made were subject to a biased response, whether this was conscious or unconscious,"" Ms Williams added. ""Some were conflated with reports made by Ms Mjadzelics and were thus dismissed as lacking credibility. ""All those involved in responding accepted the initial sceptical view of Ms Mjadzelics' reports, demonstrating a lack of open-mindedness and professional curiosity. ""This continued until 'the right type of complainant came along'."" The report did not detail why police felt Ms Mjadzelics was considered to lack credibility or what the ""right type of complainant"" was. This video can not be played Children's Commissioner for Wales Dr Sally Holland said police forces would ""sit back and think"" after the report Ms Mjadzelics wascleared in 2015of child sex abuse image offences. She claimed she had encouraged the singer to send the images in order to expose his criminality. She said the IPCC report ""finally vindicates"" her and ""accepts that from the outset I was telling the truth and trying to bring a serious criminal sexual predator to justice"". Ms Mjadzelics added: ""The IPCC report highlights what I already believed about how South Wales Police treated me and others and whilst I am pleased it is now in the public domain I am seeking legal advice on further action against the police arising from the series of events and my treatment."" South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said: ""Today's report highlights a number of failings in which information about Watkins was investigated between 2008 and 2012 which the force entirely accepts and regrets. ""South Wales Police failed to listen and properly investigate information about Watkins' offending behaviour, for this we are truly sorry."" Earlier this year, a detective sergeant wascleared of misconductover the case and no further action was taken against two detective constables. The IPCC has also previously released findings from investigations into howSouth Yorkshire Policeand Bedfordshire Police handled allegations made to them about Watkins. Wales' Children's Commissioner Sally Holland said: ""It is disturbing to think that such a catalogue of basic errors can take place in Wales in the 21st Century, which led to a four-year delay in bringing Watkins to justice. There can be no defence or excuse."" NSPCC Cymru said the report's ""damning conclusions should be a wake-up call for all those involved"".

Ex-PM Yingluck 'flees Thailand',"Ms Yingluck is the sister of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, who fled Thailand in 2008 Former Thai PM Yingluck Shinawatra has fled abroad, sources say, ahead of a verdict in her trial over a rice subsidy scheme. Sources in her party say she made the decision to leave unexpectedly, shortly before she was due to appear at the Supreme Court on negligence charges. Her lawyers told the court she had been unable to attend because she was ill. But when she failed to appear, the court issued an arrest warrant for her and confiscated her bail. Judges also postponed the verdict until 27 September. Ms Yingluck has denied any wrongdoing in the scheme which cost Thailand billions of dollars. If found guilty at the end of her two-year trial, she could be jailed for up to 10 years and permanently banned from politics. Sources within Ms Yingluck's Puea Thai Party told Reuters that she had ""definitely left Thailand"" but did not give details of her whereabouts. Thailand on edge for Yingluck trial verdict Profile: Yingluck Shinawatra Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads Thailand's military government, said all routes out of the country were being closely monitored. ""I just learned that she did not show up [at court],"" he told reporters. ""I have ordered border checkpoints to be stepped up."" Deputy PM Prawit Wongsuwan initially said he had no information on Ms Yingluck's whereabouts but as he left a meeting in Bangkok he said: ""It is possible that she has fled already."" Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC News, Bangkok Yingluck Shinawatra was the most high-profile criminal defendant in Thailand and was constantly monitored by the military authorities. So how was she able to leave the country just hours before the verdict was due to be read out? Immigration authorities say they have no record of her leaving the country. However, it is a poorly-concealed secret that some in the military government would have been happy to see her leave the country before the verdict. Had she been convicted and jailed, she could have been seen as a victim by her supporters. The government was nervous about their reaction. Acquitting her, though, would have been equally unacceptable to her hard-line opponents, many of them very influential. That would also have undermined the justification for the military coup which overthrew her government. So it is unlikely anyone tried to stop her leaving, or that they will try to get her back. She could have gone to the VIP area of one of Bangkok's airports and taken a private jet out of the country or she might have driven across the border into Cambodia or Laos. However she is most likely to have joined her brother, former prime ministerThaksin Shinawatra, who has been living mainly in Dubai since he went into exile, fleeing a Supreme Court verdict, in 2008. Ms Yingluck's lawyer had requested a delay in the ruling, telling the Supreme Court that she had vertigo and a severe headache and was unable to attend. But the court said in a statement it did not believe she was sick as there was no medical certificate and that the claimed sickness was not severe enough to prevent her travelling to court. ""Such behaviour convincingly shows that she is a flight risk. As a result, the court has issued an arrest warrant and confiscated the posted bail money,"" the statement said. Ms Yingluck posted $900,000 (Â£703,000) bail at the beginning of her trial. Journalists waited outside Ms Yingluck's home in Bangkok, expecting her to attend the court Friday's turn of events took many by surprise, including the hundreds of people who turned up outside the Supreme Court in Bangkok to support Ms Yingluck. BBC Thai reporter Nanchanok Wongsamuth said the announcement prompted shocked reactions in the courtroom, and then a flurry of activity as journalists ran out to report the news. Ms Yingluck, who became Thailand's first female prime minister in 2011, was impeached in 2015 over the rice scheme by a military-backed legislature, which then brought the legal case. The scheme, part of Ms Yingluck's election campaign platform, launched shortly after she took office. It was aimed at boosting farmers' incomes and alleviating rural poverty, and saw the government paying farmers nearly twice the market rate for their crop. But it hit Thailand's rice exports hard, leading to a loss of at least $8bn and huge stockpiles of rice which the government could not sell. Though it was popular with her rural voter base, opponents said the scheme was too expensive and open to corruption. Hundreds of Ms Yingluck's supporters had gathered outside the court During her trial, Ms Yingluck had argued she was not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme. She has insisted she is a victim of political persecution. In another development on Friday, former Thai minister Boonsong Teriyapirom was jailed for 42 years in connection with the rice subsidy scheme. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says the exceptionally heavy sentence for Mr Boonsong suggests the court would not have been lenient with Ms Yingluck and it is possible she was warned about this before making her decision to flee. Ms Yingluck's time in office was overshadowed by controversy as well as strong political opposition. The youngest sister of Mr Thaksin, she was seen by her opponents as a proxy for her brother, who was controversially ousted by the military in 2006. Both siblings remain popular among the rural poor, but are hated by an urban and middle-class elite. Their Puea Thai party has - under various different names - won every election in Thailand since 2001. Some of Ms Yingluck's supporters outside the court on Friday expressed understanding at her failure to show. ""The Thai prime minister has done her best, she has sacrificed a lot,"" said Seksan Chalitaporn, 64. ""Now the people have to fight for themselves."" Telecommunications billionaire Mr Thaksin, who once owned Manchester City FC, has lived in self-imposed exile since leaving Thailand. It is believed he travels between homes in London, Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore. May 2011- Yingluck Shinawatra is elected PM, and shortly afterwards begins rolling out her rice subsidy scheme. January 2014- Thailand's anti-corruption authoritiesinvestigate Ms Yingluckin connection to the scheme. May 2014- She is forced to step down from her post after Thailand's constitutional court finds her guilty of abuse of power in another case. Weeks later the military ousts what remains of her government. January 2015- An army-backed legislatureimpeaches Ms Yingluckfor corruption over her role in the rice scheme, which effectively bans her from politics for five years. It also launches legal proceedings against her. August 2017- Ms Yingluck fails to appear at court for the verdict, claiming ill health.

The Beatles in Bangor: The turning point,"This video can not be played When Beatlemania steamed into Bangor in 1967 Fifty years ago The Beatles arrived in Bangor - but their visit caused a stir not only among fans but the media. It was the place where they found out their manager had died, an event which some say marked the beginning of the end for the group. It was 25 August 1967 and they had just released their eighth studio album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. They were at a career high-point and decided to visit Bangor - but not to play a concert. Prof Chris Collins, head of music at Bangor University, said the band's visit to north Wales was unusual from the start. George Harrison, the Beatles guitarist, had met Maharishi Yogi, a guru in Transcendental Meditation -  a form of silent meditation - who had invited them to his conference in the Gwynedd city. ""George Harrison had become very interested in what the Maharishi was teaching and he'd taken John and Paul to a session in London, which was immediately followed by the retreat here in Bangor at what was the Normal College, now part of Bangor University,"" Prof Collins said. ""They simply jumped on a train and were here within hours of deciding to do that. ""The press were certainly very much clued into what was happening. There was a great interest in the fact that The Beatles seemed to have discovered eastern mysticism and there were suspicions around that in the press at the time. ""It really brought everyone to Bangor to follow them, as well as creating great interest locally."" John Lennon shortly before the train's departure from Euston Station to Bangor It was not just the press who came - the fans flocked too. The Beatles stayed in the Normal College, now the university's Management Centre. Len Jones was one of the gardeners there at the time and said they caused quite a stir. ""I came here at eight o'clock in the morning to start work and there were hundreds of people here. They were singing and they were meditating,"" he had said previously . ""The Beatles came then, you couldn't move with hundreds of people, especially the girls. And they were all screaming 'Beeeeatles, where are yooooooouuu'? ""The whole college, everybody stopped work for a day or two. It was heaven and it really put Bangor on the map."" But The Beatles would not be in Bangor for long. They arrived on Friday -  and on Sunday, the payphone rang in the corridor of the university halls where they were staying. Eventually, someone answered the phone and Paul McCartney received the news that their manager Brian Epstein had been found dead. On hearing the news about Brian Epstein, The Beatles decided to return to London. Freelance journalist Derek Bellis was called to Bangor to interview The Beatles about the news. ""It was a strange occasion, I suppose surreal is the word that sums it up,"" Mr Bellis recalled. ""John did most of the talking and he said that the Maharishi had said they were to remember the happy things and the constructive things. ""It felt as if the Maharishi had made some quite neutral remarks, as you might describe them."" Historians said it was a turning point for The Beatles. Without Epstein to hold the group together, they spent more and more time on their own projects before splitting up in 1970. ""Coming to Bangor was George Harrison's thing, but John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr went along with it. After Brian Epstein's death, that didn't happen so much, and The Beatles started to follow their own individual routes,"" Prof Collins said. Yet people in Bangor are still proud of their connection with the band. ""There are all the stories that everybody knows who lives in Bangor,"" added Prof Collins. ""Like The Beatles' visit to the Chinese restaurant, where George had a bank note in the sole of his shoe and that was the only way they could afford to pay for it because they didn't carry money with them. ""You have photographs of Paul McCartney in odd places just off College Road, which are part of people's local awareness of The Beatles. ""If you live in Bangor and a new book comes out about The Beatles, the first thing you do is turn to the index and look up Bangor! ""It's always there and you can read that bit about when The Beatles came into your world briefly."" That connection is still marked to this day - there is a plaque in the university and a slate slab in the high street recalling those three days in 1967 when The Beatles brought the attention of the world to Bangor.

Titchmarsh vows to save Queen's tree,"This video can not be played Alan Titchmarsh said it would be unacceptable to disregard the trees TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh has hit out at a road-widening scheme that threatens a swathe of Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) woodland. The RHS said there were two options to widen the A3 in Surrey as part ofM25 improvements,externaland one would take out a bank of trees including giant redwoods. The scheme could see RHS Wisley lose 500 trees, including one planted by the Queen to mark her silver jubilee. Highways England said the gardens would benefit from ""better, safer access"". But Titchmarsh, an RHS ambassador, described the plan as ""garden-grabbing"" and said: ""We must stand together and protect our gardens. ""I'm calling on the UK's army of 27 million gardeners to make it known that a disregard for these important trees and lack of appreciation of the national importance of this garden would not be acceptable."" The gardens attract 1.2m visitors each year A protective bank of trees separates the ""trials field"" from the A3 RHS director general Sue Biggs said the loss of the trees would be ""criminal"" Expanding the A3 to the west would take out trees more than 100 years old, several giant redwoods and five trees identified as ""threatened and endangered in cultivation"", the RHS said. Early autumn for 'stressed' trees RHS director general Sue Biggs said: ""It would be criminal for this irreplaceable woodland to be lost when another viable plan would avoid cutting down these century-old trees and still meet the important need to widen the A3."" The charity wants Highways England to choose the option on the east of the A3, which it said would not take woodland from Wisley and would provide better road access to the gardens, which attract 1.2m visitors each year.

Man dies in police 999 call car crash,"A pedestrian has been knocked over and killed by a police car responding to an emergency call in Brighton. David Ormesher, 79, of Poole in Dorset, was hit at 00:50 BST. He died at the scene, in Devonshire Place, Kemptown. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it was investigating whether the police car's lights and siren were on at the time. It said the speed the marked police car was going was being looked at, and CCTV footage was being sought. IPCC investigators attended the scene in the early hours, and house-to-house inquiries had been taking place. IPCC associate commissioner Tom Milsom urged anyone who saw or heard anything to contact them. ""It is important for all of those affected that we establish the circumstances surrounding the collision,"" he said. The area has been cordoned off by police Supt Paul Betts, of Sussex Police, said it was a tragic incident and police tried to help the man at the scene. ""Officers immediately called for assistance and performed first aid, but sadly the man died,"" he said. ""The officers involved are understandably extremely distraught. ""We have spoken with his family to whom I offer my deepest sympathies."" Amanda Douglas, who lives on nearby Edward Street, said she looked out of her window after hearing ""a big loud crash"". ""There was a guy on the road, he wasn't moving. ""The police had just stopped and they were getting out of their car. ""They've raced up there, and I think it was the driver who immediately started to resuscitate him,"" she said. Both Devonshire Place and Edward Street were closed in both directions, and Brighton and Hove Buses diverted its vehicles along the seafront. Allow Twitter content?

What happens at Jackson Hole?,"More than 700,000 people visited Grand Teton National Park in July For a few days every August, a remote Wyoming valley known for mountain views and wildlife sightings sets the stage for serious talk about interest rates, inflation and the world's labour markets. How did Jackson Hole - more than 2,000 miles west of Washington DC - become a favoured retreat for central bankers and economists from around the world? Officially, the answer is work. A regional branch of the US Federal Reserve hosts an annual conference each August at the Jackson Lake Lodge in the heart of Grand Teton National Park. But as with the millions of other tourists who pass through the area every summer, nature was the original draw. The Kansas City Federal Reserve, one of the US central bank's regional entities, started holding an annual conference in 1978. In the early years, the discussions focused on agriculture, but organisers had aspirations for a more high-profile event. The hope was that the location - in the middle of a national park - might help woo then Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, who was known to be ""fond of fly-fishing"", the bank'shistory of the event,externalrecounts. ""I said we need a place for our next symposium (where) people can fish for trout,"" recalled Tom Davis, a former senior vice-president and head of economic research at the Kansas City Federal Reserve. Former US Vice-President Dick Cheney goes fly-fishing in Wyoming Mr Volcker accepted, but did reportedly raise questions about the distance. ""He said, 'Roger, how in the hell did you ever get to Jackson, Wyoming?'"" former Federal Reserve president Roger Guffey said. Indeed. Jackson Hole has been a haunt for plutocrats for decades. John D. Rockefeller, heir to the Standard Oil fortune, vacationed there, famously buying up thousands of acres that eventually formed much of what is now Grand Teton National Park. The valley counts actors Sandra Bullock and Harrison Ford among its homeowners. Celebrity sightings include Pippa Middleton, while singer James Blunt recorded the music video for his song Bonfire Heart in the area. ""It's one of the most beautiful spots in the United States and it is sometimes hard to tear oneself away from the views to go back inside and listen to more discussions about monetary policy,"" said economist Alan Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley, who will be speaking at the conference this year. Bill and Hillary Clinton vacationed in Jackson Hole in 1995 The Federal Reserve knows the prime location is part of the conference's popularity, but officials are alert to any implication that the conference is just an excuse for a luxury escape. ""The symposium is not considered a vacation getaway,"" the bank insists in its materials. ""Jackson Hole is well known for its many resorts catering to outdoors enthusiasts from around the world, but the symposium is held each year at the Lodge, which, in line with its National Park setting, does not have some accommodations commonly found at other sites, such as a spa, exercise room or salon. In fact, televisions are not available in the Lodge's rooms."" (Thewebsite of the hotel,externalis a bit more enthusiastic, citing ""all the amenities and guest services you would expect from a full-service resort"".) A spokesman for the Federal Reserve declined to reveal how much the event costs, what participants are charged or how it is kept within the venue's capacity limits. The company that runs the Jackson Lake Lodge for the National Park Service also declined to comment on the event or how quickly the 300-plus rooms at the lodge get booked. (Cabins and camp sites are also a possibility.) Nothing appeared to be available this weekend, but some rooms were going for about Â£270 a night at the start of September if you can stand a 14-hour flight from London, according to hotel booking websites. Technically, the lodge, as a National Park Service facility, remains open to the public throughout the event. In 2014, a group of green-shirted protesters crashed the party. They were convinced to return to meet with officials in amore formal capacity,externaltwo years later. The tiny town of Jackson, a 45-minute drive south from the hotel, sees about four million people pass through every summer. Visitors are such a reliable crowd that the  Jackson Hole Travel and Tourism Board focuses its promotion efforts on other seasons, says its boss, Kate Sollitt. So while investors around the world may be alert to any hints given by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi on Friday, locals say it's practically a non-event. ""The majority of our community doesn't even know they're here,"" Ms Sollitt said. Jackson saw an influx of tourists for the eclipse This week especially bankers were eclipsed, as Jackson was one of the places in the US where the sun and the moon would fully overlap, said Gavin Fine, owner of Fine Dining Restaurant Group and Rendezvous Bistro, which he said has been patronised by former Federal Reserve chairs Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke among others. ""We were in the path of totality so we had an influx of hundreds of thousands of people,"" he said. Still, when it comes to name recognition, Mr Fine says playing host to the Federal Reserve every year ""doesn't hurt"".

News Daily: Driverless lorries and police censured over abuser,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Platooning experiments have been carried out elsewhere in Europe Small convoys ofpartially driverless lorries will be tried out on major British roadsby the end of next year, the government has announced. A contract has been awarded to the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) to carry out the tests of vehicle ""platoons"" - in which up to three lorries will travel in formation, with acceleration and braking controlled by the lead vehicle. But the head of the AA said platoons raised safety concerns. The government has been promising such a project since at least 2014. Last year, for example, it announced its intention to carry out platooning trials but was later frustrated after some European lorrymakers declined to participate. By Jennifer Bradley, Aspen Institute Driverless vehicles may seem unfamiliar now, but over the coming years you'll start to encounter - or even use them - on a daily basis. Will it mean the end of the driving licence and changes to the rules of the road? It's not uncommon to see a squat white droid trundling along the streets of Greenwich, south-east London, as it delivers takeaway food to the borough's residents at 4mph. In Paris and Helsinki, robot buses are shuttling passengers along city streets, while in Colorado an 18-wheeler truck drove beer 120 miles down a highway - without a driver. Around the world, projects like these are under way to help develop the technology that will ultimately bring driverless cars and other vehicles to our roads. Read Jennifer's full article Get our morning briefing in your inbox, each weekday morning,external South Wales Policemissed a number of chances to bring paedophile Ian Watkins to justicesooner, an investigation by the police watchdog has found. Between 2008 and 2012, South Wales Police did not adequately act on eight reports and three intelligence logs from six people about the former Lostprophets frontman's intentions. Watkins was jailed for 35 years in 2013 after admitting 13 child sex offences. Police re-investigating the murder of a schoolgirl 21 years ago have madea new appeal for information. Caroline Glachan, 14, was found dead on the banks of the River Leven in Dunbartonshire on 25 August 1996, about a mile from her home in Renton. Her killer has never been found, and Police Scotland reopened an investigation into the case a year ago. Detectives have said they are certain answers about her murder lie in the local community. Former Thai prime ministerYingluck Shinawatra has failed to show up for the verdict in her trialover a controversial rice subsidy scheme. Lawyers for Ms Yingluck, who is charged with negligence, said she was ill. But the Supreme Court did not buy their explanation and has issued an arrest warrant. She has denied any wrongdoing in the scheme which cost billions of dollars. If found guilty, she faces jail and a lifetime ban from politics.

Fresh police appeal over 1996 murder,"Police reinvestigating the murder of a schoolgirl 21 years ago have made a further appeal for information. Caroline Glachan, 14, was found dead on the banks of the River Leven in Dunbartonshire on 25 August 1996, about a mile from her home in Renton. Her killer has never been found, and Police Scotland reopened an investigation into the case a year ago. Detectives have said they are certain the answer to her murder lies in the local community. Det Supt Jim Kerr said progress had been made over the past year, including work with the forensic scientists at the Scottish Crime Campus. ""A large number of the 300 pieces of evidence continue to be carefully examined for traces of DNA, and the painstaking work that the scientists have been carrying out continues,"" he said. ""Following our reappeal, we've had calls from as far away as Australia with information, from people who lived in the area of Bonhill and Renton at the time of the murder. ""Our work over the last year has continued to review the initial investigation and visiting those who were witnesses at the time to take reference samples of DNA. ""We remain in contact with Caroline's mother Margaret and the support we receive from her and her family during our investigation remains crucial."" Detectives want to trace a man in a hooded top seen walking near Caroline, on Dillichip Loan Caroline's friend Joanne Menzies was one of the last people to see her. Caroline left Joanne at the Bonhill shops at 23:54. She was last seen at about 00:15 when she walked down Dillichip Loan towards Dillichip Bridge (known locally as the Black Bridge and which no longer exists) and then on to the tow path. A man wearing a dark green hooded top was seen by a taxi driver walking near Caroline as she made her way along Dillichip Loan. The man was described as having sharp features Despite previous appeals to identify him, he has never been traced. CCTV images show Caroline as she walked to a friend's house from shops Det Supt Kerr said witnesses had also spoken of hearing people arguing or shouting in that area a short time later. He said: ""I know there has been a reluctance from people in the Bonhill and Renton areas to come forward in the past with vital information on this murder. ""However, can I remind people that we are investigating the murder of a 14-year-old girl - a young girl who is sorely missed by her family and friends. ""Someone out there who stayed in that community at that time holds the vital information we need - there is no doubt in that.""

Why the battle for Tal Afar matters,"Tal Afar is so-called Islamic State's last remaining stronghold in northern Iraq Tal Afar, about 55km (35 miles) to the west of Mosul, was always going to be next on the ""to do"" list for Iraqi forces. Just as the fighting for Mosul moved from east to west over the course of many months, the Iraqi military is now moving westwards towards the Syrian border. Although much smaller in size, Tal Afar has been a so-called Islamic State (IS) stronghold that the jihadist group has used as a strategic ""base"" since 2014. And Tal Afar has had ruthless rulers before - between late 2004 and early 2006, the city was controlled by al-Qaeda in Iraq, a precursor to IS. Before it fell to IS, the city's population of 200,000 was predominantly ethnic Turkmen, a Turkic people who have their own language and customs. The majority were also Sunni Muslims. US forces lost control of Tal Afar to al-Qaeda in the years after the 2003 invasion of Iraq Tal Afar's residents are not viewed as helpless victims by many in the region; for a relatively small population, security sources say a disproportionate number of men from the city filled the ranks of IS as commanders, judges and members of their vicious religious police. The battle for Tal Afar could also escalate tensions between Iraq, its ethnic Kurdish minority, Turkey and Syria. Turkey refuses to close or move its military base near Mosul, claiming it could be needed to protect Iraqi Turkmen as well as the Turkish border. The mere idea of Turkish military action on Iraqi soil has been enough to cause many, from Washington to Baghdad, to lose sleep. Kurdish leaders in Irbil are also keeping their eyes wide open as well - juggling the real or perceived threats from Sunni Arab insurgents, Turkish forces and an ever-growing number of Shia Arab militiamen. Tal Afar is a two hour drive from the Turkish border, and the main road from Mosul to Syria runs through the city. It is, in many ways, the perfect location - and the right time - for a perfect storm. The military assault on Tal Afar might seem clear cut, but the combination of forces involved invites complications on the ground. Approximately 40,000 troops are taking part in the fighting - three Iraqi Army divisions, Iraqi and US-led coalition special forces personnel, as well as ""government-backed"" paramilitary fighters from the Popular Mobilisation (Hashd al-Shaabi). The Popular Mobilisation is an umbrella organisation under whose banner are militias like Kataib Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades), Moqtada al-Sadr's Saraya al-Salam - the current incarnation of the Mehdi Army - and the Badr Organisation. The Popular Mobilisation's ranks also include fighters from Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a group trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force that has been accused of a number of kidnappings and attacks in Iraq. The Popular Mobilisation is dominated by Shia militias, many of which are backed by Iran The factions in the Popular Mobilisation are predominantly Shia and many are backed and funded by Iran. When you speak to them, many of their fighters do not try to hide their deep-seated disdain for Iraqi's Sunni population. Regardless of fears, internally and internationally, about the size and ultimate intentions of the Popular Mobilisation, it is not going away any time soon. It is needed, many argue. Once Tal Afar has been recaptured, this menagerie of forces will face a tougher operation on a wider scale that could last for months. A case can be made that the number of ground troops available to take part in it will be as important as their weaponry and air support. Mosul defeat a blow to IS, but not the end Where is IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? The Iraqi towns still under IS control About 290km (180 miles) south-west of Mosul, IS also holds a string of towns along the Iraqi part of the River Euphrates in Anbar province. These villages are known collectively as ""al-Qaim"", and they are connected by the Euphrates to the last IS stronghold in Syria - Deir al-Zour province. Deir al-Zour is now the heart of the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS three years ago. Iraqi forces have recaptured more than 39,900 sq km (15,400 sq miles) from IS Accurate figures are hard to come by, but there are an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 IS fighters on the Iraqi and Syrian sides of the Euphrates valley. Simply pushing the IS extremists over the Syrian border from Iraq will not be enough - and is likely to add to the problem of IS in Syria - but there is little more than inaudible rumblings about how Iraqi forces will maintain security once they have retaken al-Qaim. One solution may be to leave the Popular Mobilisation in the area as a substitute police force, because it has enough manpower and will need a new task, and also because Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has spoken out against disbanding them. In this scenario, Iraqi border security would be handled by forces that are heavily involved with Iran, yet backed by the government in Baghdad - which in turn, is backed by the US government and other powers. Once Tal Afar is liberated, US-led coalition commanders say, much remains to be done Iraqi regular forces, as they work their way back to Baghdad, will have another problem to deal with; a large pocket of IS territory in the middle of the country that has been contained primarily for three years by Kurdish Peshmerga forces. The fight for the city of Hawija may be as deadly as any so far, as it is a cut-off viper's nest. The IS fighters holding it truly have nowhere to run, should they try. The minute the smoke clears from Hawija, the Iraqi military will be looking across the battlefield at the Peshmerga. They distrust each other with equal fervour, and the only thing they have agreed on is need to the defeat IS.

Yingluck fails to show for Thai verdict,"The rice scheme was one of several controversies which overshadowed Ms Yingluck's time in office Thailand has tightened border controls after former PM Yingluck Shinawatra failed to show up for the verdict in her trial over a rice subsidy scheme. Deputy PM Prawit Wongsuwan said it was possible she had already fled. Lawyers for Ms Yingluck, who is charged with negligence, said she was unable to attend court because she was ill. But the Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant for her, confiscated her bail of $900,000 (Â£703,000) and delayed the verdict to 27 September. Ms Yingluck has denied any wrongdoing in the scheme which cost Thailand billions of dollars. If found guilty, she could be jailed for up to 10 years and permanently banned from politics. On Friday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said all routes out of the country were being closely monitored. ""I just learned that she did not show up [at court],"" he told reporters. ""I have ordered border checkpoints to be stepped up."" Ms Yingluck still enjoys popular support Mr Prawit initially said he had no information on Ms Yingluck's whereabouts but as he left a meeting in Bangkok he said: ""It is possible that she has fled already."" Earlier, Ms Yingluck's lawyer requested a delay in the ruling, telling the court that she had vertigo and a severe headache and was unable to attend. But an official Supreme Court statement said it did not believe she was sick as there was no medical certificate and that the claimed sickness was not severe enough that she could not travel to court. ""Such behaviour convincingly shows that she is a flight risk. As a result, the court has issued an arrest warrant and confiscated the posted bail money,"" the statement said. Asked by the BBC whether she was still in the country, Ms Yingluck's lawyer Norrawit Larlaeng said: ""I don't know. I don't know."" Jonathan Head, BBC News, South East Asia correspondent The possible fate of Thailand's first female prime minister had generated a great deal of debate and anxiety in the days leading up to this court hearing. The military government had tried to prevent or discourage Ms Yingluck's supporters from coming to the Supreme Court in Bangkok, for fear of an angry reaction should she be convicted and imprisoned. Her failure to turn up for the verdict now presents the authorities with another dilemma - sending police to arrest her might also provoke unrest. What Yingluck's fate might mean for Thailand Profile: Thailand's first female PM Ms Yingluck's brother, controversial former prime ministerThaksin Shinawatra,lives in exile after fleeing the country in 2008 to evade a jail term for corruption. Friday's turn of events took many by surprise, including the hundreds of people who turned up outside the Supreme Court in Bangkok to support Ms Yingluck. BBC Thai reporter Nanchanok Wongsamut, who was in court, said the announcement prompted shocked reactions in the room, and then a flurry of activity as journalists ran out to report the news. But some supporters outside the court expressed understanding. ""The Thai prime minister has done her best, she has sacrificed a lot,"" said Seksan Chalitaporn, 64. ""Now the people have to fight for themselves."" Ms Yingluck, who became Thailand's first female prime minister in 2011, was impeached in 2015 over the rice scheme by a military-backed legislature, which then brought the legal case. The scheme, part of Ms Yingluck's election campaign platform, launched shortly after she took office. It was aimed at boosting farmers' incomes and alleviating rural poverty, and saw the government paying farmers nearly twice the market rate for their crop. But it hit Thailand's rice exports hard, leading to a loss of at least $8bn and huge stockpiles of rice which the government could not sell. Though popular with her rural voter base, opponents said the scheme was too expensive and open to corruption. During her trial, Ms Yingluck had argued she was not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme. She has insisted she is a victim of political persecution. May 2011- Yingluck Shinawatra is elected PM, and shortly afterwards begins rolling out her rice subsidy scheme.

May 2014- She is forced to step down from her post after Thailand's constitutional court finds her guilty of abuse of power in another case. Weeks later the military ousts what remains of her government.

It also launches legal proceedings against her. August 2017- Ms Yingluck fails to appear at court for the verdict, claiming ill health. Ms Yingluck's time in office was overshadowed by controversy as well as strong political opposition. The youngest sister of Mr Thaksin, she was seen by her opponents as a proxy for her brother, who was controversially ousted by the military in 2006. Both siblings remain popular among the rural poor, but are hated by an urban and middle-class elite. Their Pheu Thai party has - under various different names - won every election in Thailand since 2001.
