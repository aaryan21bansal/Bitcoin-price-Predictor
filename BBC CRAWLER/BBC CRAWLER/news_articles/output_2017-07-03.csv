"Girl, 16, admits killing seven-year-old","This video can not be played Katie Rough's parents described seeing their dying daughter after the attack A 16-year-old girl has pleaded guilty to killing seven-year-old Katie Rough. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Katie was smothered and slashed with a Stanley knife by the teenager on a playing field in Woodthorpe, York, on 9 January. She died later in hospital. Leeds Crown Court heard the killer suffered with severe mental health issues and was convinced people ""weren't human and were robots"". Katie's family were in court to hear the guilty plea. Killed girl's parents relive body find More stories from across Yorkshire Nicholas Johnson QC, defending, asked the court if the charge of murder could be put to the girl again and she wrote her plea on a piece of paper. Her solicitor told the court: ""I can confirm she has indicated not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter."" Graham Reeds QC, prosecuting, said: ""We are going to accept that plea of manslaughter by diminished responsibility."" Katie Rough died in hospital after suffering serious injuries to her neck and chest Katie was found on a playing field near Alness Drive, in Woodthorpe, York, on 9 January Mr Reeds said the the defendant had developed severe mental health problems during 2016 and had been taken out of school as a result. He said that she had been self harming since Christmas 2015 and suffering from delusions, believing that people around her ""may not be human and may be controlled by a higher and hostile force"". He said that although psychosis was being investigated prior to the killing, it had not been diagnosed. However, he said since the killing she had undergone four psychiatric and psychological assessments and there was no dispute that her mental health problems meant she was suffering from diminished responsibility at the time she killed Katie, even though the killing was planned. He told the court that when the teenager was found in the street in York by a member of the public, she told him Katie was dead and asked where she was. The man then found Katie lying on a nearby piece of land with a cut to her neck. A post-mortem examination showed Katie had two severe cuts to her body - one to her neck and the other to her torso - but neither caused her death. The prosecutor said Katie had been smothered before the cuts were made. The court heard the teenager handed police a blood-stained Stanley knife which she had taken from her grandmother's kitchen. Police also recovered a number of items from the scene and the teenager's home. Among the items were drawings of stick-men in various poses depicting killing and death, and a reference to ""they are not human"". The paper was blood-stained and the court heard it had been cut with the same knife used to slash Katie. Mr Reeds said she had displayed ""strange behaviour towards other people and herself"", and had started to self-harm before she killed Katie. A friend interviewed by police following Katie's death told them she was ""nice but weird"" and said she liked to talk about death. The judge, Mr Justice Soole, said he wanted more questions answering by the medical experts before he could pass sentence. He adjourned the case to 20 July. Katie was described as a ""daddy's girl"" Katie was a pupil at Westfield Primary School in the Acomb area of York. In the days after Katie's death Tracey Ralph, head teacher at the school, described her as a ""kind and thoughtful child who was well-liked by both pupils and staff"". More than 300 people attend Katie'sfuneral service, which took place at York Minister in February and was led by the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu. Her coffin was decorated with characters from the Dr Seuss children's books. More than 300 people attended Katie's funeral Her funeral service was held at York Minster During the service Katie's uncle described her as a ""smart, fun, beautiful child"". He said she had selective mutism, but that it did not stop her from having fun. ""Her family were her world,"" he said. ""She loved her mum and dad but she was definitely described as a daddy's girl."" 9 January - A seven-year-old girl is found seriously injured near a playing field in the Woodthorpe area of York.

Mothers criticise Baby Dove adverts,"Skincare brand Baby Dove has been criticised by mums who say the company's new adverts support those who oppose breastfeeding in public. One advert says ""75% say breastfeeding in public is fine, 25% say put them away. What's your way?"" The Advertising Standards Authority has received 151 complaints, including concerns the ad perpetuates a negative image of breastfeeding in public. Brand owner Unilever said it aims to celebrate different parenting styles. Another Dove advert shows a crying baby accompanied by text that reads: ""36% are for feeding him when he cries, 64% are passionately against it. What's your way?"" Do mums really need breastfeeding help from technology? While the brand's website also reads: ""So whether you're among the 66% who think that breastfeeding in public is fine, or the 34% who think otherwise, whatever choice you make, we are with you every step of the way."" But ""Unmumsy Mum"" blogger Sarah Turner said in an open letter to Dove, posted on Facebook, that supporting the ""dangerous"" view that it was acceptable to criticise breastfeeding in public could put mums off. ""No woman should be made to feel ashamed for feeding their baby in public,"" she wrote. ""If you are standing with people who think breastfeeding in public is not okay, are you also with them if they ask a breastfeeding mum to cover up, or if they think she would be better off sat feeding in a restaurant toilet?"" Baby Milk Action, a non-profit organisation, called the ""What's your way?"" campaign ""seriously misguided"". In a Facebook post,external, it said: ""Please do not be intimidated by the Dove marketing campaign condoning those who object to breastfeeding in public. ""It is illegal to discriminate against anyone for how they feed their child in public."" Emma Pickett, from the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers, said: ""It's not anyone's 'way' to oppose it unless they fancy going to court or criminal action, and it's insulting to imagine that mums who formula feed automatically sympathise with people who dislike breastfeeding in public. ""This message intimidates new mums and that means increased isolation and greater risk of postnatal mental health issues."" Anna Burbridge, from support group La Leche League, agreed that women ""need support and protection against unpleasant and aggressive comments, and advertising campaigns which ask what people think are unhelpful"". ""Women do not have to 'put them away' and anything which implies they do contradicts the legal right of women to breastfeed."" Unilever responded to the criticisms in a statement, saying: ""We believe there are many ways to be a great mum or dad. ""Our campaign simply aims to celebrate the different approaches and opinions around parenting, including whether or not mums choose to breastfeed in public, recognising that it's ultimately what works for you and your baby that matters the most."" Many have voiced their opinions on social media. Bev Bevster said on Facebook she was ""disgusted that Dove supports the discrimination of breastfeeding mothers"" and ""promotes child cruelty"" by allowing babies to cry. ""What has any of this got to do with do with body products?"" Why I breastfeed at work Parliament breastfeed an Australian first Rhiannon Kendrick wrote: ""I have just seen your ludicrous, sensationalist and downright upsetting Baby Dove advert. Who wants to see a picture of a crying baby for goodness sake?"" Some complaints have criticised the statistics quoted on Baby Dove's website In England and Wales, it is illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place, such as a cafe, shop or public transport. Scottish law makes it an offence to deliberately prevent or stop a person from feeding milk to a child in their charge in a public place or licensed premises. Northern Ireland ministershave been considering legislationto protect mothers who breastfeed in public. Last year, a study published in medical journal The Lancet found that the rates of breastfeeding in the UKwere the lowest in the world. The Advertising Standards Authority said the ""general nature"" of the complaints it had received were that it was not clear where the statistics were from. The complaints said one advert encouraged a parenting style that was poor or neglectful, while the other perpetuated a negative perception of breastfeeding in public. An ASA spokesman said the complaints were being assessed and no decision had yet been made on whether advertising rules had been broken.

Tony Hadley cuts ties with Spandau Ballet,"Spandau Ballet backstage at Top of the Pops in 1983, with Hadley front and centre Singer Tony Hadley says he has left 1980s pop group Spandau Ballet, and ""will not be performing"" with them in the future. In an oddly-worded statement, the star said: ""I am required to state that I am no longer a member of the band"". He did not indicate why he was leaving, but blamed ""circumstances beyond my control"". The group, who scored hits with True and Gold, broke up acrimoniously in the 1990s but had reformed in 2009. The remaining members put the blame for the latest split on Hadley's shoulders. ""Much to our frustration, Tony had made it clear in September 2016 that he didn't want to work with the band anymore,"" they wroteon their official website,external. ""This has not changed and 2015 was the last time we were able to perform or work with him. So we have now made the decision to move on as a band."" Formed in 1976 as The Cut, they cut their teeth in the punk era, before emerging as one of the planet's biggest pop bands - engaged in a fierce rivalry with fellow New Romantics Duran Duran. Following their first hit - 1980's To Cut A Long Story Short - they released six studio albums and had 10 UK top 10 singles, topping the charts with True in 1983. Spandau's original split came after the five-piece fell out over money. In 1999, Hadley, saxophonist Steve Norman and drummer John Keeble sued guitarist Gary Kemp for a share of the band's songwriting royalties. Kemp, who played in the band with his brother Martin, wrote all of the hits, but the other musicians believed they had a gentleman's agreement to share the profits, in recognition of their musical contribution to the songs. The case went to the High Court, where Kemp won. He later described the battle as ""like walking away from a car crash - you're glad to be alive but mortified and shocked by the wreckage"". The band were back in court three years later, arguing over the right to use the name Spandau Ballet. Hadley, Keeble and Norman lost again and had to tour under the humbling name of Ex-Spandau Ballet. This video can not be played Soul Boys Of The Western World looks at the career of Spandau Ballet in the 1980s By this point, Hadley was not on speaking terms with the Kemp brothers, and for a number of years a reunion seemed like an impossibility. In 2007, the singer told the Daily Express: ""I know you should never say never, and bands in the past have said hell would freeze over before they got back together, but in our case I think hell is frozen and we still wouldn't do it."" Naturally, they reformed two years later, hosting a press conference on HMS Belfast in London, the scene of a landmark early gig in 1980. Since then, they have toured the world, headlining the Isle of Wight Festival and producing adocumentaryabout themselves called Soul Boys of the Western World. They even recorded a handful of new songs for the 2014 album The Story - The Very Best of Spandau Ballet. More recently, the band have been playing solo shows; while Martin Kemp appeared as a judge on the BBC show Let It Shine. Hadley's decision to cut ties with Spandau effectively puts an end to any future reunion. The band last toured together in 2015 His full statement read as follows,external: ""Due to circumstances beyond my control, it is with deep regret that I am required to state that I am no longer a member of the band Spandau Ballet and as such I will not be performing with the band in the future."" Fans on Twitter responded by quoting some of Spandau's more memorable lyrics. ""Say it's not True!"" wrote one. ""Communication let them down,"" added another. ""He didn't need this pressure on,"" noted a third. ""You'll notice it [the statement] is only one sentence,""said Scott Taylor,external.

Elton John bomb plotter jailed for life,"Haroon Syed was caught after trying to buy a bomb from a British security agent A 19-year-old man has been jailed for life for planning a bomb attack that may have targeted an Elton John concert or Oxford Street in central London. Haroon Syed, of west London, admitted preparing acts of terrorism after trying to source weapons including a suicide bomb and machine gun. He was caught after approaching MI5 officers, who were posing as a fellow extremist, via social media. Syed was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years and six months. Last year,his brother was jailed for lifefor plotting to behead someone on Remembrance Sunday. Judge Michael Topolski QC said Syed wanted to carry out ""an act of mass murder"" and therefore a discretionary life sentence was warranted. Prosecutors say Syed's plans ranged from becoming a suicide bomber to staging a gun attack, and while he initially boasted of working with others, those people did not materialise. Instead, over the summer of last year, he made increasingly urgent efforts to secure weaponry. After he went online looking for help, a purported jihadist fighting overseas, known only as Abu Isa, introduced him to another extremist going by the name Abu Yusuf. This second man was, in fact, a group of MI5 officers who were playing the role of a jihadist in what became weeks of social media chat with Syed. Teen admits planning 'London bomb attack' Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey there was initially some ""suspicion on both sides"" before Abu Yusuf concluded that Syed was a ""committed brother"" he could deal with. Syed then began talking about his aspirations and gave his contact a shopping list, saying he wanted ""do martyrdom"" after first causing ""damage"" with a machine gun. ""Can you get the gear?"" asked Syed. ""You will be involved right? ""Two things. Number one, machine gun and we need someone who can make a vest you know the dugma [button] one. So after some damage with machine gun then do itishadi [martyrdom] ... that's what I'm planning to do."" The undercover officer told Syed guns were expensive - but he might be able to get someone to build a bomb. Syed floated the idea of going to fight overseas with his new-found friend - but revealed his passport had been cancelled by the authorities. He tried and failed twice to get fraudulent loans of thousands of pounds to cover the cost of firearms - and eventually agreed to meet his contact in a coffee shop in Slough, Berkshire, to finalise an alternative plan. The 19-year-old admitted preparing acts of terrorism Over two meetings, he talked about his aspirations and then handed over Â£150, asking for a bomb packed with nails. The conversation was secretly recorded. ""I was thinking of Oxford Street,"" he told his contact. ""If you put those things inside called nails, do you know what that is, nails? Those sharp things - lots of them inside. ""Good man, can't wait akhi [brother]. If I go to prison, I go to prison. If I die, I die, you understand? I have got to get to Jannah [heaven]."" The undercover officer later told Syed a ""bomb-making brother"" would have the device ready within days - and the suspect went online to narrow his list of targets. His web searches included ""packed places in London"" and ""Elton John, Hyde Park, 11 September"" - a major concert hosted by BBC Radio 2 which also featured Status Quo and Madness. Prosecutors say Syed's character had begun to change outwardly in late 2014, coinciding with the growing support among British extremists for the self-styled Islamic State group. During the course of the investigation, detectives found his web searches jumped about as he tried to satisfy himself that an attack on civilians was theologically justifiable. One of his last searches, a week before his arrest, was: ""How can I stop being upset about the UK killing innocent Syrians and get on with my day?"" When counter-terrorist detectives arrested him in September and asked him for the password for his phone, he replied: ""ISIS - you like that?"" Syed's was one of 18 terror plots to have been foiled since 2013. Mitigating, Mark Summers QC said it was a ""crude, ill-thought-out"" plan made at the behest of others. The court heard Syed had fallen under the influence of members of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, and that he now publicly rejected his past beliefs and condemned the recent bomb attack in Manchester. But Judge Topolski told Syed: ""You were not lured, you were not enticed, you were not entrapped. ""You became, and in my judgement as shown by your online activities away from your contact with Abu Yusuf, deeply committed to the ideology of a brutal and barbaric organisation that sought to hijack and corrupt an ancient and venerable religion for its own purposes and you wanted to be part of it."" Deb Walsh, deputy head of the counter-terrorism division of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Haroon Syed is clearly a danger to the public who was prepared to carry out indiscriminate attacks against innocent people. ""The compelling evidence presented by the CPS left him with no choice but to plead guilty.""

Jersey children in care 'still at risk',"This video can not be played Care Inquiry: Francis Oldham QC delivers scathing report Children may still be at risk in Jersey's care system, a report into seven decades of child abuse has found. Live electrical wires were applied to children's legs, one survivor told the The Independent Jersey Care Inquiry. Victims also reported being beaten with nettles, having their heads dunked in cold water and being sexually abused. The States of Jersey had ""proved to be an ineffectual and neglectful substitute parent"", the report said. Chief Minister, Senator Ian Gorst apologised and said: ""We failed children who needed our care."" Jersey care home inquiry: Decades of abuse The inquiry, led by judge Frances Oldham QC, has recommended demolishing the Haut de la Garenne children's home, where much of the abuse took place. This video can not be played Gifford Aubin shares his experience at Haut de la Garenne More on the child abuse report Survivor Gifford Aubin who was at the home in the 1950s described his treatment: ""They were putting these wires on your legs, that sort of thing...

He also suffered mental abuse from his experiences. The inquiry, launched in 2014, heard 553 offences took place between 1947 and 2004, with more than half said to have occurred at Haut de la Garenne.

While a lot of the inquiry focused on Haut de la Garenne, a number of other incidents, not previously revealed, came to light. The revelations of assault, bullying and slavery at the SacrÃ© Coeur Orphanage led to a fresh call for witnesses from the inquiry panel. A witness, known as ""Mrs A"" said outside of school hours children were forced to work unpaid in a knitting factory run by the nuns at the orphanage. In February 2015 one survivor known as ""Witness D"", now in his 40s, told the inquiry he was too scared to report the abuse he suffered to the authorities while he was at Haut de la Garenne. He told the hearing he was sexually abused by two members of staff, William Gilbert and Phil Le Bais. They were never charged and have now died. Former Haut de la Garenne resident, Gifford Aubin said a lack of staff meant older boys were often left in charge Being beaten with nettles as a punishment for bedwetting Having their hair forcibly cut off Having their mouths washed out with soap Spending long periods in an isolation room Having fat from a frying pan poured over them Being punched and slapped Being sexually abused Source: The Independent Jersey Care Inquiry - A 62 page appendix details the abuse suffered in the care system More than half of the alleged offences took place at Haut de la Garenne children's home The report said: ""Children may still be still at risk in Jersey and children in the care system are not always receiving the kind or quality of care and support that they need."" It said the buildings at Haut de la Garenne were a reminder of an ""unhappy past or shameful history"" and of the ""turmoil and trauma"" of the police investigation, which began in 2006. The report said there was no doubt that ""many instances"" of physical and sexual abuse were suffered by children in the care of the States of Jersey. The wellbeing of vulnerable children had been ""low on the list"" of Jersey's priorities and unsuitable people were appointed to management roles on the basis of local connections. It also referred to witnesses' use of the phrase the ""Jersey way"" to describe a system where ""serious issues are swept under the carpet"" and ""people avoid being held to account for abuses"". The report said ""As a result, ill-suited carers continued to look after children in unsuitable facilities, using outdated practices. ""The consequences for the children in their care were devastating and, in many instances, lifelong.""

No gender marker for baby's health card,"The parent says that a visual inspection at birth is not capable of determining a person's gender An eight-month old Canadian baby has been issued a health card without a gender marker, in what could be the first case in the world. Parent Kori Doty - a non-binary transgender person who identifies as neither male nor female - aims to allow the child to discover their own gender. The health card has been issued with a ""U"" in the space for ""sex"", which could be for ""undetermined"" or ""unassigned"". Kori Doty is fighting to omit the gender from the birth certificate. The parent gave birth to Searyl Atli in November at a friend's home in British Columbia. Kori Doty, who prefers to use the pronoun they, argues that a visual inspection at birth is unable to determine what gender that person will have or identify with later in life. They want to keep Searyl's sex off all official records. ""I'm raising Searyl in in such a way that until they have the sense of self and command of vocabulary to tell me who they are, I'm recognising them as a baby and trying to give them all the love and support to be the most whole person that they can be outside of the restrictions that come with the boy box and the girl box,"" the parentwas quoted by CBC as saying,external.

Beyond 'he' and 'she': The rise of non-binary pronouns Kori Doty, a community educator who is part of theGender-Free ID Coalition,external, said that those who feel different to the gender designation assigned at birth face several problems later in life trying to change their documents. ""When I was born, doctors looked at my genitals and made assumptions about who I would be, and those assignments followed me and followed my identification throughout my life,"" Kori Doty said.

Ashley 'vomited in fireplace at meeting',"Mike Ashley was at the High Court for the hearing Sportswear tycoon Mike Ashley once hosted a management meeting in a pub where he drank 12 pints and vomited into a fireplace, a court has heard. The Newcastle United owner is being sued by finance expert Jeffrey Blue at London's High Court. He claims Mr Ashley often held meetings in pubs, and at one time promised to pay him Â£15m if he managed to increase Sports Direct's share price to Â£8. He said the billionaire only paid him Â£1m. Mr Ashley disputes the claim. Mr Justice Leggatt was told the dispute between Mr Blue and Mr Ashley related to an alleged conversation in a London pub called the Horse & Groom in 2013. Jeffrey Chapman QC, who is leading Mr Blue's legal team, told the judge Mr Ashley's business practices flew in the face of ""business orthodoxy"". Mr Blue said he had attended several senior management meetings at another pub, the Green Dragon in Alfreton, Derbyshire. He said: ""These meetings were like no other senior management meeting I had ever attended in all my years of investment banking experience."" Finance expert Jeffrey Blue said Mr Ashley ""was like no other client"" Describing it as a ""pub lock-in"" where fish and chips and kebabs would be brought in after closing time, he said: ""On one such evening, in front of his senior management team, Mr Ashley challenged a young Polish analyst in my team, Pawel Pawlowski, to a drinking competition. ""Mr Ashley and Pawel would drink pints of lager, with vodka 'chasers' between each pint, and the first to leave the bar area for whatever reason was declared the loser. ""After approximately 12 pints and chasers Pawel apologised profusely and had to excuse himself. ""Mr Ashley then vomited into the fireplace located in the centre of the bar, to huge applause from his senior management team."" Mr Blue said he first met Mr Ashley while working for Merrill Lynch in 2006. ""Mr Ashley was like no other client that anyone at Merrill Lynch had ever come across,"" he said. ""By way of example, his ability to express boredom and frustration during client meetings knew no limits, including various episodes where he would lie underneath meeting room tables to 'have a nap'."" David Cavender QC, who leads Mr Ashley's legal team, told the judge Mr Blue's claim was an ""opportunistic try on"". The hearing continues.

Chris Gard and Connie Yates had been expecting their 10-month-old'slife support to be turned off on Friday. But Great Ormond Street Hospital said it will continue Charlie's care to allow the family to spend more time with him. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump tweeted his support on Monday. He wrote: ""If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so."" Allow Twitter content?

The Vatican said the Pope was following the case ""with affection and sadness"". A statement released on Sunday said the Pope wished to ""expresses his closeness to his [Charlie's] parents"". ""For them he prays, hoping that their desire to accompany and care for their own child to the end is not ignored,"" it said. Charlie Gard's rare disease has left him unable to cry Charlie is thought to be one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome. It is a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage because he is unable to get energy to his organs. Doctors have said he now cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow and has irreversible brain damage. His lungs are only able to keep going because of the treatment he is receiving. They have argued he should be allowed to die with dignity. But his parents and supporters have been fighting for him to be given an experimental treatment in the US. The treatment is not a cure - there isn't one - but it has been suggested it could reduce the effects of the disease. Although doctors in the US have since said the benefits they have seen have not been in cases as advanced as Charlie's. The statement came on the same day demonstrators gathered outside Buckingham Palace to protest against the decision to allow Charlie's life-sustaining treatment to be withdrawn. On 27 June,Charlie's parents lost their final legal appealto take him to the US for experimental treatment. His parents also said the hospital had denied their final wish to be able to take their son home to die, and felt ""let down"" following the lengthy legal battle. Judges at the European Court of Human Rights concluded that further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"", in line with advice from specialists at Great Ormond Street. Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie President Donald Trump said he would be ""delighted"" to help Charlie after his parents lost their legal battle. A spokeswoman for the White House said President Trump had not spoken to the family although members of the administration had. ""The president is just trying to be helpful if at all possible,"" she added. Doctors have said he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow. Charlie has been receiving specialist treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October 2016. Charlie's parents raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for the experimental treatment in the US. Ms Yates previously indicated themoney would go towards a charity for mitochondrial depletion syndromeif Charlie ""did not get his chance"".

The secret German peacemaker of Northern Ireland's Troubles,"Eberhard Spiecker's secret peace negotiations went back to the 1970s Eberhard Spiecker remains an enigma in Northern Ireland's peace process. He died in Germany in May and much of his far-reaching involvement in the labyrinthine politics of the Troubles is likely to go with him to the grave. His work stretched over several decades, almost entirely unseen, holding meetings between people who refused to meet in public and exchanging messages between people who could deny that they had ever been in contact. It seems to have included two undisclosed IRA ceasefires and three peace talks, only one of which has ever been fully revealed. If you find a public reference to Dr Spiecker, it's usually as a ""shadowy clergyman"", who staged secret peace talks in Duisburg, in the old West Germany, in 1988 between deadlocked unionist and nationalist parties. This was seen as a symbolically important piece of bridge building across the political permafrost - but it also seemed a strangely isolated event. Who was this German Lutheran who had pulled off such an unlikely meeting between representatives of the DUP, the UUP and the SDLP with a go-between for Sinn Fein, a decade before the Good Friday Agreement? What is now apparent is that this was far from a one-off involvement. Dr Spiecker, born in Duisburg in the last days of the Weimar Republic, had been involved in peace initiatives in Northern Ireland since the early 1970s. Following a meeting of senior Northern Irish Catholic and Protestant church leaders in Germany, Dr Spiecker was given the role of building contacts in Northern Ireland, in an attempt to resolve the conflict and loss of life. He was an outsider, a neutral figure, who tapped into a network of religious leaders working across Northern Ireland's divide. What were Northern Ireland's Troubles? Northern Ireland's peace process What was the Good Friday Agreement? Among his early contacts was Canon Bill Arlow, a Church of Ireland minister who controversially arranged a secret meeting between Protestant church representatives and IRA leaders in 1974, with the aim of establishing a ceasefire. This meeting ended when the location was raided by the Irish police. During the republican hunger strikes of 1980 and 1981, Dr Spiecker put together a plan to reverse out of the impasse, with contacts that included the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, the head of the Catholic church in Ireland, Cardinal Tomas O'Fiaich, Irish prime minister Garret FitzGerald and Gaston Thorn, president of the EU Commission. This was unsuccessful - and Dr Spiecker, writing a few months before his death, said the hunger strikes left a huge ""chasm"". His response was to try to build an understanding between politicians across the sectarian divide - through secret meetings held in Germany, which would move from trust building to concrete proposals. He described a ""relaxed meeting"" between unionists and nationalists in the town of Boppard on the Rhine in 1985. The hunger strikes left a political ""chasm"" that Dr Spiecker wanted to bridge It was designed to be convivial and away from the violent backdrop of Northern Ireland, where even admitting to such meetings would have been politically impossible. Later in the same year the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement between Margaret Thatcher and Mr FitzGerald prompted a mass resignation of unionist MPs. Dr Spiecker said that at his private talks in Germany the ""rapprochement was successful"". There were more undisclosed cross-party talks in May 1987, bringing together politicians from the Ulster Unionist Party, Social and Democratic Labour Party and the Alliance Party. Dr Spiecker brought opposing sides away from the violence to talk secretly in Duisburg This meeting took place in Essen in a Catholic seminary where Pope John Paul II had stayed a couple of weeks before. ""The participants were no longer only well-known personalities, but also representatives of political and social life,"" wrote Dr Spiecker. ""As an example, Martin Smyth can be mentioned, the then Grand Master of the Orange Order, who probably took part in negotiations in the rooms of a Catholic seminary for the first time."" Organisers of the Essen meeting identified another very prominent unionist politician who attended. The talks focused on familiar territory for Northern Irish negotiations - the possible shape of self-government, the roles of the Westminster and Dublin governments, responsibility and cross-community support for policing and the engagement in talks of Sinn Fein. Further talks followed the next year in a hotel in Duisburg - with Peter Robinson from the DUP joining Austin Currie from the SDLP and representatives of the UUP and Alliance. Dr Spiecker (right), a campaigner for links between churches, in a meeting with Joseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict And significantly they were joined by Father Alec Reid, a priest who acted as a go-between with the ""republican movement"". ""Eberhard Spiecker's special qualities were shown,"" according to assistants in Germany who were at the talks. ""He brought people together who, until then, had never sat around one table. He succeeded in getting these people to work on the resolution of the conflict in a constructive and convinced way, in spite of all the differences."" Even if in secret, politicians were engaging with each other - and a door was being opened to Sinn Fein, if there was an end to violence. ""The 1988 talks were significant and part of the 'bridge building' process,"" says Peter Taylor, documentary maker and author who followed the inside story of the peace process. ""They were around the time of the Hume/Adams talks facilitated by Father Alec Reid of the Clonard Monastery in Belfast. Those talks helped build the ideological platform for the declaration that Britain had no 'selfish or strategic interest' in Northern Ireland."" While the talks in Boppard and Essen remained confidential, the Duisburg meeting was leaked - making international headline news in 1989. According to the team in Germany who put together the talks, this breach of confidentiality, and the exposure of such secret exchanges, was the ""end of the matter"" for this strand of negotiations. Dr Spiecker put forward unionist and nationalist contacts during the Drumcree stand-off But Dr Spiecker's work continued - this time in his own country. He held talks with leading republicans, regarding a wave of lethal attacks on British military personnel based in Germany. According to Dr Spiecker's assistants, an agreement for an IRA ceasefire was reached in 1990, specific to Germany. This was a ""Waffenstillstand"" or ""weapons stand still"". IRA activity moved to neighbouring countries, with the Netherlands being mentioned, before a ceasefire for mainland Europe was agreed two years later. Although these localised ceasefires would later be breached, these suspensions of violence were seen as part of the ""confidence building"" during wider negotiations. But is there any evidence for such ceasefires? There are sources, close to the peace process, who say they have heard rumours of such unpublicised ceasefires. Tony Blair responding to the IRA ceasefire in July 1997 There are unlikely to be any official records - and more risks than reward for any of the participating parties to talk about such controversial deals. Another interpretation has been that a ""ceasefire"" could have been a cover for what was a forced withdrawal after a failed terror campaign. Ed Moloney, author and historian of the Troubles and the peace process, says he had ""heard about the German and European ceasefires, but not whether Spiecker was involved"". He says the deal had to be approved by the German authorities. But the German government's political archive says there are no records of such an exchange. It would not have been unheard of, because in later secret exchanges between Sinn Fein and the British government, ahead of the 1994 IRA ceasefire, there were references to unpublicised temporary suspensions in violence. But there is more speculation than certainty about such events and more long silences than explanations. Another curiosity is that Dr Spiecker - invariably recorded as a ""clergyman"" - was not actually a religious minister. He was an elder in the Lutheran church and chaired church committees, and deeply involved in ecumenical causes, but by profession he was a lawyer. Brendan Duddy, the contact between the British government and the IRA, was also in communication with Dr Spiecker Dr Spiecker's role might raise other questions. He acted in secret - and was valued for his unshowy trustworthiness - but his work seems to have overlapped with other ""secret peacemakers"". Brendan Duddy, who died recently, was the secret ""back channel"" contact between the IRA and the British government, from the 1970s to the 1990s. In Mr Duddy's archive of letters there are references to faxes he exchanged with Dr Spiecker. There were messages from 1997 exchanged about defusing the violent stand-off over the Orange Order march at Drumcree, with Dr Spiecker putting forward representatives of unionists and republicans for talks, with the offer of hosting negotiations in Germany. There were also confidential messages to the former Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds, before a round of peace process negotiations in 1997. Dr Spiecker set out unresolved areas for an IRA ceasefire, such as policing, decommissioning of weapons and prisoner release. He seemed to have had access across the landscape of Northern Ireland politics, meeting with unionists Peter Robinson, Jim Molyneaux and Martin Smyth; the SDLP's John Hume and Austin Currie and senior figures from Sinn Fein.

Counting the dead in shoot-to-kill war,"This video can not be played Police commando Herojit has admitted to more than 100 unlawful killings. Warning: This video contains distressing images More than 1,500 people were allegedly killed in a wave of extra-judicial executions by security forces in India's insurgency-ridden north-eastern Manipur state between 1979 and 2012. Last year, in a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court asked relatives of the victims and activists to collect information on the killings. The court will rule in July whether to order an official investigation which could lead to convictions. Soutik Biswas travelled to Manipur to find out more. Neena Ningombam vividly remembers the day her husband disappeared - and ended up a corpse on cable news. It was a bright, sunny November day in 2008, and 32-year-old Michael was visiting a friend's house in Imphal, the non-descript, mountain-ringed valley capital of Manipur. At home, Ms Ningombam was doing her chores. Her two boys were fast asleep. At half past three in the afternoon, her mobile phone rang. Michael was on the line saying that he had been picked up by police commandos on his way home, and that she should quickly pass on the news of his arrest to a senior policeman who was known to the family so that he could help secure his release. The call disconnected abruptly. Two hours later, a man finally picked up the phone and told Ms Ningombam that her husband was ""in the toilet"". He said he would inform him that she had called. Michael never called. When she tried calling again, his phone was switched off. Tense and confused, Ms Ningombam sat down in front of the TV. Her sister-in-law had gone in search of the police officer known to the family, but he couldn't be found. Manipur, a hilly north-eastern state on the border with Myanmar (Burma), has been a cauldron of insurgency for more than four decades. At one point, the state was home to some 30 armed groups. Six main groups are outlawed. The violence is stoked by ethnic rivalries, and demands for independence and affirmative action for local tribespeople. Some rebel groups also act as social watchdogs, targeting liquor sellers, drug traffickers and banning Bollywood films. Lack of jobs has worsened matters. According to the government, 1,214 civilians were killed by insurgents between 2000 and October 2012. Also, 365 police and soldiers were killed by insurgents during the same period. A controversial anti-insurgent law, the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Afspa) - which protects security forces who may kill a civilian by mistake or in unavoidable circumstances - has been in effect here since 1958 and been partly blamed for the ""perpetual immunity"" enjoyed by the forces. In July 2016, the Supreme Court remarked that the law could not be an excuse for retaliatory killings and excesses. So she waited, and waited, for Michael, watching the news on a local channel. At nine in the evening, the screen exploded with breaking news. They were showing footage of her bloodied husband, wearing blue nylon tracksuit bottoms and a dark green T-shirt, lying dead on a stone floor. A Chinese-made grenade lay next to the body. The news reader breathlessly announced that police commandos had killed another militant. Ms Ningombam says she looked at the screen and froze. Grief felt so like fear itself. ""I just remember that I cried and cried and cried. Someone came rushing in and yanked off the TV cable wire. My brother-in-law went to the morgue and identified him."" The police defended the killing of Michael Ningombam The post-mortem report said Michael Ningombam had died of ""shock and haemorrhage as a result of firearm injuries to lungs and liver"". The police said Michael and two friends were riding a motorcycle when they were stopped by half a dozen vehicle-borne commandos in a wooded area on the outskirts of the city. The pillion rider was said to have fired at the vehicle and Michael apparently tried to throw a grenade at the commandos who then shot and killed him in an act of self-defence. The police also said Michael was a militant and extortionist. ""My husband was struggling, doing odd jobs. He was a drug user and he was trying to kick the habit. But he was not a militant,"" Ms Ningombam , 40, told me. They had met in college, fallen in love, eloped and married. The neighbourhood had erupted in protests after the killing, demanding an investigation. What made these grannies go nude in public? Why India's 'fake encounters' are shockingly common In pictures: India's gun-violence widows How Punjab's missing thousands are being forgotten Ms Ningombam, who holds a masters degree in history, took up a driving school job to support her sons. She also single-handedly launched an arduous battle for justice, filing official complaints, petitioning the government and the court, collecting papers and coaxing a key potential witness to testify. Every day, for more than a month, she would drive 15km (9 miles) on her scooter to the wooded city outskirts where an ageing shop-owner had spotted the commandos drive by in a SUV with her husband on the afternoon of the killing. Then he had heard the sound of gunfire in the distance. ""After days of coaxing him and interacting with his family, the old man consented to testify and became a key witness. That is how we sometimes get some justice in Manipur. The state doesn't help you,"" she said. Kamalini Ngangban's son Naoba was killed outside the family home in 2009 Four years later, in July 2012, the district judge, in a report, concluded on the basis of evidence that Michael had been killed by Manipur police commandos and that there had ""been no exchange of fire"" between the policemen and the victim. The high court accepted the report, and ordered that 500,000 rupees ($7,759; Â£6,115) should be paid in compensation to Ms Ningombam. Michael Ningombam was not alone in meeting such a fate. Rights groups believe as many as 1,528 people were unlawfully executed - also known as fake encounters - in Manipur between 1979 and 2012. The overwhelming majority of the victims were men, many of them lower income and unemployed. Among those killed were 98 minors and 31 women. The oldest was an 82-year-old woman; the youngest, a 14-year-old girl. The most well-known victim was Thangjam Manorama Devi, 32, who was allegedly gang raped and murdered by paramilitary soldiers in 2004, provoking aunique nude protestby mothers and grandmothers that stunned the world. Some of the killings have been investigated by a federal human rights organisation. Judicial inquiries have resulted in compensation for a few hundred victims' families. But what is unsettling is that not a single policeman or soldier has been put on trial in connection with the killings. ""People have been picked up, called insurgents and killed. The climate of impunity means the police often don't register cases. You have to fix accountability. You cannot just suspend the right to live and kill people,"" says Babloo Loitongbam, a prominent human rights activist. Eight years ago, the families of the victims joined hands with activists to do something about this ""culture of impunity enjoyed by the police, army and paramilitaries"". On a July morning in 2009, they gathered in a room in Imphal, shared their stories and starkly christened themselves the Extrajudicial Execution Victim Families Association. The Extra Judicial Victim Families Association works out of a single-room office in Imphal Last July, responding to a petition filed by the families, the Supreme Court, in alandmark judgement,external, asked the petitioners to collect more information about the alleged murders. Even if the investigations revealed that the victim was an ""enemy and an unprovoked aggressor"", the judges said, it had to be determined whether ""excessive or retaliatory force was used to kill the enemy"". So the newly empowered civilian ""investigators"" put out adverts and appeals in the local media, and began gathering information - and potential evidence - on the killings. Some 900 families responded, bringing with them police complaints, post-mortem reports, funeral records and court orders related to killings. Volunteers - students, relatives of victims - spread out to each of the nine districts of the hilly state, collecting information. A local lawyer, working pro bono, helped with the legal work. A year later, a dozen grey filing cabinets in the office were overflowing with more than 1,500 files, each devoted to a killing. In April, the victims handed over details of 748 killings to the court even as they worked on other cases. Sometime this month, the top court is expected to rule on investigating these cases. The banal horror of death in Manipur is possibly unequalled in India. ""It takes us a long time to raise our children. Then, when they grow up, they are shot. This cannot go on. We no longer want to look for our children in the morgue,"" a women's rights activist in the state once said. There have been countrywide protests against the alleged killings in Manipur Men disappeared or were picked up by security forces while going to the market to buy fertiliser for their farms, parts for cars, to rent a DVD or while waiting for a passenger bus. Others were killed on their way to meet girlfriends, while fishing in a lake, or simply having food in a restaurant. A woman was shot while she was feeding her baby girl. Sometimes, security forces would simply break into homes, drag out suspects in front of their families and kill them. That is what happened to Ngangban Naoba Singh, a 29-year-old theology student, on a still summer night in May 2009. Naoba had returned home with his sister from a wedding late in the evening. The two were watching a film on TV, when their mother, Kamalini Ngangban, a retired census worker, joined her children. ""These late-night movies are not meant for elders. Go to sleep,"" Naoba joked. Those were his last words. Around midnight, Ms Ngangban woke up to ""violent knocking on the door"". Then she heard voices. Some people were trying to enter the house. She rushed to her son's bedroom and woke him up, and tried to take him out of the back door. Did she think that they had coming looking for her son? ""I knew something was wrong. Naoba was so sleepy, I don't think he realised what was going on. ""The moment we stepped out of the back door, someone stopped us."" She saw silhouettes in the moonlight. She thought she saw 10 of them. One man shouted at Naoba: ""Where are you going?"" He said his mother had asked him to come out. Things quickly spiralled out of control in the dark. The men ""took away"" Naoba, his parents were pushed back into the house, their phones were removed and the doors bolted from outside. There was an exchange of words, some orders were barked out, and then shots rang out in the darkness. ""Stop him! Stop him!"" somebody screamed. A vehicle was starting up behind the house. Ms Ngangban hoped her son had managed to run away. It was pitch dark, and the family was confined inside the house for the rest of the night. When dawn broke, they found out that her son had been killed in their backyard and his body taken away in a vehicle. More than 1,500 people have been allegedly executed unlawfully in Manipur ""Even today,  I don't know why he was murdered. I want to know the truth. If we did something wrong and tried to escape, they could have shot him in the leg,"" she says. ""You know, he was my favourite son. We used to go to the theatre together. My two other children live and work outside Manipur. Naoba was supposed to be the man of the house."" The police said they had cordoned off the house that night to search for Naoba, who they said was a member of an outlawed rebel group and an extortionist. Three years later, a judicial inquiry report ruled there was no evidence to show he was either. The judge ruled the police commandos had fired ""indiscriminately without any attempt to arrest Naoba by following the rule of law prevailing in this democratic country"". The Supreme Court is now hearing the case, and is to decide on compensating the family. Staying at home was no guarantee that your life was secure. Oinam Amina Devi, for example, was shot by paramilitary soldiers while she was feeding her one-month-old baby girl in her house in April 1996. The soldiers had chased a suspected rebel who had run into her tin-roof village home and hidden under the bed. Amina, who was on the veranda, panicked and ran inside with her baby when she saw the soldiers running in. When she tried to shut the door, the soldiers opened fire. A bullet pierced her and exited, then entered her baby. The bleeding daughter was taken to hospital where surgeons removed the bullet. Her mother died instantly. There were demonstrations in the area and the family refused to accept Amina's body after the post mortem.  Her corpse was taken back to the police station and later cremated. Under pressure, the government announced an inquiry. The investigation concluded that the firing was ""unprovoked, unwarranted and indiscriminate"". The government submitted the report to the Supreme Court and the family received a compensation of 50,000 rupees. Today, the daughter, Oinam Sunita Devi, 20, lives with her father who married again. ""I cannot explain my sadness. I miss my mother and I sometimes wonder how I survived. This is my fate,"" she says. Oinam Sunita Devi (right) was hit by a bullet fired by soldiers which killed her mother and now lives with her father (left) The police and security forces have, for the most part, maintained that the encounters are genuine and the victims were militants killed in counter-insurgency or anti-terror operations. The government told the top court last year that some ""5,000 militants were holding some 2.3 million people of Manipur to ransom and keeping people in constant fear"". It said 365 police and paramilitaries had been killed by the rebels between 2000 and October 2012. But things have become murkier after a police commando Herojit Singh admitted to journalists in January last year that he hadshot dead an unarmed, suspected rebel,externalinside a bustling Imphal market in 2009. In achilling interview,externalin July he admitted to killing more than 100 people and that he kept a ""tally of his kills"" in notebooks. When I met him last month in a hotel room in the city, the 36-year-old policeman, son of a government worker, said he was battling depression. He said he hadn't slept at all at night for two years. He had also survived a road accident in the city; many feel someone may have tried to kill him as he had made too many enemies. When I asked him how many people he had killed, he said: ""I don't remember the details."" ""Was it more than 100 people?"" I asked. ""Yes."" He said he felt no remorse for the killings, and he was ready to face any punishment. ""I was simply doing my duty and following the orders of my seniors. I confessed because I thought it was important to tell the truth,"" he said. Life has been difficult after his confession. Detectives from the federal Central Bureau of Investigation are investigating the killing of 23-year-old Chungkham Sanjit in the market and questioned the commando more than 10 times. Herojit Singh has been suspended a number of times for ""indiscipline and grave misconduct"", and then reinstated. By day, he spends time with his children, helping them with their homework. When his pet chicken fell ill recently, he says he panicked, clasped it to his chest and ran with it to the vet. Leitanthem Priya Leika's husband Premananda was killed on his way to the market to buy timber in 2006 Nights are brutal. ""I dread nights. I wish I had my own sun, which I could put in the sky and there would never be any darkness,"" he says. Yumnam Joykumar Singh, the former chief of Manipur police, and now the deputy chief minister of a newly-elected government ruling the state, says Herojit Singh is exaggerating his role in the killings. ""He's bluffing. He was possibly involved in 10-15 encounters. But he's claiming he has killed so many people. Let the courts ask him how many cases he was present in."" Mr Singh, who earned a reputation for being a firm and unyielding policeman, says rights groups are exaggerating the number of fake encounters. ""There might have been a few cases [of] extra-judicial killings, but I don't think the numbers being quoted are that many. If 1,500 people had been killed illegally, there would have been more protests in the state,"" he told me. During his time as the chief of police, Mr Singh beefed up the force - from 20,000 to 34,000 policemen - and made it ""the leading force"" to fight insurgents. He said militancy and extortion had led to a near-collapse of public order in the state, and he told his policemen: ""If you have a weapon, you can fire back."" ""That is how we fought the insurgency."" Bringing up the dead is not easy. Memories fade. Potential evidence - post mortem reports, police complaints - yellow and crumble with age. Hope waxes and wanes. Time heals wounds, but also allows for reflection, and gives you renewed purpose. So, emboldened by the Supreme Court's intervention, the families of victims in Manipur have plunged into an unexpectedly fierce fight for justice, in many cases years after they lost their loved ones. The killings have stopped, but there have been no punishments for the crimes yet. The families have stirred with a newly-found collective courage, not because they have great hope in an egregious and slow-moving criminal justice system. Many say they don't want their children and families to be permanently tainted by fake allegations about their fathers, brothers, sons, daughters and wives. They know the crimes and misdemeanours of a family member can easily taint all born within it. ""I kept fighting because of my sons. I don't want people to call them children of a militant. I had to clear my dead husband's name to protect them,"" says Ms Neena Nongmaithem. ""And, yes, the dead should not be completely forgotten."" Pictures by Varun Nayar and Karen Dias Â© 2025 BBC.

Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private?,"The claim:Average public sector pay is higher than private sector, even adjusted for qualifications Reality Check verdict:It is a difficult comparison to make, but IFS calculations suggest that Lord Lamont is probably right. However, in recent years private sector pay has been growing faster than public sector pay and the gap between public and private pay is expected to continue to narrow in the coming years if current government policies are implemented. Former chancellor Lord Lamont was on Radio 4 on Monday morning championing the case for continued pay restraint. He pointed out that public sector pay in Great Britain is above private sector even taking into account qualifications. The point about qualifications is important, because jobs in the public sector tend to require higher qualifications. Also, there has been a tendency for public sector bodies to outsource lower-paid functions such as cleaning and catering to contractors, which moves them from the public to the private sector. Doing so on a large scale would increase average earnings in the public sector. There tends to be a wider range of pay in the private sector - there are more low earners and more high earners. If you look at seasonally adjustedaverage weekly earnings,externalfor regular pay in the public sector, it was Â£506 a week in April, compared with Â£464 in the private sector. But Lord Lamont was talking about earnings adjusted for qualifications.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS),externalmade this comparison in May, when it found that average public sector pay was about 3% above the private sector, although it warned that it could only adjust for whether somebody had a degree, for example, and not what the degree was in, or how good a degree it was. Another thing that makes this comparison tricky is that staff in the public sector tend to have better pension provision, with earnings-related schemes still common in the public sector but unusual in the private. This is not reflected in the average earnings figures. Bonus payments are more common in the private sector and they are also not included in these average earnings figures. The gap between public and private sector earnings has been narrowing as a result of two years of frozen public sector pay starting in 2011 followed by 1% caps. In recent years private sector pay has been growing faster than public sector pay. Part of this effect has been to catch up with the period around 2009, when, as a result of the financial crisis, private sector average earnings fell substantially, while public sector earnings were much more resilient. During that period the gap between public and private sector earnings grew. But inflation has been growing faster than both public and private sector pay, meaning that workers have seen their pay fall in real terms. The IFS has warned that if the government's current plans are implemented, the gap between public and private sector pay will return to levels last seen in the 2000s, when there were considerable difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. Public-sector pay growing more slowly than inflation is reflected in a reportcommissioned by the Office of Manpower Economics published on Monday,external. It looked at what had happened to real (adjusted for inflation) median wages for 10 occupations covered by pay review bodies, between 2005 and 2015. The median wage is the one earned by the person compared with whom half of workers are paid more, and half paid less. Average hourly pay for doctors has fallen from Â£38 an hour in 2005 to Â£30 in 2015, while the average pay of nurses is unchanged at Â£16 an hour. Police officers have seen their pay fall from Â£20 an hour to Â£18, and teachers' pay is down from Â£25 to Â£22.

Public sector pay: Will they or won't they?,"Will they or won't they? As we've been reporting in the last few days, there's been a frenzied guessing game, stoked by some cabinet ministers themselves, over the future for the pay of nurses, teachers, police officers, and the rest of the five million or so people who work in the public sector. In the aftermath of the election, some in cabinet argue that scrapping the pay cap would be a way of showing they had heard the electorate's call, proof they had listened to public concerns. No politician, not least one clinging on in a minority government, wants to appear deaf to the concerns of the public. One senior figure arguing for a relaxation of the cap argues that the Tories have to get out in front of the issue, to neutralise it, before what could be a long, hot summer of political discontent, claiming that Cabinet is moving towards a consensus position to ""scrap the cap"", at least showing willing to accept the recommendations of the independent pay bodies as they report over the coming months. But after a majority-losing election where the Tories ditched their core script on sound money, others are in a very different position. One minister said, it would be ""utter madness"" to ditch a central part of their economic programme, their ""record for stewardship"", questioning whether an ""utterly useless"" election campaign should result in junking the economic discipline the government should be proud of. Another questioned ""the idea you can just walk away from the cap without serious consequences"". Yes, sticking to the cap causes the Tories political damage, but so might raising taxes, or making cuts somewhere else to do it. Arguably the simpler part of the debate has been had - many public sector workers are feeling the pinch, and there is more and more pressure to remove the limit on pay rises. The more complicated bit, who or what would pay for the increase, is a conversation that's yet to happen. Whatever Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have said in the last twenty four hours, don't expect anything to happen in a hurry. The first pay review body is not due to report for another few weeks. It seems unlikely that the government will announce any plan to either ditch the cap or promise to accept the decisions of the review bodies before then. It's not in either Theresa May or Philip Hammond's DNA to make quick decisions. One of her allies reports there is simply no decision. But how they show they are in tune with volatile public opinion while going through a decision making process is not straightforward either.

Putting the glamour back into flying,"This video can not be played I wanted to be able to go online and book a private jet, says Sergey Petrossov In its infancy, commercial air travel was expensive, and seemed like the ultimate in luxury. Today, that era seems long gone. Delays, strikes, long queues at security checkpoints, packed planes, and incidents likethe violent removal of a passengerfrom a United Airlines flight, are just some of the factors that lead many air travellers to view their next trip with dread rather than delight. Despite this, there have been attempts over the past couple of decades to bring some of the glamour back to flying, by trying to revolutionise the private aviation market. Some of these endeavours relied on the use of innovative manufacturing techniques that promised to produce small aircraft at lower costs than previously thought possible, and then to use these aeroplanes to offer new services. In the 2000s, Dayjet, based in Florida, planned to make use of a fleet of Eclipse aircraft (one of a new breed of ""very light jets"" or VLJs) to offer ""on-demand"" flights at cheaper prices than those charged by existing private air charter firms. Booking a private jet used to involve sending faxes back and forth, says JetSmarter founder Sergey Petrossov Although this initiative failed, entrepreneurs have continued to try to rethink the private aviation market. A series of start-ups are now applying new technology to the challenge. This time, however, the focus is on streamlining the booking and scheduling of aircraft, rather than on the process of building them. Some of these ventures have already failed, whilst others, like Surfair, have begun to expand across the globe. Another of the new players is JetSmarter, which has headquarters in Fort Lauderdale in Florida. Its founder, Sergey Petrossov, first became interested in the field almost a decade ago, when he was invited to join a friend on a private jet flight. Many private jets flew one way with no passengers at all, Sergey Petrossov discovered Mr Petrossov, an entrepreneur who had previously launched businesses involved in education technology, found the private aviation world fascinating. He decided to research the market; what he discovered astonished him. For one thing, in the late 2000s, booking a private flight often involved using fax machines to send documents back and forth. ""When I heard 'fax' I was thinking [that] this sounds like a stock market transaction in the eighties"", he laughs. He was amazed to learn that, at the time, it was not generally possible to book flights online. JetSmarter aims to make booking a seat on a private plane as easy as booking a taxi He began to look deeper into the industry. ""The craziest thing about it was the average private airplane was only flying 200 hours a year, when optimally they could be flying 1500 hours a year. ""And out of the 200 hours it was flying, one-third of the hours didn't have a single passenger on them - they were just flying empty,"" Mr Petrossov recalls. He saw a big opportunity to create a new business selling empty seats on private jets, with a modernised online booking process. The use of smartphone apps would make immediate reservations a possibility, in the same way that users of online taxi services like Uber can make instant cab bookings. Mr Petrossov believes that this approach allows him to offer flights on private jets at lower prices, and to open up the market to a new group of customers. Private jets are a world apart from the delays and long queues involved in normal flights The JetSmarter business model involves a membership scheme. Customers pay an annual fee of $15,000 (Â£11,547; 13,127 euros), which includes access to some flights free of further charges; for an additional cost they can also arrange flights themselves, and in some cases share the cost of these with other members. The company does not operate any planes itself. Instead flights are provided by various private jet operators in the US and several other countries around the world. The key to success for his enterprise, says Mr Petrossov, lies in the size of the community of customers. ""It's built on having a core base of members that then start to talk about it, and building that core is by far the most difficult [task]â¦. it's like any other social network. ""If you don't have the people in it you can't scale it, you can't grow it,"" he explains. The key to success lies in the size of the community of customers, says Mr Petrossov The greater the number of members, Mr Petrossov continues, the greater the number of flights, and the more attractive the proposition becomes to both existing and new customers. The firm is also starting to offer additional services, such as accommodation, in the hope of providing travellers with a seamless, ""end to end"" experience. How crafts workers are learning to sell their work The woman trying to revive a century-old leather brand The nuclear bunkers designed for luxury living It is not yet clear whether new approaches to private aviation like the one being pioneered by JetSmarter will be viable in the long term. But Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group which focuses on the aerospace and defence industry, says he finds these new business models ""intriguing"". ""Maybe this time technology companies can get it right,"" he says. Mr Aboulafia adds that applying technology to the booking and scheduling side of the business is a smarter idea than trying to find an innovative way to dramatically cut the cost of building private jets. The latter approach almost always ends in grief, not least because it can consume vast amounts of capital, he says.

'I'm swapping nursing for botox',"Constantina Antaniou became a nurse because she loves caring for people. ""I want to look after people, I'm that type of person - I wanted a profession where I can do this,"" Constantina told the BBC. She left what she describes as the ""NHS rat race"" to join a GP surgery, where she has been since September 2016. But after 27 years working in hospitals and as a community nurse, she is leaving her nursing career to work in botox. ""It's very frustrating when you want to do a job you love but you're not supported, you're not given the resources, you're not valued,"" she explained. For the first time since 2008, more nurses and midwives in the UK are leaving the profession than are joining it,figures reveal. Meanwhile the number of unfilled posts hasdoubledin three years to 40,000. ""We work long hours as it is, and on top of that, we hardly get breaks because the lack of staff means we are run off our feet,"" explains Constantina. ""It was so hard working as a community nurse - I was supposed to work 8am to 5pm, but I often stayed until 8pm and I didn't get overtime. ""We've been working in unsafe conditions - there aren't enough nurses to fill the shifts because staff are off sick with stress. ""I was supposed to see 18 people in four and half hours - it is impossible to do that in a safe way. ""I kept thinking 'I'm rushing, I'm rushing, I could make a mistake'.""

""Why get into huge debt to work in a really stressful job with low pay?"" After completing a course in botox administration this year, Constantina says she hopes a new career in cosmetic surgery will be less stressful and more lucrative. ""I want to work in an area where I can support myself. I might even set up my own business. They told me potential earnings are Â£50,000 - and I could be my own boss.

The Conservative MP who's an unlikely social media star,"An eccentric Eton and Oxford-educated Conservative backbencher, well known in Westminster for his unique oratory and sardonic put downs, has become an unlikely cult figure on social media - sparking rumours of an outsider party leadership bid. Social media cults of personality are common on the left of British politics - think ofCorbynistasor theMilifandom. So it should be no surprise that young right-wing activists have been seeking their own social media star. And they seem to have found one in Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Not only are dozens of Facebook pages devoted to Rees-Mogg - the biggest have tens of thousands of likes - but after recently joiningInstagram,external, Rees-Mogg's quips about his life on the campaign trail have built up a huge online following. He's now more popular on Instagram than the personal account of Prime MinisterTheresa May,external. Rees-Mogg shared this image of him campaigning with his young son with the caption 'We shall have to take our business elsewhere'. It was liked thousands of times. ""I am a late convert to social media and it's turned out to be great fun,"" Rees-Mogg tells BBC Trending. ""We've put up some jolly photographs.  You hear a lot about unpleasantness but it's reassuring that there is a lighter touch."" The MP admits that he is surprised by his newfound popularity. On Facebook, thousands of people have joined public groups whichsatirise or support,externalRees-Mogg. The""Middle Class Memes for Rees-Moggian Teens"",externalis one of the largest, with more than 30,000 followers. It posts daily updates offering a satirical take on the day's news. Its 16 moderators range in age from 16 to 20 and are spread across the UK and Canada. In addition to celebrating Rees-Mogg, the page includes scathing memes about Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and other politicians. But, speaking to BBC Trending, the group's moderators insist that their main purpose is humour rather than serious politics. ""We only wish to create satire to make people laugh and engage in politics, and if we make a few more conservative voters on the way that would be a bonus,"" they say. ""We believe Mogg appeals because he is the embodiment of traditional British values. It also helps that he is a bit eccentric as this helps us create a slightly satirical image."" In a somewhat bizarre episode, one of the Rees-Mogg-themed groups used their page to call out an online scam artist. The parody account ""The Church of Mogg"" was approached by a man who claimed to be a Nigerian prince who said he had ""worshipped"" the Conservative MP ""for centuries"". It was an obvious scam, so one of the moderators behind the account engaged the man in conversation. The ""prince"" asked for an airline ticket and spending money, which the ""church"" agreed to provide, as long as he sent a bunch of embarrassing pictures. ""It's an extremely funny alternative to those inheritance letters you get promising you money,"" Rees-Mogg quipped when told the story by BBC Trending. ""But I suppose I should add that as an ardent follower of the real church, I'm not sure the church would really approve of me setting up my own church in the first place,"" he says. Many of these Facebook groups have a more serious purpose - namely to persuade Rees-Mogg to stand for leader of the Conservative Party. Sam Frost is a young Conservative activist from London who set up the Facebook page ""Ready for Rees Mogg,external"" after the recent General Election. He told BBC Trending that what started as a fun group to share memes quickly spiralled into a significant young Tory movement. ""The general election wasn't exciting because Theresa May didn't give people something to believe in,"" he says. ""My Facebook group got 1,000 likes overnight, and I reached out to other young Conservative activists and we decided to create a website, where people could sign a petition to say they were ready to support Jacob Rees-Mogg when he launches a leadership bid."" ""In a matter of days we had gathered more than 10,000 signatures. I was surprised because although there were large numbers from the South of England, there were a lot more than I expected from the North and Scotland."" ""There are too many wish-washy politicians in Westminster, I think people like Jacob because he has a rare ability to explain complex issues and he's not afraid to say what he thinks,"" Frost says. Jacob Rees-Mogg alluded to his new leadership potential in this popular Instagram post which includes an unscientific poll. His caption read: 'Nanny is more technologically capable than I thought'. Unfortunately, it appears that these young activists will be disappointed. ""I am fully supporting Mrs May,"" Rees-Mogg says. ""This is all light-hearted banter but it would be a mistake to let it go to one's head.""

No 10 sticks to public sector pay policy,"Downing Street insists its position on public sector pay has not changed despite several ministers calling for the 1% cap on increases to be scrapped. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is the latest senior cabinet minister to put pressure on the chancellor and the PM to change the policy. No 10 said ministers would respond to pay review bodies in due course. But 1% rises for dentists, nurses, doctors and the military have already been agreed for this year, it added. When the matter was raised in the Commons, a minister said the government wanted to ensure ""frontline public service workers"" were ""paid fairly for their work"". Nick Hurd, a policing minister, told MPs how to do this was ""under active discussion"". Ahmed: Hammond's public sector pay challenge Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private? Listen to pay bodies, says Gove Thousands march in anti-austerity protest A Whitehall source said Mr Johnson ""strongly"" believed pay rises could be achieved in ""a responsible way"", without putting undue pressure on the public finances. The Institute for Fiscal Studieshas estimated,externalthat increasing public sector pay in line with the private sector would cost an extra Â£6.3bn a year. In the Queen's Speech debate last month, Mr Hammond made clear his aversion to higher borrowing. Are you a public sector worker affected by these issues?  Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external However, on Sunday Mr Gove, the environment secretary, appeared to reject suggestions that taxes would need to go up to meet the cost of any pay rises. Pay rises for most public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% each year since 2013. Before that, there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. In addition to the 1% annual rise, some NHS staff also get incremental increases as they progress in their roles. The Conservatives went into the election planning to maintain the cap until 2020, but there are growing calls for a rethink after the party lost its majority in the general election. This video can not be played ""If you are taking the government shilling, you need to stick to the government line"" says Tory MP Stephen Crabb The pay review bodies cover a wide range of professions, from prison officers and nurses, to judges and senior NHS managers. Those covering police and teachers' pay are due to report this month. The cap has been applied across the UK, but the Scottish government has said it plans to end it in Scotland. Nurses last month held protests against the public sector pay cap BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Arguably the simpler part of the debate has been had - many public sector workers are feeling the pinch, and there is more and more pressure to remove the limit on pay rises. The more complicated bit, who or what would pay for the increase, is a conversation that's yet to happen. Whatever Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have said in the last twenty four hours, don't expect anything to happen in a hurry. The first pay review body is not due to report for another few weeks. It seems unlikely that the government will announce any plan to either ditch the cap or promise to accept the decisions of the review bodies before then. It's not in either Theresa May or Philip Hammond's DNA to make quick decisions.Read more from Laura Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lamont told BBC Radio 4's Today programme public sector pay was on average higher than in the private sector and controlling it was ""extremely important"". He said cases could be looked at where there were specific issues around recruitment but objected to the ""general pressure that's being applied, the idea that we should abandon restraint of public expenditure"". He said people should not criticise austerity in the same way they might discuss ""too many repeats on television"" and said it was not right for cabinet ministers to ""gang up"" on Mr Hammond, saying they were making the chancellor's position ""very awkward"". ""This is not a choice,"" he added. ""It is unavoidable that we have restraint on public spending."" Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said ""within the scale of things"" Mr Hammond could ""afford a few billions here and there"", but added the chancellor would be worried that if he gives money to one part of the public sector he will come under pressure to do the same in other areas. Decisions on public sector pay are taken by the government after receiving recommendations from independent 'pay review bodies' There are eight of these, which each make their own recommendations for different sectors of the 5.4m public sector workforce They have six to eight members, who are appointed by ministers, and produce their recommendations at different points during the year In reaching a recommendation they have to consider the need to ""recruit, retain and motivate"" staff They also need to consider the ""financial circumstances"" of the government Since the 2010 Budget, it has been government policy for public sector pay to be frozen or, more recently, capped at 1% Pay review bodies are able to recommend higher increases despite this policy, although the former chairman of several bodies, Alasdair Smith, told the BBC to do so would be a ""big step"" Civil servants have also been subject to the 1% cap, although they are not covered by pay review bodies Individual government departments have responsibility for implementing pay policy following guidelines set by the Treasury NHS Confederation chairman and former Tory minister Stephen Dorrell said the pay review bodies should not be ""artificially constrained"" by the 1% policy, saying health service staff needed to be ""properly looked after"". And former cabinet minister Stephen Crabb said ministers who disagreed with the official government policy should not be in the cabinet. ""I don't think it's a great sight seeing different cabinet members giving slightly different messages to the media,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Gove did not call directly for the 1% cap to be lifted, but said ministers should respect the ""integrity"" of the pay review process. Last week Labour attempted to scrap the 1% cap but was defeated in Parliament. This video can not be played Ex-chancellor Lamont: Stop ganging up on Hammond This video can not be played Gove's quick-fire answers on the Andrew Marr show - Brexit and his return to the cabinet Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said reports on the divisions within government over public sector pay revealed there was ""turmoil"" in the Conservative Party. ""They're saying 'Wait for the pay review bodies', even though they're the ones insisting on a 1% cap,"" the Labour frontbencher told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. ""We're saying to the pay review bodies: 'Get rid of the 1% cap and give a fair pay rise.'"" Asked what level of pay rise Labour thought was fair, Mr Ashworth said the pay review bodies should consider one in line with the rise in average earnings across the economy.

Hammondâs public sector pay challenge,"The Treasury jealously guards its role as keeper of the public purse. And far from the mood since the general election easing on the matter of ""sound money"", the word among senior figures in the department is that now is the time ""to hold our nerve"". Sources close to the chancellor point out that plans to balance the books - meaning that the government only spends as much as it receives in revenues, mostly in taxes - have already been delayed three times since 2010. The present target is for the deficit - that difference between government income and expenditure - to be eliminated by 2025. Philip Hammond wants to maintain that plan. He sticks to a pretty well-known script when asked about increasing public spending. Government wealth, he says, comes from three main areas. The first is taxes - which, it is pointed out, the chancellor tried to increase in March, only for plans to raise national insurance contributions to be abandoned when it was revealed that it breached the Conservatives' 2015 manifesto pledge not to increase income tax, national insurance or VAT. Is increasing taxes any more palatable now? Second, borrowing - which the chancellor makes clear means increasing the amount of money that needs to be paid back by future generations. And, finally, an increase in the ability of the economy to create wealth - called productivity. It is this last area that is the most important and, conversely, the least open to direct government intervention. The Treasury - as much as it might want to - cannot simply demand that the private and public sector becomes more efficient at delivering goods and services. It takes time, money and training in skills - none of which the UK has a particularly proud tradition in. And anything that is done by the government - such as increasing investment in infrastructure projects like digital broadband or new railway links - takes a long time to feed through to stronger wealth creation, higher economic growth and higher government tax receipts. It is in within such classically ""Treasury"" parameters that Mr Hammond would like to see the present debate on increasing public spending considered. Today, pressure is growing from Cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove for the government to relax its approach to the public sector pay cap, asmy colleague Iain Watson reports. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that every 1% increase in public sector pay would cost between Â£1.5 and Â£2bn a year. A pay rise for more than five million public sector workers who have seen their real incomes squeezed in the majority of years since the financial crisis is not cost-free. And private sector workers on average still earn 3% to 4% less than public sector workers - although their wages are now rising more rapidly and the gap is closing. Two of the major pay review bodies - for the NHS and for schools - have reported increasing problems of recruitment and retention in their sectors. That warning is likely to be repeated by the schools review body when it reports later this month. Last July, it said: ""If current recruitment and retention trends continue, we expect an uplift to the pay framework significantly higher than 1% will be required to ensure an adequate supply of good teachers for schools in England and Wales."" The police pay review body, also expected to report imminently, sees fewer pressures. ""The general picture on officer recruitment and retention remains healthy,"" it said last year. ""There are also no issues on the quality of applicants, the number of joiners is meeting requirements and attrition rates are stable."" It does, however, say that ""motivation and morale"" remain a problem. The Treasury knows it is in a difficult position - and must be heaving a sigh of relief that the health service pay review body is not due to report until next spring. Abandoning the pay cap would certainly go some way to alleviating the standard-of-living squeeze felt by so many people. And would be politically popular for a lot of people. But Mr Hammond will have plenty of other pleas for increased funding to listen to. What spending demands might flow from the Grenfell fire tragedy? Should teachers' pay be increased, or is it more important to focus on raising per-pupil funding? Tackling both adds to the bill which someone - the Treasury argues - has to pay now, through higher taxes, in the future, through higher borrowing or via further cuts elsewhere. Such trade-offs are the stuff of politics - and the stuff of Budgets, the next of which is not due until November. Mr Hammond might prefer a period of silence from colleagues on spending commitments until then. But, with Parliament finely balanced and a prime minister relying on the good will of others to keep her in power, he knows he is not going to get it.

US governor suns himself on closed beach,"This video can not be played Hot and bothered: How 'beachgate' unfolded New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing heavy criticism after he was photographed relaxing on a state beach he had ordered closed to the public. The Republican gave the go-ahead for non-essential services to be shut down - including the Island State Beach Park - over the 4 July holiday weekend because of a budget impasse. ""I didn't get any sun today,"" he said, before theaerial photos emerged,external. The pictures show Mr Christie and his family on an otherwise empty beach. Other visitors were turned away by police. The governor defended his actions on Monday morning, telling Fox News that he had said earlier in the week he intended to spend time with his family at his beach property. ""The governor is allowed to go to his residences,"" he said. The fall and fall of Chris Christie Mr Christie said his family was spending the weekend at the governor's residence there and he was commuting to work by state helicopter. ""That's just the way it goes. Run for governor, and you have can have a residence there,"" he said at a news conference on Sunday. ""I didn't get any sun today,"" he added. After being told of the photographs, his spokesman Brian Murray admitted Mr Christie had ""briefly"" been on the beach ""talking to his wife and family before heading into the office"", NJ.com said. ""He did not get any sun. He had a baseball hat on,"" Mr Murray reportedly added. The image of Mr Christie lounging in a deckchair quickly spawned several memes, as Twitter jokers transplanted the governor to alternative locations. Submissions included the Oval Office, and the beach from the 1953 classic film From Here To Eternity. The partial government shutdown arose because New Jersey legislators had not passed a health insurance bill that Mr Christie said had to be approved alongside the state's budget. The shutdown included the closure of Island State Beach Park, one of New Jersey's few free public beaches, and all other state parks. Mr Christie had been trying to get the state's largest health insurer, Horizon Cross Blue Shield, to hand over $300m (Â£230m), some of which Mr Christie wanted to use to battle drug addiction, the New York Timesreported,external. New Jersey is one of at least nine states that were unable to meet their budget deadlines at the beginning of the month.

Pensioners among dead in German bus blaze,"This video can not be played Emergency services rushed to the scene Eighteen people died when their tour bus collided with a lorry and burst into flames on the A9 motorway in southern Germany, police say. Another 30 on the bus were hurt and two of them were fighting for their lives. The bus was carrying a group of German pensioners at the time of the fire near Stammbach in northern Bavaria. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said rescuers were delayed by ""gawpers"" driving slowly and by the intensity of the blaze. The cause of the fire is unknown. Traffic was reportedly moving slowly at the time and the collision between the two vehicles was not described as a major crash. The lorry's trailer was also incinerated and the burnt-out wreck ended up a short distance ahead of the bus. The German news websiteFrankenpost reports,externalthat it was carrying mattresses and pillows. The lorry driver was unharmed and told police the bus had gone into the back of his vehicle and burst into flames, it said. The burnt-out wrecks of the bus and lorry trailer ended up a short distance apart There were 46 passengers and two drivers on the bus. The bus driver was among those killed. The passengers were men and women aged 66 to 81, heading to Lake Garda in Italy for a holiday. Some of the passengers had got on the bus at Dresden station in the eastern state of Saxony. According to local media in Saxony, the bus had earlier picked up passengers elsewhere in Saxony and also in Brandenburg in the early hours of Monday before going to Dresden and then south-west towards Nuremberg. By mid-afternoon forensic teams had recovered the charred remains of 15 people and police confirmed that 18 had died. Firefighters reached the scene within 10 minutes of the accident but were driven back by the intensity of the fire. ""Only steel parts are recognisable so you can understand what that meant for the people in this bus,"" said German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt. Motoring safety expert Hans-Ulrich Sander suggested that the fuel line that ran under the bus may have ruptured, prompting the fire to spread fast. Five rescue helicopters joined emergency workers at the scene. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was distressed by the accident and expressed sympathy for the injured and bereaved relatives. She thanked the rescuers for looking after people ""in an appalling situation"".

Do passports restrict economic growth?,"""What would we English say if we could not go from London to the Crystal Palace or from Manchester to Stockport without a passport or police officer at our heels? Depend upon it, we are not half enough grateful to God for our national privileges."" So wrote an English publisher named John Gadsby, travelling through Europe in the mid-19th Century. This was before the modern passport system, wearily familiar to anyone who has ever crossed a national border. You stand in a queue, you proffer your standardised booklet to a uniformed official, who glances at your face to check that it resembles the image of your younger, slimmer self. Perhaps she quizzes you about your journey, while her computer checks your name against a terrorist watch-list. For most of history, passports were neither so ubiquitous nor so routine. They were, essentially, a threat: a letter from some powerful person requesting the traveller pass unmolested - or else. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. The concept of passport as protection goes back to biblical times. And protection was a privilege, not a right. Gentlemen such as Gadsby who wanted a passport needed a personal link to the relevant government minister. As Gadsby discovered, the more zealously bureaucratic continental nations had realised the passport's potential as a tool of social and economic control. A century earlier, French citizens had to show paperwork not only to leave the country, but to travel from town to town. While wealthy countries today secure their borders to keep unskilled workers out, municipal authorities historically used them to stop skilled workers from leaving. As the 19th Century progressed, railways and steamboats made travel faster and cheaper. As Martin Lloyd details in his book The Passport, restrictive travel documents were unpopular. France's Napoleon III abolished passports in 1860 France's Emperor Napoleon III shared Gadsby's admiration for the more relaxed British approach. He described passports as ""an oppressive invention"", and abolished them in 1860. France was not alone. More and more countries either formally abandoned passport requirements or stopped enforcing them, at least in peacetime. You could visit 1890s America without a passport, though it helped if you were white. The visitors greeted by the newly installed Statue of Liberty in the 1890s did not need passports Some South American countries enshrined passport-free travel in their constitutions. In China and Japan, foreigners needed passports only to venture inland. By the turn of the 20th Century, only a handful of countries still insisted on passports to enter or leave. It seemed possible they might soon disappear altogether. What would today's world look like if they had? One morning in September 2015, Abdullah Kurdi, his wife and two young sons boarded a dinghy in Bodrum, Turkey, hoping to make it 4km (2.5 miles) across the Aegean Sea to the Greek island of Kos. But the dinghy capsized in rough seas. Abdullah managed to cling to the boat, but his wife and children drowned. When the body of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi washed up on a Turkish beach and was photographed by a Turkish agency journalist,the image became an icon of the migrant crisisthat had convulsed Europe all summer. Tens of thousands of migrant families have tried to cross from Turkey to Greece The Kurdis hadn't planned to stay in Greece. They hoped eventually to start a new life in Vancouver, where Abdullah's sister Teema is a hairdresser. There are easier ways to travel from Turkey to Canada than taking a dinghy to Kos. Abdullah had money: the 4,000 euros (Â£2,500; $4,460) he paid a people-smuggler could have bought plane tickets for them all - if they had had the right passports. Since the Syrian government denied citizenship to ethnic Kurds, the family had no passports. But even with Syrian documents, they couldn't have boarded a plane to Canada. Passports issued by Sweden or Slovakia, or Singapore or Samoa would have been fine. It can seem natural that the name of the country on our passport determines where we can travel and work - legally, at least. But it's a relatively recent historical development, and, from a certain angle, it's odd. Many countries ban employers from discriminating among workers based on characteristics we can't change: whether we're male or female, young or old, gay or straight, black or white. It's not entirely true that we can't change our passport:$250,000 (Â£193,000) will buy you one from St Kitts and Nevis,external. St Kitts established its ""Citizenship by Investment"" programme in 1984 But, mostly, our passport depends on the identity of our parents and location of our birth. And nobody chooses those. Despite this, there's no public clamour to judge people not by the colour of their passport but by the content of their character. Less than three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, migrant controls are back in fashion. Donald Trump calls for a wall along the US-Mexico border. US President Trump insists that Mexico will reimburse the US for the cost of the border wall, estimates of which vary wildly The Schengen zone cracks under the pressure of the migrant crisis. Europe's leaders scramble to distinguish refugees from ""economic migrants"", the assumption being that someone who isn't fleeing persecution - but merely wants a better job or life - should not be let in. Politically, the logic of restrictions on migration may be increasingly hard to dispute. Yet economic logic points in the opposite direction. In theory, whenever you allow factors of production to follow demand, output rises. In practice, all migration creates winners and losers, but research indicates there are many more winners. In the wealthiest countries - by one estimate - five in six of the existing population are made better off by the arrival of immigrants. So why doesn't this translate into popular support for open borders? The simple steel box that changed the face of global trade How the invention of paper changed the world Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time How air conditioning changed the world There are practical and cultural reasons why migration can be badly managed: if public services aren't upgraded quickly enough to cope with new arrivals, or belief systems prove hard to reconcile. The losses also tend to be more visible than the gains. Suppose a group of Mexicans arrive in America, ready to pick fruit for lower wages than Americans are earning. The benefits - slightly cheaper fruit for everyone - are too widely spread and small to notice, while the costs - some Americans lose their jobs - produce vocal unhappiness. It should be possible to arrange taxes and public spending to compensate the losers. But it doesn't tend to work that way. The economic logic of migration often seems more compelling when it doesn't involve crossing national borders. In 1980s Britain, with recession affecting some of the country's regions more than others, Employment Minister Norman Tebbit notoriously suggested - or was widely interpreted as suggesting - that the jobless should ""get on their bikes"" to look for work. Some economists calculate global economic output would double if anyone could get on their bikes to work anywhere. That suggests today's world would be much richer if passports had died out in the early 20th Century. There's one simple reason they didn't: World War One intervened. Modern passports are remarkably uniform in format With security concerns trumping ease of travel, governments imposed strict new controls on movement, and they proved unwilling to relinquish those powers once peace returned. In 1920, the newly formed League of Nations called an ""International Conference on Passports, Customs Formalities and Through Tickets"", which effectively invented the passport as we know it. From 1921, the conference said, passports should be 15.5cm (6in) by 10.5cm, 32 pages, bound in cardboard, with a photo. The format has changed remarkably little since. Like John Gadsby, anyone with the right colour passport can only count their blessings.

How Wimbledon is using digital to court new fans,"Andy Murray will attempt to retain his men's singles title When you host what is arguably the most famous tennis tournament in the world - Wimbledon - it would be tempting to rest on your sporting laurels and let things tick along as they always have done. Not only is it the longest-established of the four Grand Slam tournaments, but the Championships also enjoy sell out crowds and hospitality every year. The two-week long event is broadcast to millions of fans, and made an operating profit of Â£42m last year. So, things certainly look rosy in the green SW19 garden, with further healthy signs being a 12% increase in the prize money pot this year to Â£31.6m. But income from broadcasters represents more than half of the event's turnover, and a small number of key broadcast markets, notably the UK and USA, provide the majority of that income. With this in mind, executives from tournament operator the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), are looking at new ways to grow awareness and interest in the tournament outside their current Anglo-centric heartlands. ""We want to take the Wimbledon brand to new audiences and regions,"" Mick Desmond, AELTC commercial and media director, tells me. ""It is not just about the people here at Wimbledon, where we have sold out all spectator tickets and all hospitality again. Mr Desmond says Wimbledon has been on a digital journey ""We want to grow our global fan base, the same as the likes of Premier League football or NBA basketball are doing."" He adds: ""Tennis as a sport is in great shape. But we take a long term view in terms of strategy. ""Not just in terms of developing physical infrastructure here on the playing site, but also about building our brand with a younger audience, and also with new audiences in different parts of the world, be it China or Colombia. ""Disruption is everywhere in the modern world, and we always have to be thinking one step ahead."" During the tournament a wealth of information is available via different digital outlets The financial reward from growing its global fan base, will come when Wimbledon signs new TV deals and sponsorship agreements, and is able to show that it can deliver a large and diverse customer base for its partners. ""It all means that we add more value to our media rights, and it means we also offer more value to our commercial partners such as IBM or Jaguar,"" he says. And it is with long-term partner IBM, its official supplier of information technology, that the event is looking to use digital media to spread its message and engage with new fans. ""We have been on a long digital journey over the past seven years,"" Mr Desmond says. Inside the IBM technology bunker underneath the Wimbledon grounds He says that in 2010 Wimbledon had a very good website, but that it looked the same as the other Grand Slam tournament sites, also created by IBM. ""We wanted to enhance the beauty and grace of Wimbledon. For those who could not be here in person, we wanted to give them the next-best experience,"" he says. ""The reaction of fans has been very positive. But we are never happy. We wanted to raise the bar for 2017."" Mr Desmond says that Wimbledon wants to provide a rich digital experience that ensures they connect with fans at the event and across the globe. The Ask Fred app is named after three-times champion Fred Perry This year the AELTC and IBM have offered a new range of digital features, which include: A new real-time tool to highlight matches of particular interest and quality, and not necessarily just those on the main show courts IBM Slam Tracker - a cross-platform application that provides real time scores, stats and insights for all matches in progress Apps for those attending have been enhanced by the Ask Fred assistant which allows fans to plan their day and make the most of their visit On Wimbledon's digital platforms this year there will be computer generated highlights from six main courts - Centre, One, Two Three, 12 and 18 A 360 degree camera view will also be provided from the practice courts IBM is also using all of the data and cognitive computing capabilities put in place for the Championship, to try and work out for fans the characteristics that it takes to be ""a great champion"". ""We are democratising data for tennis and sports fans,"" says Alexandra Willis, head of content and digital at the AELTC. ""We want to get under the skin of tennis matches at Wimbledon, and use digital to deepen engagement with fans."" Graphic showing the differing types and amounts of data analysed and produced for Wimbledon fans She adds: ""We spend a lot of time trying to build our media assets. We are trying to reach a bigger, younger, more engaged audience."" Meanwhile, social media content from the tournament is being adapted into a number of different languages. There will be Facebook pages for fans in Korea, Japan, India, and the Spanish speaking nations. And content is being produced for Weibo and Wechat in China, and for Japanese messenger service Line. ""We are trying to inform fans,"" adds Ms Willis.  ""We are not just pushing content at them, we are tailoring what we do to different types of fans."" With such a varied digital offering, there had been criticism in the past there was no actual wi-fi at the tournament grounds to help ease access to it. This year there will be three areas where public wi-fi is available. They are, from the entrance way at Gate 3 and along to the food court, in the ticket resale area, and at the west stand area of court 12. Organisers say they want to see how well this works, before looking to potentially expand wi-fi access in 2018. Fans will be able to access a wealth of playing facts and data ""We are not complacent about what we are doing with our media and digital assets,"" says Mr Desmond. ""Our brand is the most important thing we have, we need to nurture and develop it. The more we can drive our content and brand, as other sports rights holders are doing, the more we can grow our audience. ""And that can ultimately only help us commercially.""

"German bus inferno killed 18, police say","This video can not be played Emergency services rushed to the scene Eighteen people died when their tour bus collided with a lorry and burst into flames on the A9 motorway in southern Germany, police say. Another 30 on the bus were hurt and two of them were fighting for their lives. The bus was carrying a group of German pensioners at the time of the fire near Stammbach in northern Bavaria. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said rescuers were delayed by ""gawpers"" driving slowly and by the intensity of the blaze. The cause of the fire is unknown. Traffic was reportedly moving slowly at the time and the collision between the two vehicles was not described as a major crash. The lorry's trailer was also incinerated and the burnt-out wreck ended up a short distance ahead of the bus. The German news websiteFrankenpost reports,externalthat it was carrying mattresses and pillows. The lorry driver was unharmed and told police the bus had gone into the back of his vehicle and burst into flames, it said. The burnt-out wrecks of the bus and lorry trailer ended up a short distance apart There were 46 passengers and two drivers on the bus. The bus driver was among those killed. The passengers were men and women aged 66 to 81, heading to Lake Garda in Italy for a holiday. Some of the passengers had got on the bus at Dresden station in the eastern state of Saxony. According to local media in Saxony, the bus had earlier picked up passengers elsewhere in Saxony and also in Brandenburg in the early hours of Monday before going to Dresden and then south-west towards Nuremberg. By mid-afternoon forensic teams had recovered the charred remains of 15 people and police confirmed that 18 had died. Firefighters reached the scene within 10 minutes of the accident but were driven back by the intensity of the fire. ""Only steel parts are recognisable so you can understand what that meant for the people in this bus,"" said German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt. Motoring safety expert Hans-Ulrich Sander suggested that the fuel line that ran under the bus may have ruptured, prompting the fire to spread fast. Five rescue helicopters joined emergency workers at the scene. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was distressed by the accident and expressed sympathy for the injured and bereaved relatives. She thanked the rescuers for looking after people ""in an appalling situation"".

Child abuse home 'should be demolished',"This video can not be played Care Inquiry: Francis Oldham QC delivers scathing report Children may still be at risk in Jersey's care system, a report into seven decades of child abuse has found. Live electrical wires were applied to children's legs, one survivor told the The Independent Jersey Care Inquiry. Victims also reported being beaten with nettles, having their heads dunked in cold water and being sexually abused. The States of Jersey had ""proved to be an ineffectual and neglectful substitute parent"", the report said. Chief Minister, Senator Ian Gorst apologised and said: ""We failed children who needed our care."" Jersey care home inquiry: Decades of abuse The inquiry, led by judge Frances Oldham QC, has recommended demolishing the Haut de la Garenne children's home, where much of the abuse took place. This video can not be played Gifford Aubin shares his experience at Haut de la Garenne More on the child abuse report Survivor Gifford Aubin who was at the home in the 1950s described his treatment: ""They were putting these wires on your legs, that sort of thing... ""And also hitting you with a pre-war army stick, you know, like a sergeant major or officer would have. It had a metal end, so you can imagine how that cut into you."" He also suffered mental abuse from his experiences. The inquiry, launched in 2014, heard 553 offences took place between 1947 and 2004, with more than half said to have occurred at Haut de la Garenne. Jacky de la Haye was one of a handful of girls at the home and said she suffered psychological abuse. This video can not be played Jacky de la Haye shares her experiences at Haut de la Garenne ""I have nightmares that I'm still there,"" she said. While a lot of the inquiry focused on Haut de la Garenne, a number of other incidents, not previously revealed, came to light. The revelations of assault, bullying and slavery at the SacrÃ© Coeur Orphanage led to a fresh call for witnesses from the inquiry panel. A witness, known as ""Mrs A"" said outside of school hours children were forced to work unpaid in a knitting factory run by the nuns at the orphanage. In February 2015 one survivor known as ""Witness D"", now in his 40s, told the inquiry he was too scared to report the abuse he suffered to the authorities while he was at Haut de la Garenne. He told the hearing he was sexually abused by two members of staff, William Gilbert and Phil Le Bais. They were never charged and have now died. Former Haut de la Garenne resident, Gifford Aubin said a lack of staff meant older boys were often left in charge Being beaten with nettles as a punishment for bedwetting Having their hair forcibly cut off Having their mouths washed out with soap Spending long periods in an isolation room Having fat from a frying pan poured over them Being punched and slapped Being sexually abused Source: The Independent Jersey Care Inquiry - A 62 page appendix details the abuse suffered in the care system More than half of the alleged offences took place at Haut de la Garenne children's home The report said: ""Children may still be still at risk in Jersey and children in the care system are not always receiving the kind or quality of care and support that they need."" It said the buildings at Haut de la Garenne were a reminder of an ""unhappy past or shameful history"" and of the ""turmoil and trauma"" of the police investigation, which began in 2006. The report said there was no doubt that ""many instances"" of physical and sexual abuse were suffered by children in the care of the States of Jersey. The wellbeing of vulnerable children had been ""low on the list"" of Jersey's priorities and unsuitable people were appointed to management roles on the basis of local connections. It also referred to witnesses' use of the phrase the ""Jersey way"" to describe a system where ""serious issues are swept under the carpet"" and ""people avoid being held to account for abuses"". The report said ""As a result, ill-suited carers continued to look after children in unsuitable facilities, using outdated practices. ""The consequences for the children in their care were devastating and, in many instances, lifelong."" This video can not be played ""History will be very damning on us if we don't take steps in light of the content of this report,"" says lawyer Alan Collins, a lawyer who represented victims, said ""systematic failings"" allowed a culture to develop where ""children's welfare became a secondary issue"". Mr Collins added ""Jersey is not alone in this"" and ""the UK needs to take serious note of this report"". Senator Ian Gorst, Jersey's chief minister, apologised to ""all those who suffered abuse in our islands over the years"". He said: ""Unpalatable truths were swept under the carpet because it was the easiest thing to do. ""People cared more for the status quo, for a quiet life, than for children. ""We failed children who needed our care who needed to be protected and listened to. ""I am shocked, I am saddened and I am sorry. I accept every recommendation.""

Pre-teenage girls 'seek vagina surgery',"This video can not be played 'Girls say they hate their vaginas' Girls as young as nine are seeking surgery on their genitals because they are distressed by its appearance, the Victoria Derbyshire show has been told. Dr Naomi Crouch, a leading adolescent gynaecologist, said she was concerned GPs were referring rising numbers of young girls who wanted an operation. Labiaplasty, as the surgery is known, involves the lips of the vagina being shortened or reshaped. The NHS says it should not be carried out on girls before they turn 18. In 2015-16, more than 200 girls under 18 had labiaplasty on the NHS. More than 150 of the girls were under 15. Some experts fear that pornography and images viewed through social media are leading young girls to have unrealistic perceptions of how their genitals should look. Dr Crouch, who chairs the British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology, said in her work for the NHS she was yet to see a girl who needed the operation. ""Girls will sometimes come out with comments like, 'I just hate it, I just want it removed,' and for a girl to feel that way about any part of her body - especially a part that's intimate - is very upsetting."" This video can not be played 'Anna' explains why she wanted vagina surgery as a teenager Anna - not her real name - considered having labiaplasty from the age of 14. ""I just picked up from somewhere that it wasn't neat enough or tidy enough and I think I wanted it to be smaller. ""People around me were watching porn and I just had this idea that it should be symmetrical and not sticking out. ""I thought that was what everyone else looked like, because I hadn't seen any normal everyday [images] before then. ""I remember thinking, 'If there's surgery for it, then clearly I'm not the only one who wants this done, and maybe it won't be that big a deal.'."" She later decided not to pursue having an operation. ""I'm totally glad I didn't get it done. I didn't need it. I look totally normal. Completely and utterly normal."" Paquita de Zulueta, a GP for more than 30 years, said it was only in the past few years that girls had started coming to her with concerns over the appearance of their labia. ""I'm seeing young girls around 11, 12, 13 thinking there's something wrong with their vulva - that they're the wrong shape, the wrong size, and really expressing almost disgust. ""Their perception is that the inner lips should be invisible, almost like a Barbie, but the reality is that there is a huge variation. It's very normal for the lips to protrude."" Paquita de Zulueta says some girls magnify their physical symptoms to improve chances of having surgery She blames the unrealistic images girls are being exposed to through pornography and social media. ""There isn't enough education and it should start really quite young, explaining that there is a range and that - just as we all look different in our faces - we all look different down there, and that's OK."" NHS England said it did not carry out the operation for cosmetic reasons, only for clinical conditions. For the past few years clinical commissioning groups have been able to refer only patients who are experiencing physical pain or emotional distress. But Dr De Zulueta says some girls know they need to overstate their physical symptoms to get the surgery. ""There is awareness that they're more likely to get the operation if they say it's interfering with sex, with sport, they feel that will tick that box."" Dr Crouch believes labiaplasty should be given only to girls who have a medical abnormality. ""I find it very hard to believe there are 150 girls with a medical abnormality which means they needed an operation on their labia,"" she said. She added there were uncomfortable parallels between this surgery and female genital mutilation (FGM), which is illegal in the UK. ""The law says we shouldn't perform these operations on developing bodies for cultural reasons. Current Western culture is to have very small lips, tucked inside. I see this as the same thing"". Dr Gail Busby, lead adolescent gynaecologist at St Mary's Hospital, says it is important for girls and their parents to remember: In adolescence, the labia are still growing - with the inner lips growing first - so it is normal for them to appear prominent. Girls should not compare themselves to adult women By age 18, the outer lips will have grown. If girls can hold off seeking an operation until adulthood, their genitals' appearance will have changed - removing the initial reason for wanting surgery Surgery will probably lead to scarring and - as the labia are still developing - could lead to it becoming asymmetrical in adulthood Do not feel alone. Half the girls in your class will be in the same position, it is a normal part of development - it is just that no-one talks about it openly If parents wish to allay fears, take your daughter to a GP In some instances, if there are deeper concerns regarding body image, it may help to create some coping strategies Body image advice The majority of labiaplasties are done by private cosmetic surgeons on women over 18. The industry has been criticised for normalising the procedure. Plastic surgeon Miles Berry says labiaplasty can improve women's self-esteem Plastic surgeon Miles Berry defended the surgery, saying it could improve women's lives. ""It can change people fundamentally, the feelings they have about themselves, their confidence and self-esteem. ""I have seen patients aged between 16 and 21 who have never had a boyfriend because they are so concerned about this.""

Why CNN 'assault' tweet should surprise no-one,"Trump's history with wrestling goes back at least a decade On Saturday, Donald Trump tweeted that he's redefining the social media behaviour of a ""modern-day"" president. On Sunday he once again proved it. Mr Trump's CNN-wrestling video, apparently cribbed from a user on the internet message board Reddit, may be unfamiliar commentary coming from the chief executive of the US, but it's classic Trump. He has shown time and time again that he views politics as performance art; another reality television competition where the more drama and conflict there is, the better. Candidate Trump belittled his Republican opponents - Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and company - then shrugged it off as part of the game. He turned Hillary Clinton, whom he had once praised and buddied around with at his wedding, into a ""crooked"" caricature who should be shipped off to prison. He portrayed the media, and CNN in particular, as cartoon villains that he can rhetorically beat into submission. Mr Trump's choice of a professional wrestling clip for his latest tweet was particularly apt, as throughout his campaign he treated the political process like a World Wrestling Entertainment match. The drama is contrived; the action is fake; the outcome predetermined. Trump body-slams CNN I'm modern day presidential, says Trump He pulled back the curtain on the show and laughed along with his supporters at the spectacle. He encouraged his crowds to cheer the hero (him) and berate the villains (everyone else). Journalists - corralled in their pens - were often singled out for derision, and his adoring legions would turn and jeer, shaking their fists, but also, for the most part, enjoying themselves. On more than one occasion while covering Mr Trump's campaign, I would have a friendly conversation with someone at his rally - an elderly woman in a homemade Trump t-shirt in Virginia or a leather-jacket-clad rancher in Nevada - then watch as they heartily booed me and my colleagues at Mr Trump's prompting. This video can not be played Are President Trump's attacks on the media undermining the news? The press, like Mr Trump's opponents on the debate stage, were all part of his performance; the black-clad villains in his show. Some in the media have rushed to condemn Mr Trump's wrestling tweet as a thinly-veiled threat of violence against the media. CNN issued a statement calling it a ""sad day"" and asserting deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied earlier in the week when she said the president had never ""promoted or encouraged violence"". White House 'in smear threat to TV hosts' Trump and the media - Is it war or love? Such imagery coming from the president of the US will certainly harshen the level of discourse in the nation, and there is the not insignificant possibility that some may view it as a call for violence. This video can not be played 'I want to upset people', says the Progressive Liberal, an anti-Trump wrestler Most, however, will see it as the president probably intended - the latest episode in the biggest show ever to hit the US political scene; a new plot twist to keep the audience entertained. As Mr Trump said in a speech lashing out against his media critics on Saturday night: ""I'm president, and they're not."" Donald Trump played by his rules and won. He's going to keep reminding us that it's not the same game anymore. Welcome to the modern presidency. Donald Trump posts video 'beating' CNN Meet wrestling's anti-Trump villain.

Two in court after UK-bound guns seized,"A haul of firearms has been seized in France from a car heading to the UK. Seventy-nine ""viable"" weapons were recovered from the car's trailer when it was stopped by UK Border Force officers at Coquelles near the Channel Tunnel terminal on Saturday. Two men, a Polish and a Czech national, have been remanded in custody at Uxbridge magistrates' court in connection with the operation. The guns were concealed in specially-adapted engine blocks. The seizure follows a joint operation by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Metropolitan Police working with Border Force officials in France. Graham Gardner, the NCA's deputy director of investigations, said: ""Our recent threat assessment highlights that handguns are still commonly favoured by some criminal groups in the UK. ""They may not be the largest firearm, but they are easily concealable and lethal in the hands of anyone prepared to use them."" The firearms were concealed in engine blocks Denis Kolencukov, 23, originally from the Czech Republic but living in the UK, and Polish national Janusz Michek, 59, are each charged with two firearms offences. No further action will be taken against six other Polish nationals arrested in Coquelles.

Boris Johnson joins calls to end pay cap,"Downing Street insists its position on public sector pay has not changed despite several ministers calling for the 1% cap on increases to be scrapped. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is the latest senior cabinet minister to put pressure on the chancellor and the PM to change the policy. No 10 said ministers would respond to pay review bodies in due course. But 1% rises for dentists, nurses, doctors and the military have already been agreed for this year, it added. When the matter was raised in the Commons, a minister said the government wanted to ensure ""frontline public service workers"" were ""paid fairly for their work"". Nick Hurd, a policing minister, told MPs how to do this was ""under active discussion"". Ahmed: Hammond's public sector pay challenge Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private? Listen to pay bodies, says Gove Thousands march in anti-austerity protest A Whitehall source said Mr Johnson ""strongly"" believed pay rises could be achieved in ""a responsible way"", without putting undue pressure on the public finances. The Institute for Fiscal Studieshas estimated,externalthat increasing public sector pay in line with the private sector would cost an extra Â£6.3bn a year. In the Queen's Speech debate last month, Mr Hammond made clear his aversion to higher borrowing. Are you a public sector worker affected by these issues?  Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external However, on Sunday Mr Gove, the environment secretary, appeared to reject suggestions that taxes would need to go up to meet the cost of any pay rises. Pay rises for most public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% each year since 2013. Before that, there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. In addition to the 1% annual rise, some NHS staff also get incremental increases as they progress in their roles. The Conservatives went into the election planning to maintain the cap until 2020, but there are growing calls for a rethink after the party lost its majority in the general election. This video can not be played ""If you are taking the government shilling, you need to stick to the government line"" says Tory MP Stephen Crabb The pay review bodies cover a wide range of professions, from prison officers and nurses, to judges and senior NHS managers. Those covering police and teachers' pay are due to report this month. The cap has been applied across the UK, but the Scottish government has said it plans to end it in Scotland. Nurses last month held protests against the public sector pay cap BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Arguably the simpler part of the debate has been had - many public sector workers are feeling the pinch, and there is more and more pressure to remove the limit on pay rises. The more complicated bit, who or what would pay for the increase, is a conversation that's yet to happen. Whatever Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have said in the last twenty four hours, don't expect anything to happen in a hurry. The first pay review body is not due to report for another few weeks. It seems unlikely that the government will announce any plan to either ditch the cap or promise to accept the decisions of the review bodies before then. It's not in either Theresa May or Philip Hammond's DNA to make quick decisions.Read more from Laura Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lamont told BBC Radio 4's Today programme public sector pay was on average higher than in the private sector and controlling it was ""extremely important"". He said cases could be looked at where there were specific issues around recruitment but objected to the ""general pressure that's being applied, the idea that we should abandon restraint of public expenditure"". He said people should not criticise austerity in the same way they might discuss ""too many repeats on television"" and said it was not right for cabinet ministers to ""gang up"" on Mr Hammond, saying they were making the chancellor's position ""very awkward"". ""This is not a choice,"" he added. ""It is unavoidable that we have restraint on public spending."" Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said ""within the scale of things"" Mr Hammond could ""afford a few billions here and there"", but added the chancellor would be worried that if he gives money to one part of the public sector he will come under pressure to do the same in other areas. Decisions on public sector pay are taken by the government after receiving recommendations from independent 'pay review bodies' There are eight of these, which each make their own recommendations for different sectors of the 5.4m public sector workforce They have six to eight members, who are appointed by ministers, and produce their recommendations at different points during the year In reaching a recommendation they have to consider the need to ""recruit, retain and motivate"" staff They also need to consider the ""financial circumstances"" of the government Since the 2010 Budget, it has been government policy for public sector pay to be frozen or, more recently, capped at 1% Pay review bodies are able to recommend higher increases despite this policy, although the former chairman of several bodies, Alasdair Smith, told the BBC to do so would be a ""big step"" Civil servants have also been subject to the 1% cap, although they are not covered by pay review bodies Individual government departments have responsibility for implementing pay policy following guidelines set by the Treasury NHS Confederation chairman and former Tory minister Stephen Dorrell said the pay review bodies should not be ""artificially constrained"" by the 1% policy, saying health service staff needed to be ""properly looked after"". And former cabinet minister Stephen Crabb said ministers who disagreed with the official government policy should not be in the cabinet. ""I don't think it's a great sight seeing different cabinet members giving slightly different messages to the media,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Gove did not call directly for the 1% cap to be lifted, but said ministers should respect the ""integrity"" of the pay review process. Last week Labour attempted to scrap the 1% cap but was defeated in Parliament. This video can not be played Ex-chancellor Lamont: Stop ganging up on Hammond This video can not be played Gove's quick-fire answers on the Andrew Marr show - Brexit and his return to the cabinet Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said reports on the divisions within government over public sector pay revealed there was ""turmoil"" in the Conservative Party. ""They're saying 'Wait for the pay review bodies', even though they're the ones insisting on a 1% cap,"" the Labour frontbencher told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. ""We're saying to the pay review bodies: 'Get rid of the 1% cap and give a fair pay rise.'"" Asked what level of pay rise Labour thought was fair, Mr Ashworth said the pay review bodies should consider one in line with the rise in average earnings across the economy.

Many feared dead in German bus blaze,"This video can not be played Emergency services rushed to the scene Eighteen people died when their tour bus collided with a lorry and burst into flames on the A9 motorway in southern Germany, police say. Another 30 on the bus were hurt and two of them were fighting for their lives. The bus was carrying a group of German pensioners at the time of the fire near Stammbach in northern Bavaria. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said rescuers were delayed by ""gawpers"" driving slowly and by the intensity of the blaze. The cause of the fire is unknown. Traffic was reportedly moving slowly at the time and the collision between the two vehicles was not described as a major crash. The lorry's trailer was also incinerated and the burnt-out wreck ended up a short distance ahead of the bus. The German news websiteFrankenpost reports,externalthat it was carrying mattresses and pillows. The lorry driver was unharmed and told police the bus had gone into the back of his vehicle and burst into flames, it said. The burnt-out wrecks of the bus and lorry trailer ended up a short distance apart There were 46 passengers and two drivers on the bus. The bus driver was among those killed. The passengers were men and women aged 66 to 81, heading to Lake Garda in Italy for a holiday. Some of the passengers had got on the bus at Dresden station in the eastern state of Saxony. According to local media in Saxony, the bus had earlier picked up passengers elsewhere in Saxony and also in Brandenburg in the early hours of Monday before going to Dresden and then south-west towards Nuremberg. By mid-afternoon forensic teams had recovered the charred remains of 15 people and police confirmed that 18 had died. Firefighters reached the scene within 10 minutes of the accident but were driven back by the intensity of the fire. ""Only steel parts are recognisable so you can understand what that meant for the people in this bus,"" said German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt. Motoring safety expert Hans-Ulrich Sander suggested that the fuel line that ran under the bus may have ruptured, prompting the fire to spread fast. Five rescue helicopters joined emergency workers at the scene. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was distressed by the accident and expressed sympathy for the injured and bereaved relatives. She thanked the rescuers for looking after people ""in an appalling situation"".

Hinkley Point builder raises cost estimate,"Construction of the Hinkley Point plant is under way after government approval last year French energy supplier EDF has estimated that the cost of completing the new Hinkley Point nuclear plant will be nearly 10% more than expected. The company, which is the project's main backer, said the total cost of the power station was likely to rise by Â£1.5bn to Â£19.6bn. Hinkley Point C would be the UK's first new nuclear plant for decades, but has been beset with budget problems. An EDF review found the project could also be delayed by up to 15 months. The firm said that would result in an extra Â£700m in costs, but that it hoped to avoid delays and finish the first nuclear reactor by the end of 2025. Climate campaigners said Hinkley Point was ""already over time and over budget"" only nine months since being approved. Hinkley Point deal 'risky and expensive' What is Hinkley Point and why is it important? EDF is building two new reactors at Hinkley Point, which are expected to provide 7% of the country's electricity needs for 60 years. Work is under way on the plant in Somerset after Prime Minister Theresa May formally gave it the go-ahead in September last year. EDF said the extra costs partly resulted from adapting the project's design to meet the demands of UK regulators. The French state-controlled energy firm is funding two-thirds of the plant, which is expected to create more than 25,000 jobs, with China investing the rest. A government spokeswoman said: ""Consumers won't pay a penny until Hinkley is built; it will provide clean, reliable electricity powering six million homes."" The cost of building Hinkley Point, including any overruns, will be met by EDF and the other backers, she said. John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: ""Hinkley is already over time and over budget after just a few months of building work. ""Today's news is yet another damning indictment of the government's agreement to go ahead with this project."" EDF said it remained on track to meet the project's first major milestone in 2019 but that delays could come later in the project. Last month, public auditors called the new nuclear plant ""risky and expensive"". The National Audit Office said the government had ""increasingly emphasised Hinkley Point C's unquantified strategic benefits, but it has little control over these and no plan yet in place to realise them"". 2007: EDF boss predicts UK households will cook their Christmas turkeys in 2017 using power from Hinkley Point C 2008:The project is earmarked by the Labour government as a potential site in a ""nuclear renaissance"" 2013:The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government approves construction of Hinkley Point C and agrees commercial terms with EDF 2015:EDF signs a deal with China's state-owned nuclear firm CGN to help finance the project 2016: March:EDF finance director quits ahead of a final investment decision on the plant July:Theresa May delays the final decision on Hinkley shortly after becoming prime minister September:The Conservative government approves Hinkley and signs a deal with EDF and CGN 2017: July:EDF estimates the project will cost an extra Â£1.5bn and could be delayed beyond 2025 - eight years after its original target Hinkley Point deal 'risky and expensive' Government approves Hinkley Point deal What is Hinkley Point and why is it important?

UK 'ditches cake-and-eat-it Brexit stance',"UK officials have ""quietly abandoned"" hopes of securing ""the government's promised cake-and-eat-it Brexit deal"", theGuardian reports,external. According to the paper, government insiders have reported a ""dramatic change of mood"" in the Department for Exiting the European Union since the general election. It says the idea of enjoying full trade access to the bloc - without concessions over immigration, courts and a financial settlement - is now being given less credence by officials. Many of the papers focus on the reported divisions within Conservative ranks about public spending. ""Cabinet split over austerity tax row"" is the front page headline in theDaily Telegraph,external. It suggests Chancellor Philip Hammond has warned ministers that ""unpopular tax rises"" will be required to fund possible moves, like lifting the cap on public sector pay increases. The Mail's,externaleditorial says the paper is ""deeply troubled by reports that some Tory MPs, including senior ministers, are demanding that the spending taps be turned back on"". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external According tothe Times,external, Britain's new independent reviewer of counter-terrorism laws is concerned about the way jihadist attacks are covered by the media. It says Max Hill believes the publication of images of dead terrorists can give, in his words, ""the oxygen of publicity in death, to those who apparently craved martyrdom"". But one senior media lawyer, Mark Stephens, tells the paper: ""It is extremely unhelpful to make the argument that freedom of speech needs to be curbed, in an effort to fight terror."" The lead in theFinancial Times,externalis about a delegation from the City of London travelling to Brussels this week, with what it describes as ""a secret blueprint for a post-Brexit free-trade deal on financial services"". The paper says there is concern among bankers that the deadline for the UK to leave the EU, in March 2019, will come before a ""credible deal has been struck"". ""Blame it on our boys"",externalis the front page headline in the Sun.  It claims that Iraqis, who had alleged that they were mistreated by American troops, were told by lawyers to accuse UK forces instead, because the Ministry of Defence was easier to sue. The paper quotes someone who used to work for a law firm handling such claims, saying it was widely known that many were fake. The front pages of both the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express report on the latest deaths of migrants who tried to cross the Mediterranean from Africa to Europe. The Mirror's,externalheadline is ""Migrants' hell on Costa beaches"", while in the Express it is""EU in crisis over boat migrants"",external. The paper says European Union officials are to hold emergency talks on the matter. The Mirror's opinion column urges the authorities to ""turn the tide on the crisis"". It believes that, faced with such a problem, the UK is ""morally right"" to spend Â£13bn on international development, which could help tackle some of the causes of migration.

It says the US president has a gap in his diary, between a visit to Germany this week for the G20 summit and a trip to France later in July.

China calls US warship 'a provocation',"The USS Stetham, pictured here arriving in Shanghai in 2015, sailed close to Triton Island Beijing has called the presence of a US warship near a disputed island in the South China Sea ""a serious political and military provocation"". The USS Stethem sailed close to Triton Island, part of the Paracel Islands archipelago, claimed by China and others. China responded by sending military vessels and fighter jets to the area. It happened hours before US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping spoke on the phone. During the call, Mr Xi told Mr Trump that ""negative factors"" were affecting US-China relations, according to a read-out of the call carried on Chinese state TV. A White House statement about their call did not say if they had discussed the incident. It said the leaders had instead ""reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearised Korean peninsula"". Why is the South China Sea contentious? Satellite photos 'show weapons' built on islands The US has repeatedly warned China against its occupation and aggressive reclamation of islands in disputed waters, but Beijing says it is within its sovereign rights to do so. Ina statement late on Sunday,,externalChina's foreign ministry confirmed reports that the USS Stethem had entered waters claimed by China. The warship had sailed within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island - which is also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam - as part of its ""freedom of navigation"" operations, according to news agencies and Fox News citing US defence officials. UN rules dictate that any territory can claim the waters up to 12 nautical miles from its coast. The sailing of a US ship within those limits indicates the US does not recognise the territorial claim. This video can not be played Rupert Wingfield-Hayes gets a view of a new Chinese runway on Mischief Reef Beijing said it would use ""all necessary means to defend national sovereignty and security"". It also accused the US of ""deliberately stirring up troubles"" in the region as China and Southeast Asian neighbours have ""cooled down and improved the situation"". China has been embroiled in maritime disputes with several of its regional neighbours in recent years. Chinese tour groups have also visited the Paracels The US conducts a programme called ""freedom of navigation"" whichthe State Department says,externalis to highlight the need to protect global maritime rights. The US, it says, will not acquiesce ""in unilateral acts of other states designed to restrict the rights and freedoms of the international community in navigation and overflight and other related high seas uses"". It views Beijing's construction of artificial islands on disputed reefs in the South China Sea as a threat to freedom of navigation. The military operation is the second since Mr Trump took office. In May,the USS Dewey sailedless than 12 nautical miles from an artificial island built by China called Mischief Reef, which is part of the Spratly Islands. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said a few days later thatthe US would not acceptChina's militarisation of man-made islands in the region. In previous years, the US has conducted such operations against China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years as Beijing has begun re-asserting its claims. The area is a major shipping route, and a rich fishing ground, and is thought to have abundant oil and gas reserves. The various islands and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Much of the conflict has been centred on two clusters of islands, the Paracels and Spratlys. China claims the largest portion of territory, saying its rights go back centuries, and issued a map in 1947 detailing its claims. Under President Xi Jinping, China has ramped up its territorial assertions, building artificial islands and military facilities on reefs while also carrying out naval patrols in disputed waters. But China denies the accusations of militarisation, saying the facilities are for civilian and defence purposes.

How one man built a global hospitality empire,"Choe Peng Sum launched Frasers Hospitality from scratch On the first day in his new job, Choe Peng Sum was given a fairly simple brief: ""Just go make us a lot of money."" Fast forward about 20 years, and it's fair to say he has done just that. The business he runs, Frasers Hospitality, is one of the world's biggest providers of high-end serviced apartments. Its 148 properties span about 80 capital cities, as well as financial hubs across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. But it almost didn't get off the ground. When Mr Choe was appointed to launch and lead the company, Asia was booming; the tiger economies of Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore were expanding rapidly. But as Frasers prepared to open its first two properties in Singapore, the Asian financial crisis hit. It was 1997. Currencies went into freefall. Suddenly, people were losing their jobs and stopped travelling. Mr Choe recalls asking staff if they really wanted to continue working with the firm, because when the properties opened they might not get paid. ""It was really that serious,"" he says. ""I remember tearing up because they said 'let's open it, let's open it whether you can pay us or not'."" Choe Peng Sum (second from left) with colleagues at Frasers Manila opening in 2002 Survival, Mr Choe admits, came through a bit of luck, and the misfortune of others. He had convinced the board at parent firm, property group Frasers Centrepoint, to open serviced apartments rather than hotels - partly because getting planning permission in Singapore was easier. But he also sensed it was a big, untapped market. And at the time of the crisis, it proved to be exactly what customers wanted. ""As we were going through this difficult patch, there were protests and riots in Jakarta,"" he says. ""A lot of companies like Microsoft called up looking for rooms for their staff because they were moving out of Jakarta."" Frasers' 412 apartments were quickly in demand. Occupancy soon hit 70%, and then 90%. Explaining the popularity of serviced apartments, Mr Choe says that if people are staying somewhere for just a few days, they happily stay in hotels, but if they are going to be somewhere for one month to eight months, the walls of hotel rooms ""close in on you"". But now, Mr Choe, 57, faces new challenges - the travel tastes of millennials and the disruptive nature of Airbnb. ""The way to tackle Airbnb is not to ignore it. I will never underestimate Airbnb,"" he says. There's been no significant impact on Frasers yet. Big corporations still prefer to put employees in big service apartments, he says, because they can guarantee a level of safety and security. But that is likely to change, Mr Choe admits. A former Edinburgh hospital has been converted into serviced apartments by Frasers-owned Malmaison Hotel du Vin ""I have two daughters who to my chagrin use Airbnb,"" he says. ""We took a family trip to Florence and I stayed in this wonderful boutique hotel, but paid a bundle for it. ""When my daughter joined us, she said, 'I'm just staying next door and paying about 80 euros'. We paid about 330 euros. ""I asked why they stayed at Airbnb. They say 'it's like a surprise, it's part of the adventure'."" And so now, Mr Choe wants to bring some of that vibrancy to Frasers. While neutral colours, beige curtains and dark wooden chairs dominate its more traditional apartments, many customers want something different, and this is shaping Fraser's strategy. In 2015 it bought Malmaison Hotel du Vin, a UK hotel group that specialises in developing heritage properties into upscale boutique hotels. That has taken them beyond financial centres, including to Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon. Or, an intrepid traveller with $500 (Â£325) to spend could have a night in a converted medieval prison in Oxford. And Frasers has launched the Capri sub-brand - whose website promises ""inspiring art and inspirational tech"". Frasers' Capri Kuala Lumpur show the firm's typical interior designs On a day-to-day basis Mr Choe says he still draws on his experience as a young man, who - having been given a scholarship by the Shangri-La hotel group to study at Cornell University in the US - came back to Asia to learn about the hospitality industry. ""They put me in every department conceivable. I remember one of the toughest jobs I had was in the butchery. I had to carve an entire cow. For one month, I could not eat meat. ""I'm thankful for those experiences. When you step into a hotel, you immediately pick up what works and what doesn't work. ""When I see the check-in staff walking more than three steps, I know the counter is set up wrong. ""It's like a cockpit. Can you imagine if the pilot had to turn around when he flies?"" MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich The snacks boss with an appetite for success Taking his own path: The world's leading maze designer Mr Choe adds that loyalty is very important to him, and he remains tremendously grateful to staff who have stayed with him. ""I will always respect and remember those who gave up their jobs to join me,"" he says. This loyalty is something that Mr Choe has earned, according to Donald MacLaurin, associate professor at Singapore Institute of Technology, and specialist in the hospitality sector. Frasers is now a global business, with property around the world, including the Suites Le Claridge in Paris Mr MacLaurin points out that Mr Choe introduced a five-day working week, in a part of the world where six days is common, thereby showing ""a focus on quality of life issues for employees"". The associate professor adds says the early success of the business was remarkable given the timing of its launch. Fast forward to today and the company is now on track to operate 30,000 serviced apartments globally by 2019. That success, say Mr Choe's admirers, should make him something of a visionary.

Horn rejects 'naysayers' after underdog win,"Jeff Horn (r) overcame his more favoured opponent, Manny Pacquiao The former schoolteacher who stunned Manny Pacquiao to win the WBO world welterweight title has dismissed suggestions he did not deserve to win. Jeff Hornbeat Pacquiao,an eight-time world champion, following a unanimous points decision in Brisbane, Australia. Pacquiao's coaches and celebrities including Lennox Lewis and Kobe Bryant were critical of the judges' call on the result. But the relatively unknown Australian, 29, said he was worthy of the win. ""There will always be a backlash where people say I got lucky, or whatever,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""There will always be the naysayers saying I did not win the fight, but I felt like I won the fight. A lot of Queenslanders think I won the fight and people around the world."" Pacquiao's Australian coach, former heavyweight boxer Justin Fortune, had described the referee as ""sketchy"" and the judges as ""crazy"" following the bout. Horn 'read books, played board games and was bullied' However Pacquiao, 38, congratulated his opponent and said he respected the decision. Horn celebrates his victory over the eight-time world champion Pacquiao said he accepted the judges' call The Australian responded by paying tribute to his rival, describing him as ""an absolute warrior, a legend of the sport"". Horn, who taught at a Brisbane school until only recently, said he believed his former students would be proud. ""I have a lot to do with the school still,"" he said. ""I don't go there and teach but I still go to the schools and I know the kids will be proud of what I have done."" Nicknamed ""The Hornet"", he also drew praise from admirers including Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. ""What a great Australian story - congratulations,"" Mr Turnbull said. ""Brisbane school teacher to world champion. Against all of the pundits."" His grandfather, Ray Horn, said he was also very proud. ""If anyone had ever told me I would have a grandchild I would have found it hard to believe,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""But I would think they were nuts if they told me I would be a grandfather of a world champion one day."" More than 51,000 spectators watched the bout at Brisbane's Lang Park stadium. Horn set up his victory with an aggressive start before both fighters tired in the final rounds. Reports claim,externalthe underdog won a guaranteed A$500,000 (Â£295,000; $384,000) from his fight against Pacquiao, and he could now be set for even bigger paydays. Horn has already challenged US boxer Floyd Mayweather to a fight and said he would consider a re-match against Pacquiao.

Number of UK nurses and midwives falling,"More nurses and midwives are leaving the profession in the UK than joining it, for the first time since 2008, figures show. The number registered in the UK fell by 1,783 to 690,773, in the year to March. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) said the downward trend had been most pronounced among British workers. Many leavers cited working conditions. But the government said there were now 13,000 more nurses working in hospitals in England than in 2010. In April and May this year, there was a more dramatic fall in those leaving nursing and midwifery, with a further 3,264 workers going. Other than retirement, the main reasons given for leaving were working conditions - including staffing levels and workload - personal circumstances and disillusion with quality of care to patients, according to an NMC survey of more than 4,500 leavers. Other reasons included leaving the UK and poor pay and benefits. Boris Johnson joins calls to end pay cap 'I'm swapping nursing for botox' Saffron Cordery, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: ""These figures provide further evidence of the severe workforce problems NHS trusts face. ""This goes beyond the concerns over Brexit - worrying though they are. ""The reduction in numbers is most pronounced among UK registrants. And it is particularly disappointing to see so many of our younger nurses and midwives choosing to leave."" She said a new staff retention programme would offer support to those NHS trusts with the highest leaving rates. ""However, until we address the underlying issues driving retention problems, including the pay cap and the unsustainable workplace pressures, these approaches will only have a limited impact."" Nurses protested against the 1% public sector pay cap in June The figures being flagged up by the Nursing and Midwifery Council are for those registered to work in the UK. That is, of course, important - without a ready supply, the NHS cannot recruit the staff it needs. But the figure that is perhaps of most interest to the public is how many are actually working in the health service - and whether that is enough. The Department of Health in England has made this point, highlighting figures showing there are more than 13,000 more nurses working in hospitals than there were in 2010. But if you look at the overall number working in the NHS - once you include the likes of district nurses and those working in mental health - the number has risen by only 5,000 to nearly 286,000. That is because the rise in hospital nurses has been partly offset by a fall elsewhere. What is more, if you consider the number the NHS wants to employ but cannot - by adding on the number of vacancies - you find that the health service is well short of what it needs. Earlier this year, research by the Royal College of Nursing showed there were 40,000 unfilled posts - double the number from three years ago. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said poor working conditions and the ""vicious cycle"" of staffing levels had contributed to the number of nurses leaving the profession. RCN chief executive Janet Davies added that the NHS had resorted to a ""quick fix"" by bringing in ""people from overseas"" to fill the gap left by the lack of British nurses. She believes the decision on how much nurses are paid is political. She added: ""[The government is also] removing the funding of the training of our future nurses. ""In September it will be the first time we see nurses coming in and having to take a loan. ""We know that's put people off, we haven't seen the actual figures but we know it's really low in some places and of course that just went into savings."" Nurses and midwives previously received bursaries during their studies, but the government announced it would cease the NHS bursaries system from 1 August 2017, meaning students in many healthcare fields will now have to repay the cost of their degrees. The RCN called on the government to scrap the 1% public sector pay cap as a matter of urgency to prevent more health workers leaving. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""We are making sure we have the nurses we need to continue delivering world-class patient care - that's why there are almost 13,100 more on our wards since May 2010 and 52,000 in training. ""We also know we need to retain our excellent nurses and earlier this week we launched a national programme to ensure nurses have the support they need to continue their vital work.""

EDF raises Hinkley Point cost estimate,"Construction of the Hinkley Point plant is under way after government approval last year French energy supplier EDF has estimated that the cost of completing the new Hinkley Point nuclear plant will be nearly 10% more than expected. The company, which is the project's main backer, said the total cost of the power station was likely to rise by Â£1.5bn to Â£19.6bn. Hinkley Point C would be the UK's first new nuclear plant for decades, but has been beset with budget problems. An EDF review found the project could also be delayed by up to 15 months. The firm said that would result in an extra Â£700m in costs, but that it hoped to avoid delays and finish the first nuclear reactor by the end of 2025. Climate campaigners said Hinkley Point was ""already over time and over budget"" only nine months since being approved. Hinkley Point deal 'risky and expensive' What is Hinkley Point and why is it important? EDF is building two new reactors at Hinkley Point, which are expected to provide 7% of the country's electricity needs for 60 years. Work is under way on the plant in Somerset after Prime Minister Theresa May formally gave it the go-ahead in September last year. EDF said the extra costs partly resulted from adapting the project's design to meet the demands of UK regulators. The French state-controlled energy firm is funding two-thirds of the plant, which is expected to create more than 25,000 jobs, with China investing the rest. A government spokeswoman said: ""Consumers won't pay a penny until Hinkley is built; it will provide clean, reliable electricity powering six million homes."" The cost of building Hinkley Point, including any overruns, will be met by EDF and the other backers, she said. John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: ""Hinkley is already over time and over budget after just a few months of building work. ""Today's news is yet another damning indictment of the government's agreement to go ahead with this project."" EDF said it remained on track to meet the project's first major milestone in 2019 but that delays could come later in the project. Last month, public auditors called the new nuclear plant ""risky and expensive"". The National Audit Office said the government had ""increasingly emphasised Hinkley Point C's unquantified strategic benefits, but it has little control over these and no plan yet in place to realise them"". 2007: EDF boss predicts UK households will cook their Christmas turkeys in 2017 using power from Hinkley Point C 2008:The project is earmarked by the Labour government as a potential site in a ""nuclear renaissance"" 2013:The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government approves construction of Hinkley Point C and agrees commercial terms with EDF 2015:EDF signs a deal with China's state-owned nuclear firm CGN to help finance the project 2016: March:EDF finance director quits ahead of a final investment decision on the plant July:Theresa May delays the final decision on Hinkley shortly after becoming prime minister September:The Conservative government approves Hinkley and signs a deal with EDF and CGN 2017: July:EDF estimates the project will cost an extra Â£1.5bn and could be delayed beyond 2025 - eight years after its original target Hinkley Point deal 'risky and expensive' Government approves Hinkley Point deal What is Hinkley Point and why is it important?

Employers 'forced to pay more to recruit',"Many UK employers have had to pay ""well above market rate"" to attract employees over the past year as a skills shortage intensifies, a survey suggests. Almost all firms in a survey of 400 by the Open University said it had been difficult to find workers with the skills they needed. The distance learning university calculated the problem was costing companies more than Â£2bn a year. It said uncertainty surrounding Brexit was exacerbating the skills gap. It found people already in work were reluctant to move employer, while some EU nationals did not want to take a UK role because of the lack of clarity over future immigration rules. The number of EU workers in the UK fell by 50,000 to 2.3 million in the last three months of last year, according to official statistics. Meanwhile,unemployment is at its lowest ratesince records began in 1975. This means that it is taking firms more time than usual to recruit new staff. As a result, many firms are having to hire temporary staff and pay additional recruitment fees, as well as higher salaries, the survey found. Some 56% of the firms surveyed said they had had to increase the salary on an advertised role to get the skills they needed over the past year. For small and medium-sized firms, the average increase was Â£4,150, while for larger firms it was Â£5,575, according to the survey. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Open University is urging firms to help solve the issue by training staff internally via apprenticeships. From May, employers have been able to draw vouchers froma new fundaimed at creating three million new apprenticeships. The vouchers are being funded from a 0.5% levy on company payrolls of larger firms with an annual wage bill of Â£3m and above. Around 59% of the firms surveyed are planning to offer apprenticeships over the next year, almost double the number that currently offer them, probably as a result of the new funding, the survey suggested. The Open University's external engagement director Steve Hill said firms needed to look at recruitment and retention ""differently"". ""Now faced with a shrinking talent pool, exacerbated by the uncertainties of Brexit, it is more important that employers invest in developing their workforce,"" he added.

Injuries in shooting near French mosque,"A seven-year-old girl was reportedly among those injured in the attack in Avignon, France Eight people have been injured in a shooting outside a mosque in southern France, officials have confirmed. Worshippers leaving the Arrahma mosque in Avignon were approached by two hooded suspects at about 22:30 local time (21:30 GMT) on Sunday. The suspects, carrying a handgun and a shotgun, arrived in a Renault Clio before opening fire on the crowd,La Provence newspaper reports,external. Police said they were not treating the incident as a terrorist attack. Four people were wounded outside the mosque and a family of four - including a seven-year-old girl - also suffered injuries from shrapnel while in their apartment, located some 50 metres away, La Provence said, citing a source. Two of the eight wounded were hospitalised, according to the source, who also said that worshippers leaving the mosque had not been the intended target. An eyewitness interviewed at the scene said that dozens of people near the mosque started to run when they saw the two suspects exit the vehicle and approach them with firearms. ""It was a black Renault car,"" the witness said, adding: ""There were four individuals, only two of them, who were seated in the back, stepped out and started shooting at everyone."" The Avignon attack is not being treated as a terrorist incident, the prosecutor's office said. ""The fact that it happened in the street of the religious establishment was unconnected with it,"" the prosecutor said. Laure Chabaud, a district magistrate, said that the incident was likely to be the result of a dispute between youths. The criminal investigation department has taken charge of the case, AFP news agency reports. On Thursday, a man was arrested aftertrying to drive a car into a crowdin front of a mosque in the Paris suburb of Creteil. No-one was injured in the incident.

Gulf states give Qatar 48-hour extension,"Qatar's foreign minister is in Kuwait to deliver a formal response to the demands Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states have given Qatar an extra two days to accept a list of demands or face further sanctions. They accuse Qatar of destabilising the region by supporting extremism and terrorism - which it denies. They also want Qatar to shut the Al Jazeera TV network, close a Turkish military base and scale down Iran ties. Qatar has responded formally but no details have been released. It has said the demands break international law. The initial deadline for Qatar to agree to the group's 13 demands expired on Sunday. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani was in Kuwait on Monday to hand over a formal response in the form of a letter from the emir of Qatar to the emir of Kuwait, the main mediator in the Gulf crisis. In a statement released shortly beforehand, lawyers for Qatar denounced the demands and called for international condemnation. They said the tactics were ""reminiscent of the extreme and punitive conduct of 'bully' states that have historically resulted in war. ""The world must unite immediately to halt the singling out of Qatar for unjustified collective punishment and humiliation and to preserve peace, security and prosperity in the region."" Why the West should be worried What's behind crisis with Qatar? Five surprising facts about Qatar Qatar has been under unprecedented diplomatic and economic sanctions for weeks from Saudi Arabia and its allies, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain. The four countries, whose foreign ministers will meet on Wednesday to discuss the situation, have accused Qatar of harbouring Islamist groups that they consider terrorist organisations - including the Muslim Brotherhood - and giving them a platform on the Al Jazeera satellite channel, which is funded by the Qatari state. Doha denies the accusations. The imposed restrictions have caused turmoil in Qatar, an oil- and gas-rich nation dependent on imports to meet the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million. As a result, Iran and Turkey have been increasingly supplying it with food and other goods. Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims Can Al Jazeera survive? This video can not be played Al Jazeera journalists ""demand press freedom"" UAE officials have told the BBC that after the new deadline expires on Tuesday, the offer for Qatar to return to the Arab fold will be off the table, the economic and political sanctions on it will become permanent and Qatar will be ostracised by its closest Arab neighbours. The situation is the worst political crisis among Gulf countries in decades. According to the Associated Press news agency, which obtained a copy of the list, Qatar must also: Sever all ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been banned in several Arab states Refuse to naturalise citizens from the four countries and expel those currently on its territory, in what the countries describe as an effort to keep Qatar from meddling in their internal affairs Hand over all individuals who are wanted by the four countries for terrorism Stop funding any extremist entities that are designated as terrorist groups by the US Provide detailed information about opposition figures whom Qatar has funded, ostensibly in Saudi Arabia and the other nations Align itself politically, economically and otherwise with the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) Stop funding other news outlets in addition to Al Jazeera, including Arabi21 and Middle East Eye Pay an unspecified sum in compensation An unnamed official from one of the four countries told Reuters news agency that Qatar was also being asked to sever links with so-called Islamic State, al-Qaeda and Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah. The demands have not been officially unveiled. Their publication has increased the friction between the two sides.

Eight injured in France mosque shooting,"A seven-year-old girl was reportedly among those injured in the attack in Avignon, France Eight people have been injured in a shooting outside a mosque in southern France, officials have confirmed. Worshippers leaving the Arrahma mosque in Avignon were approached by two hooded suspects at about 22:30 local time (21:30 GMT) on Sunday. The suspects, carrying a handgun and a shotgun, arrived in a Renault Clio before opening fire on the crowd,La Provence newspaper reports,external. Police said they were not treating the incident as a terrorist attack. Four people were wounded outside the mosque and a family of four - including a seven-year-old girl - also suffered injuries from shrapnel while in their apartment, located some 50 metres away, La Provence said, citing a source. Two of the eight wounded were hospitalised, according to the source, who also said that worshippers leaving the mosque had not been the intended target. An eyewitness interviewed at the scene said that dozens of people near the mosque started to run when they saw the two suspects exit the vehicle and approach them with firearms. ""It was a black Renault car,"" the witness said, adding: ""There were four individuals, only two of them, who were seated in the back, stepped out and started shooting at everyone."" The Avignon attack is not being treated as a terrorist incident, the prosecutor's office said. ""The fact that it happened in the street of the religious establishment was unconnected with it,"" the prosecutor said. Laure Chabaud, a district magistrate, said that the incident was likely to be the result of a dispute between youths. The criminal investigation department has taken charge of the case, AFP news agency reports. On Thursday, a man was arrested aftertrying to drive a car into a crowdin front of a mosque in the Paris suburb of Creteil. No-one was injured in the incident. France remains on alert amid heightened security following adeadly attack on Paris policein April and a series of terrorist incidents in recent years.

No sprinklers in 300 tower blocks,"Thousands of homes in tower blocks across Scotland do not have potentially life-saving sprinkler systems, a BBC Scotland investigation has found. There are no sprinklers in flats in more than 300 high-rise buildings in towns and cities across the country, including Glasgow and Edinburgh. Every high-rise built in Scotland since 2005 must have sprinklers, by law. But there is no obligation on councils or social landlords to fit the systems in older tower blocks. There were no sprinkler systems in Grenfell Tower in Kensington, west London, when it was engulfed by a devastating fire last month that killed at least 80 people. It has led to renewed calls from firefighters and politicians to retrofit the devices in high-rise buildings. And the Scottish government has pledged to review the evidence about the effectiveness of the systems. Anindependent report,externalpublished earlier this year found that sprinklers were 99% effective at controlling or extinguishing fires. BBC Scotland contacted local authorities and housing associations across Scotland in a bid to determine how many high-rise homes were fitted with sprinklers. Of those which replied to our request, only South Ayrshire Council said it had fitted the system into flats in its tower blocks. They were fitted in 234 homes in three tower blocks in Ayr during a refurbishment of the flats in 2003. Sprinkler systems are in place in flats in three tower blocks in Riverside Place in Ayr Fife Council, the City of Edinburgh Council and Glasgow Housing Association have sprinklers in their bin stores - amove being considered by Aberdeen City Council. But there are no sprinklers in high-rise homes operated by the following social landlords: Aberdeen City Council (59 tower blocks) City of Edinburgh Council (48) Dundee City Council (10) Falkirk Council (13) Fife Council (12) Glasgow Housing Association (67) River Clyde Housing Association (Inverclyde) (13) North Ayrshire Council (7) North Lanarkshire Council (48) Perth and Kinross Council (6) Renfrewshire Council (14) West Dunbartonshire Council (22) (South Lanarkshire Council has not yet supplied the information to BBC Scotland) There is no suggestion that any of the councils or housing associations are breaching fire regulations and they have reassured tenants about fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell tragedy. In response to the BBC Scotland inquiry, a number of landlords said they would act on any of the findings or recommendations made following the London fire. Brian Sweeney, the former head of Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service, called on the Scottish government to act to protect residents of high rise buildings north of the border. He told BBC Scotland that the Grenfell tower fire was a ""game changer"" and added that he believed a sprinkler would have prevented the fire, which started in a fridge in a fourth floor flat, from spreading. ""I think the Scottish government have led the way in requiring sprinklers since 2005 in both residential care homes and high rise blocks,"" he said ""What I want them to do now is go a little bit further and say they now want to work in partnership with the 32 local government authorities in Scotland, they want to prioritise the installation of sprinklers and they want to... to make sure these 300 high rises are fitted with sprinklers in each flat over the next three to five years. ""I think that's do-able. I think that would show a progressive approach to fire safety in Scotland. I think they could take lead in the UK in demonstrating exactly how important public safety is to them, and particularly how important the life safety of those who are most vulnerable is to them."" He added: ""If you can put sprinklers in hotels, if you can put them in high rise premises and office premises and commercial premises, well lets take a look at those council estates where people are most vulnerable - like Grenfell - and let's make sure they get them as well."" The BBC Scotland investigation also led to a call for action from Scottish Labour's deputy leader, Alex Rowley. He said the Scottish government must agree to fund a programme to ensure the ""highest safety standards"" in all high rise flats. Graham Simpson, the Scottish Conservative's housing spokesman agreed that the government should work with councils on a sprinkler installation system. ""That's what the people living there would expect, and it's something which has to happen immediately,"" he said. The effectiveness of sprinklers - or fire suppression systems- was confirmed in anindependent report,externalpublished shortly before the Grenfell tragedy. The study, which was commissioned by the National Fire Chiefs Council and the National Sprinkler Network found that they were 99% effective at controlling or extinguising fires when they operate. Lead author Peter Wood, of Edinburgh-based Optimal Economics, told BBC Scotland he was confident of the effectiveness of sprinklers but he had ""no idea"" whether they would have prevented the Grenfell Tower fire. He said they ""very, very occasionally"" do not work when they are overwhelmed by a fire but he dismissed concerns that sprinklers could be easily triggered, causing flooding, as a ""myth"". ""Sprinklers don't go off on a whim,"" he said. ""They need heat to go off."" According to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, many sprinklers are only triggered by heats of around 68C - 11C higher than the highest temperature ever recorded in Death Valley in California. In 2015 areport commissioned by the Scottish government,externalwhich examined the ""cost benefit analysis"" of fitting sprinkler systems in homes across Scotland found that it would cost between Â£1,000 and Â£3,000 per flat. It concluded that it was not cost-effective to fit sprinklers in individual houses, but a ""targeted installation"" would benefit at-risk groups. People who live in deprived areas, those with drug and alcohol problems, or mental health problems, and elderly people are at greater risk from fire. The Scottish government has confirmed that the provision of sprinklers will be considered in a review of fire legislation and building regulations - to which the fire service will contribute. Police fear that around 80 people have died in the fire at the Grenfell tower block Assistant Chief Officer David McGown said: ""The SFRS recognises the value these installations can add whilst acknowledging that they may not be appropriate in all cases when applied on a risk basis."" He added: ""The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service works closely with local authorities and housing associations to help ensure the safety of occupants in high-rise buildings. The SFRS is here to support communities, most notably through our free home fire safety visits."" A spokesman for the Scottish government said: ""While we continue to be confident that we have stringent building and fire safety regulations which contribute to keeping people safe, following the tragic events at Grenfell Tower it is imperative that we undertake a thorough and critical review of our regulations. ""The Ministerial Working Group overseeing this process will consider all relevant measures to ensure the safety of residents in high-rise domestic buildings, including a review of evidence on fire suppression systems.""

Drone causes Gatwick airport disruption,"The Civil Aviation Authority says drone use has increased significantly A drone flying close to Gatwick Airport led to the closure of the runway and forced five flights to be diverted. An airport spokesman said the runway had been closed for two periods on Sunday - of nine and five minutes - after the drone was sighted. Easyjet said four of its flights were diverted, while British Airways said one aircraft was diverted to Bournemouth. Other flights were put into holding patterns as a precaution. Sussex Police is investigating. The airport said: ""Runway operations at Gatwick were suspended between 18:10 BST and 18:19, and again from 18:36 to 18:41, resulting in a small number of go-arounds and diverts."" Craig Jenkins, who was flying with Easyjet from Naples, Italy, said: ""We were crossing over the Channel and it [the plane] started circling. ""It did four or five circles... before the captain said we were landing at Stansted. ""First, they said Gatwick was closed because of an incident. Shortly after, they said it was a drone."" Mr Jenkins, from Greenwich, south-east London, said passengers were given the choice of disembarking at Stansted or waiting an hour to fly back to Gatwick. Niamh Slatter, from Sussex, was flying from Valencia, Spain, when her BA flight was diverted to Bournemouth. ""We were due to land 15 minutes early, but ended up circling over the south coast,"" she said. ""Our attempted landing at Gatwick was aborted quite late as the drone had been spotted again, so we were told that the flight was being diverted to Bournemouth."" Easyjet apologised for the inconvenience, saying the circumstances were ""outside"" of the firm's control. The UK Airprox Board monitors near-miss incidents. An Airprox is the official term for a situation where the distance between aircraft and their relative positions and speed were such that the safety of the aircraft may have been compromised. There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - more than double the number for 2015. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. The Civil Aviation Authority recommends drones be flown at no higher than 400ft. However, the highest Airprox involving a drone was at 12,500ft. Of the 142 Airprox incidents involving drones recorded since 2010, 40 of them were near to Heathrow. Six of them, up to May, had been near to Gatwick. This video can not be played Drones should be flown no higher than 400ft In November 2016, the UK's drone code was revised and updated to help pilots ensure they fly the gadgets safely. The revised code turned the five main safety tips into a mnemonic, spelling drone, to make it easier to remember. Don't fly near airports or airfields Remember to stay below 120m (400ft) and at least 50m (150ft) away from people Observe your drone at all times Never fly near aircraft Enjoy responsibly UK revises safe flying drone code The British Airline Pilots' Association's flight safety specialist, Steve Landells, said the threat of drones flown near aircraft ""must be addressed before we see a disaster"". ""We believe a collision, particularly with a helicopter, has the potential to be catastrophic,"" he said. The union has called for compulsory registration of drone users and said new technology should be considered, including a system where the drone transmits enough data for the police to track down the operator. The Civil Aviation Authority said there were serious consequences for people who broke the rules when flying drones. ""Drone users have to understand that when taking to the skies they are potentially flying close to one of the busiest areas of airspace in the world. ""[It is] a complex system that brings together all manner of aircraft including passenger aeroplanes, military jets, helicopters, gliders and light aircraft,"" a spokesman said. ""It is totally unacceptable to fly drones close to airports and anyone flouting the rules can face severe penalties including imprisonment.""

Growing Wimbledon's global tennis fan base,"Andy Murray will attempt to retain his men's singles title When you host what is arguably the most famous tennis tournament in the world - Wimbledon - it would be tempting to rest on your sporting laurels and let things tick along as they always have done. Not only is it the longest-established of the four Grand Slam tournaments, but the Championships also enjoy sell out crowds and hospitality every year. The two-week long event is broadcast to millions of fans, and made an operating profit of Â£42m last year. So, things certainly look rosy in the green SW19 garden, with further healthy signs being a 12% increase in the prize money pot this year to Â£31.6m. But income from broadcasters represents more than half of the event's turnover, and a small number of key broadcast markets, notably the UK and USA, provide the majority of that income. With this in mind, executives from tournament operator the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), are looking at new ways to grow awareness and interest in the tournament outside their current Anglo-centric heartlands. ""We want to take the Wimbledon brand to new audiences and regions,"" Mick Desmond, AELTC commercial and media director, tells me. ""It is not just about the people here at Wimbledon, where we have sold out all spectator tickets and all hospitality again. Mr Desmond says Wimbledon has been on a digital journey ""We want to grow our global fan base, the same as the likes of Premier League football or NBA basketball are doing."" He adds: ""Tennis as a sport is in great shape. But we take a long term view in terms of strategy. ""Not just in terms of developing physical infrastructure here on the playing site, but also about building our brand with a younger audience, and also with new audiences in different parts of the world, be it China or Colombia. ""Disruption is everywhere in the modern world, and we always have to be thinking one step ahead."" During the tournament a wealth of information is available via different digital outlets The financial reward from growing its global fan base, will come when Wimbledon signs new TV deals and sponsorship agreements, and is able to show that it can deliver a large and diverse customer base for its partners. ""It all means that we add more value to our media rights, and it means we also offer more value to our commercial partners such as IBM or Jaguar,"" he says. And it is with long-term partner IBM, its official supplier of information technology, that the event is looking to use digital media to spread its message and engage with new fans. ""We have been on a long digital journey over the past seven years,"" Mr Desmond says. Inside the IBM technology bunker underneath the Wimbledon grounds He says that in 2010 Wimbledon had a very good website, but that it looked the same as the other Grand Slam tournament sites, also created by IBM. ""We wanted to enhance the beauty and grace of Wimbledon. For those who could not be here in person, we wanted to give them the next-best experience,"" he says. ""The reaction of fans has been very positive. But we are never happy. We wanted to raise the bar for 2017."" Mr Desmond says that Wimbledon wants to provide a rich digital experience that ensures they connect with fans at the event and across the globe. The Ask Fred app is named after three-times champion Fred Perry This year the AELTC and IBM have offered a new range of digital features, which include: A new real-time tool to highlight matches of particular interest and quality, and not necessarily just those on the main show courts IBM Slam Tracker - a cross-platform application that provides real time scores, stats and insights for all matches in progress Apps for those attending have been enhanced by the Ask Fred assistant which allows fans to plan their day and make the most of their visit On Wimbledon's digital platforms this year there will be computer generated highlights from six main courts - Centre, One, Two Three, 12 and 18 A 360 degree camera view will also be provided from the practice courts IBM is also using all of the data and cognitive computing capabilities put in place for the Championship, to try and work out for fans the characteristics that it takes to be ""a great champion"". ""We are democratising data for tennis and sports fans,"" says Alexandra Willis, head of content and digital at the AELTC. ""We want to get under the skin of tennis matches at Wimbledon, and use digital to deepen engagement with fans."" Graphic showing the differing types and amounts of data analysed and produced for Wimbledon fans She adds: ""We spend a lot of time trying to build our media assets. We are trying to reach a bigger, younger, more engaged audience."" Meanwhile, social media content from the tournament is being adapted into a number of different languages. There will be Facebook pages for fans in Korea, Japan, India, and the Spanish speaking nations. And content is being produced for Weibo and Wechat in China, and for Japanese messenger service Line. ""We are trying to inform fans,"" adds Ms Willis.  ""We are not just pushing content at them, we are tailoring what we do to different types of fans."" With such a varied digital offering, there had been criticism in the past there was no actual wi-fi at the tournament grounds to help ease access to it. This year there will be three areas where public wi-fi is available. They are, from the entrance way at Gate 3 and along to the food court, in the ticket resale area, and at the west stand area of court 12. Organisers say they want to see how well this works, before looking to potentially expand wi-fi access in 2018. Fans will be able to access a wealth of playing facts and data ""We are not complacent about what we are doing with our media and digital assets,"" says Mr Desmond. ""Our brand is the most important thing we have, we need to nurture and develop it. The more we can drive our content and brand, as other sports rights holders are doing, the more we can grow our audience. ""And that can ultimately only help us commercially.""

Numbers of nurses and midwives falling,"More nurses and midwives are leaving the profession in the UK than joining it, for the first time since 2008, figures show. The number registered in the UK fell by 1,783 to 690,773, in the year to March. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) said the downward trend had been most pronounced among British workers. Many leavers cited working conditions. But the government said there were now 13,000 more nurses working in hospitals in England than in 2010. In April and May this year, there was a more dramatic fall in those leaving nursing and midwifery, with a further 3,264 workers going. Other than retirement, the main reasons given for leaving were working conditions - including staffing levels and workload - personal circumstances and disillusion with quality of care to patients, according to an NMC survey of more than 4,500 leavers. Other reasons included leaving the UK and poor pay and benefits. Boris Johnson joins calls to end pay cap 'I'm swapping nursing for botox' Saffron Cordery, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: ""These figures provide further evidence of the severe workforce problems NHS trusts face. ""This goes beyond the concerns over Brexit - worrying though they are. ""The reduction in numbers is most pronounced among UK registrants. And it is particularly disappointing to see so many of our younger nurses and midwives choosing to leave."" She said a new staff retention programme would offer support to those NHS trusts with the highest leaving rates. ""However, until we address the underlying issues driving retention problems, including the pay cap and the unsustainable workplace pressures, these approaches will only have a limited impact."" Nurses protested against the 1% public sector pay cap in June The figures being flagged up by the Nursing and Midwifery Council are for those registered to work in the UK. That is, of course, important - without a ready supply, the NHS cannot recruit the staff it needs. But the figure that is perhaps of most interest to the public is how many are actually working in the health service - and whether that is enough. The Department of Health in England has made this point, highlighting figures showing there are more than 13,000 more nurses working in hospitals than there were in 2010. But if you look at the overall number working in the NHS - once you include the likes of district nurses and those working in mental health - the number has risen by only 5,000 to nearly 286,000. That is because the rise in hospital nurses has been partly offset by a fall elsewhere. What is more, if you consider the number the NHS wants to employ but cannot - by adding on the number of vacancies - you find that the health service is well short of what it needs. Earlier this year, research by the Royal College of Nursing showed there were 40,000 unfilled posts - double the number from three years ago. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said poor working conditions and the ""vicious cycle"" of staffing levels had contributed to the number of nurses leaving the profession. RCN chief executive Janet Davies added that the NHS had resorted to a ""quick fix"" by bringing in ""people from overseas"" to fill the gap left by the lack of British nurses. She believes the decision on how much nurses are paid is political. She added: ""[The government is also] removing the funding of the training of our future nurses. ""In September it will be the first time we see nurses coming in and having to take a loan. ""We know that's put people off, we haven't seen the actual figures but we know it's really low in some places and of course that just went into savings."" Nurses and midwives previously received bursaries during their studies, but the government announced it would cease the NHS bursaries system from 1 August 2017, meaning students in many healthcare fields will now have to repay the cost of their degrees. The RCN called on the government to scrap the 1% public sector pay cap as a matter of urgency to prevent more health workers leaving. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""We are making sure we have the nurses we need to continue delivering world-class patient care - that's why there are almost 13,100 more on our wards since May 2010 and 52,000 in training. ""We also know we need to retain our excellent nurses and earlier this week we launched a national programme to ensure nurses have the support they need to continue their vital work.""

"Death linked to ""Ikea"" ecstasy pills","Police believe the ""Ikea"" branded tablets are a ""particularly strong"" batch of ecstasy An 18-year-old man has died from what is believed to be a ""particularly strong"" batch of ecstasy tablets. Jersey Police said Kyle Pringle, from St Helier, died at the General Hospital early on Saturday morning. His death follows a public appeal about the yellow and blue drugs circulating in the island, stamped with the word IKEA. Three people have been arrested and a quantity of the branded tablets have been seized. ""Whilst subject to toxicology reports and a post-mortem, evidence at this time suggests the death is as a result consumption of ""Ikea"" ecstasy tablets,"" a police statement said. ""We strongly advise members of the public not to take these tablets in the interests of their health. ""Anyone who does take the tablets and becomes unwell is urged to seek medical attention through their GP or in an emergency, attend at the accident and emergency department."" A report into Mr Pringle's death will be submitted to the Deputy Viscount. Ecstasy is also known as MDMA and last year the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction warned of aresurgence in use of MDMAand an increased availability of high-strength tablets and powders.
