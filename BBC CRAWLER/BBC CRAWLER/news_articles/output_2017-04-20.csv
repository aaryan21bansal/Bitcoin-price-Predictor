Which MPs are going and who might return?,"The surprise election on 8 June has brought things into sharp focus for MPs looking for a way out of politics - and offers a possible way back for their former colleagues wanting to return. Some of the big names stepping down includeGeorge OsborneandSir Eric Pickles, whileTony Blairand Wikileaks founderJulian Assangeare among the more surprising names to suggest, perhaps not entirely seriously, that they are thinking of standing. George Osborne The former chancellor once feted as the likely successor to David Cameron as prime minister has announced hewill not seek re-electionas Conservative MP for Tatton, Cheshire. Mr Osborne was sacked as chancellor after Theresa May became the party's new leader in July. He has since become the editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper as well as taking a job for the fund manager BlackRock, among others, prompting calls for him to stand down. Announcing his decision not to seek re-election, the 45-year-old said he was stepping down ""for now"". Sir Eric Pickles Former Conservative Party chairman Sir Eric Pickles, 65,is standing down as MP for Brentwood and Ongarafter 25 years. Sir Eric, who had been the communities and local government secretary between 2010 and 2015, said he was going to ""miss it dreadfully"" but there always came a point when things must end. Andrew Tyrie The long-standing chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, who has locked horns withBoris Johnson,HMRCandBank of England governor Mark Carney, will quit his safe Conservative seat. Mr Tyrie, 60, said it had been an ""exhilarating"" 20 years as MP for Chichester in West Sussex but that he was ""hopefully young enough"" to contribute to public service in other ways. Douglas Carswell Douglas Carswell, UKIP's first elected MP who later became an independent after falling out with senior figures in the party,will not be seeking re-election in Clacton. Instead, the political maverick will lend his support to the Conservatives, the party he defected from in 2014, causing political shockwaves at the time. Farewell to an independent-minded MP Alan Johnson Regarded by some in Westminster as the best leader Labour never had,Alan Johnson is to stand downfrom the Hull West and Hessle seat he has held since 1997. Announcing his decision not to seek re-election, the former postman and union official who rose to become home secretary under Gordon Brown, said it was ""best for the party"". Gisela Stuart Labour's Birmingham Edgbaston MP, who was a key figure in the campaign to leave the EU, has decided not to seek re-election. Ms Stuart, who has represented the Midlands seat since 1997, told local supporters it was ""time to stand down and pass on the baton"". Andy Burnham Andy Burnham, a former Labour health secretary and now tipped as favourite to become Mayor of Greater Manchester, says he will not stand again in June. Mr Burnham, MP for Leigh for 16 years, had two shots at party leadership, coming fourth in 2010 and second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015. Tom Blenkinsop - Labour (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) elected in 2010 Graham Allen - Labour (Nottingham North) elected in 1987 Iain Wright - Labour (Hartlepool) elected in 2004 Pat Glass - Labour (North West Durham) elected in 2010 Simon Burns - Conservative (Chelmsford) elected in 1987 John Pugh - Lib Dem (Southport) elected in 2001 Andrew Smith - Labour (Oxford East) elected in 1987 Angela Watkinson - Conservative (Hornchurch and Upminster) elected in 2001 Jim Dowd - Labour (Lewisham West and Penge) elected in 1992 Fiona Mactaggart - Labour (Slough) elected in 1997 Rob Marris - Labour (Wolverhampton South West) elected in 2015 Sir Gerald Howarth - Conservative (Aldershot) elected in 1997 Dave Anderson - Labour (Blaydon) elected in 2005 Michael Dugher - Labour (Barnsley East) elected in 2010 Michelle Thomson - Independent (Edinburgh West). Ms Thomson was elected as SNP MP in 2015, but resigned the party whip amid a police probe into property deals. After being rejected for SNP selection, she said she would not stand again at this time Sir Alan Haselhurst - Conservative (Saffron Walden) elected in 1977 David Mackintosh - Conservative (Northampton South) elected in 2015 Karen Lumley - Conservative (Redditch) elected in 2010 Andrew Turner - Conservative (Isle of Wight) elected in 2001 Zac Goldsmith The former Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith,has been re-selected as the party's candidatein Richmond Park. Goldsmithresigned from the partyand stood as an independent in a by-election before Christmas in protest at the government's decision to give the go-ahead to the expansion of Heathrow Airport. But he lost to the Liberal Democrats' Sarah Olney, who is standing for re-election. EstherMcVey The former employment minister, who was a TV presenter before entering Parliament, lost her Wirral West seat in 2015 to Labour's Margaret Greenwood (who is standing again). She has been selected to stand in George Osborne's former Tatton seat. Sir Vince Cable Sir Vince Cable, who served as former business secretary in the coalition government from 2010-2015, is one of a batch of Lib Dems who have confirmed they will stand again. A former Labour councillor, the 73-year-old was first elected as MP for Twickenham in 1997 but was defeated by Conservative Tania Mathias in 2015 after the Lib Dems lost dozens of seats. Ms Mathias is expected to stand again. Announcing his decision to stand again, Sir Vince said ""Bring it on!"". Sir Simon Hughes A former Lib Dem deputy leader and minister of state for justice and civil liberties in the coalition government, Sir Simon Hughes said he intends to be the party's candidate to fight the Bermondsey and Old Southwark seat in south London, which he lost to Labour's Neil Coyle in 2015. Mr Coyle is standing again. Sir Ed Davey Sir Ed Davey, 51, is another Lib Dem heavyweight to announce his return to the political fray. Confirming his intention to stand again for election in Kingston and Surbiton, the former energy secretary in the coalition government toldthe Independent,external: ""We will be the surprise in this election, we will do far better than people currently think."" The seat was won by Conservative James Berry in 2015, with a majority of 2,834. Mr Berry is standing again. Jo Swinson A former deputy leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson was once Parliament's youngest MP, after she was elected to East Dunbartonshire in 2005, but was ousted in 2015 by the SNP's John Nicolson, who is standing for re-election. Sir Bob Russell The former Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester, Sir Bob Russell,is to stand again, despite retiring from politics after his defeat in 2015 to Conservative Will Quince. Sir Nick Harvey Previously an armed forces minister, former Liberal Democrat MP, Sir Nick Harvey, 55, has told the BBC he will be seeking re-election after losing his seat in North Devon in 2015 to Conservative Peter Heaton-Jones. Ed Balls Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls will not be standing in the Morley and Outwood constituency he held for five years and is not expected to stand anywhere else. Mr Balls, who lost his seat in the 2015 general election, has arguably since become best known for his dance moves on the last series of Strictly Come Dancing, in whichhe became a fan favourite. Arron Banks The former UKIP donor was all set to take on Douglas Carswellin Clacton- the two are not the best of friends - but since Mr Carswell pulled out the insurance tycoon has had a change of heart. After visiting UKIP volunteers in the Essex seaside town - a place he cheerfully admitted he knew nothing about - he has said he has ""no intention of standing in the way of hard-working activists who are the soul of the party"". He will instead endorse local UKIP councillor Jeff Bray for the role and ""give the local party financial assistance to fight the election"". Nigel Farage The former UKIP leader briefly flirted with an eighth attempt to get elected to the House of Commons, saying he could have had an ""easy"" win in the former UKIP seat of Clacton, buthas thought better of it. He says he has more clout as a member of the European Parliament, where he will continue to ""fight for Brexit"". Karen Danczuk The ex-councillor and former wife of suspended Labour MP Simon Danczuk had applied to be Labour candidate for the Conservative-held Bury North seat. Ms Danczuk, dubbed the ""selfie queen"" by the tabloid press afterposting pictures of herself on Twitter, had said she was ""a voice of the people"". However, the party has chosen James Frith to stand for the seat, currently held by David Nuttall. Simon Danczuk The MP was suspended as a member of the Labour Party in 2015 over allegations about his private life. Heintended to stand for re-election as the party's candidate in Rochdalebut Labour had other ideas. A Labour spokesman said: ""After considering the case of Simon Danczuk in detail and speaking to him in an interview, the Labour Party's NEC endorsement panel unanimously recommended that he should not be endorsed as a Labour candidate."" Paul Nuttall The UKIP leader - who recently failed to take Stoke-on-Trent from Labour in a by-election - wavered for a few days but has now confirmedhe will stand in Boston and Skegness. The constituency, held by the Conservatives in 2015 with UKIP second, recorded the highest Leave vote in the EU referendum, with 75.6% choosing to leave the EU. Mr Nuttall said he would make it his ""mission"" to ""ensure there is no backsliding on Brexit"". Jack Monroe The food blogger and campaigner Jack Monroewill stand for the National Health Action Partyin Southend West, against Conservative Sir David Amess. Announcing theplan on Twitter,,externalthe activist said: ""Those who know me will know how much I fear meeting new people, which makes the next six weeks a huge personal challenge on every level... ""...but some things are bigger than me, so today I'm digging deep and heading to Southend High St to meet campaigners fighting for our A&E."" Steve Rotherham Will Labour's candidate to be Liverpool's first ""metro mayor"" - and a staunch ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - continue to sit as an MP if he wins 4 May's poll? His ultra-safe Liverpool Walton seat would be a prize for any aspiring Labour politician and there is a row brewing locally about a candidate being ""parachuted in"" by the party's London HQ. Tony Blair He won three elections while leader of the Labour Party, before stepping down in 2007, but could Tony Blair - now 63 - be making a big political comeback in this snap election? The former MP for Sedgefield - and prominent Remainer - got tongues waggingduring an exclusive interview with BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, after he admitted there was a temptation to get back into Westminster politics to fight against a hard Brexit. ""I feel for the first time since I first came into politics, I look at the British political scene at the moment and I actually almost feel motivated to go right back into it,"" he said. In an interview marking the 20th anniversary of his 1997 election victory, he later told The Observer that he wanted to ""reconnect with voters"" and ""get his hands dirty"" again but insisted he would not be a candidate in June. David Miliband There has been speculation about whether David Miliband might return to politics after stepping down as an MP in 2013. The former foreign secretary under Gordon Brown, who was surprisingly defeated by his brother Ed in the 2010 Labour leadership contest, declined to rule out a return to UK politics in an interview withthe Times,externalin February. Julian Assange The Wikileaks founder may have been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, but has still suggested, perhaps light-heartedly, that he could stand in the election. Mr Assangetweeted,external: ""I can run for Parliament in any constituency in the UK. Ha ha. So which one?""

UK's aid budget: Decision time for Theresa May,"A few weeks ago, Theresa May did something rather unusual. The prime minister went to Scotland and delivered a speech in praise of Britain's aid budget. As far as I can determine, this was a first. She praised the Department for International Development (DfID) that delivers that budget. In an unexpected flurry of alliteration, she praised the aid money being spent in Somalia, South Sudan and Syria. She said UK aid ""helps millions around the world and speaks strongly to the values that we share as a country"". But here's the thing: at no point did she mention the government's commitment - set out in law - to spend 0.7% of Britain's national income on foreign aid. As ever, Mrs May was hedging her bets. For she is torn between competing pressures. On the one hand, she is under political pressure from supportive newspapers such as the Daily Mail to scrap the commitment. Some of her MPs are joining in, publicly attacking a Â£13bn budget they see as too large and too wasteful. In a time of austerity and rising deficits, there are genuine questions about whether the aid budget should continue to be protected when others are facing cuts. In these circumstances, it might seem tempting for the prime minister to ditch yet another of her predecessor's legacy policies. In a speech in Scotland, Theresa May praised the UK's international aid budget and DfID Yet Mrs May has also found it rather useful in recent months to praise the aid budget. When she argues that Brexit does not mean Britain turning in on itself, she recites a list that includes the UK's seat on the UN Security Council, its membership of Nato, and its commitment to spend 2% of national income on defence and 0.7% on international aid. Reality Check: How much does the UK spend on overseas aid? UK aid money: Generosity or wasted spending? Bill Gates urges UK to protect foreign aid Priti Patel walks UK aid budget tightrope In Scotland, she used Britain's aid budget - and the soft power that it provided - to show what she thought the UK could deliver if the union continued. She also likes the argument that Britain's aid budget gives it global diplomatic clout. Until recently, there was an assumption at Westminster that the aid commitment would be up for grabs towards the end of the Parliament, ahead of an election in 2020. One scenario was that Mrs May might have offered to drop the aid target to mollify Tory MPs unhappy with whatever compromise deal she negotiates on Brexit. But the decision to go for an early election has accelerated that debate. Its critics say that the UK's Â£13bn aid budget is too large and too wasteful And right now there is a vacuum of uncertainty. The Conservatives are refusing to say whether they will renew the 0.7% target in their election manifesto. At Prime Minister's Questions this week, Mrs May gave an ambiguous, non-committal answer when asked to reaffirm the pledge. Her party spokesman said simply that the government would continue to support the poorest people around the world. As for the manifesto and the aid commitment, he said only that ""we will set out our plans in due course"". It is into this debate that the global philanthropist Bill Gates is making his pitch, warning the prime minister that dropping the aid target would ""cost lives"". The uncertainty about Mrs May's intentions has prompted much speculation. Some Tories say the aid target should be merged into a new defence spending target. Others say it should be redefined to include more security related needs. Others again say the target should be kept but with different definitions, so that it has to be met not every 12 months but over an entire five-year Parliament. This would mean that DfID would not have to spend money rashly at the end of the financial year simply to meet what is an artificial target. So it is decision time for Theresa May on aid. She could keep the 0.7% in her election manifesto. This would incur the wrath of some Conservative MPs and voters who think the bloated aid budget would be better spent on schools and hospitals at home. Development Secretary Priti Patel says the UK's aid budget promotes Britain's national interest But it would also avoid a distracting row that might bleed into the election campaign. The last thing the prime minister wants to do right now is upset potential Tory voters on the liberal left who are disillusioned with the Labour leadership. Nor does she want to give the Liberal Democrats an early election gift. Or the prime minister could drop or amend the aid target. This would please her political base, but it would also make it harder to argue that Britain was showing global leadership. Spending less on aid would reduce Britain's soft power, making it less easy for ministers to open doors in foreign capitals. It would also undermine all those arguments that she and other ministers - such as the Development Secretary Priti Patel - have been making in defence of UK aid: namely that it promotes Britain's national interests by deterring refugees from Europe and turning fragile states into potential trading partners. In that speech in Scotland, Theresa May said: ""We are a kind and generous country... a big country that will never let down - or turn our back on - those in need. ""We are a country that does, and will always, meet our commitments to the world - and particularly to those who so desperately need our support."" We are about to find out what those words mean.

The 13 MPs who opposed snap election,"Parliament voted for an early general election on Wednesday, with 522 MPs in favour. However, 13 voted no. But who are the 13 and why are they against the poll? MPs back May's call for snap election When did he first win his seat?1987 What positions has he held?Parliamentary commissioner for administration (June 1987 - March 1997), Health Committee member (October 2005 - November 2007), Public Administration Committee member (July 1997 - May 2001). Why did he vote no?Mr Campbell is 73 and has been treated for stomach cancer. However, he is on the road to recovery after an operation and chemotherapy. He announced earlier on Wednesday he would stand again for election as it would be the party's national executive committee who would choose his replacement rather than the local party - not something he was keen on. When did she first win her seat?1984 What positions has she held in the party?Shadow secretary of state for international development (January 1989 - January 1992), shadow secretary of state for Wales (July 1992 - November 1992), shadow minister for culture, media and sport (November 1992 - January 1993), chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party (May 2005 - December 2006). Why did she vote no?The Welsh MP said the only reason the prime minister called the election was a ""cut and run tactic"" because of how difficult Brexit negotiations will be. As a former MEP, she said members of the European Parliament were ""not going to roll over with a handshake and a smile, they are going to talk tough and be tough"". Ms Clwyd added: ""Nobody is ready for this general election. I do think this is an irrelevance considering what is happening in the world at the moment."" When did he first win his seat?2001 What positions has he held in the party?Member of multiple committees, including the Culture, Media and Sport Committee  (July 2015 - present), the Privacy and Injunctions Committee (July 2011 - March 2012) and the Consolidation Bills Committee (December 2010 - March 2015). Why did he vote no?Mr Farrelly has one of the smallest majorities in the UK, with only 650, so it may be understandable why he was not keen for an election. But he told a local newspaper reporter for the Stoke Sentinel that he voted against it because he believes it will be ""bad for the country"" and the unity of the UK. When did he first win his seat?1997 (the seat changed from Poplar and Canning Town to Poplar and Limehouse in 2010) What positions has he held in the party?Minister of state for environment, food and rural affairs (June 2009 - May 2010), shadow minister for environment, food and rural affairs (May 2010 - October 2010), shadow minister for transport (October 2010 - August 2013). Why did he vote no?Mr Fitzpatrick was planning to retire in 2020, but he will be standing for re-election. He said he voted no because he thought the prime minister was ""taking advantage of a lead in the opinion polls for purely party political advantage, not in the national interest."" He added that Mrs May's ""misleading [of] the public... ought to have been objected to and opposed."" When did he first win his seat?2015 What positions has he held in the party?Shadow secretary of state for defence (June 2016 - Oct 2016) and shadow secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy (October 2016 - February 2017). Why did he vote no?It may be for personal reasons as he is due to get married on 6 May.He told the Daily Telegraph,external: ""Theresa May kind of has thrown a clanger into my life. We've had to cancel the honeymoon and we don't even know if we're getting married now, so I don't know. It's a bit of a disaster personally."" But he has also said it was down to the way the government had gone about turning over the Fixed Term Parliament Act. ""At this critical time, it isn't the time for Theresa May to simply call an election when it is convenient,"" he said. ""Had a motion of no confidence in the government been on the table I would have voted for it."" When did she win her seat?1997 What positions has she held in the party?Shadow minister for the equalities office (October 2010 - April 2011) and shadow minister for equalities (April 2011 - October 2011). Why did she vote no?The former Labour minister has announced she is not going to stand for re-election, saying she is ""bored by political squabbles over personalities"". Of the election she said: ""I can't believe that spending eight weeks of a time-limited negotiation period campaigning in an election rather than talking to our EU partners will strengthen her hand in negotiations with anyone outside her own Conservative Party."" When did she first win her seat?2014 What positions has she held in the party?Shadow minister for communities and local government (September 2015 - June 2016) and shadow minister for foreign and Commonwealth affairs (October 2016 - present). Why did she vote no?The Greater Manchester MP said she voted against the election because of ""voter fatigue"". She toldBuzzfeed,externalthat after a by-election that saw her become an MP, the 2015 general election, the referendum, and the mayoral race in 2017, there was the potential for low turnout.  Ms McInnes added: ""I haven't met anyone who welcomes it, people just go 'oh no, not again'."" When did he first win his seat?1970 What positions has he held in the party?Member of the National Executive Committee (July 1979 - July 1992, July 1994 - July 1998, July 1999 - May 2010), vice-chair of the Labour Party (July 1987 - July 1988) and Party Chair (July 1988 - July 1989). Why did he vote no?No official word from Mr Skinner, but during PMQs he asked for a guarantee that those Tory MPs under investigation for election expenses would not stand. For him, failure to do that would make the whole campaign ""the most squalid in my life time"". Perhaps not a surprise he voted against it then. When did he first win his seat?1997 What positions has he held in the party?Parliamentary secretary at the cabinet office (November 1999 - June 2001) and Lord Commissioner at the Treasury (June 2001 - May 2002). Why did he vote no?Mr Stringer condemned his own party for not opposing the snap election and ""falling into Theresa May's trap"" to boost the Tories. He added: ""The opinion polls might be a few points out but they're not telling a complete lie. We have got to spend the next seven weeks getting our policy issues over, they appear to be popular with the public when tested. But I wasn't going to vote to support Theresa May's cynical move to try and increase the Conservatives' majority.""

When did she first win her seat?2015 What positions has she held in the party?SNP Westminster spokeswoman for disabilities (May 2015 - November 2015). Why did she vote no?It was an eventful day for Ms McGarry, who confirmed she was pregnant after she fainted in the Houses of Parliament. An ambulance was called, but just as a precaution. The politician, who lost the SNP whip and now sits as an independentafter allegations of fraud were made against her, hasn't explained why she voted as she did. When did she first win her seat?2015 What positions has she held in the party?SNP Westminster group leader for business, innovation and skills (May 2015 - October 2015). Why did she vote no?She is currently sitting as an independent after withdrawing the SNP whip last year.

When did he first win his seat?2005 What positions has he held in the party?Leader from 2011 to 2015.

Parties race against time to choose candidates,"Britain's political parties are in a race against time to get candidates in place for the snap election. They had been working on the assumption that there would not be an election until May 2020, but now have just three weeks to put names forward. Any British, Irish or eligible Commonwealth citizen over the age of 18 - who meetsthe qualification criteria,external- can stand, provided they can scrape together a Â£500 deposit. The deadline for submitting an application is Thursday 11 May. Here is how the parties' efforts are going: Labour has said all of its 229 MPs will be automatically re-selected - they had until 17:00 BST on Thursday, April 20, to say whether they wanted to stand again or not. Only 12 of them have opted to stand down, including former home secretary Alan Johnson. The party will advertise these vacancies on its website, but the deadline for applications is Sunday, 23 April. All Labour candidates in England will be selected by members of the party's ruling National Executive Committee and regional board members. Local Labour Party branches, who normally get to choose candidates, will not get a say ""due to the exceptional snap general election circumstances"". The party says this will not set any precedent for future elections - but it removes the prospect of MPs being deselected by ballots of local party members. Labour in Scotland and Wales will shortly announce their own selection plans. The Conservative Party has also changed its normal selection procedures and is short-listing candidates for target seats without inviting applications. ""Inevitably it has to be a somewhat shorter process than we usually use,"" says aleaked letter to would-be Tory candidates published by Conservative Home.,external The party's 330 MPs will be re-selected, unless they have decided to stand down. Four of them have done that so far. In target seats and those where MPs are standing down, local party members will get to choose from a shortlist of three candidates drawn up by the party's central office, according to Conservative Home. In non-target seats, candidates will be appointed by central office after consultation with local party officials. All 54 of the SNP's existing MPs are expected to stand again. Two MPs - Michelle Thompson and Natalie McGarry- have been suspended by the party since 2015. The party's National Executive Committee met on Saturday and decided not to allow them tobe SNP candidates this time. There are three other seats in Scotland not held by the SNP, where candidates need to be selected. The party selected 326 candidates last year and a further 70 or so before the snap election was announced. It advertised for the remaining vacancies and is hoping to have candidates in all 650 seats by early next week. All candidates are selected by local parties, in line with national party guidelines on gender balance and ethnic diversity. Regional party boards are also expected to consider LGBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender) candidates for winnable seats. One Lib Dem MP, John Pugh, is standing down. Party members in his Southport constituency will select a candidate from an all-women shortlist. A UKIP spokesman told the BBC: ""Since the announcement of the snap election, we have been rapidly gearing up for the campaign and we are confident we have the resources in place to fight it. ""Our candidate selection process will begin shortly, with candidates being adopted over the course of the next week, and we will be fielding candidates nationwide."" The Greens stood in over 90% of seats in England and Wales last time, a party spokeswoman said. She said local parties were currently selecting candidates but added: ""A number are also in negotiations about potentially pulling their candidates if any electoral alliances are arranged."" The party, which currently has three MPs, is selecting its candidates next week - the choice is made by local party members. It aims to stand in all 40 seats being contested in Wales. With talks still going on at Stormont about restoring devolved government, none of the parties is thought to have selected candidates yet for the general election.

Murray suffers shock Monte Carlo defeat,"This video can not be played I made some bad decisions - Andy Murray World number one Andy Murray blew a 4-0 lead in the deciding set as he fell to a shock defeat by Albert Ramos-Vinolas in the Monte Carlo Masters third round. Murray went on to lose 2-6 6-2 7-5 in only his second match back after a month out with an elbow injury. Two breaks had the Briton in command of the third set, but Spanish 15th seed Ramos-Vinolas hit back to win seven of the last eight games. Rafael NadalandNovak Djokovicboth reached the quarter-finals. Serena Williams: How can you win a Grand Slam when pregnant? Murray, 29, was playing his first tournament since beingbeaten in the second round at Indian Wellsin March. He defeated Gilles Muller in straight sets on Wednesday, but admitted afterwards his elbow injury was still causing him some problems. Murray began his second-round match against Muller with three double faults in the first four points of the match, and his service game was again an issue against Ramos-Vinolas. The Scot was broken seven times as 29-year-old Ramos-Vinolas claimed a first win against a world number one. Murray showed trademark fight in fending off three break points at 4-4 in the decider, but could not respond when the Spaniard was in the ascendancy in his next service game. Murray briefly threatened to break back with the score at 30-30 as Ramos-Vinolas served for the match, but he dragged a forehand wide and misjudged a drop shot into the net at match point. Marin Cilicawaits Ramos-Vinolas in the last eight after beating Tomas Berdych.

The tournament in Monte Carlo is one of only two Masters 1000 events Murray has never won BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller: Even before this match, Murray was talking of adding an extra tournament to his schedule and heading to Budapest next week. He needs more matches and the time to rebuild trust in his serve and elbow: the French Open begins just five weeks on Sunday. Murray has at least had four and a half hours of competitive clay-court action this week and won't be pressing the panic button just yet. He reached the semi-finals in Monte Carlo last year, but struggled badly in the early rounds, and still went on to dominate the rest of the year.

Zverev, who turned 20 on Thursday, smashed his racquet in half after being broken twice by Nadal in the second set. The Spaniard, aiming for his 50th clay title, will next face Argentina'sDiego Schwartzman. World number two Djokovic fought back from a mixed second set to beat 13th-ranked Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta 6-2 4-6 6-4. The Serb saved two break points at 4-4 in the final set before immediately breaking Carreno Busta to set up a quarter-final with Belgium'sDavid Goffin.

How much does the UK spend on overseas aid?,"The Microsoft founder Bill Gates has urged the UK to maintain its promise to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid. He warned that reducing the commitment would cost lives. But some Conservative MPs and newspapers have suggested that the figure is too high and should not be maintained after the election. Under legislation approved in 2015, the UK government is legally required to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on overseas development assistance (ODA), popularly known as foreign aid. In 2015, that translated to a total spend of Â£12.1bn, according to the Department for International Development. The provisional figure for 2016 is Â£13.3bn. International summits since the 1970s have been urging wealthy countries to spend 0.7% of GNI on overseas aid. The target was also seen as an important way to help meet the UN's Millennium Development Goals. The UK first met the target on a voluntary basis in 2013, before it was made a legal requirement. In 2015, 37% of UK overseas development assistance was delivered via international organisations and 63% was spent as bilateral aid sent directly to the countries concerned. The top five country recipients of UK aid in 2015 were Pakistan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Syria. It is also worth noting that about Â£1bn of the money the UK pays to the EU budget counts as part of the foreign aid budget. The EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future. The Department for International Development (DfID) says UK aid goes to specific regions, countries and programmes or is pooled with other donors' money and spent by multilateral organisations. Humanitarian projects received the largest proportion of aid in 2015. To ensure value for money for the taxpayer, development programmes are subject to ""rigorous checks and analysis"", according to DfID, and projects can be tracked online. The parties have not issued their election manifestos yet, but this is where they stand at the moment. According to the government, this money is building ""a safer, healthier, more prosperous world for people in developing countries and in the UK"". Earlier this year, Prime Minister Theresa May described the target as a ""critical pillar"" of the country's foreign policy. The UK was one of only eight countries that hit the target of 0.7% of GNI in 2016. However, the level of spending has long had its critics in Parliament and the press. They say the amount that the UK spends on ODA is too large and that aid money has been wasted in recent years. While the Conservative government supports the target, several Tory backbenchers oppose it. ""This 0.7% means that important things at home like social care are struggling,""according to Peter Bone MP.,external UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has called the size of the budget an ""absolute outrage"", saying money should be diverted to the NHS. Labour is firmly committed to 0.7% - the aid budget doubled when the party was in power between 1997 and 2010. Shadow international development secretary Kate Osamor has said potential cuts are ""deeply alarming"" and that the money is a ""lifeblood for the indispensable work that aid agencies carry out"". The Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party, Greens and Plaid Cymru are all supporters of the 0.7% figure. Last month, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the Conservative Party has been taken over by ""anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-international aid zealots"". According to the latest figures from the OECD, in 2016 two G7 countries met the target: the UK and, for the first time, Germany. The other countries that spent at least 0.7% were Sweden, Luxembourg, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Denmark and Norway. The Netherlands, which usually meets the target, dropped off the list in 2016. By comparison, Russia spent 0.08% of its GNI on foreign aid. In absolute terms, however, by far the largest annual amount of foreign aid is given by the United States, although that represents only 0.18% of its national income. Update: On  21 April, the prime ministersaid there would be no cutsto the UK's foreign aid budget.  This piece has also been updated to include the 2016 figures from the OECD.

Prince: 12 things we've learned since his death,"The star's hits included Purple Rain, Little Red Corvette, Raspberry Beret and Diamonds and Pearls This Friday, it will be one year since Prince died, after taking an accidental overdose of painkillers. His death robbed the world of a true original: A pocket-sized virtuoso who broke musical rules and defied genres, apparently without breaking a sweat. President Obama called his death a ""remarkable loss"", and revealed he listened to Purple Rain to ""just to get warmed up"" in the morning. The star was famously private, rarely giving interviews, and even serving non-disclosure agreements on former bandmates and collaborators. Since his death, however, fans have been afforded the occasional glimpse into his life - some funny, some enlightening, all of them elevating his status as a visionary, and a musical genius. Here are 12 things we've learned in the last 12 months. With songs like Erotic City and Sexy Dancer, Prince became known as a rampant sex machine - but he was also a devoutly religious vegan, who became a Jehovah's Witness in 2003. After that, he excised swear words from his music (Sexy MF was never played live again) and kept a ""cuss bucket"" in his recording studio. ""He didn't want to dishonour the faith,"" said his friend James Lundstrom. ""He wasn't joking. You had to pay in cash in the bucket. He would charge you between three and 10 dollars per swear word. ""Once I bumped my knee and I said, 'damn'. He said, 'What did you say?'"" On one occasion, Lundstrom recalled, a foul-mouthed musician stuffed a handful of hundred dollar bills in the swear jar as a down-payment for the rest of the day. Prince with his first wife, Mayte Garcia Prince was cremated at a private ceremony for family and close friends on Saturday, 23 April. Among the songs played at the service was Comeback, an acoustic lament the star originally recorded in 1996 for his son, Ahmir, who was born with a rare genetic disorder and died seven days later. Released on the fanclub-only album The Truth, the song's lyrics were equally apt for Prince's funeral. ""If you ever lose someone dear to you / Never say the words 'they're gone' / They'll come back."" Prince: No-one in the universe will ever compare Documents show Prince's painkiller habit Prince: A life in pictures A portrait of Prince from Steve Parke's new book, Picturing Prince Prince's former art director Steve Parke recently published a book featuring the intimate, behind-the-scenes photographs he took of the star during his time at Paisley Park. He also recounts the time Prince invited him to watch a montage of old performances he was preparing for the American Music Awards. When a scene from Purple Rain appeared, the star bellowed, ""Look at that wig!"" and burst out laughing. Parke later asked Prince's hair stylist Earl Jones about the comment. He explained the star had had to reshoot a few scenes after the filming wrapped - but he had already cut his hair and bleached it blond - necessitating the bouffant hairpiece. Jones added that Prince had reacted so badly to the bleach that his hair started breaking off, so he had to let it grow out, and dye it back to black. ""The hairstyle in Raspberry Beret was literally all I could do with it."" It's no secret that Prince was a perfectionist - but some of the stories that emerged after his death highlighted the star's ruthless attitude towards his bandmates. ""He did like to push the band with fear,"" said Michael B Nelson, who played trombone for the New Power Generation. One night, months into 1993's Act I tour, Nelson missed a high B during his solo on a song called The Flow. ""The next day, [Prince] came by and said, 'You're gonna play that solo right tonight?'""he told Rolling Stone,external. ""I said, 'I'll do my best.' And he says, 'Uh, you did your best last night.' And he walks away."" That night, when it came to the solo, Prince walked up to him with his ""golden gun"" microphone (pictured above) and held it to his head. ""I was like, 'Oh, my God.' And he kept doing it. And it was like a week of him doing this, and I'm freaking out. It wasn't showbiz at that point. It was, 'Don't you ever do that again'."" Prince was pictured riding his bicycle through Minneapolis shortly before his death Five days before his death, Prince celebrated Record Store Day by cycling to his local record store and snapping up a few bargains. According to Bob Fuchs, the manager ofElectric Fetus,external, the star bought six CDs: Stevie Wonder - Talking Book Chambers Brothers - The Time Has Come Joni Mitchell - Hejira Swan Silvertones - Inspirational Gospel Classics Missing Persons - The Best Of Missing Persons Santana - Santana IV Prince then set off on his bike, waving to fans at a nearby hair salon before visiting a local coffee store. According to barista, Alya Al-Hilwani, he preferred a mocha, with no whipped cream. In summer 2015, the Minneapolis house that featured as Prince's childhood home in the film Purple Rain went up for sale. It turns out that Prince bought it himself. Minnesota Public Radio checked property records and discovered the owner of the 1913 house, at3420 Snelling Avenue, Minneapolis,external, was NPG Music Publishing  - one of Prince's companies. The initial asking price was just $110,000, but Prince paid $117,000 in cash to secure the property. After his death, Prince's estate put it up for sale, saying ""the costs of repair and ongoing maintenance"" were such that keeping hold of the house was ""not in the Estate's best interest"". Incredibly, Prince was the biggest-selling artist in the US last year, in terms of album sales. He shifted more than 2.2 million albums in the months after his death, partly because his music was unavailable on the major streaming platrforms. He was the only artist to sell more than one million digital and physical albums in 2016; and sold a total of 5.4 million digital songs, putting him ahead of Drake and Adele. When his music finally became available on Spotify, Apple, Amazon and Google Play this February, it was streamed 17 million times in one week  - with Purple Rain alone racking up 1 million plays. In the recording studio with Prince Hunting for Prince's vault Prince: Sixteen pivotal songs Prince - BBC Music homepage Prince had many aliases - most famously changing his name to an unpronounceable symbol in the 1990s Prince had many aliases as a songwriter - Alexander Nevermind, Joey Coco and Jamie Starr, to name but a few. But unsealed court documents show, released earlier this week, show that the star, an intensely private person, travelled under the name Peter Bravestrong to help conceal his identity. That name was on a luggage tag he used while travelling to Atlanta for what proved to be his final concert. The suitcase was found at Paisley Park after his death, and contained several prescription bottles in the name of Kirk Johnson, a personal friend and employee since the 1980s. (It also contained handwritten lyrics for U Got the Look, according to investigators.) US authorities are still investigating how Prince obtained the prescription medications which killed him. As well as, presumably, Raspberry Sorbet As bandmates and friends lined up to pay tribute to Prince, they all seemed to have one memory in common: Eggs. ""Prince did the cooking. Scrambled eggs,"" singer Jill Jones told GQ magazine. ""He put curry and a little bit of cheddar cheese in them. It was really good, actually. ""You know, he barely ate. I was always starving around him. I was always freaking hungry."" ""Prince was never an eater,"" agreed Cat Glover, who joined him on the Sign O The Times and Lovesexy tours. ""He would usually smell his food. Literally. I never really seen Prince eat. I've seen him make pancakes - he made me pancakes, he made me eggs. But he's not the type of person that eats a lot. ""Yeah, he has made me scrambled eggs,"" said dancer Misty Copeland. ""Breakfast was his forte. He liked to use a lot of seasoning. They were delicious."" It's worth noting that Prince himself did not carry an eggy whiff. ""Ever since I've known Prince, I've attached a smell to him, which is lavender,"" Madonna once said. ""He reeks of it."" One of the other properties put up for sale by Prince's estate was a huge, 160-acre estate near Lake Ann in Chanhassen, which was valued at almost $14 million. It once contained a yellow three-story mansion-style house, complete with a home studio, where portions of Sign O' the Times and The Black Album were recorded. ""There were a couple of summer nights where we could hear music coming through the woods,"" Juli Gempler, who lived next door,told ABC News,externalafter his death. ""Nice and loud. It was good. It was really cool."" The property even had its own windmill - also bright yellow - where Prince presumably spent many a happy hour milling organic flour before baking a nice batch loaf. Sadly, though, he had the house and the windmill torn down in the 1990s.Satellite images now show the property,externalas a vast expanse of green fields and woodland, except for a lone tennis court. Shortly after Prince's death, the legendary ""vault"" that contained his archive of concert recordings, unreleased songs and rehearsal tapes was drilled open. According to the singer's former recording engineer Susan Rodgers, who started the vault for Prince during the 1980s, the facility was almost full when she left in 1987, with songs in there that pre-date his legendary Purple Rain album. ""We used to do two songs a day, and he just put them away,"" added his friend and engineer David Z. In fact, there's so much music waiting to be released, ""it probably won't be tapped out in our lifetime,"" said former Paisley Park employee Scott LeGere. The first release came last year, when the 1999-era track Moonbeam Levels was unearthed for the compilation Prince 4Ever. This June, an expanded version of Purple Rain is due, containing ""two incredible albums of previously unreleased Prince music and two complete concert films,"" according to Warner Bros Records. Aleaked tracklist,externalsuggests fans will finally get to hear studio versions of the much-bootlegged songs Electric Intercourse and Possessed, amongst others. Prince's estate has also signed a $30m deal with Universal Music to release non-Warner Bros material - which will hopefully include fan favourites like Extraloveable, Wonderful Ass, Lisa, Train, Rebirth of the Flesh and Big Tall Wall. There is some speculation that the star didn't maintain his vault to archival standards, and that some of the tapes may have deteriorated. Furthermore, the process of cataloguing the material hadn't even begun by the start of this year. One of the most widely-circulated links after Prince's death was avideo of his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004,external. It sees Prince joining an all-star version of the Beatles' While My Guitar Gently Weeps, backed by Tom Petty, Steve Winwood and George Harrison's son, Dhani. He keeps to the sidelines until the final two minutes, when he steps forward to deliver one of the most breathtaking guitar solos you've ever seen, full of fluttering high notes and ringing harmonics. Amazingly, Prince never rehearsed this moment with the band. At a run-through the night before it was Jeff Lynne's guitarist, Marc Mann, who took the solo. ""Prince doesn't say anything, just starts strumming, plays a few leads here and there, but for the most part, nothing memorable,"" recalled Joel Gallen, who directed the ceremony. But when the big moment came, Prince stole the show. At one point, he turned to face Petty and Harrison, then fell backwards into the audience -while still playing- before strutting off stage, throwing his guitar into the air before the song ended. ""You see me nodding at him, to say, 'Go on, go on,'""Petty told the New York Times,external. ""I remember I leaned out at him at one point and gave him a 'This is going great!' kind of look. ""He just burned it up. You could feel the electricity of 'something really big's going down here.'"" Prince later claimed he had never even heard the song before it was sent to him to learn for the performance.

Trump or Trumpism? A conservative dilemma,"As Fox News is forced to reassess its role in American political life, it might ask the question, is this White House about Trump or about the movement he stands for, call it Trumpism? There's a difference. It's the same question millions of voters who supported Donald Trump will soon want the answer to. For the past couple of decades Fox News has dominated the American cable landscape by successfully combining a coherent conservative ideology with top quality television visuals. The political ideology is talked about a lot and was driven by one man, Roger Ailes who became founding CEO of the channel in 1996. His talent for TV is mentioned less often. This piece is not about the sexual harassment allegations against Bill O'Reilly or Fox's role in putting women in overly sexual roles on air - that's the dark side of Roger Ailes' knack for producing seductive TV. A list of Trump's broken promises How much has Trump achieved so far? When I praise Fox's visuals, I'm thinking of the graphics, the maps, the movement, the speed with which they get video up on air and the relentless determination to make sure the screen didn't look dull, even for a single moment. The network was revolutionary. Yes, Fox could be lampooned for being too whiz-bang, but don't fool yourself, every other TV producer looked at what Mr Ailes was doing back in the 1990s and they were awestruck. They quickly followed suit as far as their own budgets allowed. Imitation is the highest form of flattery. Now Fox faces a different challenge, how to respond to the man in the White House, and the answer to that lies in the broader determination of what this presidency is really about. Donald Trump was elected to be a champion of the ""forgotten men and women"" of America. That was his populist promise. He would revive their economic fortunes and return power to the people. To do so, he promised to be tough on the countries that had stolen those jobs - primarily China. It was a ""currency manipulator"", he railed, which ""raped"" America, didn't play fair and should be slapped with 40% tariffs. This video can not be played Five Trump changes you may have missed In the old steel mill towns of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and even Wisconsin, they nodded with relief. Finally here was someone who said what they had been thinking for years. It was time to get bearish on Beijing. That's a pretty good example of Trumpism. Candidate Trump ignored the wise old foreign policy hands who said that this strategy was unrealistic and that it would alienate China's co-operation on other issues, namely North Korea. With the arch-populist Steve Bannon whispering in his ear, Mr Trump continued to say what the people wanted to hear, he promised not to be afraid of anyone, not to compromise on their beliefs and always to put America first. The slogans won him the White House. The Trump House in the former mining and steel town of Youngstown, Pennsylvania But once he actually got into the Oval Office and sat behind that historic desk, two things happened to undermine that commitment. First, Mr Trump realised that the world was a lot more complicated than he'd taken time as a candidate to learn. The old hands were right, he did need China to help deal with Kim Jong-un and he wouldn't get that help if he slapped them with tariffs or started a currency war. Second, his approval ratings fell, dramatically. Although Mr Trump has seen a recent uptick in his poll numbers in the past couple of weeks, he is still at historic lows. This was embarrassing to a man who routinely spent a lot of time in his campaign speeches touting his impressive poll numbers. It was also embarrassing to his family. The Trumps have built their brand on success. Failure was not a popular option in the family. Inside the White House, the president's daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared, realise that for Mr Trump to succeed, Trumpism may have to go. Or at least, be substantially sidelined. The two liberal, cosmopolitan New York Democrats had never been particularly wedded to the hellfire-and-brimstone vision of America that Steve Bannon described in the lines of Mr Trump's inaugural address. Neither of them are natural working-class populists. Posters outside the Fox News headquarters in New York City As they both formally expanded their roles and their presence in their father's administration, a shift occurred away from protecting the ideology to protecting the man. The risk for Mr Trump is thatthese policy shifts-on China, the Export Import bank, the currency,Nato- risk disappointing his base. The latest polls show Mr Trump scoring very badly on questions like ""shares my values"" or ""cares about people like me"". Many of these people really want Mr Trump to deliver on his campaign promises, not abandon them. This is where Fox News comes in. Fox did well out of the Trump campaign. It was firmly in the president's camp and his frequent interviews with the network helped drive ratings which helped drive ad revenue. Throughout the Obama years, Fox was the insurgent network of opposition. Now it needs a new role. It can be a mouthpiece of the Trump administration (though supporting the government doesn't make for the most gripping cable TV.) Or Fox can stick to its conservative roots and champion Trumpism, even when the man himself does not.

Have North Korea's missile tests paid off?,"North Korea regularly threatens to lay waste to its enemies, but how realistic are such threats? North Korea displayed a lot of missiles - including big ones - at a bombastic military parade over the weekend. But what do we really know about Pyongyang's missile capabilities? Defence expert Melissa Hanham explains. Kim Jong-unput on quite a showto mark the 105th anniversary of the birth of his grandfather Kim Il-sung, North Korea's founding leader. More new hardware was on display than ever before, including new inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). To its domestic audience, it was a demonstration of technological might and prosperity. To outsiders it was a threat: be you near or far you will eventually be in range. The Kim Jong-un years have seen increasingly frequent missile tests, all defying UN sanctions, but have they made any difference to the North's capabilities? Kim Jong-un has made himself a major presence when monitoring missile launches North Korea's ballistic missile programme grew out of one of the most widely proliferated missiles of all time: the Scud. In 1979, then Egyptian President Anwar Sadat transferred a small number of the Soviet missiles to North Korea as part of a broader agreement to co-operate on missile technology. North Korea then reverse-engineered the Scud and began producing and testing their own missiles, called Hwasong-6 and Hwasong-7. In time, they extended the range of the Scud and elongated the body to create a missile called the Nodong. Eventually, North Korea began clustering those Nodong engines to create a staged space launch vehicle called the Unha-3, a rocket capable of carrying a payload outside the earth's atmosphere. While the Scud family of missiles is not advanced, the missiles are reliable and relatively cheap to produce. The Nodong is nuclear-capable, and North Korea even exported it to Pakistan and Iran. But there were other advances to be made. North Korea's missile programme North Korea threatens new missile tests How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? More recently, North Korea reverse-engineered the Soviet R-27 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) into a road-mobile missile that could hit US forces in Guam. The missile, known as the Musudan, was displayed on military parades for years, but North Korea only started testing it in 2016. After six Musudan tests, there has only been one notable success, in June 2016. But the incremental changes between each test are interesting to note. For example, after one of the failures damaged the transporter erector launcher (TEL) truck badly, North Korea sent out the next TEL with shielding over its wheels and chassis. And, yes, this missile is probably nuclear-capable. Nearly all of North Korea's missiles are road mobile. This means North Korea can keep the missiles continuously moving around the country on TELs. These trucks can be hidden in tunnels, warehouses, bunkers and caves. Constantly moving them and hiding them makes them harder to detect. 2016 was also an important year for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. After disastrous failures in 2015, North Korea began to make some progress on a missile known as the Pukguksong. The Pukguksong, one of North Korea's submarine-launched ballistic missiles, was displayed in the military parade Using an underwater platform, North Korean engineers were previously able to achieve successful ejection of the missile but could not get the stage to light or achieve much range. After a test of a solid- (rather than liquid-) fuelled enginein April 2016, North Korea began to have increasingly successful SLBM tests. These SLBMs are not nearly as worrying as the SLBMs that the US, Russia or China possess. They will remain unreliable unless testing continues. North Korea's submarines are also loud and easy to detect. So in many ways these missiles are more for domestic ""prestige"" than military use. That being said, satellite imagery shows that North Korea is investing a lot in overhauling the submarine shipyard at Sinpo. So this is just the beginning of its programme. The KN-17 (a label assigned by the US) shown in the most recent parade is also being tested near Sinpo. This land-based anti-ship ballistic missile has had two failures so far, but its message is that US, South Korean and Japanese ships should beware. InFebruary 2017, North Korea tested a land-based version of its solid-fuelled SLBM, called the Pukguksong-2, launching it from a canister on the back of a TEL. North Korea traditionally relied on the same liquid fuel that Scuds used. This fuel is reliable and cheap, but it is corrosive and cannot be stored in the missile. This means that missile convoys have to travel with fuel and oxidizer trucks, making them larger and easier to spot from satellites. It also means the missile cannot be moved or stored while fuelled, so the launch process takes longer. This is the land-based version of the SLBM, the Pukguksong-2, tested for the first time in February 2017. The trucks are interesting - they show North Korea is starting to make its own track-based trucks because it can't get wheeled chassis into the country A truck will pull out of a tunnel, for example, erect the missile, the unit will fuel it and target it, and then launch. However, solid fuel can generally be stored in the missile, shaving valuable time off a launch in a war scenario. The parade showed that North Korea is committed to solid fuel by showing off two new possible solid fuel ICBMs in canisters. The canisters may have been empty (why load a missile if nobody's going to see it?), but it's likely that this is a design concept that will evolve over several parades and component tests. Developments since the start of 2016 have shown that North Korea is focusing not just on new missile technologies, but also on the actual deployment of the missile in the field. This is the second canister system. It is probably also a solid fuel ICBM. This truck was illicitly procured from China and made its first appearance in 2012 carrying the KN-08 missile. In September 2016, North Korea launched a volley of three ballistic missiles. In March 2017, they launched four more.  The simultaneous launch of several missiles means tracking and intercepting them is harder, and that also poses a challenge to Thaad,the controversial new ballistic missile defence system being deployed in South Korea. The question that seems to fascinate Americans the most is whether North Korea can deploy a missile to reach US shores. The main reason to have an ICBM is for a nuclear strike. There is little point in putting a conventional weapon on such a missile. North Korea has paraded ICBMs since 2012, when they revealed not only a missile known as the KN-08, but an illicitly-procured Chinese truck as a TEL. The missiles were initially criticised as ""fakes"" but over time, improvements made them credible. The latest parade appeared to show two different solid fuel ICBMs in addition to a dramatically altered KN-08. Outsiders have dismissed North Korea's ability for decades but should probably pay attention to a few key developments. In 2015, North Korea responded by introducing an ICBM known as the KN-14. In 2016, its propaganda featured images and video of essentially all the components one would need for an ICBM. First, North Korea released photos of Kim Jong-un standing between a KN-08 ICBM and a purported nuclear warhead that would fit in it. Second, North Korea simulated a heat shield test for a re-entry vehicle the same month - a key stage that distinguishes a space launch vehicle from an ICBM. An ICBM leaves the Earth's atmosphere like a space launch vehicle but must return a warhead back through the atmosphere intact, so simulation helps make sure it can withstand the heat and pressure of re-entry. In addition, North Korean engineers tested a remarkable re-engineering of the Soviet R-27 engine in order to double it and indications are that it has jumped to a more ""energetic"" fuel.  That engine test in April 2016 showed a translucent pink-purple flame rather than the yellow flame analysts are used to seeing from Scud-based engines. Kim Jong-un was shown apparently inspecting a warhead shield after a simulated re-entry test If the flame colour does indicate more energetic fuel, then this ICBM puts not just Alaska and Hawaii at risk, but London and Washington DC too - by using a better fuel they can throw more weight farther. So when will North Korea actually test an ICBM? The answer to that is, when it is good and ready to. The two new solid fuel ICBMs seen on the parade are years away from testing. Buthigh-level UK embassy defector Thae Yong-hosaid Pyongyang aims to complete the development of one ICBM by the end of 2017 or early 2018. Testing and ""completing"" are two different things. It seems likely North Korea will test the liquid fuelled KN-08 ICBM in this time frame since it is apparently closest to completion. But it is also likely that it will fail multiple times before it can be deployed.

What exactly are 'Australian values'?,"Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (left) initially struggled to define Australian values Australia unveiled significant changes to its citizenship process on Thursday, flagging - among several changes - new tests on English language and ""Australian values"". Thenew requirementswould put ""Australian values at the heart of citizenship processes"", the government said. But as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull explained the system, social media observers were keen to interrogate an obvious question. That question appeared to trouble even Mr Turnbull, when a reporter asked him to provide a summary. ""What we willâ¦ the answer is yes, but the discussion paper that [the immigration] department has released is going to engage public discussion on this,"" he said. After some further comments, he said: ""Australians have an enormous reservoir of good sense, and we know that our values of mutual respect, democracy, freedom, rule of law, those values, a fair go - these they are fundamental Australian values."" Despite his clarification, Mr Turnbull's response drew rapid criticism from political commentators.""Wow... doesn't answer,"",externalsaid one; another dubbed the briefing""surreal"",external; a third suggested Mr Turnbull was in""full gibbering mode"",external. Sharing comments on a hashtag #AustralianValues, many people were quick to offer amusing alternatives. Some joked that sporting fanscomplaining about,externalrising match costs demonstrated ""Australian values"", while others poked fun at Australians'use of languageand skillat making coffee. Others took aim at politicians including one who resigned overan expenses scandalinvolving a chartered helicopter. Some used it to protest government policy over theailing Great Barrier Reef, or Australia's tough policy of offshore detentionfor asylum seekers. There was also criticism of Australia'ssoaring house prices, a topic of much national discussion in recent weeks. Others suggested that ""Australian values"" as a solitary concept would not necessarily result in wise policy. Criticism included comparisons to last century'sWhite Australia policy, when Australia took migrants from only certain countries, and theStolen Generations,external, when Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families. That may be difficult to immediately assess, given the specifics of the new test are not fully known. However, although the opposition accused Mr Turnbull of playing domestic politics, it did agree some of his ideas were worthwhile. ""I think it is reasonable to look for English language proficiency and I think it is reasonable to have some period of time before you become an Australian citizen,"" said opposition leader Bill Shorten. Citizenship to require years of residency Australia tightens working visa scheme Mr Turnbull's linking of Australian values to gender equality, and preventing domestic violence, also drew praise. ""The Prime Minister is on the right track defending the fundamental right of every woman and child to live free from violence and domestic abuse,"" said Libby Davies, the CEO of anti-domestic violence group White Ribbon.

Why an American went to Cuba for cancer care,"Cuba has faced more than 50 years of US sanctions. Now, for the first time, a unique drug developed on the communist island is being tested in New York state. But some American cancer patients are already taking it - by defying the embargo and flying to Havana for treatment. Judy Ingels and her family are in Cuba for just six days.  They have time to go sightseeing and try out the local cuisine. Judy, a keen photographer, enjoys capturing the colonial architecture of Old Havana. And while she is in the country, Ingels, 74, will have her first injections of Cimavax, a drug shown in Cuban trials to extend the lives of lung cancer patients by months, and sometimes years. By travelling to Havana from her home in California, she is breaking the law. The US embargo against Cuba has been in place for more than five decades, and though relations thawed under President Obama, seeking medical treatment in Cuba is still not allowed for US citizens. ""I'm not worried,"" Ingels says.  ""For the first time I have real hope."" She has stage four lung cancer and was diagnosed in December 2015. ""My oncologist in the United States says I'm his best patient, but I have this deadly disease."" He does not know she is in Cuba.  When she asked him about Cimavax, he had not heard of it. ""But we've done a lot of research - I've read good things,"" Ingels says. Since January, Cimavax has been tested on patients in Buffalo, New York state, but it isn't yet available in the US. Ingels, her husband Bill and daughter Cindy are staying at the La Pradera International Health Centre, west of Havana. It treats mostly foreign, paying patients like Ingels, and with its pool complex, palm trees and open walkways, La Pradera feels more like a tropical hotel than a hospital. This trip from their home in California, together with a supply of Cimavax to take back to the US, will cost the Ingels family more than $15,000 (Â£12,000). Cimavax fights cancer by stimulating an immune response against a protein in the blood that triggers the growth of lung cancer.  After an induction period, patients receive a monthly dose by injection. It's a product of Cuba's biotechnology industry, nurtured by former President Fidel Castro since the early 1980s. Ironically, Cuba's biotech innovations can partly be explained by the US embargo - something Castro continually railed against. It meant Cuba had to produce the drugs it could not access or afford.  And medications like Cimavax - low-tech products that could be administered in a rural setting - were developed to fit the Cuban context. This video can not be played Cuban cancer drug CIMAvax is bringing hope to US patients in the first collaboration of its kind Now the industry employs around 22,000 scientists, technicians and engineers, and sells drugs in many parts of the world - but not in the US. And although the Cubans will not reveal the cost of producing Cimavax, it is cheaper than other treatments. For Cuba's residents, all health care is free. One beneficiary is Lucrecia de Jesus Rubillo, 65, who lives on the fifth floor of a block of flats in the east of Havana Last September she was given two or three months to live. What began as pain in Lucrecia's leg, was diagnosed as stage-four lung cancer that had spread. She had chemotherapy. ""That was really very hard,"" she says.  ""It gave me nausea, and it hurt.  But my kids asked me to fight, so I did."" After radiotherapy, Lucrecia began Cimavax injections.  Now she is strong enough to walk up the five flights of stairs to her home, and her persistent cough has diminished. She feels better, more hopeful, and is thinking about what to do next. ""Perhaps I'll go to Spain to visit my kid,"" she says. ""I feel happy, and I'm still dreaming of the future, but I also feel sadness.  I've had a lot of friends who've died of cancer, and they never had the chance I'm having with these injections.  I feel privileged."" Her doctor is Elia Neninger, an oncologist at the Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital in Havana. Neninger is one of the principal clinicians to trial Cimavax on patients since the 1990s. ""Lucrecia arrived incapacitated by her disease in a wheelchair,"" Neninger remembers. ""Now the tumour on her lung has disappeared, and the lesions on her liver aren't there either. With Cimavax, she's in a maintenance phase."" In Cuba, specialists like Neninger do not talk about curing cancer - they talk about controlling it and transforming it into a chronic disease. She has treated hundreds of patients with Cimavax. ""I never thought I'd work on something that would improve the lives of so many people,"" she says. ""I have stage-four lung cancer patients who are still alive 10 years after their diagnosis."" But mostly Cimavax is proven to extend life for months, not years.  And it does not help everyone. In trials, around 20% of patients haven't responded, Neninger says, often because the disease is very advanced, or they have associated illnesses that make treatment more difficult. Nonetheless, Dr Kelvin Lee is impressed.  He is the Chair of Immunology at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, where the American trials of Cimavax are taking place. It is the first time a Cuban medication has been trialled in the US, and required special permission because the embargo prohibits most collaboration and trade. Cancer immunotherapy is getting more expensive in the US, Lee says. A cheap vaccine that can be administered at primary care level is very attractive.  And he thinks it is possible that Cimavax could be used to prevent lung cancer, too. ""If we could vaccinate the high-risk smokers to prevent them from developing lung cancer, that would have an enormous public health impact both in the United States and worldwide."" This has not been proven, however, and the initial US trials of Cimavax only began in January. There is political uncertainty, too. On the campaign trail before his election, President Trump said he would reverse the thaw with Cuba that began under the Obama administration, unless there was change on the island, which is governed as a one-party state. ""Our demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people, and the freeing of political prisoners,"" Trump said on the campaign trail in Miami. So far, Cuba has not made it to the top of his in-tray.  There is a large constituency of Americans who believe that Cuba does not deserve the kind of recognition and status the association with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute brings. Listen to Cuba's Cancer Revolution on BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents at 11:00 on Thursday 20 April - orcatch up again on iPlayer The programme can also he heard onAssignment on BBC World Service But Lee thinks political arguments against US-Cuba collaboration are misplaced. ""The gas we put in our cars, the iPhones we tweet from, the shoes we buy our kids - all come from countries that the United States has fundamental differences with regarding women's rights, freedom of speech, personal liberties.  Yet that has never stopped us from working with them in areas that benefit the people in both countries."" For now Bill Ingels, Judy's husband, isn't worried about falling foul of US authorities. ""I told them I was coming for educational purposes,"" he says.  ""And I am learning about cancer and medication!  I'm basically a very honest person, but if I have to, I will lie."" Ingels will not know if the vaccine has made a difference until she has a scan in three months. ""We feel pretty positive, and we thought this would be a great experience and journey for my family to take together. It's the first time I've felt up since I was diagnosed."" Cindy Ingels, Judy's daughter, is a nurse - she will administer the Cimavax shots to her mother back home in California. ""Even if she remains stable - that it maintains the tumour size, and it doesn't worsen - we'd be happy with that,"" she says.  ""If the tumour decreases from what it is now, that would really be a miracle."" Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

Why you need to question your hippo boss,"Is the hippo in your workforce too dominating? As Richard sat in an important meeting at work, he and his colleagues nervously considered the hippo in the room. Richard, who works for a TV production company in Toronto, was attending a key meeting to discuss future projects. And the hippo was dominating proceedings far too much. Thankfully for the firm's health and safety considerations, there wasn't actually a large semi-aquatic mammal in the room with them. Instead this ""hippo"" was an acronym for ""the highest paid person's opinion"", and the other attendees were too scared to question its wisdom. ""I can recall meetings where people are brainstorming, throwing around ideas, and ultimately going with what the boss came up with on a whim,"" says Richard, 34, who did not want us to use his surname. Some bosses can be difficult to argue with ""You kind of see all the subordinates in the room glancing at each other defeated, [their faces] saying, 'are we really going ahead with this?'"" Most of us have had to work for an overly dominating hippo at some time in our careers - a boss who staff feel unable to criticise, or whose every idea employees feel they have to praise. But how often is the unchallenged boss's decision correct? Far from all the time if astudy,externalby the Rotterdam School of Management is to be believed. The report found that projects led by junior managers were more likely to be successful than those that had a senior boss in charge, because other employees felt far more able to voice their opinions and give critical feedback. Balazs Szatmari, the lead author of the study, says: ""The surprising thing in our findings is that high-status project leaders fail more often. ""I believe that this happens not despite the unconditional support they get, but actually because of it."" Balazs Szatmari says staff often feel unable to question their senior bosses Mr Szatmari, who looked at 349 projects in the video games industry dating back to 1972, says that staff were likely to fear ""the possible consequences of criticising the work of high-status employees"". Short of senior bosses not allowing themselves to do much at work, what is the solution? Sarah Biggerstaff, a lecturer in leadership at Yale School of Management in Connecticut, says that companies simply have to work hard to allow staff to question their senior bosses' decisions without any fear of reprisal. ""It can be challenging to give feedback if there is a culture of fear around the office,"" she says. ""In that kind of organisation, if you don't go with the flow you won't get promoted. Or what's happened historically is that people pay lip service to executives instead of giving them constructive feedback in order to toe the line."" Sarah Biggerstaff says firms need to create a culture where senior bosses can be questioned James Farrow, founding director of UK management consultancy Curium Solutions, agrees that senior managers should encourage staff to question their decisions and then ""acknowledge the different perspective, and not leap... to disprove their viewpoint"". He adds that senior figures should ""never ridicule or push back strongly in large groups, so that people feel safe voicing their views"". Brian Morgan, professor of entrepreneurship at Cardiff Metropolitan University, says there are numerous examples of bad business decisions that may have been prevented if senior bosses had been more willing to accept a collective approach to decision making. ""The recent whistleblowingcontroversyat UK bank Barclays has brought into sharp focus the importance of creating a corporate culture of openness, where employees feel confident to speak candidly about some of the issues facing the business,"" he says. Prof Morgan adds that Royal Bank of Scotland'sill-fateddecision to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007 for Â£50bn may also have been avoided if middle managers at RBS had been given more of a say. Barclays boss Jes Staley was recently criticised for trying to uncover a whistleblower US computer group Cisco Systems has had a formalfeedback system,externalin place for a number of years to prevent senior figures making decisions in isolation. Cassandra Frangos, vice president for global executive talent and organisational development at Cisco, says that in one incident it was reported that an executive ""was distant and defensive, and that he didn't partner on key business decisions"". ""The feedback was instantly eye-opening for the executive,"" she says. Mr Szatmari's suggested solution to the problem is for the leader of any new project to be kept secret, thereby encouraging junior managers to be more willing to put across their honest opinions. He says such a ""blind review process"" would work best in a large business, and ""offer an opportunity for leaders to learn from their staff, and to engage in the type of meaningful dialogue every company should have"". Back in Toronto, Richard says he remembers one project in particular that a former hippo pushed through. ""One idea, an animated, musical web series never really went anywhere commercially, and deep down it was what we all expected.""

General election: What you need to know,"The UK will have a general election on 8 June. Here's what you need to know. Ask a questionâ¼ Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  A general election is how the British public decide who they want to represent them in Parliament and, ultimately, run the country. Everyone who is eligible - and registered (see below) - gets to vote for one candidate to represent their local area, which is known in Parliament as a constituency. The candidates standing for election aare usually drawn from political parties, but can also stand as independents. The person with the most votes in a constituency is elected as its MP, to represent that area in the House of Commons. The leader of the political party with the most MPs after the election is expected to be asked by the Queen to become prime minister and form a government to run the country. The leader of the political party with the second highest number of MPs normally becomes leader of the opposition. Once elected, MPs work both in your area - or their constituency - dealing with local matters, and in Parliament, where they vote and help shape law, alongside 649 other MPs. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called a general election on 8 June - three years earlier than scheduled. Mrs May's official reason for holding an election was to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations. She claimed Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems would try to destabilise and frustrate the process in Parliament. But Mrs May's Conservative Party has a big opinion poll lead over Labour so she will be hoping the election will see her getting a bigger majority in the House of Commons, tightening her grip on power. As things stand, it does not take many Conservative MPs to decide they don't like something the government is doing to get it derailed. Mrs May is also tied to the promises made by the Conservatives at the 2015 election, when David Cameron was prime minister. She has made a few changes - such as backing grammar schools and easing plans to reduce the deficit - but an election gives her the chance to set out her own vision for Britain. Find out the latest picture with theBBC's poll tracker. The latest polls have shown the Conservatives ahead, but that their longstanding lead over Labour has narrowed. The early signs that 2017 will be a tactical election The seats that could decide the election Election 2017 poll tracker: How the parties compare The Conservatives publishedtheir manifesto,externalon 18 May with Theresa May promising a ""mainstream government that will deliver for mainstream Britain"".

Basically, if you're aged 18 or over on election day, registered to vote and a British citizen you can vote. Citizens of the Republic of Ireland resident in the UK and citizens ofqualifying Commonwealth states,externalresident in the UK can also vote if they are over 18 and registered to vote. British citizens living abroad can vote if they have been registered to vote in the UK in the past 15 years, although the deadline to apply to register now passed, as has the postal vote application deadline. People who will be temporarily abroad can vote by post (although it's too late to apply for a postal vote) or byproxy,external, which means getting someone else to vote for you. It's too late to register to vote in the general election on 8 June. You can register to vote in future electionsonline,external. It's now too late to apply for a postal vote. If you have already applied, post your completed ballot paper and voting statement back as soon as possible so they arrive in time. Alternatively, forms can be handed into your local polling station by 22:00 BST on polling day. Students may be registered at both their home address, and at a university or college address. It all depends whether you spend an equal amount of time at each and, ultimately, the electoral registration officer will decide whether or not someone can register at both. At the general election, it is an offence to vote more than once. Anyone who has moved since they last voted, must register at their new address - paying council tax does not mean you are registered to vote. If you did not re-register in time, you may be able to still vote at the address you originally registered at. If this is too far away, you can always arrange a proxy vote. You can vote either by post or by proxy - which is where you appoint someone else to register your vote on your behalf. To do that you candownload the form here,external.

Theresa May had said she wanted to wait until 2020 for the next scheduled election but changed her mind, in a move that took everyone by surprise. Prime ministers used to be free to hold an election whenever they felt like it - but under the 2011 Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a general election is supposed to take place every five years on the first Thursday in May, which is why the next one was scheduled for May 2020. But an election can be called ahead of schedule for two reasons - if there is a vote of ""no confidence"" in the current government, or if MPs vote for an early election by a two-thirds majority. Mrs May chose the second option, which was overwhelmingly backed by MPs, by 522 votes to 13. You have to go back to 1966 and Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson for the last example of a government holding an election after a short time in power to increase its number of MPs. In 1974, there were two elections eight months apart - but that was under different circumstances because no party won a majority in the Commons in the first one. UK snap election: Five things you need to know A 2017 general election means that the subsequent election is now due in 2022. That's because the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, which decrees that elections take place every five years, is still in force. But an election could be held at any time if two-thirds of MPs vote for it, as they did this time. A future government could also decide to scrap the Fixed Term Parliaments Act - the Conservative manifesto includes plans to do so. Parliament broke up on 3 May to allow just over a month of full-pelt campaigning ahead of 8 June. The general election didn't stop voting taking place in 34 local council areas in England, all 32 councils in Scotland and all 22 councils in Wales on 4 May. The Conservatives gained control of 11 councils and Labour lost seven, with UKIP losing the 145 council seats it had been defending, and gaining just one. In addition, six areas in England voted for newly-created ""combined local authority mayors"". The Conservatives won four mayoral races and Labour two. The Manchester Gorton by-election, caused by the death of Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, had been due to take place on 4 May but will now be held at the same time as the general election on 8 June. Britain is still on course to officially leave the European Union on Friday 29 March 2019. Negotiations with other EU nations are not due to start until June, meaning the election will probably be over and a new government in place before any serious talking gets under way in Brussels. The Conservative Party says this is a ""one-off chance to hold an election while the European Union agrees its negotiating position"". If Mrs May wins by a big margin in the UK, she will see it as a vote of confidence in her strategy for leaving the EU. But if her slender House of Commons majority is cut further or she loses the election - with anti-Brexit parties such as the Liberal Democrats getting many more MPs - then the UK's current Brexit strategy will be up for grabs. There's a summary ofwhere Britain's parties stand on Brexit, if you'd like to read it. There are lots of opinion polls carried out in the run-up to a general election. Their methods vary but they usually survey the views of at least 1,000 people to find which political party is likely to get most votes. They give each party a percentage rating based on how many people said they would vote for them. A poll tracker amalgamates the results of several opinion polls to try to get as clear a picture as possible. TheBBC tracker, for example, takes the results of the latest seven opinion polls, on a rolling basis, and works out the median (middle) rating for each party. When you hear someone talking about one party having a poll lead over another - they are talking about the gap between the percentage ratings of the parties in the latest poll or set of polls. The opinion polls were wrong about the 2015 general election and the industry has yet to fully fix the problems that caused those inaccuracies. So they should be taken with a pinch of salt. But the gap between Labour and the Conservatives in the polls leading up to the 2015 election was between 0% and 6%, and in the end the Conservatives did better than polls suggested. The Conservatives have a bigger lead than that now, although it has narrowed recently. It's not a straightforward process to work it out. Many Labour MPs have ""safe"" seats - they got thousands more votes than their nearest rivals in 2015, meaning they could lose votes and still retain their place in the Commons. The Conservatives have fewer ""safe"" seats than Labour. They pulled off their surprise 2015 general election victory by winning seats just where they needed them, such as in previously Liberal Democrat-held constituencies in the south-west of England. The danger for Labour is that it piles up votes in seats it already holds - something that happened in 2015 - rather than in areas represented by rival parties. This makes it harder for it to suffer large-scale losses, but it also makes it relatively harder for it to make big gains. No. They were not due to be introduced until 2020.A public consultation is under waywith final proposals set to be made in 2018. The main parties faced a race against time to get candidates in place and some streamlined their normal selection procedures, with more candidates chosen centrally. Some 68 parties and 191 independent candidates contribute to a total of 3,304 people standing for Parliament this year - a decrease of 664 from 2015. Find your constituency and candidates A-Z constituency guide Oh yes - it's proved a good chance for people to get out, or try to return to, frontline politics. Some of the big names stepping down include former Conservative chancellor George Osborne - who is now editing the London Evening Standard newspaper - and ex-party chairman Sir Eric Pickles. Labour's Alan Johnson is retiring, and former health secretary Andy Burnham will not stand after becoming Mayor of Greater Manchester. Some former MPs are aiming to get back, though - including former Lib Dem ministers Sir Vince Cable and Ed Davey. And others are throwing their hat into the ring for the first time, including blogger Jack Monroe - who is campaigning over the NHS - while UKIP's Paul Nuttall is among his party's best known hopefuls. The Conservatives have 330 seats, Labour 229, the SNP 54, the Lib Dems nine and Plaid Cymru three. The Green Party has one MP. UKIP have no MPs after their sole representative left the party and became an independent. For Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party have eight MPs; Sinn Fein, who don't take up their seats, four; the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) three; and the Ulster Unionist Party two. Five MPs sit as independents.

Laura Kuenssberg: May sets out her stall,"At the moment (although we know Theresa May is very capable of changing her mind) there won't be head to head TV clashes between the PM and Jeremy Corbyn - or the PM and Nicola Sturgeon, or the PM with anyone else for that matter. One, the Tory leader is no fan of the glitz of the TV studio. That's one reason why Number 10 is adamant that she will not take part in TV debates. But two - it's not just down to her very different style, but also, as David Cameron learnt very quickly, front runners in any campaign have everything to lose in those debates, and the underdogs have everything to gain. Downing Street knows they will take a certain amount of flak for the decision not to play ball, and the opposition parties are of course relishing every opportunity to say that the PM is too frightened to defend her record. But right now Mrs May's allies are willing to wear it, rather than broker the risk of taking part, even if the broadcasters go ahead with the programmes without her. What will you hear a lot of from the Tory leader? Well if her very first campaign visit is anything to go by, David Cameron and George Osborne's ""long-term economic plan"" mantra will be replaced by the phrase ""strong and stable"". On the stump you'd be forgiven for losing count of the number of times she used the phrase. One totting-up puts it at 13 mentions. Brexit has undoubtedly set the backdrop for this election, and provided the catalyst for its timing. But the Conservatives plan to win to deliver their version of Brexit by again and again comparing what they claim is the ""strong and stable"" leadership provided by the sitting prime minister, and the alternative put forward by Jeremy Corbyn. Tomorrow he'll make his first big election speech, his first big chance to recast that argument. Brexit triggered: What happens now?

How to vote in the June election,"Theresa May has announceda ""snap"" general electionto take place in seven weeks. The prime minister says she wants MPs to come together in the way she says the British public has since the Brexit vote. There are roughly 750,000 people who will be able to vote for the first time in their lives on 8 June. That's the number of British citizens who have turned 18 since the last election in 2015. This page explains what else you need to do to cast your vote. The government's website promises it will only take five minutes to answer the questions that allow you to be added to the electoral register. You cannot vote unless you're on this database. Click here to register.,external You will be asked for basic things like your address, nationality and National Insurance number when you register Once registered, you'll get a polling card in the post in the days before voting day. This will tell you where to go on 8 June and what time your local polling station will be open. It's normally 7am until 10pm. You still get a vote, so long as you register in time. The Electoral Commission says the deadline to register is 22 May. Although it's too late to register to vote in the local elections on 4 May. This is not like the US election, where voters directly pick their preferred candidate for president. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Tim Farron of the Liberal Democrats will take on Theresa May's Conservatives Britain's parliamentary system means you choose your local MP, who represents a political party. That means there are 650 individual elections taking place on a single day, across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. If one party is able to win more than half the seats in the House of Commons (326) then its leader gets to become prime minister and form a government. Then you'll probably have to wait until 2022 to have another say in who runs the country, unless there is another snap election before then. General elections usually occur every five years.

Could election improve UKâs Brexit position?,"The claim:The prime minister justified calling an early election on the basis that it would strengthen her position in the Brexit negotiations. Reality Check verdict:If she won, a larger majority would give her more flexibility to chart her own Brexit course at home and not having another election until 2022 would be advantageous. But it wouldn't necessarily strengthen her hand in negotiations with the rest of the EU. Theresa May told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she had called the snap election because she believed it would put her in a stronger position as she starts to negotiate the UK's exit from the EU. Would she be in a stronger position domestically? If she won, a bigger majority would reduce the chances of a rebellion, either from Remain supporters or from those who advocate a more hardline Brexit. Of course, if the new Parliament has a greater number of ardent Remain supporters or she has a smaller majority or loses, that would be a different matter. Would a bigger majority in the UK Parliament strengthen her hand with the EU? It certainly wouldn't weaken it, but winning an election doesn't automatically give you more leverage in negotiations with the EU. Consider the case of Alexis Tsipras in Greece, who swept to power promising to end austerity and renegotiate Greece's bailout programme. He couldn't deliver because the rest of the EU refused to change course. EU negotiators would actually welcome a UK government with a larger majority because they believe it would make negotiations more secure and be the best guarantee of avoiding last-minute complications. But the biggest impact of an early election could be on what happens after March 2019, when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. The prime minister told the Today programme: ""If you look at the timetable, had the election been in 2020 we would have been coming up to the most crucial part of the negotiations - in what would have started to be the run-up to a general election."" In other words, an election in 2020 would take place during a transition period (the government prefers the term ""implementation phase"") at a time when we could - in effect - be half in and half out of the EU, during a transition period. Delaying the election means there would be less political pressure during that transition - when the UK would have to make compromises on issues such as free movement of people, budget payments and the role of the European Court of Justice. To put it another way, holding an election now, and then another in June 2022, means in theory that a prime minister would have two years of Article 50 negotiations and then another three years of transition arrangements before they would have to go back to the country to let voters  give their verdict on whether they had done a good job.
