"Sort it out or step aside, Tory donor tells PM","John Caudwell donated Â£500,000 to the Conservatives before the last election A major Conservative donor has issued an ultimatum to Boris Johnson over revelations about lockdown parties in Downing Street. John Caudwell said: ""Sort it out, Boris, or step aside and let someone else sort it out so that the Tories aren't wiped out at the next election."" The Phones4U founder donated Â£500,000 to the Conservatives ahead of the 2019 general election. He criticised the government's perceived ""arrogance and hypocrisy"". PM can't hide from party allegations, says Labour No 10 staff had to block Downing Street parties What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Billionaire Caudwell goes head-to-head with Labour's John McDonnell Mr Caudwell was one of the Conservative Party's biggest individual donors at the last general election, and has previously given money to pro-Brexit Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. He told BBC News: ""Although I have always obeyed the rules I have never been puritanical about lockdown restrictions so I find it difficult to personally get excited about an outdoor drinks party. But it's the perceived arrogance, hypocrisy and rule breaking that is impossible to justify. ""While the rest of us were striving to follow the ever-changing rules - including myself, even when I deemed them to be excessive at best, nonsensical at worst - those who were setting those rules were, apparently freely and frequently, disregarding them. ""Each one of these new revelations gives greater force to the accusation that areas of the government think it's 'one rule for them, one rule for the rest of us'. ""This is disastrous."" He added that he was not a ""dyed-in-the-wool Tory"" and had been critical of the government's economic recovery plans, urging more investment in apprenticeships and renewable energy. But he added: ""I do think the Conservatives are the best party to govern this country, particularly as we look to navigate opportunities post-Brexit. ""Sort it out, Boris, or step aside and let someone else sort it out so that the Tories aren't wiped out at the next election."" Alasdair Locke, who has donated Â£280,000 to the Conservative Party since Mr Johnson came to power, said the lockdown parties were ""something the media is making a great deal of"" and voters would be concerned with ""serious stuff"" at the next election. ""I really don't think a leadership change, or challenge, is needed at this stage. A bit more grip would help but that will probably come."" The prime minister is under growing pressure from Labour - and anger from some Conservatives - over his alleged attendance at a previously unreported Downing Street party. It comes after ITV published a leaked email from the PM's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting 100 staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" on 20 May 2020. The invitation for the event, which was organised when strict lockdown rules were still in place, encouraged people to ""bring your own booze"" and ""make the most of the lovely weather"". Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife had been among about 30 people who attended the gathering. But Mr Johnson has declined to say whether he was one of them. The PM's official spokesman also refused to comment on the claims while the investigation was taking place, but he added that the prime minister retained full confidence in Mr Reynolds. Senior civil servant Sue Gray is investigating lockdown parties in Downing Street, including the event on 20 May 2020, and is expected to report shortly.

Sacked belly-dancing teacher sparks Egypt debate,"Aya Youssef said she had returned to work as a teacher on Tuesday In Egypt, a viral video of a teacher belly-dancing has sparked a national debate about women's rights and the country's socially conservative values. Aya Yousef was sacked, and divorced by her husband, after she was filmed by a colleague at a work social event on a Nile boat without her permission. Footage shows her moving to the music alongside male teaching staff. Belly-dancing is said to date back to Pharaonic times but it is often frowned upon now for women to dance in public. The video of Ms Yousef, who is wearing a headscarf and a long-sleeved dress for the daytime river trip, looks very tame by Western standards. Two held in Egypt amid outrage over teen's suicide CitroÃ«n pulls ad accused of normalising harassment Egypt detains female TikTok star after conviction However, as it was widely shared on Arab social media in the past week, it prompted an outcry among Egyptian conservatives. Her critics claimed she had acted shamefully: ""It clearly expresses the poor times we live in!! Anything is permitted,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""Education has reached a low level in Egypt,"" another commented, calling for intervention by the relevant authorities. Ms Yousef was then sacked by the primary school in Dakahlia Governorate in the Nile Delta, where she had worked for several years teaching Arabic. She has vowed she will never dance again and said that she had contemplated suicide during her recent ordeal. ""Ten minutes on the boat in the Nile cost me my life,"" she told journalists. This video can not be played Five Egyptian women shared their stories of sexual harassment and abuse with BBC Arabic (October 2018) Women's rights advocates in Egypt also spoke out strongly, insisting the teacher did nothing wrong and saying that she was the victim of a witch hunt. In her support and in defence of personal freedoms, the deputy head of another school posted photographs on social media of herself dancing at her daughter's wedding. The head of the Egyptian Centre for Women's Rights, Dr Nihad Abu Qumsan, offered Ms Yousef a job in her office and asked her to bring her contract from the education ministry in order to file a legal complaint against her dismissal. This may have helped prompt a rethink. Local authorities have now appointed Ms Yousef to a position at a new school. The teacher complained the affair was ""a transgression of [her] privacy"". She pointed out that she did not dance at a public institution or in front of students and said she planned to sue the person who filmed the video last month.

Quebec to impose health tax on unvaccinated,"The Canadian province of Quebec will charge a health tax to residents who are not vaccinated against Covid-19. Quebec, which has seen the highest number of Covid-related deaths in Canada, is currently struggling with a  surge in cases. On Tuesday, the premier announced that it would be the first in the nation to financially penalise the unvaccinated. Only about 12.8% of Quebec residents are not vaccinated, but they make up nearly a third of all hospital cases. According to federal data, just over 85% of Quebec residents had received at least one vaccine dose by 1 January. Premier Francois Legault said during a news conference that people who have not received their first dose of vaccine will have to pay a ""contribution"". The fee has not yet been decided, but will be ""significant"", he said. ""I think right now it's a question of fairness for the 90% of the population who made some sacrifices,"" Mr Legault said. ""I think we owe them this kind of measure."" Last week, the province announced that it would require proof of vaccination to shop in government cannabis and liquor stores. A curfew is also in place, the second one of the pandemic, running from 22:00 to 05:00 each day. On Tuesday, Quebec's death toll from Covid reached 12,028. It comes after 62 deaths were recorded in the previous 24-hour period. The daily figure represents a similar rate to January 2021, before widespread vaccinations had begun in the province. The percentage of Covid patients in intensive care who have not been vaccinated is 45%, provincial data shows. The premier's press conference was attended by his interim public health director, who took over after the long-serving previous director resigned over criticism of his handling of the latest Omicron-driven surge. Hospitals in Montreal, the province's largest city, are nearing 100% capacity and have already started limiting non-Covid related care. Over 200 members of the city's unhoused population have also tested positive, indicating an outbreak. It comes amid a severe cold snap, which is overwhelming shelters. Quebec reported 8,710 new cases on Tuesday. The figure represents a 20% positivity rate. There are currently 2,742 Covid patients in Quebec hospitals, including 244 in intensive care. While rare, Quebec is not the only region in the world seeking to impose a financial penalty on those unwilling to get jabbed. Starting later this month, Greeks over age 60 are being required to pay a â¬100 (Â£85; C$142; $113) fine for each month that they remain unvaccinated. Singapore has required Covid patients to pay for their own medical bills if they are not vaccinated.

Charles commissions Holocaust survivor portraits,"Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who played in the prisoners' orchestra at Auschwitz, is among those being painted The Prince of Wales has commissioned seven artists to paint portraits of seven Holocaust survivors, in a tribute to their passing generation. ""As the number of Holocaust survivors sadly but inevitably declines, my abiding hope is that this special collection will act as a further guiding light,"" Prince Charles said. The paintings will be put on public display in Buckingham Palace. And the art project will feature in a BBC Two documentary later this month. As well as providing a reminder of ""history's darkest days"", Prince Charles said the portraits would show ""humanity's interconnectedness, as we strive to create a better world for our children, grandchildren and generations as yet unborn - one where hope is victorious over despair and love triumphs over hate"". Helen Aronson, 94, survived the Lodz ghetto The documentary will feature the survivors' accounts of what the Nazis did to them and their Jewish families. Many are now over 90, having been in concentration camps as children and then spent much of their adult lives in Britain. Paul Benney has painted Helen Aronson, 94, who survived the incarceration of Jewish people in the Lodz ghetto, in Nazi-occupied Poland. Prince Charles wants the paintings to show ""hope is victorious over despair"" Peter Kuhfeld has painted Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, 96, a musician from a German Jewish family who played in an orchestra of inmates in the Auschwitz concentration camp, also in Nazi-occupied Poland, and was later held at Bergen-Belsen, in Germany. The other paintings are by Ishbel Myerscough, Clara Drummond, Massimiliano Pironti, Stuart Pearson Wright and Jenny Saville. Prince Charles's intolerance warning at Auschwitz anniversary Last witnesses of the Holocaust share their memories Parents who saved their child by giving her away Holocaust Educational Trust chief executive Karen Pollock said:  ""Holocaust survivors endured the very worst. ""To survive the concentration and death camps and 77 years later see their portraits displayed in Buckingham Palace is very special indeed and a poignant and fitting testament to their lasting contribution to this country."" Prince Charles has made a personal cause of promoting tolerance and building bridges between religions and has often warned against the dangers of extremism and persecution. And in a speech marking the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, he said the lessons of the Holocaust were still ""searingly relevant"". Survivors: Portraits of the Holocaust is on BBC Two at 21:00 on 27 January, marking Holocaust Memorial Day. The paintings will be at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, between 27 January and 13 February, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh, from 17 March to 6 June.

100 invited to Downing Street lockdown drinks,"As many as 100 people were invited to a ""bring-your-own-booze"" drinks event in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown, it is understood. Witnesses have told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended the gathering on 20 May 2020. But Boris Johnson has declined to say whether he was among those there. The Metropolitan Police said it was in contact with the government over ""widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches"" of Covid rules. Labour has been granted an urgent question in the Commons at 12:30 GMT to push for answers from a minister. The party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said the prime minister needed to ""come clean"" about the gathering. Addressing Mr Johnson on Twitter, he added: ""Your deflections and distractions are absurd. Not only did you know about the parties in Downing Street, you attended them. ""Stop lying to the British public."" Laura Kuenssberg analysis: No escape for No 10 The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Anemail, revealed by ITV News,,externalinvited people to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"". It was sent when lockdown restrictions were still in place. Twelve days later - on 1 June - rules in England were relaxed to allow groups of up to six people to meet outside. Health Minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he understood the ""anger, sadness and upset many will feel about these allegations"". But he said it was ""important"" to allow an investigation to take place into gatherings in Downing Street before coming to any conclusions. However, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the BBC the PM did not need to wait for an inquiry to answer whether he attended. ""I can't understand if the prime minister attended why on earth he thought that was the right thing to do,"" she added. ""People are furious about this, what they gave up, how difficult it was, what happened to their own lives, and to think that this was going on? It is indefensible, it cannot be defended."" This video can not be played Watch former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson call the No 10 party ""indefensible"" Downing Street declined to comment as it said the gathering - like others reported to have happened under coronavirus restrictions during 2020 - is now being looked into as part of an ongoing independent investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray. A Met spokesperson said the force was ""aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on 20 May 2020 and is in contact with the Cabinet Office"", which oversees government policy. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister ""cannot run and cannot hide"" from the allegations. He added: ""It speaks to a rotten culture at the heart of this government and the rotten culture begins with the person in charge."" Hannah Brady said her father's death certificate had been signed on the same day the drinks took place The Wednesday 20 May gathering first came to light last week ina blog,externalby the PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings. ITV News has now published what appears to be the full email invitation sent on behalf of Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. It has the subject line ""Socially Distanced Drinks! [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE-No 10 ONLY]"". ""After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening,"" the email says. ""Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze."" Two eyewitnesses have told the BBC they saw Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie at the event in the garden. And sources have said that several Downing Street members of staff voiced concerns about drinks happening, with one claiming: ""There were conversations about the email being really unwise."" Another added: ""I remember people saying, 'What the hell?'"" Others said a long table had been set up in the garden for the event. A message sent by one Downing Street staffer to another at the time, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin (Reynolds) encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Another asked: ""Is this for real?"" In a Twitter post on the day of the gathering, when it was 25C (77F) in London, the Metropolitan Police reminded people they could only relax or exercise outside on their own, with their own household or one person from another household.

On the same day as the gathering, the then Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, gave theDowning Street coronavirus briefing,external- in which he confirmedanother 363 people,externalin the UK had died with Covid in the previous 24 hours. At the briefing, he told the public: ""You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay two metres apart."" ""Is this for real?"" That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown. Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form. A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. ""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time. Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance. Read more from Laurahere. You could only meet one other person from another household outdoors, with advice to remain 2m (6ft) apart Larger gatherings with people from other households were not allowed, apart from a few exceptions, such as funerals, or where the gathering was essential for work purposes People who could work from home were still asked to do so - but people could attend workplaces if necessary Schools, non-essential shops, hospitality venues and hairdressers remained closed Hannah Brady, spokeswoman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said her father had died four days before the email was sent. ""At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK?"" she asked. ""To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same garden, looked the prime minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died,"" Ms Brady added. ""He told me he had done everything he could to protect my dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that dad's death certificate was signed. It makes me feel sick to think about it."" Separately last month, the Guardian published a photograph taken on 15 May 2020 - five days before the drinks took place - showing the prime minister, his wife and 17 staff membersin the Downing Street garden. Mr Johnson has said this was not a party and those present were ""people at work, talking about work"". Sue Gray is heading the investigation into gatherings that took place in 2020 In December, the prime minister asked Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, to investigate a series of allegations about events taking place in government buildings in 2020 despite coronavirus restrictions being in force. Mr Case stepped down after suggestions one of the parties had happened in his own office and the investigation was passed to Sue Gray, another senior civil servant. Asked during a visit to a vaccination centre in west London if he had attended the 20 May drinks, the prime minister said: ""All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray."" His minister, Mr Argar, echoed that on Tuesday, saying Ms Gray would be allowed to look into the allegations ""without fear or favour"", and would ""want to act quickly"". He added: ""It is right whatever flows from thatâ¦ [if] people are shown to have broken the rules, appropriate disciplinary action is taken."" The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant told the BBC he understood the anger over the gathering, but claimed the PM was showing ""loyalty"" to his staff. ""Boris and others felt sorry for people who were working long, long hours and they were simply spilling out from their own offices into a secure garden, which is an integral part of No 10 Downing Street,"" he said. ""And you know what? I'd rather have a prime minister who felt for his staff and all those hardworking people than some cold fish who really couldn't care [at all] about them."" But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us. ""He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates."" The SNP called on the Tories to ""show [the PM] the door"" or risk ""the whole party will be tainted by the lies, arrogance and rule-breaking"", while the Liberal Democrats demanded a police investigation. The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. 16 December 2020 London moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important “everyone is cautious” ahead of the festive period. The Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it “inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment” by staff. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was “truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result”. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. 12 April 2021 Lockdown restrictions were eased in England, with pubs and restaurants allowed to reopen with outdoor service only. However, working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it “should not have happened at the time that it did”. Boris Johnson was not at either party.

No escape for No 10 from party claims,"""Is this for real?"" That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown. Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form. A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. ""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time. Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" '100 invited' to Downing Street lockdown drinks The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance, a long table set out in the garden for drinks, crisps and sausage rolls with, two eyewitnesses told me, the prime minister and his wife in attendance. Notwithstanding how many of you might feel reading the details of that event, and the planning that went into it, there are three main reasons why this latest bout of claims about what was happening in Number 10 are deeply troubling for Mr Johnson. First off, the email,,externala scoop for our colleagues at ITV, is evidence in black and white of a social event that was planned in advance. That flies in the face of the prime minister's insistence so far that there were ""no parties"". Evidence of a planned event is not the same as ad hoc chats or the odd drink after hours outdoors or in the office in a Covid-secure environment - the kind of events some in government think could be justified. With an official investigation under way by a senior and experienced official with a stringent reputation, that is troublesome. Second, the prime minister could lose a senior official over what happened, and there has long been speculation about which moderately senior head might roll in the aftermath of the inquiry. But if, as eyewitnesses have told us, Mr Johnson was there himself, he is personally right at the centre of the mess. Third, for most of Monday the chatter among MPs and ministers getting back into the parliamentary routine was that the mood had calmed, the Tory anger at No 10's chaos had eased off after a liberal application of mince pies and eggnog. Disillusionment with Downing Street was still extremely common but the heat, and with it the political pressure, had cooled somewhat. But now, with this new damaging fodder for the opposition, don't be so sure.

EastEnders starts filming on troubled new Â£87m set,"Filming in the replica Albert Square began on Tuesday EastEnders has moved into a new Albert Square, with the cameras rolling for the first time on a troubled Â£86.7m replacement for the BBC soap's set. The show's original home at Elstree studios in Hertfordshire was only intended to be used for two years, but has lasted since 1984. However, the nearby replacement has been plagued with problems, going way over budget and schedule. It was originally due to be finished by 2018, at a cost of Â£59.7m. After filming began in the new Albert Square on Tuesday, a BBC statement said: ""The investment in the BBC's longest-running TV serial drama and wider BBC Elstree Centre, enables improved HD for our audiences and enhanced filming options. ""EastEnders production are now able to explore new areas on screen and writers, producers and directors have greater freedom to drive further creativity."" The new Albert Square is near the old one at Elstree studios In 2018,a critical reportfrom the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, said the old set was no longer fit for purpose, but that the new set wouldn't deliver value for money in the way that was envisaged when it was planned in 2015. Some of the problems were ""built into"" the project from the outset and ""some of the reasons for the delays and cost increases could have been addressed earlier by the BBC"", it said. The following year, MPs on the House of Commons Public Accounts select committeedescribed the constructionas ""flawed from the start"", saying the BBC was ""complacent"" and had made ""fundamental planning mistakes"".

Fans to return to Scottish stadiums next week,"This video can not be played 'Corner being turned' in Covid battle Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland, including football matches and concerts, are to be lifted from next Monday. The move will allow fans to return to stadiums when the Scottish Premiership's winter break ends. It will also avoid Scotland's Six Nations rugby matches having to be played behind closed doors at Murrayfield next month. A limit of 500 people at outdoor events has been in place since Boxing Day. Premiership football teams started their winter break early after the crowd limit was imposed, with many fans believing the sport was unfairly singled out by the restrictions. Large Hogmanay events, including the famous street party in Edinburgh, were also cancelled. Live coverage and reaction to the announcement Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What happens when Covid becomes endemic? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that the limit of 500 people would be removed from Monday 17 January - which will allow Celtic's match with Hibernian on that day to be played before a full crowd at Celtic Park. Event organisers will now have to check the vaccine certification of at least 50% of attendees, rather than the current 20%, or at least 1,000 people - whichever figure is higher. From Monday, the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" for the purpose of vaccine passports will include having a booster if the second dose was more than four months ago. And the government will also continue to consider whether the vaccine passport scheme should be extended to more venues. Restrictions on indoor events and venues will remain in place until at least 24 January, when Ms Sturgeon said she hoped to be able to lift them too. The Scottish Licensed Traders Association said the industry had been left in limbo by the first minister's statement, and warned that any extension of the vaccine passport scheme would have a ""major negative impact"" on businesses. The Scottish Premiership started its winter break early to avoid playing more matches without fans People will also still be required to wear face coverings in indoor public places, to work from home when possible, and to only meet indoors in groups of up to three households. The measures were imposed by the Scottish government in an attempt to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, with the first minister saying there were now signs that the country was ""starting to turn the corner"" after a huge spike in cases. Limits of 100 people were placed on indoor standing events or 200 if they were seated, while nightclubs had to close and pubs and restaurants had to bring back table service for alcohol and a one-metre distance between different groups of people. But the latest Scottish government Covid report showed that average daily cases in Scotland (2,824 per one million population in the week to 6 January) were higher than in England (2,615 per one million), which has fewer Covid restrictions. This is clearly the news that major sporting bodies and fans were hoping for. There were genuine fears, from within football at least, that the first minister would push the date back once again. It now appears that the increase in Covid passport checks outside stadia has allowed her to throw the doors back open but with a sense of continued caution. The Scottish government says the decision is based purely on the science, but there's no doubt that the move is timely, from a political perspective. With the Six Nations fast approaching, could the first minister really have watched on if Scotland's home game's had been moved south for the sake of attendance? It was certainly being discussed. As talk now turns to how we learn to live with Covid, this latest sporting sigh of relief will be accompanied by the hope that fans are be back for good. Some business leaders say said that the tougher coronavirus rules have failed to make a ""meaningful difference"" to infection levels and were causing ""enormous damage"" to some sectors. And pressure has been growing on the first minister to set out how Scotland can begin to ""live safely"" with Covid and loosen restrictions. Ms Sturgeon insisted that the restrictions had ""helped to mitigate to some extent the impact of the Omicron wave"", with positive cases estimated to be about 30,000 a day in early January rather than the initial projection of 50,000 per day . She added: ""It is very likely that the situation we face now, though serious, would have been even more challenging without the renewed sacrifices made by people across the country over these last few weeks."" The first minister also told MSPs that a revised framework for dealing with the virus will be released in the coming weeks, following input from parliament and business organisations. In a marked change of language to earlier stages of the pandemic, the first minister said this would set out how the country might be able to live with the virus without the need for restrictive measures ""that we are all tired of and which do harm in other ways"". Pubs had to reintroduce table service and ensure distancing between groups of customers as part of measures aimed at slowing the spread of Omicron Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was ""disappointing"" that restrictions such as the vaccine passport scheme were continuing despite Scotland being in a ""far more positive position than the government were expecting"". He said: ""The outlook is much better now not because of government restrictions, but because of people's good sense. The people of Scotland got this right, not the government."" Meanwhile Labour's Anas Sarwar said that ""a new phase of the pandemic must mean a new approach"". He added: ""People can no longer live their lives waiting to hear on an ad hoc basis what the rules will be day by day. ""Businesses and workers cannot plan for the future properly if they cannot predict the government's response."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

One of the biggest illegal marketplaces on there, Torrez, went offline last month after two years of selling Class A drugs, counterfeit cash and hacking tools. But one darknet drug dealer has told the BBC that law enforcement face an ""impossible task"" trying to close down such sites. BBC data research has found at least 450 dealers that had survived multiple police shutdowns. Watch this investigation from the BBC's cyber reporter Joe Tidy.

Half of Europe to catch Omicron - WHO,"The World Health Organization has warned that half of Europe will have caught the Omicron Covid variant within the next six to eight weeks. Dr Hans Kluge said a ""west-to-east tidal wave"" of Omicron was sweeping across the region, on top of a surge in the Delta variant. The projection was based on the seven million new cases reported across Europe in the first week of 2022. The number of infections has more than doubled in a two-week period. ""Today the Omicron variant represents a new west-to-east tidal wave, sweeping across the region on top of the Delta surge that all countries were managing until late 2021,"" Dr Kluge told a news conference. He quoted the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation as forecasting that ""more than 50 percent of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks"". He said European and Central Asian countries remained under ""intense pressure"" as the virus spread from western countries into the Balkans. ""How each country now responds must be informed by its epidemiological situation, available resources, vaccination uptake status and socio-economic context"", he added. Recent studies suggest that Omicron is less likely to make people seriously ill than previous Covid variants. But Omicron is still highly contagious and can infect people even if they are fully vaccinated. The record number of people catching it has left health systems under severe strain. On Monday, the UK reported a further 142,224 confirmed cases of the virus and 77 deaths. A number of hospitals have declared ""critical"" incidents due to staff absences and rising pressures caused by Covid. Elsewhere, hospital numbers are also rising. France's Health Minister Olivier Veran warned last week that January would be tough for hospitals. He added that Omicron patients were taking up ""conventional"" beds in hospitals while Delta was putting a strain on ICU departments. In eastern Europe, Poland reported that 100,000 people had died from the virus in the country since the start of the pandemic. Poland now has the sixth-highest mortality rate in the world from Covid-19, and almost 40% of its population remains unvaccinated. In Russia, top consumer health official Anna Popova told a meeting of the government's coronavirus task force that without action to control the spread of the virus, the daily number of new Covid cases there could reach 100,000. The daily infection rate had recently been declining from a peak of 41,335 cases recorded in early November, Reuters news agency reports. Ms Popova said 305 known cases of the Omicron variant had been detected so far, in 13 of the country's regions. Russia has registered at least 311,281 deaths and 10.5 million cases to date. On Monday, the pharmaceutical firm Pfizer said it would be able to launch a version of its vaccine that offers special protection against Omicron, to be rolled out in March. Health experts say it is not yet clear whether this is needed.

100 invited to No 10 drinks,"As many as 100 people were invited to a ""bring-your-own-booze"" drinks event in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown, it is understood. Witnesses have told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended the gathering on 20 May 2020. But Boris Johnson has declined to say whether he was among those there. The Metropolitan Police said it was in contact with the government over ""widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches"" of Covid rules. Labour has been granted an urgent question in the Commons at 12:30 GMT to push for answers from a minister. The party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said the prime minister needed to ""come clean"" about the gathering. Addressing Mr Johnson on Twitter, he added: ""Your deflections and distractions are absurd. Not only did you know about the parties in Downing Street, you attended them. ""Stop lying to the British public."" Laura Kuenssberg analysis: No escape for No 10 The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Anemail, revealed by ITV News,,externalinvited people to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"". It was sent when lockdown restrictions were still in place. Twelve days later - on 1 June - rules in England were relaxed to allow groups of up to six people to meet outside. Health Minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he understood the ""anger, sadness and upset many will feel about these allegations"". But he said it was ""important"" to allow an investigation to take place into gatherings in Downing Street before coming to any conclusions. However, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the BBC the PM did not need to wait for an inquiry to answer whether he attended. ""I can't understand if the prime minister attended why on earth he thought that was the right thing to do,"" she added. ""People are furious about this, what they gave up, how difficult it was, what happened to their own lives, and to think that this was going on? It is indefensible, it cannot be defended."" This video can not be played Watch former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson call the No 10 party ""indefensible"" Downing Street declined to comment as it said the gathering - like others reported to have happened under coronavirus restrictions during 2020 - is now being looked into as part of an ongoing independent investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray. A Met spokesperson said the force was ""aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on 20 May 2020 and is in contact with the Cabinet Office"", which oversees government policy. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister ""cannot run and cannot hide"" from the allegations. He added: ""It speaks to a rotten culture at the heart of this government and the rotten culture begins with the person in charge."" Hannah Brady said her father's death certificate had been signed on the same day the drinks took place The Wednesday 20 May gathering first came to light last week ina blog,externalby the PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings. ITV News has now published what appears to be the full email invitation sent on behalf of Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. It has the subject line ""Socially Distanced Drinks! [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE-No 10 ONLY]"". ""After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening,"" the email says. ""Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze."" Two eyewitnesses have told the BBC they saw Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie at the event in the garden. And sources have said that several Downing Street members of staff voiced concerns about drinks happening, with one claiming: ""There were conversations about the email being really unwise."" Another added: ""I remember people saying, 'What the hell?'"" Others said a long table had been set up in the garden for the event. A message sent by one Downing Street staffer to another at the time, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin (Reynolds) encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Another asked: ""Is this for real?"" In a Twitter post on the day of the gathering, when it was 25C (77F) in London, the Metropolitan Police reminded people they could only relax or exercise outside on their own, with their own household or one person from another household.

On the same day as the gathering, the then Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, gave theDowning Street coronavirus briefing,external- in which he confirmedanother 363 people,externalin the UK had died with Covid in the previous 24 hours. At the briefing, he told the public: ""You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay two metres apart."" ""Is this for real?"" That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown. Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form. A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. ""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time. Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance. Read more from Laurahere. You could only meet one other person from another household outdoors, with advice to remain 2m (6ft) apart Larger gatherings with people from other households were not allowed, apart from a few exceptions, such as funerals, or where the gathering was essential for work purposes People who could work from home were still asked to do so - but people could attend workplaces if necessary Schools, non-essential shops, hospitality venues and hairdressers remained closed Hannah Brady, spokeswoman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said her father had died four days before the email was sent. ""At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK?"" she asked. ""To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same garden, looked the prime minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died,"" Ms Brady added. ""He told me he had done everything he could to protect my dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that dad's death certificate was signed. It makes me feel sick to think about it."" Separately last month, the Guardian published a photograph taken on 15 May 2020 - five days before the drinks took place - showing the prime minister, his wife and 17 staff membersin the Downing Street garden. Mr Johnson has said this was not a party and those present were ""people at work, talking about work"". Sue Gray is heading the investigation into gatherings that took place in 2020 In December, the prime minister asked Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, to investigate a series of allegations about events taking place in government buildings in 2020 despite coronavirus restrictions being in force. Mr Case stepped down after suggestions one of the parties had happened in his own office and the investigation was passed to Sue Gray, another senior civil servant. Asked during a visit to a vaccination centre in west London if he had attended the 20 May drinks, the prime minister said: ""All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray."" His minister, Mr Argar, echoed that on Tuesday, saying Ms Gray would be allowed to look into the allegations ""without fear or favour"", and would ""want to act quickly"". He added: ""It is right whatever flows from thatâ¦ [if] people are shown to have broken the rules, appropriate disciplinary action is taken."" The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant told the BBC he understood the anger over the gathering, but claimed the PM was showing ""loyalty"" to his staff. ""Boris and others felt sorry for people who were working long, long hours and they were simply spilling out from their own offices into a secure garden, which is an integral part of No 10 Downing Street,"" he said. ""And you know what? I'd rather have a prime minister who felt for his staff and all those hardworking people than some cold fish who really couldn't care [at all] about them."" But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us. ""He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates."" The SNP called on the Tories to ""show [the PM] the door"" or risk ""the whole party will be tainted by the lies, arrogance and rule-breaking"", while the Liberal Democrats demanded a police investigation. The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. 16 December 2020 London moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important “everyone is cautious” ahead of the festive period. The Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it “inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment” by staff. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was “truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result”. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. 12 April 2021 Lockdown restrictions were eased in England, with pubs and restaurants allowed to reopen with outdoor service only. However, working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it “should not have happened at the time that it did”. Boris Johnson was not at either party.

Heathrow warns return to normal travel years away,"At least 600,000 passengers scrapped plans to fly from Heathrow Airport last month as the Omicron coronavirus strain sparked tougher travel restrictions. Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said it underlined the crisis in the industry and the uncertainty facing travellers. A return to normal ""could be years away"", the chief executive of the UK's busiest airport warned. Just 19.4 million passengers passed through Heathrow in 2021 - 12.3% below 2020, the year the pandemic began. Last year's number, the lowest for Heathrow for 50 years, was less than a quarter of the pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. Mr Holland-Kaye said it was time for all coronavirus testing measures to be dropped for fully-vaccinated people. Fears over the Omicron Covid variant meant that, from late November, all travellers arriving in the UK were required to take a pre-departure lateral flow test and self-isolate until they received a negative result from a post-arrival PCR test. This led to many people scrapping their travel plans over the festive period. The new rules were relaxed for fully-vaccinated arrivals last week after travel firms said they were ineffective due to Omicron spreading widely within the UK. That move sparked a rush of bookings, airlines reported. What tests do I need to go on holiday? Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""There are currently travel restrictions, such as testing, on all Heathrow routes - the aviation industry will only fully recover when these are all lifted and there is no risk that they will be re-imposed at short notice, a situation which is likely to be years away."" John Holland-Kaye says the aviation regulator could help ease the uncertainty. He warned this creates ""enormous uncertainty"" for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the aviation regulator, as it prepares to set a five-year cap on Heathrow's passenger charges. ""The regulator must focus on an outcome that improves service, incentivises growth and maintains affordable private financing."" The CAA increased the cap on Heathrow's price per passenger from Â£19.60 to Â£30.19 from 1 January, sparking complaints from airlines that the rise was far too high. The CAA is expected to announce a long-term cap running from the summer to 2027 in the coming weeks. Heathrow said travel to and from the Asia-Pacific region in 2021 was particularly badly hit, down 40.3% from a year earlier. The other markets with double-digit reductions were non-EU Europe (down 13.8%) and North America (down 13.6%). Domestic travel bucked the trend, with a 21.1% boost in passengers compared with 2020.

LiveLiveLabour questions PM's integrity over drinks party2 minutes ago,"MPs in the Commons have been asking minister Michael Ellis for more details on an alleged drinks party at No 10 during lockdown Labour's Angela Rayner asked if Boris Johnson knew about the party in May 2020 and called on him to respond personally Michael Ellis said he had confidence in the PM, but would not comment on the ongoing investigation into various gatherings About 100 people were invited to the ""bring-your-own-booze"" event in the Downing Street garden in the first lockdown, the BBC understands Witnesses say Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie were among about 30 people at the gathering on 20 May 2020 Meanwhile, from today, people without Covid symptoms no longer need a PCR test to confirm a positive lateral flow in England Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland will be lifted from Monday, allowing football and rugby fans to fully return to matches Edited by Hamish Mackay It's goodbye from us for now but we'll be back with all the latest updates tomorrow. Today's live page was the work of Mary O'Connor, Alex Kleiderman, Nathan Williams, Chris Giles, Alys Davies, Kate Whannel, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Marie Jackson. It was edited by Hamish Mackay and Emma Owen. On a day that's been dominated by that Downing Street drinks party, here's a round-up of what's been happening in the UK and elsewhere: BBC Reality Check During the first
lockdown â 27 March to 1 June 2020 â 17,981fines were issued,externalfor breaking
Covid-19 restrictions. We donât know
exactly how many of those were for illegal gatherings of more than 30 people on
private properties, but it wasnât very many.Only 29 fines,externalwere issued for that
offence in first and second lockdowns put together. During first
lockdown,fines,externalfor those attending illegal indoor gatherings of more than
30 people were Â£100 â or Â£50 if paid quickly â doubling after each offence. Not all of the fines
imposed will have been paid. Between March 2020 and August 2021,prosecutors checked,external2,098 cases that had been challenged. They ruled that 445 had been
incorrectly charged and 348 cases were withdrawn.

But Australian officials have said they're still considering whether or not to deport him. Now, Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic has told the BBC she remains hopeful the world men's number one will be allowed to defend his singles title at the tournament. Following a phone conversation with her Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison, she said Serbia understood Australia's restrictive Covid rules and procedures, and that Belgrade was not looking for any special treatment for Djokovic. I donât think this is the end of the whole saga. I am hoping Novak will be able to play in the Australian Open Ana Brnabic, Serbian Prime Minister ""Whatâs important is that Novak is treated equally, that he gets a fair chance. We support him, but at the same time itâs important to keep the relationship strong between the two countries."" On Djokovic attending public events after his positive PCR test, she said that if he had done so, it would be a clear breach of Serbian rules. ""What we donât know is when he actually saw his results, so there is some grey area, and I think the only answer to this can be provided by Novak."" She also said she didn't understand why you wouldnât want to get vaccinated, but that ""in a democracy you have to respect a personâs decision"". As Omicron becomes the dominant variant across the globe, some BBC World News viewers have been sending in questions. Would it be accurate to say Omicron is like a bad flu? Have countries started changing their travel restrictions? Can having a cold over winter protect you against Covid? BBC World Newsâs Lucy Hockings put these questions and others to Prof David Montefiori, immunologist at Duke University, and Julia Lo Bue-Said the CEO at The Advantage Travel Partnership. This video can not be played Is Omicron like bad flu? Your questions answered Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter United
Airlines will reduce its schedule due to staff shortages this month, in the
latest sign of economic strains caused by the Omicron variant. Chief
executive Scott Kirby said some 3,000 employees were out sick - about 4% of its
US workforce. At one point, one-third of its staff at its main hub in New
Jersey called out with the virus, he said. The moves
follow widespread flight cancellations in recent weeks. Transit systems in the
US have also reduced service, while retailers such as Apple and Macyâs have cut
hours at some store, and school districts such as Chicago have cancelled
classes. Firms including Facebook have delayed return-to-office plans. Speaking to
Congress on Tuesday, the head of Americaâs central bank said the pandemic was
causing economic disruption for far longer than most experts anticipated. âTwo years
ago, I donât think we would have said we would still be having record levels of
cases and [near] record levels of hospitalisation,â Federal Reserve Chair
Jerome Powell said. âGetting past the pandemic is the most important thing we
can do.â  Her name keeps popping up, but beside being the senior civil servant leading the Downing Street parties' inquiry, what else do we know about Sue Gray? Gray, who is married to a country and western singer, has worked in several departments including transport and health, but is not a typical career civil servant. In the late 1980s she took a career break to run a pub in Northern Ireland - a job she said she loved but would never do again. Having served as head of the Cabinet Office's ethics team, she is experienced at investigating ministers. In 2012, her inquiry into ""plebgate"" led to the resignation of then-chief whip Andrew Mitchell. Mitchell admitted using bad language towards a police officer, but denied calling him a ""pleb"". And a 2017 investigation forced Damian Green to step down as minister after he was found to have made ""inaccurate"" statements over what he knew about claims pornography was found on his office computer in 2008. Last year her application to become head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service was rejected - something she attributed to being ""too much of a challenger"". In case you missed it earlier, Labour's deputy leader told MPs there would be no need for an investigation in to a party in Downing Street if the prime minister explained if he knew about it and if he attended. Angela Rayner said the government could not ""blame it on a few junior civil servants"". Paymaster General Michael Ellis, answering Rayner's question in the Commons, said he had confidence in Boris Johnson's honour and integrity. This video can not be played Rayner and Ellis on Johnson role in No 10 work lockdown party Children's author Michael Rosen, who himself was seriously ill with Covid, has been talking to BBC News about the latest Downing Street party claims. He reflects that Covid has involved hundreds of thousands of people who've all been damaged in some way by the pandemic - creating a kind of social trauma, much like the London Blitz during World War Two. He says: ""I don't think we have begun to deal with this social trauma. But worse, this is just the opposite of dealing with it. ""Instead of the equivalent of wreaths at the Cenotaph, what we're getting is 'oh, we were partying while you were doing that'. ""It's an appalling feeling to just think of that."" A further 379 deaths have been reported within 28 days of a positive cornavirus test, official UK figuresshow,external. There have now been 1,660 deaths by this measure in the last seven days - an 80% increase on the seven previous days. There have also been another 120,821 Covid cases recorded across the UK. Meanwhile, the World Bank has said the global economy faces a ""grim outlook"", as the aftershocks of the pandemic continue to weigh on growth, especially in poor countries. The organisation's latest forecast predicts global growth will slow to 4.1% this year from 5.5% in 2021. It attributes the slowdown to virus threats, government aid unwinding and an initial rebound in demand fading. But World Bank President David Malpass says his greatest worry is widening global inequality. ""The big drag is the inequality that's built into the system,"" he tells the BBC, noting that poorer countries are especially vulnerable to economic damage from efforts to fight inflation. ""The outlook for the weaker countries is still to fall further and further behind. That causes insecurity."" Read more here. This video can not be played DUP MP Jim Shannon breaks down in Commons There were tears in the Commons earlier as DUP MP Jim Shannon put his question to the government minister. He told Parliament how his mother-in-law had died alone with Covid during the pandemic and said the government must ensure ""full and complete disclosure"" over the Downing Street party claims. Read the full storyhere. We've got a bit more now from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who calls on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign over news of thebring-your-own-booze Downing Street garden party during lockdown. She tells MSPs that people are ""aghast"" at Downing Street's behaviour, which appears to show ""serial breaches of guidance"" that the public followed despite the ""painful sacrifices"" involved. Accusing Johnson of ""not being truthful"" about his knowledge of events, she argues the office of prime minister and UK interests would be ""greatly enhanced"" by his resignation. In
the week of the drinks party at No 10 Downing Street, the police handed out hundreds
of fines to people for breaking coronavirus laws. The
latest police data shows there were 807 fixed penalty notices in the week between 15
and 21 May 2020 for Covid law breaches in England and Wales. Most
of these would have related to people breaking rules on gatherings and movement. At
the time,people couldn't leave their homes without a reasonable excuse, such as work, exercise and getting things like food and medicine. The
police in England could fine people Â£100 for a first offence, which could then
double for each further offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. We've heard a number of people this morning refer to the independent inquiry into Downing Street lockdown parties that's being led by senior civil servant Sue Gray. She was appointed to head up the inquiry after Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant,stepped aside from the role following reports a party was held in his office while London was under Covid rules. Boris Johnson announced an inquiry would be carried out at the beginning of last month,after a video from last year emerged of government staff joking about a partythat took place on 18 December - a day on which more than 400 Covid deaths were reported. Which events is the inquiry investigating?  A full list of reported government lockdown parties can be foundhere. Labourâs former director of communications, Alastair Campbell, is the latest to add his voice to calls for the prime minister to consider his position. He tells BBC News if Boris Johnson is found to have broken his âown lawâ in relation to Covid restrictions âhis position is untenableâ and âhe has to goâ. Campbell - who was a key aide to Tony Blair - says heâs âsurprisedâ at the âreluctance of the policeâ to get involved in any of the previous allegations of gatherings that took place in Downing Street in 2020. They now being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray. Campbell believes ""the police have to get involved nowâ because he says there has been âa crime in the garden of Downing Streetâ. The son of a Bletchley Park codebreaker whose funeral was held on the same day as lockdown drinks in Downing Street is the latest to share his shock at the claims, saying heâs ""totally gobsmacked"". Ann Mitchell, who was part of a World War Two code-breaking team, died in May 2020, aged 97, after testing positive for Covid. Her son, Andy Mitchell, said just five people attended her funeral in Edinburgh. He added that they had a âquick chatâ afterwards before returning home, with ""no drinks in the garden or anything like that"". As we just mentioned, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that attendance limits on live outdoor events in Scotland will end on Monday. In her Covid update to MSPs at Holyrood, she also announced:  The first minister says she hopes the cabinet will decide to lift more restrictions - including on indoor live events, table service in hospitality and distancing in indoor public places - from 24 January. Sturgeon says, as these measures are lifted, it will be necessary to consider whether the use of vaccine passports may have to be extended. Antony Mullen, leader of the Conservatives on Sunderland Council, says he does not see how the prime minister can survive these latest allegations. He described claims that Boris Johnson's private secretary, Martin Reynolds, invited about 100 No 10 staff members to a ""bring-your-own-booze"" garden party in May 2020 as ""absolutely appalling"". ""I thinkMartin Reynoldsshould have been sacked and I think Boris Johnson will inevitably have to follow him,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme. Mullen added that he believed an investigation into Downing Street parties would now likely find that Johnson misled the Commons. Restrictions on attendance levels at live outdoor events in Scotland will be removed from next Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms. The move will allow fans to return to stadiums when the Scottish Premiership's winter break ends. It will also avoid Scotland's Six Nations rugby matches having to be played behind closed doors at Murrayfield. A limit of 500 people at outdoor events has been in place since Boxing Day. Speaking to MSPs at Holyrood, Sturgeon says there are some signs Scotland is ""starting to turn the corner"" on the Omicron variant spike, while the nation's latest Covid figures gave grounds for ""encouragement"". Up to 30,000 positive cases a day are being recorded, almost half the initial projection of 50,000 per day, she says. She cautions there are still ""uncertainties"" in the data to be addressed, including the impact of the post-Christmas return to work and school. But she says we do know that high case numbers are disrupting the economy and critical services, while the NHS remains under ""severe pressure"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sort it out or step aside, Tory donor tells PMTelecoms tycoon John Caudwell says revelations about lockdown parties are ""disastrous"" for Boris Johnson.UK Politics","John Caudwell donated Â£500,000 to the Conservatives before the last election A major Conservative donor has issued an ultimatum to Boris Johnson over revelations about lockdown parties in Downing Street. John Caudwell said: ""Sort it out, Boris, or step aside and let someone else sort it out so that the Tories aren't wiped out at the next election."" The Phones4U founder donated Â£500,000 to the Conservatives ahead of the 2019 general election. He criticised the government's perceived ""arrogance and hypocrisy"". PM can't hide from party allegations, says Labour No 10 staff had to block Downing Street parties What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Billionaire Caudwell goes head-to-head with Labour's John McDonnell Mr Caudwell was one of the Conservative Party's biggest individual donors at the last general election, and has previously given money to pro-Brexit Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. He told BBC News: ""Although I have always obeyed the rules I have never been puritanical about lockdown restrictions so I find it difficult to personally get excited about an outdoor drinks party. But it's the perceived arrogance, hypocrisy and rule breaking that is impossible to justify. ""While the rest of us were striving to follow the ever-changing rules - including myself, even when I deemed them to be excessive at best, nonsensical at worst - those who were setting those rules were, apparently freely and frequently, disregarding them. ""Each one of these new revelations gives greater force to the accusation that areas of the government think it's 'one rule for them, one rule for the rest of us'. ""This is disastrous."" He added that he was not a ""dyed-in-the-wool Tory"" and had been critical of the government's economic recovery plans, urging more investment in apprenticeships and renewable energy. But he added: ""I do think the Conservatives are the best party to govern this country, particularly as we look to navigate opportunities post-Brexit. ""Sort it out, Boris, or step aside and let someone else sort it out so that the Tories aren't wiped out at the next election."" Alasdair Locke, who has donated Â£280,000 to the Conservative Party since Mr Johnson came to power, said the lockdown parties were ""something the media is making a great deal of"" and voters would be concerned with ""serious stuff"" at the next election. ""I really don't think a leadership change, or challenge, is needed at this stage. A bit more grip would help but that will probably come."" The prime minister is under growing pressure from Labour - and anger from some Conservatives - over his alleged attendance at a previously unreported Downing Street party. It comes after ITV published a leaked email from the PM's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting 100 staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" on 20 May 2020. The invitation for the event, which was organised when strict lockdown rules were still in place, encouraged people to ""bring your own booze"" and ""make the most of the lovely weather"". Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife had been among about 30 people who attended the gathering. But Mr Johnson has declined to say whether he was one of them. The PM's official spokesman also refused to comment on the claims while the investigation was taking place, but he added that the prime minister retained full confidence in Mr Reynolds. Senior civil servant Sue Gray is investigating lockdown parties in Downing Street, including the event on 20 May 2020, and is expected to report shortly.

This will allow fans to return in their thousands to football and rugby matches The current rules around social distancing, table service and mask wearing in pubs and restaurants will remain in place The first minister also says that as restrictions are lifted it might be necessary to extend ""the scope"" of vaccine certificates Ms Sturgeon adds: ""To be clear, we have not yet taken any decisions on this and it will require careful judgment.""

That's all for our live coverage of the first minister's statement today. Join us again next time. Chris McLaughlinBBC Scotland Sports News Correspondent This is clearly the news that major sporting bodies and fans
were hoping for. There were genuine fears, from within football at least, that
the first minister would push the date back once again. It now appears that the
increase in Covid passport checks outside stadia has allowed her to throw the
doors back open, but with a sense of continued caution. The Scottish government
say the decision is based purely on the science but thereâs no doubt that the
move is timely, from a political perspective. With the Six Nations fast
approaching, could the first minister really have watched on if Scotlandâs home
games had been moved south for the sake of attendance? It was certainly being
discussed. As talk now turns to how we learn to live with Covid, this latest
sporting sigh of relief will be accompanied by the hope that fans are be back
for good. Boris and Carrie Johnson are alleged to have attended the lockdown drinks gathering in the Downing Street garden Nicola Sturgeon says Boris Johnson should quit over the
latest revelations aboutparties in Downing Street during lockdown. The first minister says âserial breaches of guidance that
people were following through painful sacrificesâ means the office of prime
minister would be ""greatly enhanced by Boris Johnson's departure from
it"". The first minister was responding to a question from Green
MSP Gillian Mackay who described the No 10 revelations as âabsolutely sickeningâ. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The first minister says restrictions have
made the difference, alongside boosters and public behaviour, to ensure the NHS
was protected from a surge of cases all at once, but she does acknowledge it is
difficult to prove a direct link. Nicola Sturgeon also says there are
signs things are improving, paving the way to ease more measures. So where does that leave us? Eventually, the expectation is that Covid
will be a concern for scientists and the NHS with far less impact on our daily
lives. The hope is it will become a more manageable disease. But in the short-term, the data on positive cases is becoming less reliable with the move to
relying on lateral flow tests to record positive cases. That will make it
more challenging for modellers to make projections and to monitor for new
variants. And right now, Covid continues to have a
significant impact on the health service. The numbers of patients in
hospital is up 40% on this time last week, and staff absences are high. Even if vaccines and treatments mean beds can be freed up more quickly and far
fewer end up in intensive care, it still means the health service has
very little capacity to do anything other than the most urgent or emergency
care. This all stores up a different set of future problems for the NHS.  SNP MSP Joe FitzPatrick asks the first minister about calls to cut the self-isolation period to five days and whether the Scottish government is considering this. Ms Sturgeon replies that as with all areas related to Covid, decisions will be kept under review by clinicians. She notes that the decision has just recently been made to move from 10 days' self-isolation to seven (provided you feel well and don't have a fever, and that you return negative lateral flow tests on day six and day seven). This was not an insignificant decision, or one that came without risk, she adds. She says in the period ahead, the impact of the move from 10 to seven days will be monitored before any decision is made about reducing self-isolation further. Alex Cole-Hamilton picks up on the first ministerâs comments
about âliving with Covidâ by asking what is happening with support for those
suffering from the long-term impact of the virus. The Scottish Lib Dem leader points out more than 100,000
people in Scotland are thought to have Long Covid. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish governmentâs Long Covid
action plan is being implemented and adds it is âwrong and an over-simplificationâ
to focus only on specialist clinics as a way of supporting people in this situation. Mr Sarwar also asks whether Holyrood will be given a vote on the new Covid framework before it comes into force. He adds that any deviations from the framework must also come before parliament for consent. Ms Sturgeon replies that parliament will be asked to vote on the revised framework. But she says the virus ""doesn't wait til parliament considers things. Sometimes, governments have to make decisions quickly in the interest of public health and safety."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar asks the first minister to confirm whether the new strategic framework for dealing with Covid will provide ""clearly set-out trigger points for future restrictions"". For example, these would include infection rates, hospitalisations and staff absences. He also asks about key triggers on what financial support restrictions will trigger. Mr Sarwar says this will be important for businesses to allow them to plan, as well as for people to make their own decisions about protecting themselves. People cannot live their lives waiting for ad hoc updates on what the rules will be day-to-day.  âBusinesses and workers cannot plan for the future properly if they cannot predict the government's response."" Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour leader Ms Sturgeon responds that the government wants to give as much clarity and predictability as possible on the triggers for more restrictions. ""We are dealing with an infectious, unpredictable, mutating virus. ""Any government that gets itself stuck in fixed triggers or fixed ways of thinking about things is not serving the health of the country well and we will not do that,"" she adds. Douglas Ross questions the Scottish governmentâs plans to increase the number of vaccine passport spot-checks at bigger sporting events. The Tory MSP and MP says the move is âdisappointingâ and asks
how feasible it is to check more than 30,000 Covid certificates at Murrayfield when
Scotland open their Six Nations campaign next month. Nicola Sturgeon says she has âevery confidenceâ in both the
rugby and football authorities to be able to cope with the increase in the number
of spot-checks they now need to carry out. Douglas Ross says the public deserve credit for the way the country
has dealt with the Omicron threat. The Scottish Conservatives leader says the âoutlook is more positive
now not because of government restrictions but because of peopleâs good senseâ. He adds, âthe people of Scotland got this right, not the
government.â Nicola Sturgeon says âwe are in a more positive placeâ but
there âremains significant uncertaintiesâ and this justifies her cautious
approach. Ms Sturgeon says she wants to speak about how we can learn to live with Covid. She says plans are being drawn up for how we might adapt in the medium and longer term to mitigate harm without the need for restrictions. ""Hopefully, we are on a path from Covid being an epidemic to it becoming endemic - in other words, existing at more manageable and consistent levels."" Nicola Sturgeon, First minister A revised framework is being prepared and the Scottish government will consult with parliament, business organisations and other partners across society. The new framework will be published within the next few weeks, Ms Sturgeon adds. Ms Sturgeon says there are still too many eligible people
not yet fully vaccinated. She says someone not fully vaccinated is at least four times more likely
to require hospital treatment than someone who has had a booster or third dose. The FM urges everyone to get their booster jab. There is plenty of capacity in vaccination
centres, she says, and you will always be welcomed. Nicola Sturgeon warns âdifficult choicesâ such as pausing or
reducing some services to protect social care services may need to be taken in the coming weeks. The first minister says this is being driven by the âsignificant
impactâ of staff absences as a result of the Omicron wave. Ms Sturgeon also announces an additional Â£5m to improve ventilation in schools and nurseries. The first minister continues that the Cabinet will review the data again when it meets a week today. She says she hopes at this meeting it will be decided to lift more restrictions - including on indoor live events, table service in
hospitality and distancing in indoor public places - from 24 January. She says as these measures are lifted it will be necessary to consider whether the use of vaccine passports may have to be extended. The requirements for face coverings and working from home will remain in place for now, she says. For at least the immediate period
ahead, the advice to limit contact with
people in other households, and in particular to limit the number of households
in any indoor gathering to a maximum of three, will also remain in place. Question from Ann in Haddington You can get a Covid passport a few ways. You candownload the NHS Scotland Covid Status app,externalonto your mobile device, for example onto your smartphone (if you have one). Or, you candownload or request a copy of your vaccination status online,externalor by phoning the COVID Status Helpline on 0808 196 8565. The number of people in hospital with Covid has continued to increase over the past week, the FM says. But there are signs the rate of increase is slowing. Two weeks ago, the number increased from 594 to 1,147 this time last weekâ an increase of 553. Since then, it has risen further to 1,479 - an increase
of 332. Ms Sturgeon also says numbers of Covid patients in ICU have increased more rapidly than in the previous two weeks. But, she notes, this could be down to the lag between people becoming hospitalised, and them requiring intensive care. There are still uncertainties, though, and we do not know what impact the return to work and school after Christmas will have on infection levels, she says. The situation in Scotland just now is undoubtedly serious but perhaps less so than it might have been, and there are also some signs that we may be starting to turn a corner."" Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The definition of being fully vaccinated for the purpose of using
vaccine passports is to change, Nicola Sturgeon announces. From Monday, being âfully vaccinatedâ for Covid certification
will include having a booster if the second dose was more than four months
ago. The NHS Scotland Covid status app will be
updated from Thursday so that its QR code includes evidence of booster
vaccination. It will also be possible to order updated paper and PDF
copies of vaccination status, which are now valid for three months. It will still be possible to gain admission to events and venues by
providing proof of a recent negative lateral flow test, instead of a vaccine
passport. The attendance limit of 500 people at
large-scale outdoor events will be lifted from 17 January, Nicola Sturgeon
confirms. This means top-flight football fixtures
scheduled for early next week will be allowed to have full crowds as well as the forthcoming
Six Nations rugby matches. One change for those attending these events is
that the Covid certification scheme is to be expanded. Organisers of large events of 1,000 or more
people will be required to check the certification status of at least 50% of
attendees (up from the 20% previously required) or at least 1,000 people -
whichever figure is higher. Last week, it was announced that people without symptoms who test positive on a lateral flow test will no longer need to have their result confimed by a PCR test. Ms Sturgeon says this change means the
current daily numbers are capturing fewer positive cases than before. This will lead to changes in how case numbers are reported by Public Health Scotland. From Thursday, the number will be combined - to include those who test positive either with a PCR or lateral flow test. This will mean a time lag in reporting case numbers initially, she adds. But the new way of reporting should allow the trend in cases to be reported more accurately than it is now. She concludes by urging everyone to make sure they report their lateral flow results - whether positive or negative. Question from Donald in Edinburgh Yes, the guidance is still to limit mixing to three households. Before Christmas, the first minister made what she called a ""request"" to the public to ""reduce as far as possible - to a minimum - the contacts that we have with people from other households"". She said mixing between households was not going to be banned or restricted in law, as happened before. Instead, she said her government would be issuing ""strong guidance"" to ""cut down as far as possible the number of people from outside our own households with whom we interact"". Ms Sturgeon did ask those who were going to socialise - either at home or in indoor public places - to limit each gathering to a maximum of three households, and for everyone to do a lateral flow test beforehand.

Couple says troubled council broke family,"Sonny and Sarita Simak spent three years fighting to be reunited with a boy they planned to adopt A couple have received an apology and a ""very significant"" financial payout from a council over a failed adoption. Sonny and Sarita Simak spent three years fighting to be reunited with a boy they planned to adopt after he was wrongly removed by Bradford Council. They were approved by an independent expert and two adoption panels - but the council then told them he wasn't suitable for adoption. The council said it put the ""interests and wellbeing"" of children at its core. The young boy was a toddler when he was first placed with the Simaks. He is now going to school and is likely to now stay in long-term foster care. It comes as Bradford's children's services have been heavily criticised for failing to protect Star Hobson, the toddlerwho was killed by her mother's partner. A commissioner from the Department for Education is currently assessing the department. Sonny and Sarita Simak were thrilled when ""their"" little boy - as they still call him - came to live with them in Slough, in November 2017. They had been approved by an adoption panel and were matched with him. ""He was just a joy, a delight, a lovely little boy. We love him,"" Sarita told the BBC. The little boy, who we are not naming, had some problems settling in - as they'd been warned he would. However, according to the Simaks' account, he quickly became accustomed to his new home and they planned to go through the final adoption process. ""He thrived in adoption placement with us,"" Sarita said. ""He loved having a mummy and daddy. He was doing very well."" This video can not be played Watch Sonny and Sarita speak emotionally about their failed adoption So it was a shock to them in July 2018, just eight months later, when the little boy was removed from their home. They say this was done with just 12 hours' notice. They challenged his removal. However, they were told social workers doubted the long-term placement would work because the couple suffered from low moods and hadn't taken advice about feeding the boy. The Simaks didn't accept this and their GP and health visitor said the little boy had thrived in their care. A year after he'd been taken away, they had a formal meeting with the council. Star Hobson: The short life and death of a beloved toddler Third children service's boss quits council post Bradford apologised and said if the Simaks still wanted to adopt the boy, an independent social worker could assess them all to determine what was in his best interests. They agreed and, nearly a year later, the independent report concluded he should be returned to them as soon as possible. The Simaks were assessed and approved by a second adoption panel, in September 2020. It had been more than two years since the Simaks had the child, but they were regularly sent photos and videos of him. The last one they received was in April 2021. But a fortnight later, they were told he would not be coming back after all. They discovered Bradford had commissioned a new therapeutic assessment. It said the boy wasn't suitable for adoption and should stay in long-term foster care for the rest of his childhood. The couple decided to take legal action. ""We felt there was injustice against our little boy,"" Sonny said. ""He had a family waiting for him and they took that away. How can you do that ? We felt we needed to be his voice."" Before the case came to court, Bradford Council offered to settle the claim without contesting any of the assertions made by the Simaks. The couple's solicitor, Nigel Priestey, said they received ""a five-figure settlement"" and the authority also agreed to pay their legal costs. ""That's the action of a local authority that's been found out,"" he added. Following on from the Star Hobson case, Mr Priestley says the DfE should look at how decisions are made within Bradford's children's services. Bradford Council said it could not comment on an individual case, but it always puts the best interests and wellbeing of children at the core of its decisions. ""When we make decisions regarding the long-term placement of a child we take into account all assessments including updated or new assessments from a range of partners working with the child. We will continue to engage with Mr and Mrs Simak to work through their concerns."" A Department for Education spokesman said it was awaiting a report from its commissioner, appointed to assess Bradford Council. ""On seeing his final report we will not hesitate to take further action to drive rapid improvements."" The Simaks now hope the Department for Education's inquiry could mean their case is reviewed and, as unlikely as it seems, the boy could come back to them. ""We worry about him"" said Sarita. ""We don't want him to spend the rest of his life in foster care, that's why we fought for him."" ""We were a family and they broke us,"" she added. ""They broke our family twice. And they did it just so casually.""

That's all for our live coverage of the first minister's statement today. Join us again next time. Chris McLaughlinBBC Scotland Sports News Correspondent This is clearly the news that major sporting bodies and fans
were hoping for. There were genuine fears, from within football at least, that
the first minister would push the date back once again. It now appears that the
increase in Covid passport checks outside stadia has allowed her to throw the
doors back open, but with a sense of continued caution. The Scottish government
say the decision is based purely on the science but thereâs no doubt that the
move is timely, from a political perspective. With the Six Nations fast
approaching, could the first minister really have watched on if Scotlandâs home
games had been moved south for the sake of attendance? It was certainly being
discussed. As talk now turns to how we learn to live with Covid, this latest
sporting sigh of relief will be accompanied by the hope that fans are be back
for good. Boris and Carrie Johnson are alleged to have attended the lockdown drinks gathering in the Downing Street garden Nicola Sturgeon says Boris Johnson should quit over the
latest revelations aboutparties in Downing Street during lockdown. The first minister says âserial breaches of guidance that
people were following through painful sacrificesâ means the office of prime
minister would be ""greatly enhanced by Boris Johnson's departure from
it"". The first minister was responding to a question from Green
MSP Gillian Mackay who described the No 10 revelations as âabsolutely sickeningâ. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The first minister says restrictions have
made the difference, alongside boosters and public behaviour, to ensure the NHS
was protected from a surge of cases all at once, but she does acknowledge it is
difficult to prove a direct link. Nicola Sturgeon also says there are
signs things are improving, paving the way to ease more measures. So where does that leave us? Eventually, the expectation is that Covid
will be a concern for scientists and the NHS with far less impact on our daily
lives. The hope is it will become a more manageable disease. But in the short-term, the data on positive cases is becoming less reliable with the move to
relying on lateral flow tests to record positive cases. That will make it
more challenging for modellers to make projections and to monitor for new
variants. And right now, Covid continues to have a
significant impact on the health service. The numbers of patients in
hospital is up 40% on this time last week, and staff absences are high. Even if vaccines and treatments mean beds can be freed up more quickly and far
fewer end up in intensive care, it still means the health service has
very little capacity to do anything other than the most urgent or emergency
care. This all stores up a different set of future problems for the NHS.  SNP MSP Joe FitzPatrick asks the first minister about calls to cut the self-isolation period to five days and whether the Scottish government is considering this. Ms Sturgeon replies that as with all areas related to Covid, decisions will be kept under review by clinicians. She notes that the decision has just recently been made to move from 10 days' self-isolation to seven (provided you feel well and don't have a fever, and that you return negative lateral flow tests on day six and day seven). This was not an insignificant decision, or one that came without risk, she adds. She says in the period ahead, the impact of the move from 10 to seven days will be monitored before any decision is made about reducing self-isolation further. Alex Cole-Hamilton picks up on the first ministerâs comments
about âliving with Covidâ by asking what is happening with support for those
suffering from the long-term impact of the virus. The Scottish Lib Dem leader points out more than 100,000
people in Scotland are thought to have Long Covid. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish governmentâs Long Covid
action plan is being implemented and adds it is âwrong and an over-simplificationâ
to focus only on specialist clinics as a way of supporting people in this situation. Mr Sarwar also asks whether Holyrood will be given a vote on the new Covid framework before it comes into force. He adds that any deviations from the framework must also come before parliament for consent. Ms Sturgeon replies that parliament will be asked to vote on the revised framework. But she says the virus ""doesn't wait til parliament considers things. Sometimes, governments have to make decisions quickly in the interest of public health and safety."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar asks the first minister to confirm whether the new strategic framework for dealing with Covid will provide ""clearly set-out trigger points for future restrictions"". For example, these would include infection rates, hospitalisations and staff absences. He also asks about key triggers on what financial support restrictions will trigger. Mr Sarwar says this will be important for businesses to allow them to plan, as well as for people to make their own decisions about protecting themselves. People cannot live their lives waiting for ad hoc updates on what the rules will be day-to-day.  âBusinesses and workers cannot plan for the future properly if they cannot predict the government's response."" Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour leader Ms Sturgeon responds that the government wants to give as much clarity and predictability as possible on the triggers for more restrictions. ""We are dealing with an infectious, unpredictable, mutating virus. ""Any government that gets itself stuck in fixed triggers or fixed ways of thinking about things is not serving the health of the country well and we will not do that,"" she adds. Douglas Ross questions the Scottish governmentâs plans to increase the number of vaccine passport spot-checks at bigger sporting events. The Tory MSP and MP says the move is âdisappointingâ and asks
how feasible it is to check more than 30,000 Covid certificates at Murrayfield when
Scotland open their Six Nations campaign next month. Nicola Sturgeon says she has âevery confidenceâ in both the
rugby and football authorities to be able to cope with the increase in the number
of spot-checks they now need to carry out. Douglas Ross says the public deserve credit for the way the country
has dealt with the Omicron threat. The Scottish Conservatives leader says the âoutlook is more positive
now not because of government restrictions but because of peopleâs good senseâ. He adds, âthe people of Scotland got this right, not the
government.â Nicola Sturgeon says âwe are in a more positive placeâ but
there âremains significant uncertaintiesâ and this justifies her cautious
approach. Ms Sturgeon says she wants to speak about how we can learn to live with Covid. She says plans are being drawn up for how we might adapt in the medium and longer term to mitigate harm without the need for restrictions. ""Hopefully, we are on a path from Covid being an epidemic to it becoming endemic - in other words, existing at more manageable and consistent levels.""

"Heathrow warns return to normal travel years awayBritain's busiest airport wants an end to testing for all vaccinated travellers, as passengers hit 50-year low.","At least 600,000 passengers scrapped plans to fly from Heathrow Airport last month as the Omicron coronavirus strain sparked tougher travel restrictions. Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said it underlined the crisis in the industry and the uncertainty facing travellers. A return to normal ""could be years away"", the chief executive of the UK's busiest airport warned. Just 19.4 million passengers passed through Heathrow in 2021 - 12.3% below 2020, the year the pandemic began. Last year's number, the lowest for Heathrow for 50 years, was less than a quarter of the pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. Mr Holland-Kaye said it was time for all coronavirus testing measures to be dropped for fully-vaccinated people. Fears over the Omicron Covid variant meant that, from late November, all travellers arriving in the UK were required to take a pre-departure lateral flow test and self-isolate until they received a negative result from a post-arrival PCR test. This led to many people scrapping their travel plans over the festive period. The new rules were relaxed for fully-vaccinated arrivals last week after travel firms said they were ineffective due to Omicron spreading widely within the UK. That move sparked a rush of bookings, airlines reported. What tests do I need to go on holiday? Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""There are currently travel restrictions, such as testing, on all Heathrow routes - the aviation industry will only fully recover when these are all lifted and there is no risk that they will be re-imposed at short notice, a situation which is likely to be years away."" John Holland-Kaye says the aviation regulator could help ease the uncertainty. He warned this creates ""enormous uncertainty"" for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the aviation regulator, as it prepares to set a five-year cap on Heathrow's passenger charges. ""The regulator must focus on an outcome that improves service, incentivises growth and maintains affordable private financing."" The CAA increased the cap on Heathrow's price per passenger from Â£19.60 to Â£30.19 from 1 January, sparking complaints from airlines that the rise was far too high. The CAA is expected to announce a long-term cap running from the summer to 2027 in the coming weeks. Heathrow said travel to and from the Asia-Pacific region in 2021 was particularly badly hit, down 40.3% from a year earlier. The other markets with double-digit reductions were non-EU Europe (down 13.8%) and North America (down 13.6%). Domestic travel bucked the trend, with a 21.1% boost in passengers compared with 2020.

'Half of Europe' to be infected with Omicron - WHO,"The World Health Organization has warned that half of Europe will have caught the Omicron Covid variant within the next six to eight weeks. Dr Hans Kluge said a ""west-to-east tidal wave"" of Omicron was sweeping across the region, on top of a surge in the Delta variant. The projection was based on the seven million new cases reported across Europe in the first week of 2022. The number of infections has more than doubled in a two-week period. ""Today the Omicron variant represents a new west-to-east tidal wave, sweeping across the region on top of the Delta surge that all countries were managing until late 2021,"" Dr Kluge told a news conference. He quoted the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation as forecasting that ""more than 50 percent of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks"". He said European and Central Asian countries remained under ""intense pressure"" as the virus spread from western countries into the Balkans. ""How each country now responds must be informed by its epidemiological situation, available resources, vaccination uptake status and socio-economic context"", he added. Recent studies suggest that Omicron is less likely to make people seriously ill than previous Covid variants. But Omicron is still highly contagious and can infect people even if they are fully vaccinated. The record number of people catching it has left health systems under severe strain. On Monday, the UK reported a further 142,224 confirmed cases of the virus and 77 deaths. A number of hospitals have declared ""critical"" incidents due to staff absences and rising pressures caused by Covid. Elsewhere, hospital numbers are also rising. France's Health Minister Olivier Veran warned last week that January would be tough for hospitals. He added that Omicron patients were taking up ""conventional"" beds in hospitals while Delta was putting a strain on ICU departments. In eastern Europe, Poland reported that 100,000 people had died from the virus in the country since the start of the pandemic. Poland now has the sixth-highest mortality rate in the world from Covid-19, and almost 40% of its population remains unvaccinated. In Russia, top consumer health official Anna Popova told a meeting of the government's coronavirus task force that without action to control the spread of the virus, the daily number of new Covid cases there could reach 100,000. The daily infection rate had recently been declining from a peak of 41,335 cases recorded in early November, Reuters news agency reports. Ms Popova said 305 known cases of the Omicron variant had been detected so far, in 13 of the country's regions. Russia has registered at least 311,281 deaths and 10.5 million cases to date. On Monday, the pharmaceutical firm Pfizer said it would be able to launch a version of its vaccine that offers special protection against Omicron, to be rolled out in March. Health experts say it is not yet clear whether this is needed.

LiveLiveCovid in Scotland: Outdoor event restriction to be lifted4 minutes ago,"Nicola Sturgeon confirms the lifting of restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland from Monday, 17 January. This will allow fans to return in their thousands to football and rugby matches The current rules around social distancing, table service and mask wearing in pubs and restaurants will remain in place The first minister also says that as restrictions are lifted it might be necessary to extend ""the scope"" of vaccine certificates Ms Sturgeon adds: ""To be clear, we have not yet taken any decisions on this and it will require careful judgment."" Scottish Conservative Party leader Douglas Ross says the public are already learning to live with the virus and he believes people will be dismayed at a vaccine passport scheme extension In her statement, the FM says that the current wave of the virus in Scotland is ""at or near to the peak"" The latest on cases shows that there were 10,392 new positive PCR tests which represents 27.7% of all lab tests undertaken BBC Scotland News  Allow Twitter content?

That's all for our live coverage of the first minister's statement today. Join us again next time. Chris McLaughlinBBC Scotland Sports News Correspondent This is clearly the news that major sporting bodies and fans
were hoping for. There were genuine fears, from within football at least, that
the first minister would push the date back once again. It now appears that the
increase in Covid passport checks outside stadia has allowed her to throw the
doors back open, but with a sense of continued caution. The Scottish government
say the decision is based purely on the science but thereâs no doubt that the
move is timely, from a political perspective. With the Six Nations fast
approaching, could the first minister really have watched on if Scotlandâs home
games had been moved south for the sake of attendance? It was certainly being
discussed. As talk now turns to how we learn to live with Covid, this latest
sporting sigh of relief will be accompanied by the hope that fans are be back
for good. Boris and Carrie Johnson are alleged to have attended the lockdown drinks gathering in the Downing Street garden Nicola Sturgeon says Boris Johnson should quit over the
latest revelations aboutparties in Downing Street during lockdown. The first minister says âserial breaches of guidance that
people were following through painful sacrificesâ means the office of prime
minister would be ""greatly enhanced by Boris Johnson's departure from
it"". The first minister was responding to a question from Green
MSP Gillian Mackay who described the No 10 revelations as âabsolutely sickeningâ. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The first minister says restrictions have
made the difference, alongside boosters and public behaviour, to ensure the NHS
was protected from a surge of cases all at once, but she does acknowledge it is
difficult to prove a direct link. Nicola Sturgeon also says there are
signs things are improving, paving the way to ease more measures. So where does that leave us? Eventually, the expectation is that Covid
will be a concern for scientists and the NHS with far less impact on our daily
lives. The hope is it will become a more manageable disease. But in the short-term, the data on positive cases is becoming less reliable with the move to
relying on lateral flow tests to record positive cases. That will make it
more challenging for modellers to make projections and to monitor for new
variants. And right now, Covid continues to have a
significant impact on the health service. The numbers of patients in
hospital is up 40% on this time last week, and staff absences are high. Even if vaccines and treatments mean beds can be freed up more quickly and far
fewer end up in intensive care, it still means the health service has
very little capacity to do anything other than the most urgent or emergency
care. This all stores up a different set of future problems for the NHS.  SNP MSP Joe FitzPatrick asks the first minister about calls to cut the self-isolation period to five days and whether the Scottish government is considering this. Ms Sturgeon replies that as with all areas related to Covid, decisions will be kept under review by clinicians. She notes that the decision has just recently been made to move from 10 days' self-isolation to seven (provided you feel well and don't have a fever, and that you return negative lateral flow tests on day six and day seven). This was not an insignificant decision, or one that came without risk, she adds. She says in the period ahead, the impact of the move from 10 to seven days will be monitored before any decision is made about reducing self-isolation further. Alex Cole-Hamilton picks up on the first ministerâs comments
about âliving with Covidâ by asking what is happening with support for those
suffering from the long-term impact of the virus. The Scottish Lib Dem leader points out more than 100,000
people in Scotland are thought to have Long Covid. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish governmentâs Long Covid
action plan is being implemented and adds it is âwrong and an over-simplificationâ
to focus only on specialist clinics as a way of supporting people in this situation. Mr Sarwar also asks whether Holyrood will be given a vote on the new Covid framework before it comes into force. He adds that any deviations from the framework must also come before parliament for consent. Ms Sturgeon replies that parliament will be asked to vote on the revised framework. But she says the virus ""doesn't wait til parliament considers things. Sometimes, governments have to make decisions quickly in the interest of public health and safety."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar asks the first minister to confirm whether the new strategic framework for dealing with Covid will provide ""clearly set-out trigger points for future restrictions"". For example, these would include infection rates, hospitalisations and staff absences. He also asks about key triggers on what financial support restrictions will trigger. Mr Sarwar says this will be important for businesses to allow them to plan, as well as for people to make their own decisions about protecting themselves. People cannot live their lives waiting for ad hoc updates on what the rules will be day-to-day.  âBusinesses and workers cannot plan for the future properly if they cannot predict the government's response."" Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour leader Ms Sturgeon responds that the government wants to give as much clarity and predictability as possible on the triggers for more restrictions. ""We are dealing with an infectious, unpredictable, mutating virus. ""Any government that gets itself stuck in fixed triggers or fixed ways of thinking about things is not serving the health of the country well and we will not do that,"" she adds. Douglas Ross questions the Scottish governmentâs plans to increase the number of vaccine passport spot-checks at bigger sporting events. The Tory MSP and MP says the move is âdisappointingâ and asks
how feasible it is to check more than 30,000 Covid certificates at Murrayfield when
Scotland open their Six Nations campaign next month. Nicola Sturgeon says she has âevery confidenceâ in both the
rugby and football authorities to be able to cope with the increase in the number
of spot-checks they now need to carry out. Douglas Ross says the public deserve credit for the way the country
has dealt with the Omicron threat. The Scottish Conservatives leader says the âoutlook is more positive
now not because of government restrictions but because of peopleâs good senseâ. He adds, âthe people of Scotland got this right, not the
government.â Nicola Sturgeon says âwe are in a more positive placeâ but
there âremains significant uncertaintiesâ and this justifies her cautious
approach. Ms Sturgeon says she wants to speak about how we can learn to live with Covid. She says plans are being drawn up for how we might adapt in the medium and longer term to mitigate harm without the need for restrictions. ""Hopefully, we are on a path from Covid being an epidemic to it becoming endemic - in other words, existing at more manageable and consistent levels."" Nicola Sturgeon, First minister A revised framework is being prepared and the Scottish government will consult with parliament, business organisations and other partners across society. The new framework will be published within the next few weeks, Ms Sturgeon adds. Ms Sturgeon says there are still too many eligible people
not yet fully vaccinated. She says someone not fully vaccinated is at least four times more likely
to require hospital treatment than someone who has had a booster or third dose. The FM urges everyone to get their booster jab. There is plenty of capacity in vaccination
centres, she says, and you will always be welcomed. Nicola Sturgeon warns âdifficult choicesâ such as pausing or
reducing some services to protect social care services may need to be taken in the coming weeks. The first minister says this is being driven by the âsignificant
impactâ of staff absences as a result of the Omicron wave. Ms Sturgeon also announces an additional Â£5m to improve ventilation in schools and nurseries. The first minister continues that the Cabinet will review the data again when it meets a week today. She says she hopes at this meeting it will be decided to lift more restrictions - including on indoor live events, table service in
hospitality and distancing in indoor public places - from 24 January. She says as these measures are lifted it will be necessary to consider whether the use of vaccine passports may have to be extended. The requirements for face coverings and working from home will remain in place for now, she says. For at least the immediate period
ahead, the advice to limit contact with
people in other households, and in particular to limit the number of households
in any indoor gathering to a maximum of three, will also remain in place. Question from Ann in Haddington You can get a Covid passport a few ways. You candownload the NHS Scotland Covid Status app,externalonto your mobile device, for example onto your smartphone (if you have one). Or, you candownload or request a copy of your vaccination status online,externalor by phoning the COVID Status Helpline on 0808 196 8565. The number of people in hospital with Covid has continued to increase over the past week, the FM says. But there are signs the rate of increase is slowing. Two weeks ago, the number increased from 594 to 1,147 this time last weekâ an increase of 553. Since then, it has risen further to 1,479 - an increase
of 332. Ms Sturgeon also says numbers of Covid patients in ICU have increased more rapidly than in the previous two weeks. But, she notes, this could be down to the lag between people becoming hospitalised, and them requiring intensive care. There are still uncertainties, though, and we do not know what impact the return to work and school after Christmas will have on infection levels, she says. The situation in Scotland just now is undoubtedly serious but perhaps less so than it might have been, and there are also some signs that we may be starting to turn a corner."" Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The definition of being fully vaccinated for the purpose of using
vaccine passports is to change, Nicola Sturgeon announces. From Monday, being âfully vaccinatedâ for Covid certification
will include having a booster if the second dose was more than four months
ago. The NHS Scotland Covid status app will be
updated from Thursday so that its QR code includes evidence of booster
vaccination. It will also be possible to order updated paper and PDF
copies of vaccination status, which are now valid for three months. It will still be possible to gain admission to events and venues by
providing proof of a recent negative lateral flow test, instead of a vaccine
passport. The attendance limit of 500 people at
large-scale outdoor events will be lifted from 17 January, Nicola Sturgeon
confirms. This means top-flight football fixtures
scheduled for early next week will be allowed to have full crowds as well as the forthcoming
Six Nations rugby matches. One change for those attending these events is
that the Covid certification scheme is to be expanded. Organisers of large events of 1,000 or more
people will be required to check the certification status of at least 50% of
attendees (up from the 20% previously required) or at least 1,000 people -
whichever figure is higher. Last week, it was announced that people without symptoms who test positive on a lateral flow test will no longer need to have their result confimed by a PCR test. Ms Sturgeon says this change means the
current daily numbers are capturing fewer positive cases than before. This will lead to changes in how case numbers are reported by Public Health Scotland. From Thursday, the number will be combined - to include those who test positive either with a PCR or lateral flow test. This will mean a time lag in reporting case numbers initially, she adds. But the new way of reporting should allow the trend in cases to be reported more accurately than it is now. She concludes by urging everyone to make sure they report their lateral flow results - whether positive or negative. Question from Donald in Edinburgh Yes, the guidance is still to limit mixing to three households. Before Christmas, the first minister made what she called a ""request"" to the public to ""reduce as far as possible - to a minimum - the contacts that we have with people from other households"". She said mixing between households was not going to be banned or restricted in law, as happened before. Instead, she said her government would be issuing ""strong guidance"" to ""cut down as far as possible the number of people from outside our own households with whom we interact"". Ms Sturgeon did ask those who were going to socialise - either at home or in indoor public places - to limit each gathering to a maximum of three households, and for everyone to do a lateral flow test beforehand.

PCR tests end in England for no-symptoms cases,"A positive lateral flow result can be taken as a confirmation that you have Covid if you have no symptoms, the UK Health Security Agency says People without Covid symptoms no longer need a PCR test to confirm a positive lateral flow in England. The change reflects the high prevalence of coronavirus in the community and the accuracy of rapid tests,the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.,external The surge in Omicron cases has seen many with positive lateral flow tests struggling to book a follow-up PCR. The UK has capacity for more than 800,000 daily lab tests but moved closer to its limit in December. On 23 December, a total of 622,948 PCR tests were taken and on 28 December the figure was 630,768,government figures show.,external And the demand grew further in the first week of 2022, reaching 698,502 PCR tests on 6 January and 613,496 on Sunday 9 January. It is hoped the change will improve access to PCR tests for people with symptoms and for healthcare, transport and other key workers required to test regularly. Those who have one of the three main Covid symptoms - high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to the sense of smell or taste -  must still get a PCR test, the government said. On Monday, daily testing of 100,000 critical workers in industries such as food processing, transport and the border force began. Reported coronavirus cases in the UK reached a 218,724 high last Tuesday but then fell, with the latest data showing 142,224 new infections on Monday. When should I take a Covid test now? What are the Covid self-isolation rules? How do I know I have Omicron? When can I have a booster? Announcing the temporary halting of follow-up PCR tests,externalon Wednesday, the UKHSA said lateral flows were more than 80% effective ""at finding people with high viral loads who are most infectious"". And it added that, for every 10,000 lateral flow tests carried out, there were likely to be fewer than three false positive results. The requirement was previously suspended between January and March 2021 at a time of high virus prevalence. Those who test positive on a lateral flow but have no symptoms must still self-isolate for up to 10 days, but they can end quarantine if they receive two negative lateral flow test results, 24 hours apart, on days six and seven. The changes, which have already been introduced in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, do not apply to people who have symptoms. They will still need to book a follow up PCR test. Lateral flow tests can be done at home, and show results in 20-30 minutes. PCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis, with results provided in 24-48 hours Health officials stress it is still important asymptomatic people register a positive lateral flow test on the government website so case numbers can be reflected accurately and contact tracing can take place. There are some exemptions to the new rule. People who receive Test and Trace financial support, those taking part in Covid research studies and about one million people in England eligible for new NHS treatments for Covid will all be asked to take a follow-up PCR. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would ""look at the science"" on the possibility of cutting the minimum isolation period for people who tested positive, from seven days to five. However, the possibility was not discussed by cabinet ministers on Tuesday, Downing Street has confirmed. The PM's official spokesman said the government was ""gathering the latest evidence"" and keeping the issue under review to ""make sure we have the right approach"". He said: ""But what we're absolutely not doing is prejudging anything. ""The prime minister hasn't received formal advice either way yet. So, we'll await that and then make a decision."" The UKHSA, which is leading work on the issue along with the government's Covid taskforce based in the Cabinet Office, has now clarified the recommended self-isolation period in the US is five days and therefore shorter than in the UK. It had previously said the isolation period was effectively the same in both countries. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cut the recommended isolation period there to five days in December.

Labour question PM's integrity over drinks party,"MPs in the Commons have been asking minister Michael Ellis for more details on an alleged drinks party at No 10 during lockdown Labour's Angela Rayner asked if Boris Johnson knew about the party in May 2020 and called on him to respond personally Michael Ellis said he had confidence in the PM, but would not comment on the ongoing investigation into various gatherings About 100 people were invited to the ""bring-your-own-booze"" event in the Downing Street garden in the first lockdown, the BBC understands Witnesses say Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie were among about 30 people at the gathering on 20 May 2020 Meanwhile, from today, people without Covid symptoms no longer need a PCR test to confirm a positive lateral flow in England Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland will be lifted from Monday, allowing football and rugby fans to fully return to matches Edited by Hamish Mackay It's goodbye from us for now but we'll be back with all the latest updates tomorrow. Today's live page was the work of Mary O'Connor, Alex Kleiderman, Nathan Williams, Chris Giles, Alys Davies, Kate Whannel, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Marie Jackson. It was edited by Hamish Mackay and Emma Owen. On a day that's been dominated by that Downing Street drinks party, here's a round-up of what's been happening in the UK and elsewhere: BBC Reality Check During the first
lockdown â 27 March to 1 June 2020 â 17,981fines were issued,externalfor breaking
Covid-19 restrictions. We donât know
exactly how many of those were for illegal gatherings of more than 30 people on
private properties, but it wasnât very many.Only 29 fines,externalwere issued for that
offence in first and second lockdowns put together. During first
lockdown,fines,externalfor those attending illegal indoor gatherings of more than
30 people were Â£100 â or Â£50 if paid quickly â doubling after each offence. Not all of the fines
imposed will have been paid. Between March 2020 and August 2021,prosecutors checked,external2,098 cases that had been challenged. They ruled that 445 had been
incorrectly charged and 348 cases were withdrawn. This video can not be played Serbia PM: I can't agree with Djokovic jab decision On Monday, we reported extensively ontennis star Novak Djokovic winning a legal battle in Australia to overturn his visa cancellationto play at the Australian Open. But Australian officials have said they're still considering whether or not to deport him. Now, Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic has told the BBC she remains hopeful the world men's number one will be allowed to defend his singles title at the tournament. Following a phone conversation with her Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison, she said Serbia understood Australia's restrictive Covid rules and procedures, and that Belgrade was not looking for any special treatment for Djokovic. I donât think this is the end of the whole saga. I am hoping Novak will be able to play in the Australian Open Ana Brnabic, Serbian Prime Minister ""Whatâs important is that Novak is treated equally, that he gets a fair chance. We support him, but at the same time itâs important to keep the relationship strong between the two countries."" On Djokovic attending public events after his positive PCR test, she said that if he had done so, it would be a clear breach of Serbian rules. ""What we donât know is when he actually saw his results, so there is some grey area, and I think the only answer to this can be provided by Novak."" She also said she didn't understand why you wouldnât want to get vaccinated, but that ""in a democracy you have to respect a personâs decision"". As Omicron becomes the dominant variant across the globe, some BBC World News viewers have been sending in questions. Would it be accurate to say Omicron is like a bad flu? Have countries started changing their travel restrictions? Can having a cold over winter protect you against Covid? BBC World Newsâs Lucy Hockings put these questions and others to Prof David Montefiori, immunologist at Duke University, and Julia Lo Bue-Said the CEO at The Advantage Travel Partnership. This video can not be played Is Omicron like bad flu? Your questions answered Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter United
Airlines will reduce its schedule due to staff shortages this month, in the
latest sign of economic strains caused by the Omicron variant. Chief
executive Scott Kirby said some 3,000 employees were out sick - about 4% of its
US workforce. At one point, one-third of its staff at its main hub in New
Jersey called out with the virus, he said. The moves
follow widespread flight cancellations in recent weeks. Transit systems in the
US have also reduced service, while retailers such as Apple and Macyâs have cut
hours at some store, and school districts such as Chicago have cancelled
classes. Firms including Facebook have delayed return-to-office plans. Speaking to
Congress on Tuesday, the head of Americaâs central bank said the pandemic was
causing economic disruption for far longer than most experts anticipated. âTwo years
ago, I donât think we would have said we would still be having record levels of
cases and [near] record levels of hospitalisation,â Federal Reserve Chair
Jerome Powell said. âGetting past the pandemic is the most important thing we
can do.â  Her name keeps popping up, but beside being the senior civil servant leading the Downing Street parties' inquiry, what else do we know about Sue Gray? Gray, who is married to a country and western singer, has worked in several departments including transport and health, but is not a typical career civil servant. In the late 1980s she took a career break to run a pub in Northern Ireland - a job she said she loved but would never do again. Having served as head of the Cabinet Office's ethics team, she is experienced at investigating ministers. In 2012, her inquiry into ""plebgate"" led to the resignation of then-chief whip Andrew Mitchell. Mitchell admitted using bad language towards a police officer, but denied calling him a ""pleb"". And a 2017 investigation forced Damian Green to step down as minister after he was found to have made ""inaccurate"" statements over what he knew about claims pornography was found on his office computer in 2008. Last year her application to become head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service was rejected - something she attributed to being ""too much of a challenger"". In case you missed it earlier, Labour's deputy leader told MPs there would be no need for an investigation in to a party in Downing Street if the prime minister explained if he knew about it and if he attended. Angela Rayner said the government could not ""blame it on a few junior civil servants"". Paymaster General Michael Ellis, answering Rayner's question in the Commons, said he had confidence in Boris Johnson's honour and integrity. This video can not be played Rayner and Ellis on Johnson role in No 10 work lockdown party Children's author Michael Rosen, who himself was seriously ill with Covid, has been talking to BBC News about the latest Downing Street party claims. He reflects that Covid has involved hundreds of thousands of people who've all been damaged in some way by the pandemic - creating a kind of social trauma, much like the London Blitz during World War Two. He says: ""I don't think we have begun to deal with this social trauma. But worse, this is just the opposite of dealing with it. ""Instead of the equivalent of wreaths at the Cenotaph, what we're getting is 'oh, we were partying while you were doing that'. ""It's an appalling feeling to just think of that."" A further 379 deaths have been reported within 28 days of a positive cornavirus test, official UK figuresshow,external. There have now been 1,660 deaths by this measure in the last seven days - an 80% increase on the seven previous days. There have also been another 120,821 Covid cases recorded across the UK. Meanwhile, the World Bank has said the global economy faces a ""grim outlook"", as the aftershocks of the pandemic continue to weigh on growth, especially in poor countries. The organisation's latest forecast predicts global growth will slow to 4.1% this year from 5.5% in 2021. It attributes the slowdown to virus threats, government aid unwinding and an initial rebound in demand fading. But World Bank President David Malpass says his greatest worry is widening global inequality. ""The big drag is the inequality that's built into the system,"" he tells the BBC, noting that poorer countries are especially vulnerable to economic damage from efforts to fight inflation. ""The outlook for the weaker countries is still to fall further and further behind. That causes insecurity."" Read more here.

He told Parliament how his mother-in-law had died alone with Covid during the pandemic and said the government must ensure ""full and complete disclosure"" over the Downing Street party claims. Read the full storyhere. We've got a bit more now from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who calls on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign over news of thebring-your-own-booze Downing Street garden party during lockdown. She tells MSPs that people are ""aghast"" at Downing Street's behaviour, which appears to show ""serial breaches of guidance"" that the public followed despite the ""painful sacrifices"" involved. Accusing Johnson of ""not being truthful"" about his knowledge of events, she argues the office of prime minister and UK interests would be ""greatly enhanced"" by his resignation. In
the week of the drinks party at No 10 Downing Street, the police handed out hundreds
of fines to people for breaking coronavirus laws. The
latest police data shows there were 807 fixed penalty notices in the week between 15
and 21 May 2020 for Covid law breaches in England and Wales. Most
of these would have related to people breaking rules on gatherings and movement. At
the time,people couldn't leave their homes without a reasonable excuse, such as work, exercise and getting things like food and medicine. The
police in England could fine people Â£100 for a first offence, which could then
double for each further offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. We've heard a number of people this morning refer to the independent inquiry into Downing Street lockdown parties that's being led by senior civil servant Sue Gray. She was appointed to head up the inquiry after Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant,stepped aside from the role following reports a party was held in his office while London was under Covid rules. Boris Johnson announced an inquiry would be carried out at the beginning of last month,after a video from last year emerged of government staff joking about a partythat took place on 18 December - a day on which more than 400 Covid deaths were reported. Which events is the inquiry investigating?  A full list of reported government lockdown parties can be foundhere. Labourâs former director of communications, Alastair Campbell, is the latest to add his voice to calls for the prime minister to consider his position. He tells BBC News if Boris Johnson is found to have broken his âown lawâ in relation to Covid restrictions âhis position is untenableâ and âhe has to goâ. Campbell - who was a key aide to Tony Blair - says heâs âsurprisedâ at the âreluctance of the policeâ to get involved in any of the previous allegations of gatherings that took place in Downing Street in 2020. They now being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray. Campbell believes ""the police have to get involved nowâ because he says there has been âa crime in the garden of Downing Streetâ. The son of a Bletchley Park codebreaker whose funeral was held on the same day as lockdown drinks in Downing Street is the latest to share his shock at the claims, saying heâs ""totally gobsmacked"". Ann Mitchell, who was part of a World War Two code-breaking team, died in May 2020, aged 97, after testing positive for Covid. Her son, Andy Mitchell, said just five people attended her funeral in Edinburgh. He added that they had a âquick chatâ afterwards before returning home, with ""no drinks in the garden or anything like that"". As we just mentioned, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that attendance limits on live outdoor events in Scotland will end on Monday. In her Covid update to MSPs at Holyrood, she also announced:  The first minister says she hopes the cabinet will decide to lift more restrictions - including on indoor live events, table service in hospitality and distancing in indoor public places - from 24 January. Sturgeon says, as these measures are lifted, it will be necessary to consider whether the use of vaccine passports may have to be extended. Antony Mullen, leader of the Conservatives on Sunderland Council, says he does not see how the prime minister can survive these latest allegations. He described claims that Boris Johnson's private secretary, Martin Reynolds, invited about 100 No 10 staff members to a ""bring-your-own-booze"" garden party in May 2020 as ""absolutely appalling"". ""I thinkMartin Reynoldsshould have been sacked and I think Boris Johnson will inevitably have to follow him,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme. Mullen added that he believed an investigation into Downing Street parties would now likely find that Johnson misled the Commons. Restrictions on attendance levels at live outdoor events in Scotland will be removed from next Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms. The move will allow fans to return to stadiums when the Scottish Premiership's winter break ends. It will also avoid Scotland's Six Nations rugby matches having to be played behind closed doors at Murrayfield. A limit of 500 people at outdoor events has been in place since Boxing Day. Speaking to MSPs at Holyrood, Sturgeon says there are some signs Scotland is ""starting to turn the corner"" on the Omicron variant spike, while the nation's latest Covid figures gave grounds for ""encouragement"". Up to 30,000 positive cases a day are being recorded, almost half the initial projection of 50,000 per day, she says. She cautions there are still ""uncertainties"" in the data to be addressed, including the impact of the post-Christmas return to work and school. But she says we do know that high case numbers are disrupting the economy and critical services, while the NHS remains under ""severe pressure"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Covid in Scotland: Update on restrictions,"Nicola Sturgeon confirms the lifting of restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland from Monday, 17 January. This will allow fans to return in their thousands to football and rugby matches The current rules around social distancing, table service and mask wearing in pubs and restaurants will remain in place The first minister also says that as restrictions are lifted it might be necessary to extend ""the scope"" of vaccine certificates Ms Sturgeon adds: ""To be clear, we have not yet taken any decisions on this and it will require careful judgment."" Scottish Conservative Party leader Douglas Ross says the public are already learning to live with the virus and he believes people will be dismayed at a vaccine passport scheme extension In her statement, the FM says that the current wave of the virus in Scotland is ""at or near to the peak"" The latest on cases shows that there were 10,392 new positive PCR tests which represents 27.7% of all lab tests undertaken BBC Scotland News  Allow Twitter content?

That's all for our live coverage of the first minister's statement today. Join us again next time. Chris McLaughlinBBC Scotland Sports News Correspondent This is clearly the news that major sporting bodies and fans
were hoping for. There were genuine fears, from within football at least, that
the first minister would push the date back once again. It now appears that the
increase in Covid passport checks outside stadia has allowed her to throw the
doors back open, but with a sense of continued caution. The Scottish government
say the decision is based purely on the science but thereâs no doubt that the
move is timely, from a political perspective. With the Six Nations fast
approaching, could the first minister really have watched on if Scotlandâs home
games had been moved south for the sake of attendance? It was certainly being
discussed. As talk now turns to how we learn to live with Covid, this latest
sporting sigh of relief will be accompanied by the hope that fans are be back
for good. Boris and Carrie Johnson are alleged to have attended the lockdown drinks gathering in the Downing Street garden Nicola Sturgeon says Boris Johnson should quit over the
latest revelations aboutparties in Downing Street during lockdown. The first minister says âserial breaches of guidance that
people were following through painful sacrificesâ means the office of prime
minister would be ""greatly enhanced by Boris Johnson's departure from
it"". The first minister was responding to a question from Green
MSP Gillian Mackay who described the No 10 revelations as âabsolutely sickeningâ. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The first minister says restrictions have
made the difference, alongside boosters and public behaviour, to ensure the NHS
was protected from a surge of cases all at once, but she does acknowledge it is
difficult to prove a direct link. Nicola Sturgeon also says there are
signs things are improving, paving the way to ease more measures. So where does that leave us? Eventually, the expectation is that Covid
will be a concern for scientists and the NHS with far less impact on our daily
lives. The hope is it will become a more manageable disease. But in the short-term, the data on positive cases is becoming less reliable with the move to
relying on lateral flow tests to record positive cases. That will make it
more challenging for modellers to make projections and to monitor for new
variants. And right now, Covid continues to have a
significant impact on the health service. The numbers of patients in
hospital is up 40% on this time last week, and staff absences are high. Even if vaccines and treatments mean beds can be freed up more quickly and far
fewer end up in intensive care, it still means the health service has
very little capacity to do anything other than the most urgent or emergency
care. This all stores up a different set of future problems for the NHS.  SNP MSP Joe FitzPatrick asks the first minister about calls to cut the self-isolation period to five days and whether the Scottish government is considering this. Ms Sturgeon replies that as with all areas related to Covid, decisions will be kept under review by clinicians. She notes that the decision has just recently been made to move from 10 days' self-isolation to seven (provided you feel well and don't have a fever, and that you return negative lateral flow tests on day six and day seven). This was not an insignificant decision, or one that came without risk, she adds. She says in the period ahead, the impact of the move from 10 to seven days will be monitored before any decision is made about reducing self-isolation further. Alex Cole-Hamilton picks up on the first ministerâs comments
about âliving with Covidâ by asking what is happening with support for those
suffering from the long-term impact of the virus. The Scottish Lib Dem leader points out more than 100,000
people in Scotland are thought to have Long Covid. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish governmentâs Long Covid
action plan is being implemented and adds it is âwrong and an over-simplificationâ
to focus only on specialist clinics as a way of supporting people in this situation. Mr Sarwar also asks whether Holyrood will be given a vote on the new Covid framework before it comes into force. He adds that any deviations from the framework must also come before parliament for consent. Ms Sturgeon replies that parliament will be asked to vote on the revised framework. But she says the virus ""doesn't wait til parliament considers things. Sometimes, governments have to make decisions quickly in the interest of public health and safety."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar asks the first minister to confirm whether the new strategic framework for dealing with Covid will provide ""clearly set-out trigger points for future restrictions"". For example, these would include infection rates, hospitalisations and staff absences. He also asks about key triggers on what financial support restrictions will trigger. Mr Sarwar says this will be important for businesses to allow them to plan, as well as for people to make their own decisions about protecting themselves. People cannot live their lives waiting for ad hoc updates on what the rules will be day-to-day.  âBusinesses and workers cannot plan for the future properly if they cannot predict the government's response."" Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour leader Ms Sturgeon responds that the government wants to give as much clarity and predictability as possible on the triggers for more restrictions. ""We are dealing with an infectious, unpredictable, mutating virus. ""Any government that gets itself stuck in fixed triggers or fixed ways of thinking about things is not serving the health of the country well and we will not do that,"" she adds. Douglas Ross questions the Scottish governmentâs plans to increase the number of vaccine passport spot-checks at bigger sporting events. The Tory MSP and MP says the move is âdisappointingâ and asks
how feasible it is to check more than 30,000 Covid certificates at Murrayfield when
Scotland open their Six Nations campaign next month. Nicola Sturgeon says she has âevery confidenceâ in both the
rugby and football authorities to be able to cope with the increase in the number
of spot-checks they now need to carry out. Douglas Ross says the public deserve credit for the way the country
has dealt with the Omicron threat. The Scottish Conservatives leader says the âoutlook is more positive
now not because of government restrictions but because of peopleâs good senseâ. He adds, âthe people of Scotland got this right, not the
government.â Nicola Sturgeon says âwe are in a more positive placeâ but
there âremains significant uncertaintiesâ and this justifies her cautious
approach. Ms Sturgeon says she wants to speak about how we can learn to live with Covid. She says plans are being drawn up for how we might adapt in the medium and longer term to mitigate harm without the need for restrictions. ""Hopefully, we are on a path from Covid being an epidemic to it becoming endemic - in other words, existing at more manageable and consistent levels."" Nicola Sturgeon, First minister A revised framework is being prepared and the Scottish government will consult with parliament, business organisations and other partners across society. The new framework will be published within the next few weeks, Ms Sturgeon adds. Ms Sturgeon says there are still too many eligible people
not yet fully vaccinated. She says someone not fully vaccinated is at least four times more likely
to require hospital treatment than someone who has had a booster or third dose. The FM urges everyone to get their booster jab. There is plenty of capacity in vaccination
centres, she says, and you will always be welcomed. Nicola Sturgeon warns âdifficult choicesâ such as pausing or
reducing some services to protect social care services may need to be taken in the coming weeks. The first minister says this is being driven by the âsignificant
impactâ of staff absences as a result of the Omicron wave. Ms Sturgeon also announces an additional Â£5m to improve ventilation in schools and nurseries. The first minister continues that the Cabinet will review the data again when it meets a week today. She says she hopes at this meeting it will be decided to lift more restrictions - including on indoor live events, table service in
hospitality and distancing in indoor public places - from 24 January. She says as these measures are lifted it will be necessary to consider whether the use of vaccine passports may have to be extended. The requirements for face coverings and working from home will remain in place for now, she says. For at least the immediate period
ahead, the advice to limit contact with
people in other households, and in particular to limit the number of households
in any indoor gathering to a maximum of three, will also remain in place. Question from Ann in Haddington You can get a Covid passport a few ways. You candownload the NHS Scotland Covid Status app,externalonto your mobile device, for example onto your smartphone (if you have one). Or, you candownload or request a copy of your vaccination status online,externalor by phoning the COVID Status Helpline on 0808 196 8565. The number of people in hospital with Covid has continued to increase over the past week, the FM says. But there are signs the rate of increase is slowing. Two weeks ago, the number increased from 594 to 1,147 this time last weekâ an increase of 553. Since then, it has risen further to 1,479 - an increase
of 332. Ms Sturgeon also says numbers of Covid patients in ICU have increased more rapidly than in the previous two weeks. But, she notes, this could be down to the lag between people becoming hospitalised, and them requiring intensive care. There are still uncertainties, though, and we do not know what impact the return to work and school after Christmas will have on infection levels, she says. The situation in Scotland just now is undoubtedly serious but perhaps less so than it might have been, and there are also some signs that we may be starting to turn a corner."" Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The definition of being fully vaccinated for the purpose of using
vaccine passports is to change, Nicola Sturgeon announces. From Monday, being âfully vaccinatedâ for Covid certification
will include having a booster if the second dose was more than four months
ago. The NHS Scotland Covid status app will be
updated from Thursday so that its QR code includes evidence of booster
vaccination. It will also be possible to order updated paper and PDF
copies of vaccination status, which are now valid for three months. It will still be possible to gain admission to events and venues by
providing proof of a recent negative lateral flow test, instead of a vaccine
passport. The attendance limit of 500 people at
large-scale outdoor events will be lifted from 17 January, Nicola Sturgeon
confirms. This means top-flight football fixtures
scheduled for early next week will be allowed to have full crowds as well as the forthcoming
Six Nations rugby matches. One change for those attending these events is
that the Covid certification scheme is to be expanded. Organisers of large events of 1,000 or more
people will be required to check the certification status of at least 50% of
attendees (up from the 20% previously required) or at least 1,000 people -
whichever figure is higher. Last week, it was announced that people without symptoms who test positive on a lateral flow test will no longer need to have their result confimed by a PCR test. Ms Sturgeon says this change means the
current daily numbers are capturing fewer positive cases than before. This will lead to changes in how case numbers are reported by Public Health Scotland. From Thursday, the number will be combined - to include those who test positive either with a PCR or lateral flow test. This will mean a time lag in reporting case numbers initially, she adds. But the new way of reporting should allow the trend in cases to be reported more accurately than it is now. She concludes by urging everyone to make sure they report their lateral flow results - whether positive or negative. Question from Donald in Edinburgh Yes, the guidance is still to limit mixing to three households. Before Christmas, the first minister made what she called a ""request"" to the public to ""reduce as far as possible - to a minimum - the contacts that we have with people from other households"". She said mixing between households was not going to be banned or restricted in law, as happened before. Instead, she said her government would be issuing ""strong guidance"" to ""cut down as far as possible the number of people from outside our own households with whom we interact"". Ms Sturgeon did ask those who were going to socialise - either at home or in indoor public places - to limit each gathering to a maximum of three households, and for everyone to do a lateral flow test beforehand.

Today's live page was the work of Mary O'Connor, Alex Kleiderman, Nathan Williams, Chris Giles, Alys Davies, Kate Whannel, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Marie Jackson. It was edited by Hamish Mackay and Emma Owen. On a day that's been dominated by that Downing Street drinks party, here's a round-up of what's been happening in the UK and elsewhere: BBC Reality Check During the first
lockdown â 27 March to 1 June 2020 â 17,981fines were issued,externalfor breaking
Covid-19 restrictions. We donât know
exactly how many of those were for illegal gatherings of more than 30 people on
private properties, but it wasnât very many.Only 29 fines,externalwere issued for that
offence in first and second lockdowns put together. During first
lockdown,fines,externalfor those attending illegal indoor gatherings of more than
30 people were Â£100 â or Â£50 if paid quickly â doubling after each offence. Not all of the fines
imposed will have been paid. Between March 2020 and August 2021,prosecutors checked,external2,098 cases that had been challenged. They ruled that 445 had been
incorrectly charged and 348 cases were withdrawn. This video can not be played Serbia PM: I can't agree with Djokovic jab decision On Monday, we reported extensively ontennis star Novak Djokovic winning a legal battle in Australia to overturn his visa cancellationto play at the Australian Open. But Australian officials have said they're still considering whether or not to deport him. Now, Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic has told the BBC she remains hopeful the world men's number one will be allowed to defend his singles title at the tournament. Following a phone conversation with her Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison, she said Serbia understood Australia's restrictive Covid rules and procedures, and that Belgrade was not looking for any special treatment for Djokovic. I donât think this is the end of the whole saga. I am hoping Novak will be able to play in the Australian Open Ana Brnabic, Serbian Prime Minister ""Whatâs important is that Novak is treated equally, that he gets a fair chance. We support him, but at the same time itâs important to keep the relationship strong between the two countries."" On Djokovic attending public events after his positive PCR test, she said that if he had done so, it would be a clear breach of Serbian rules. ""What we donât know is when he actually saw his results, so there is some grey area, and I think the only answer to this can be provided by Novak."" She also said she didn't understand why you wouldnât want to get vaccinated, but that ""in a democracy you have to respect a personâs decision"". As Omicron becomes the dominant variant across the globe, some BBC World News viewers have been sending in questions. Would it be accurate to say Omicron is like a bad flu? Have countries started changing their travel restrictions? Can having a cold over winter protect you against Covid? BBC World Newsâs Lucy Hockings put these questions and others to Prof David Montefiori, immunologist at Duke University, and Julia Lo Bue-Said the CEO at The Advantage Travel Partnership. This video can not be played Is Omicron like bad flu? Your questions answered Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter United
Airlines will reduce its schedule due to staff shortages this month, in the
latest sign of economic strains caused by the Omicron variant. Chief
executive Scott Kirby said some 3,000 employees were out sick - about 4% of its
US workforce. At one point, one-third of its staff at its main hub in New
Jersey called out with the virus, he said. The moves
follow widespread flight cancellations in recent weeks. Transit systems in the
US have also reduced service, while retailers such as Apple and Macyâs have cut
hours at some store, and school districts such as Chicago have cancelled
classes. Firms including Facebook have delayed return-to-office plans. Speaking to
Congress on Tuesday, the head of Americaâs central bank said the pandemic was
causing economic disruption for far longer than most experts anticipated. âTwo years
ago, I donât think we would have said we would still be having record levels of
cases and [near] record levels of hospitalisation,â Federal Reserve Chair
Jerome Powell said. âGetting past the pandemic is the most important thing we
can do.â  Her name keeps popping up, but beside being the senior civil servant leading the Downing Street parties' inquiry, what else do we know about Sue Gray? Gray, who is married to a country and western singer, has worked in several departments including transport and health, but is not a typical career civil servant. In the late 1980s she took a career break to run a pub in Northern Ireland - a job she said she loved but would never do again. Having served as head of the Cabinet Office's ethics team, she is experienced at investigating ministers. In 2012, her inquiry into ""plebgate"" led to the resignation of then-chief whip Andrew Mitchell. Mitchell admitted using bad language towards a police officer, but denied calling him a ""pleb"". And a 2017 investigation forced Damian Green to step down as minister after he was found to have made ""inaccurate"" statements over what he knew about claims pornography was found on his office computer in 2008. Last year her application to become head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service was rejected - something she attributed to being ""too much of a challenger"". In case you missed it earlier, Labour's deputy leader told MPs there would be no need for an investigation in to a party in Downing Street if the prime minister explained if he knew about it and if he attended. Angela Rayner said the government could not ""blame it on a few junior civil servants"". Paymaster General Michael Ellis, answering Rayner's question in the Commons, said he had confidence in Boris Johnson's honour and integrity. This video can not be played Rayner and Ellis on Johnson role in No 10 work lockdown party Children's author Michael Rosen, who himself was seriously ill with Covid, has been talking to BBC News about the latest Downing Street party claims. He reflects that Covid has involved hundreds of thousands of people who've all been damaged in some way by the pandemic - creating a kind of social trauma, much like the London Blitz during World War Two. He says: ""I don't think we have begun to deal with this social trauma. But worse, this is just the opposite of dealing with it. ""Instead of the equivalent of wreaths at the Cenotaph, what we're getting is 'oh, we were partying while you were doing that'. ""It's an appalling feeling to just think of that."" A further 379 deaths have been reported within 28 days of a positive cornavirus test, official UK figuresshow,external. There have now been 1,660 deaths by this measure in the last seven days - an 80% increase on the seven previous days. There have also been another 120,821 Covid cases recorded across the UK. Meanwhile, the World Bank has said the global economy faces a ""grim outlook"", as the aftershocks of the pandemic continue to weigh on growth, especially in poor countries. The organisation's latest forecast predicts global growth will slow to 4.1% this year from 5.5% in 2021. It attributes the slowdown to virus threats, government aid unwinding and an initial rebound in demand fading. But World Bank President David Malpass says his greatest worry is widening global inequality. ""The big drag is the inequality that's built into the system,"" he tells the BBC, noting that poorer countries are especially vulnerable to economic damage from efforts to fight inflation. ""The outlook for the weaker countries is still to fall further and further behind. That causes insecurity."" Read more here. This video can not be played DUP MP Jim Shannon breaks down in Commons There were tears in the Commons earlier as DUP MP Jim Shannon put his question to the government minister. He told Parliament how his mother-in-law had died alone with Covid during the pandemic and said the government must ensure ""full and complete disclosure"" over the Downing Street party claims. Read the full storyhere. We've got a bit more now from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who calls on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign over news of thebring-your-own-booze Downing Street garden party during lockdown. She tells MSPs that people are ""aghast"" at Downing Street's behaviour, which appears to show ""serial breaches of guidance"" that the public followed despite the ""painful sacrifices"" involved. Accusing Johnson of ""not being truthful"" about his knowledge of events, she argues the office of prime minister and UK interests would be ""greatly enhanced"" by his resignation. In
the week of the drinks party at No 10 Downing Street, the police handed out hundreds
of fines to people for breaking coronavirus laws. The
latest police data shows there were 807 fixed penalty notices in the week between 15
and 21 May 2020 for Covid law breaches in England and Wales. Most
of these would have related to people breaking rules on gatherings and movement. At
the time,people couldn't leave their homes without a reasonable excuse, such as work, exercise and getting things like food and medicine. The
police in England could fine people Â£100 for a first offence, which could then
double for each further offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. We've heard a number of people this morning refer to the independent inquiry into Downing Street lockdown parties that's being led by senior civil servant Sue Gray. She was appointed to head up the inquiry after Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant,stepped aside from the role following reports a party was held in his office while London was under Covid rules. Boris Johnson announced an inquiry would be carried out at the beginning of last month,after a video from last year emerged of government staff joking about a partythat took place on 18 December - a day on which more than 400 Covid deaths were reported. Which events is the inquiry investigating?  A full list of reported government lockdown parties can be foundhere. Labourâs former director of communications, Alastair Campbell, is the latest to add his voice to calls for the prime minister to consider his position. He tells BBC News if Boris Johnson is found to have broken his âown lawâ in relation to Covid restrictions âhis position is untenableâ and âhe has to goâ. Campbell - who was a key aide to Tony Blair - says heâs âsurprisedâ at the âreluctance of the policeâ to get involved in any of the previous allegations of gatherings that took place in Downing Street in 2020. They now being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray. Campbell believes ""the police have to get involved nowâ because he says there has been âa crime in the garden of Downing Streetâ. The son of a Bletchley Park codebreaker whose funeral was held on the same day as lockdown drinks in Downing Street is the latest to share his shock at the claims, saying heâs ""totally gobsmacked"". Ann Mitchell, who was part of a World War Two code-breaking team, died in May 2020, aged 97, after testing positive for Covid. Her son, Andy Mitchell, said just five people attended her funeral in Edinburgh. He added that they had a âquick chatâ afterwards before returning home, with ""no drinks in the garden or anything like that"". As we just mentioned, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that attendance limits on live outdoor events in Scotland will end on Monday. In her Covid update to MSPs at Holyrood, she also announced:  The first minister says she hopes the cabinet will decide to lift more restrictions - including on indoor live events, table service in hospitality and distancing in indoor public places - from 24 January. Sturgeon says, as these measures are lifted, it will be necessary to consider whether the use of vaccine passports may have to be extended. Antony Mullen, leader of the Conservatives on Sunderland Council, says he does not see how the prime minister can survive these latest allegations. He described claims that Boris Johnson's private secretary, Martin Reynolds, invited about 100 No 10 staff members to a ""bring-your-own-booze"" garden party in May 2020 as ""absolutely appalling"". ""I thinkMartin Reynoldsshould have been sacked and I think Boris Johnson will inevitably have to follow him,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme. Mullen added that he believed an investigation into Downing Street parties would now likely find that Johnson misled the Commons. Restrictions on attendance levels at live outdoor events in Scotland will be removed from next Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms. The move will allow fans to return to stadiums when the Scottish Premiership's winter break ends. It will also avoid Scotland's Six Nations rugby matches having to be played behind closed doors at Murrayfield. A limit of 500 people at outdoor events has been in place since Boxing Day. Speaking to MSPs at Holyrood, Sturgeon says there are some signs Scotland is ""starting to turn the corner"" on the Omicron variant spike, while the nation's latest Covid figures gave grounds for ""encouragement"". Up to 30,000 positive cases a day are being recorded, almost half the initial projection of 50,000 per day, she says. She cautions there are still ""uncertainties"" in the data to be addressed, including the impact of the post-Christmas return to work and school. But she says we do know that high case numbers are disrupting the economy and critical services, while the NHS remains under ""severe pressure"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Heathrow hit by 600,000 cancellations in December","At least 600,000 passengers scrapped plans to fly from Heathrow Airport last month as the Omicron coronavirus strain sparked tougher travel restrictions. Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said it underlined the crisis in the industry and the uncertainty facing travellers. A return to normal ""could be years away"", the chief executive of the UK's busiest airport warned. Just 19.4 million passengers passed through Heathrow in 2021 - 12.3% below 2020, the year the pandemic began. Last year's number, the lowest for Heathrow for 50 years, was less than a quarter of the pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. Mr Holland-Kaye said it was time for all coronavirus testing measures to be dropped for fully-vaccinated people. Fears over the Omicron Covid variant meant that, from late November, all travellers arriving in the UK were required to take a pre-departure lateral flow test and self-isolate until they received a negative result from a post-arrival PCR test. This led to many people scrapping their travel plans over the festive period. The new rules were relaxed for fully-vaccinated arrivals last week after travel firms said they were ineffective due to Omicron spreading widely within the UK. That move sparked a rush of bookings, airlines reported. What tests do I need to go on holiday? Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""There are currently travel restrictions, such as testing, on all Heathrow routes - the aviation industry will only fully recover when these are all lifted and there is no risk that they will be re-imposed at short notice, a situation which is likely to be years away."" John Holland-Kaye says the aviation regulator could help ease the uncertainty. He warned this creates ""enormous uncertainty"" for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the aviation regulator, as it prepares to set a five-year cap on Heathrow's passenger charges. ""The regulator must focus on an outcome that improves service, incentivises growth and maintains affordable private financing."" The CAA increased the cap on Heathrow's price per passenger from Â£19.60 to Â£30.19 from 1 January, sparking complaints from airlines that the rise was far too high. The CAA is expected to announce a long-term cap running from the summer to 2027 in the coming weeks. Heathrow said travel to and from the Asia-Pacific region in 2021 was particularly badly hit, down 40.3% from a year earlier. The other markets with double-digit reductions were non-EU Europe (down 13.8%) and North America (down 13.6%). Domestic travel bucked the trend, with a 21.1% boost in passengers compared with 2020.

Girl waits six years to donate afro to charity,"This video can not be played Poppy has wanted to cut her hair for charity for a number of years An 11-year-old girl who has waited more than half her life to donate her afro hair to charity is weeks away from fulfilling her dream. Poppy Lee-Burrowes had hoped to give away her hair to make wigs when she was five. But at the time the Little Princess Trust said it was unable to make wigs from afro hair. Undeterred, Poppy spent the next six years growing it in case this changed. And this year it did. In April the charity announced it was now able to make wigs using afro hair after another11-year-old urged it to rethinkafter being told her afro locks were too delicate for wig-making. Afro comb inventor hopes to inspire black women Sent home from school because afro is 'too big' Poppy plans to cut off about 8 inches of her hair on 29 January Poppy, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she was excited to cut her hair for charity in a few weeks. Despite knowing she will miss her ""big hair, don't care"" look, she knows that ""other people will be able to love my hair too"". ""I want to do it because of the people that won't have hair. I want to be generous and help,"" she said. On a fundraising page, she wrote: ""It's taken me since I was about five, I have only ever had small trims in my life, never a big cut, so this is a big deal to me."" Even though Poppy loves her hair ""so much"", she is excited for a new bobbed look. Poppy will be part of the tens of thousands who donate their hair to Little Princess Trust a year, its head says Poppy's mum Jessica said her daughter asked if she could cut her hair for charity after hearing about her friends doing the same over the years. ""When we looked into it unfortunately we couldn't donate it because of her hair type, so we just thought we'd carry on growing it. ""It was last year a friend sent me an article to say they were now able to accept afro hair. ""We showed it to Poppy and she was ecstatic, over the moon. She was more than happy to have it cut and share her hair."" Call for more diverse heroes in children's stories How to look after afro hair during lockdown Poppy with her parents Jessica (left) and Beki Mrs Lee-Burrowes said it was ""disappointing"" to hear the charity did not take afro hair but understood ""because of the extensive work they put in to making these wigs and how important they are"". It can take 30 to 60 hours to make a hand-tied individual wig, according to Little Princess Trust's chief executive Phil Brace. The charity, which provides real hair wigs to children who have lost their own hair through cancer treatment or other reasons, said it has always offered afro style wigs using straight hair which was later curled into the requested style. But it was unable to find a wig manufacturer able to use hair donations from black and mixed race people in wigs. The chairty made two wigs, including the one pictured, in its successful trials last year Afro hair can easily break in the wig-making process but after working with 120-year-old London company Raoul to develop a wefting method, ""any child or young person who wants a wig now really does have a wonderful choice"", Mr Brace said. ""This was about ensuring that any child or young person can feel inclusive and be able to help and support children with cancer and hair loss."" He added: ""Poppy's a star, we are so indebted and grateful. ""When you get a youngster like this that has made a decision that they want to do good for other people, it's really heart-warming.""

Prisoner's suicide prompts call for change,"Usk Prison was built in 1842 A prisoner killed himself after being told he could not live at home with his children upon release, a report said. Gwent coroner Caroline Saunders called it ""devastating news"" and urged changes to how soon-to-be-released prisoners are dealt with. She has issueda Prevention of Future Deaths report,externalafter Ian Miller, who was serving a custodial sentence at Usk Prison, Monmouthshire, died. A jury inquest in December returned a conclusion of suicide. Mr Miller was found unconscious in his cell on 21 September 2019. Surge in violence in Welsh prisons New Welsh prison could be built The day before he died, Mr Miller had been called to a probation meeting ahead of his expected release the following month. During the meeting he was told he would not be able to live at the family home or have unsupervised contact with his children. He was also told he would not be able to live with his father-in-law and would probably become homeless. In the Prevention of Future Deaths report, Ms Saunders said key people at the meeting did not have a prior relationship with Mr Miller. ""They did not know how devastating this news would be to him, and he was not placed under closer supervision,"" she said. The inquest heard Mr Miller died from self-inflicted injuries, while a toxicologist also found a number of medications in his blood and urine that he had not been prescribed. His former cellmate described a culture where prescription drugs were being traded and had become ""a form of currency"". He said the trading of drugs was ""rife"" and Mr Miller bought medications from other prisoners. ""Whilst the ingestion of unprescribed medication did not contribute to Ian's death, this practice, if left unchecked, clearly puts the lives of other prisoners at risk in the future,"" said the coroner. The Prison Service has been given until the end of February to explain what steps Usk Prison has taken to address the risks posed by prisoners trading prescribed medication. A Prison Service spokesman said its thoughts remained with the friends of family of Mr Miller, adding: ""We will consider the coroner's findings and respond in due course.""

"Â£150,000 starting salaries as firms fight for staff","A professional recruitment firm says it is placing graduate lawyers at top firms on starting salaries as high as Â£150,000 amid a shortage of workers. Alan Bannatyne, chief financial officer at Robert Walters, told the BBC people in many UK industries were quitting for better paid jobs amid soaring demand. ""15% is the minimum pay rise we're seeing, but some are increasing their salaries by up to 50%,"" he said. ""Unless something significant happens, 2022 should be even better for staff."" UK job vacancies have hit record levels since the economy reopened as employers scramble to meet demand. Robert Walters, which focuses on placing professionals in roles, said this had put firms in a ""fierce competition for talent"" and it was ""incredibly hard to find the right people"". Employers have put up salaries to attract workers, although Mr Bannatyne said there had been ""winners and losers"" from Covid and not everyone was in a position to pay well. ""Bricks-and-mortar retailers and airlines have really struggled so will probably not be paying bonuses or giving pay rises,"" he told the BBC. ""So they become a hunting ground for other high growth businesses, such as online retailers, anything to do with technology and digital, and manufacturers of household goods."" Sainsbury's raises pay to Â£10 an hour Starter salaries rise at fastest rate in 24 years Job vacancies surge past one million in new record Robert Walters, which has offices in Asia, Europe and the US, said it had seen its best December ever, with net fee income up 39% globally. Recruitment agency Manpower said it was seeing a similar trend, as employers struggled to fill vacancies for highly-skilled positions. UK director Chris Gray told the BBC: ""It is absolutely a candidate-led market right now. ""Those with the in-demand skills hold the power, and have the freedom and flexibility to accept a job that suits their particular needs and expectations."" Skills shortages have been particularly pronounced in sectors such as law, where vacancies for London-based associates rose some 131% year-on-year between January and November last year, according to research from recruiter BCL Legal and data firm Vacancysoft. According to Robert Waters, there is a shortage of recently qualified lawyers, while reports point to an increase in experienced practitioners quitting the industry. In addition, UK legal firms face intense competition for talent from US law firms expanding in Britain. It's led to newly qualified lawyers at top London firms being offered salaries of over Â£100,000 before bonuses. According to the Law Society,external,in 2018 the average salary for solicitors working full-time in private practice was Â£62,000 a year (rising to Â£88,000 in London). City banks have also boosted starter salaries to retain talent and Robert Walters predicts the bonus pool this year will be ""huge"". Wages have also been increasing in lower paid jobs. Last week, Sainsbury's became the latest supermarket to pay shop workers at least Â£10 an hour, following similar moves from Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi. Many workers have revaluated their careers during lockdown and changed jobs or left the workforce, in what some have labelled the ""great resignation"". It has helped to drive up salaries across the UK, with growth in average payincluding bonuses standing at 4.9% year-on-year between August and October,external. James Reed, chairman of recruitment agency Reed Recruitment, said the UK was in the midst of a ""jobs boom"" that showed no signs of abating. ""It's the best time in 50 years to look for a new job, in a situation where the pendulum has swung in jobseekers' favour.""

Breaking|Breaking newsRestrictions on outdoor events likely to be liftedThe move would allow Scottish football and rugby fans to return to stadiums.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played 'Corner being turned' in Covid battle Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland, including football matches and concerts, are to be lifted from next Monday. The move will allow fans to return to stadiums when the Scottish Premiership's winter break ends. It will also avoid Scotland's Six Nations rugby matches having to be played behind closed doors at Murrayfield next month. A limit of 500 people at outdoor events has been in place since Boxing Day. Premiership football teams started their winter break early after the crowd limit was imposed, with many fans believing the sport was unfairly singled out by the restrictions. Large Hogmanay events, including the famous street party in Edinburgh, were also cancelled. Live coverage and reaction to the announcement Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What happens when Covid becomes endemic? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that the limit of 500 people would be removed from Monday 17 January - which will allow Celtic's match with Hibernian on that day to be played before a full crowd at Celtic Park. Event organisers will now have to check the vaccine certification of at least 50% of attendees, rather than the current 20%, or at least 1,000 people - whichever figure is higher. From Monday, the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" for the purpose of vaccine passports will include having a booster if the second dose was more than four months ago. And the government will also continue to consider whether the vaccine passport scheme should be extended to more venues. Restrictions on indoor events and venues will remain in place until at least 24 January, when Ms Sturgeon said she hoped to be able to lift them too. The Scottish Licensed Traders Association said the industry had been left in limbo by the first minister's statement, and warned that any extension of the vaccine passport scheme would have a ""major negative impact"" on businesses. The Scottish Premiership started its winter break early to avoid playing more matches without fans People will also still be required to wear face coverings in indoor public places, to work from home when possible, and to only meet indoors in groups of up to three households. The measures were imposed by the Scottish government in an attempt to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, with the first minister saying there were now signs that the country was ""starting to turn the corner"" after a huge spike in cases. Limits of 100 people were placed on indoor standing events or 200 if they were seated, while nightclubs had to close and pubs and restaurants had to bring back table service for alcohol and a one-metre distance between different groups of people. But the latest Scottish government Covid report showed that average daily cases in Scotland (2,824 per one million population in the week to 6 January) were higher than in England (2,615 per one million), which has fewer Covid restrictions. This is clearly the news that major sporting bodies and fans were hoping for. There were genuine fears, from within football at least, that the first minister would push the date back once again. It now appears that the increase in Covid passport checks outside stadia has allowed her to throw the doors back open but with a sense of continued caution. The Scottish government says the decision is based purely on the science, but there's no doubt that the move is timely, from a political perspective. With the Six Nations fast approaching, could the first minister really have watched on if Scotland's home game's had been moved south for the sake of attendance? It was certainly being discussed. As talk now turns to how we learn to live with Covid, this latest sporting sigh of relief will be accompanied by the hope that fans are be back for good. Some business leaders say said that the tougher coronavirus rules have failed to make a ""meaningful difference"" to infection levels and were causing ""enormous damage"" to some sectors. And pressure has been growing on the first minister to set out how Scotland can begin to ""live safely"" with Covid and loosen restrictions. Ms Sturgeon insisted that the restrictions had ""helped to mitigate to some extent the impact of the Omicron wave"", with positive cases estimated to be about 30,000 a day in early January rather than the initial projection of 50,000 per day . She added: ""It is very likely that the situation we face now, though serious, would have been even more challenging without the renewed sacrifices made by people across the country over these last few weeks."" The first minister also told MSPs that a revised framework for dealing with the virus will be released in the coming weeks, following input from parliament and business organisations. In a marked change of language to earlier stages of the pandemic, the first minister said this would set out how the country might be able to live with the virus without the need for restrictive measures ""that we are all tired of and which do harm in other ways"". Pubs had to reintroduce table service and ensure distancing between groups of customers as part of measures aimed at slowing the spread of Omicron Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was ""disappointing"" that restrictions such as the vaccine passport scheme were continuing despite Scotland being in a ""far more positive position than the government were expecting"". He said: ""The outlook is much better now not because of government restrictions, but because of people's good sense. The people of Scotland got this right, not the government."" Meanwhile Labour's Anas Sarwar said that ""a new phase of the pandemic must mean a new approach"". He added: ""People can no longer live their lives waiting to hear on an ad hoc basis what the rules will be day by day. ""Businesses and workers cannot plan for the future properly if they cannot predict the government's response."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

North Korea fires suspected ballistic missile,"Kim Jong-un vowed to bolster the North's defences during a key meeting of the ruling party in December last year North Korea has fired a suspected ballistic missile, less than a week after it launched what it claimed was a hypersonic missile. South Korea said it detected the launch at 07:27 local time on Tuesday (22:27 GMT on Monday). Japan's coast guard also reported the launch, saying North Korea had fired a ""ballistic missile-like object"". It comes shortly after six countries issued a statement urging the North to cease its ""destabilising actions"". ""Our military detected a suspected ballistic missile fired by North Korea from land towards the East Sea,"" South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) said, adding that intelligence authorities from South Korea and the US were in the process of conducting a detailed analysis. The latest launch underscores North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's pledge to bolster the country's defences as part of its policy priorities for 2022, which were outlined during a key meeting in December. On Monday, the US mission to the United Nations, joined by France, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Albania, issued a joint statement condemning last week's apparent test. ""These actions increase the risk of miscalculation and escalation and pose a significant threat to regional stability,"" said US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield. The group called for North Korea ""to refrain from further destabilising actions... and engage in meaningful dialogue towards our shared goal of complete denuclearisation."" North Korea has welcomed in the new year with two missile tests in quick succession. Today's test could be timed to coincide with a UN Security Council meeting in New York - where the US and its allies condemned last week's launch. But it could also serve several other functions. One could be to divert public attention from an increasingly severe economic situation in the country, which has been worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. Another could be to get the attention of Washington, which has shown little interest in resuming negotiations with Pyongyang after the failed summit between former President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in 2019. There a third reason, which is less often reported. North and South Korea are engaged in what observers say is an increasingly intense arms race, with both sides working to perfect smaller, more accurate and more deadly missile systems with which they can threaten each other's leaderships. The latest tests come as Pyongyang struggles with food shortages due to a coronavirus blockade that has severely affected its economy. At the end-of-year meeting of the ruling party, Mr Kim said the country was facing a ""great life-and-death struggle"", adding that increasing development and improving people's living standards were among this year's goals. UN officials had earlier warned that vulnerable children and elderly people in North Korea were at risk of starvation. The US has been calling for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang's relationship with President Joe Biden's administration has so far been fraught with tension. North Korea has also repeatedly accused South Korea of double standards over its military activities. South Korea recently tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, which it said was needed as deterrence against North Korea's ""provocations"".

Loungewear in fashion as party outfits shelved,"Shoppers swapped party outfits for comfy clothes in the Christmas sales as the Omicron Covid variant saw festive parties cancelled and the return of working from home guidance. Helen Dickinson, boss of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said loungewear was ""back in fashion"". But despite rising cases and concerns over a possible lockdown, UK retailers posted strong sales in December. Clothes and jewellery dominated Christmas gift buying at the tills. Total sales rose 2.1% in December compared with the same period a year earlier, according to statistics from the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor. They were up by nearly 5% over a two-year period before the pandemic. Over the three months to December, total food sales increased 0.4%, while non-food retail sales rose 4.8%. Pandemic fashion: 'From sequins to sweatpants' Boden boss declares the end of formal office wear Ms Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said despite the concerns over Omicron, ""retail sales held up through December"". ""Loungewear was back in fashion, as many pre-empted the possibility of future restrictions,"" she added. ""Meanwhile, the return of work-from-home advice and reduction in Christmas social events, caused formalwear sales to slow."" Compared to December 2020, when the UK was subject to Covid restrictions during parts of the month, online sales fell 13.9% last month, as shoppers returned to High Street stores. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said footwear was the only online category to see mild growth. But for the year as a whole, online sales grew by 14.3% overall on 2020. Despite the positive sales figures in December, Ms Dickinson said businesses faced ""significant head winds in 2022, as consumer spending is held back by rising inflation, increasing energy bills, and April's National Insurance hike"". ""It will take continued agility and resilience if they are to battle the storm ahead, while also tackling issues from labour shortages to rising transport and logistics costs,"" she added. With UK inflation at a 10-year high in November, and the rate expected to increase further in the next few months, many analysts are warning of a cost-of-living ""crisis"". Businesses are also bracing for higher energy costs due to surging wholesale gas prices. Figures from Barclaycard showed a jump in essential spending for December but flagged that the spread of Omicron weighed heavily on hospitality and leisure spending. The credit card spending data revealed total spending rose 12.2% in December, lifted by a 13.7% rise in essential spending, which was driven by supermarket shopping and fuel. Restaurants saw spending slide by 14.1% against pre-pandemic levels from 2019. Jose Carvalho, head of consumer products at Barclaycard, said more Brits ""were either isolating or choosing to stay at home due to the new variant, which hampered face-to-face retailers as well as hospitality and leisure outlets"". Retailers are starting to issue their Christmas trading updates, with discount chains among the strong gainers. On Tuesday, the UK arm of Germany's Lidl said that in the four weeks to 26 December its sales rose 2.6% from a year earlier as it benefited from shoppers switching from other supermarkets. Lidl said its Christmas jumpers were the fastest selling non-food and drink product, with one sold every two seconds on first day of sale. Christian HÃ¤rtnagel, Lidl GB chief executive, said the pandemic had been challenging, but added: ""As inflation continues to rise, I want to reassure each and every one of our customers that we remain resolute in our promise of being the destination for the lowest grocery prices in the market."" That came a day after Aldi said its Christmas performance was boosted by record sales of its premium range food and strong demand for beer, wine and spirits. Last week, discount chain B&M raised its profits expectations after reporting a strong festive trading period. Major supermarkets report trading updates this week, with Marks & Spencer and Tesco tipped by analysts to have done particularly well.

"We will not attack Ukraine, Russia tells USRussian officials downplay the threat to neighbouring Ukraine during high-stakes talks in Geneva.US & Canada","A Ukrainian soldier stationed at the country's border with Russia. Moscow has deployed thousands of troops to its side of the border Russia has told the US that it has no intention of invading Ukraine, after officials from both countries met for high-stakes talks in Geneva. After a meeting that lasted for seven hours on Monday, both sides agreed to continue efforts to reduce tensions. But there was no sign of a major breakthrough following the talks. Around 100,000 Russian troops are believed to be near the border with Ukraine, prompting fears of an incursion and warnings from the West. The US has said there would be sanctions if Russia were to attack Ukraine. Russia, meanwhile, has warned the US not to ""underestimate the risks"" involved in Moscow's confrontation with the West. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to attack Ukraine,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters following the meeting. He said the Russians had told their US counterparts ""that all measures for the combat training of troops and forces are carried out within our territory"" and that there was ""no reason to fear any escalation scenario in this regard"". US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman described the talks as ""frank and forthright"" discussions designed to encourage a better understanding of each side's security concerns. This was the first chance Russian and American diplomats had to discuss face to face the standoff over Ukraine, and Russia's demands for Nato to step back from eastern Europe. And while little agreement appears to have been reached, both sides aired their concerns and set out their demands with at least the possibility of talks continuing in the future. Yet the gap between both sides remains large. The US urged Russia to de-escalate the situation and remove its troops from Ukraine's border but it received no assurance that would happen. Russia demanded that Nato should give a cast-iron guarantee it would never offer membership to Ukraine. The US rejected this outright. The US offered some ideas for both countries to limit military exercises and missile deployments but there was no sense this would be enough for Russia. Optimists will point to the fact the talks were business-like, they did not break up in acrimony and Russia insisted it had no intention of invading Ukraine. Pessimists will note that even after such assurances, US officials said they were still not sure if Russia was serious about finding a diplomatic solution to this crisis. Ms Sherman said the US had pushed back on Russian proposals that were ""non-starters"" for the US government, including Russia's demand that Nato commit to never include Ukraine in the alliance. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed Nato's open-door policy, which has always been central to the Nato alliance,"" she said. According to Ms Sherman, the US delegation told the Russians that any invasion would be met with ""significant cost and consequences well beyond what they faced in 2014"" when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine. Ukraine leader alleges coup plan involving Russians Nato warning over Russian build-up near Ukraine These measures could include sanctions against key financial institutions, export controls, ""enhancements of Nato force posture on allied territory"" and increased security assistance to Ukraine, she added. Mr Ryabkov said the talks had been ""business-like and professional"" but warned the US not to ""underestimate the risks"" of the tensions. The Geneva talks are the first of several meetings between US, allied and Russian officials this week, which will also include a meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels and at the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes Russia. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Monday's meeting, however, took place without the participation of US European allies, including Ukraine, prompting reassurances from Ms Sherman and other US officials that Ukraine, Europe and Nato would be included in any decisions. Earlier on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell Fontelles said he believed a Russian invasion was still possible. ""There are 100,000 Russian troops on the other side of the border,"" he said. ""I suppose they haven't gone there to drink coffee!"" Mr Borrell added that he'd been told nothing would be agreed without the EU's ""strong co-operation, co-ordination and participation"". Russia has repeatedly denied it has any plans to launch a military operation in Ukraine.

"North Korea fires suspected ballistic missileIt comes as six nations, including the US, call for the North to stop its ""destabilising actions.""","Kim Jong-un vowed to bolster the North's defences during a key meeting of the ruling party in December last year North Korea has fired a suspected ballistic missile, less than a week after it launched what it claimed was a hypersonic missile. South Korea said it detected the launch at 07:27 local time on Tuesday (22:27 GMT on Monday). Japan's coast guard also reported the launch, saying North Korea had fired a ""ballistic missile-like object"". It comes shortly after six countries issued a statement urging the North to cease its ""destabilising actions"". ""Our military detected a suspected ballistic missile fired by North Korea from land towards the East Sea,"" South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) said, adding that intelligence authorities from South Korea and the US were in the process of conducting a detailed analysis. The latest launch underscores North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's pledge to bolster the country's defences as part of its policy priorities for 2022, which were outlined during a key meeting in December. On Monday, the US mission to the United Nations, joined by France, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Albania, issued a joint statement condemning last week's apparent test. ""These actions increase the risk of miscalculation and escalation and pose a significant threat to regional stability,"" said US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield. The group called for North Korea ""to refrain from further destabilising actions... and engage in meaningful dialogue towards our shared goal of complete denuclearisation."" North Korea has welcomed in the new year with two missile tests in quick succession. Today's test could be timed to coincide with a UN Security Council meeting in New York - where the US and its allies condemned last week's launch. But it could also serve several other functions. One could be to divert public attention from an increasingly severe economic situation in the country, which has been worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. Another could be to get the attention of Washington, which has shown little interest in resuming negotiations with Pyongyang after the failed summit between former President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in 2019. There a third reason, which is less often reported. North and South Korea are engaged in what observers say is an increasingly intense arms race, with both sides working to perfect smaller, more accurate and more deadly missile systems with which they can threaten each other's leaderships. The latest tests come as Pyongyang struggles with food shortages due to a coronavirus blockade that has severely affected its economy. At the end-of-year meeting of the ruling party, Mr Kim said the country was facing a ""great life-and-death struggle"", adding that increasing development and improving people's living standards were among this year's goals. UN officials had earlier warned that vulnerable children and elderly people in North Korea were at risk of starvation. The US has been calling for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang's relationship with President Joe Biden's administration has so far been fraught with tension. North Korea has also repeatedly accused South Korea of double standards over its military activities. South Korea recently tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, which it said was needed as deterrence against North Korea's ""provocations"".

Loungewear in fashion as party outfits shelvedComfy clothes were back in fashion after people were advised to work from home.Business,"Shoppers swapped party outfits for comfy clothes in the Christmas sales as the Omicron Covid variant saw festive parties cancelled and the return of working from home guidance. Helen Dickinson, boss of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said loungewear was ""back in fashion"". But despite rising cases and concerns over a possible lockdown, UK retailers posted strong sales in December. Clothes and jewellery dominated Christmas gift buying at the tills. Total sales rose 2.1% in December compared with the same period a year earlier, according to statistics from the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor. They were up by nearly 5% over a two-year period before the pandemic. Over the three months to December, total food sales increased 0.4%, while non-food retail sales rose 4.8%. Pandemic fashion: 'From sequins to sweatpants' Boden boss declares the end of formal office wear Ms Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said despite the concerns over Omicron, ""retail sales held up through December"". ""Loungewear was back in fashion, as many pre-empted the possibility of future restrictions,"" she added. ""Meanwhile, the return of work-from-home advice and reduction in Christmas social events, caused formalwear sales to slow."" Compared to December 2020, when the UK was subject to Covid restrictions during parts of the month, online sales fell 13.9% last month, as shoppers returned to High Street stores. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said footwear was the only online category to see mild growth. But for the year as a whole, online sales grew by 14.3% overall on 2020. Despite the positive sales figures in December, Ms Dickinson said businesses faced ""significant head winds in 2022, as consumer spending is held back by rising inflation, increasing energy bills, and April's National Insurance hike"". ""It will take continued agility and resilience if they are to battle the storm ahead, while also tackling issues from labour shortages to rising transport and logistics costs,"" she added. With UK inflation at a 10-year high in November, and the rate expected to increase further in the next few months, many analysts are warning of a cost-of-living ""crisis"". Businesses are also bracing for higher energy costs due to surging wholesale gas prices. Figures from Barclaycard showed a jump in essential spending for December but flagged that the spread of Omicron weighed heavily on hospitality and leisure spending. The credit card spending data revealed total spending rose 12.2% in December, lifted by a 13.7% rise in essential spending, which was driven by supermarket shopping and fuel. Restaurants saw spending slide by 14.1% against pre-pandemic levels from 2019. Jose Carvalho, head of consumer products at Barclaycard, said more Brits ""were either isolating or choosing to stay at home due to the new variant, which hampered face-to-face retailers as well as hospitality and leisure outlets"". Retailers are starting to issue their Christmas trading updates, with discount chains among the strong gainers. On Tuesday, the UK arm of Germany's Lidl said that in the four weeks to 26 December its sales rose 2.6% from a year earlier as it benefited from shoppers switching from other supermarkets. Lidl said its Christmas jumpers were the fastest selling non-food and drink product, with one sold every two seconds on first day of sale. Christian HÃ¤rtnagel, Lidl GB chief executive, said the pandemic had been challenging, but added: ""As inflation continues to rise, I want to reassure each and every one of our customers that we remain resolute in our promise of being the destination for the lowest grocery prices in the market."" That came a day after Aldi said its Christmas performance was boosted by record sales of its premium range food and strong demand for beer, wine and spirits. Last week, discount chain B&M raised its profits expectations after reporting a strong festive trading period. Major supermarkets report trading updates this week, with Marks & Spencer and Tesco tipped by analysts to have done particularly well.

Couple says troubled council broke their family,"Sonny and Sarita Simak spent three years fighting to be reunited with a boy they planned to adopt A couple have received an apology and a ""very significant"" financial payout from a council over a failed adoption. Sonny and Sarita Simak spent three years fighting to be reunited with a boy they planned to adopt after he was wrongly removed by Bradford Council. They were approved by an independent expert and two adoption panels - but the council then told them he wasn't suitable for adoption. The council said it put the ""interests and wellbeing"" of children at its core. The young boy was a toddler when he was first placed with the Simaks. He is now going to school and is likely to now stay in long-term foster care. It comes as Bradford's children's services have been heavily criticised for failing to protect Star Hobson, the toddlerwho was killed by her mother's partner. A commissioner from the Department for Education is currently assessing the department. Sonny and Sarita Simak were thrilled when ""their"" little boy - as they still call him - came to live with them in Slough, in November 2017. They had been approved by an adoption panel and were matched with him. ""He was just a joy, a delight, a lovely little boy. We love him,"" Sarita told the BBC. The little boy, who we are not naming, had some problems settling in - as they'd been warned he would. However, according to the Simaks' account, he quickly became accustomed to his new home and they planned to go through the final adoption process. ""He thrived in adoption placement with us,"" Sarita said. ""He loved having a mummy and daddy. He was doing very well."" This video can not be played Watch Sonny and Sarita speak emotionally about their failed adoption So it was a shock to them in July 2018, just eight months later, when the little boy was removed from their home. They say this was done with just 12 hours' notice. They challenged his removal. However, they were told social workers doubted the long-term placement would work because the couple suffered from low moods and hadn't taken advice about feeding the boy. The Simaks didn't accept this and their GP and health visitor said the little boy had thrived in their care. A year after he'd been taken away, they had a formal meeting with the council. Star Hobson: The short life and death of a beloved toddler Third children service's boss quits council post Bradford apologised and said if the Simaks still wanted to adopt the boy, an independent social worker could assess them all to determine what was in his best interests. They agreed and, nearly a year later, the independent report concluded he should be returned to them as soon as possible. The Simaks were assessed and approved by a second adoption panel, in September 2020. It had been more than two years since the Simaks had the child, but they were regularly sent photos and videos of him. The last one they received was in April 2021. But a fortnight later, they were told he would not be coming back after all. They discovered Bradford had commissioned a new therapeutic assessment. It said the boy wasn't suitable for adoption and should stay in long-term foster care for the rest of his childhood. The couple decided to take legal action. ""We felt there was injustice against our little boy,"" Sonny said. ""He had a family waiting for him and they took that away. How can you do that ? We felt we needed to be his voice."" Before the case came to court, Bradford Council offered to settle the claim without contesting any of the assertions made by the Simaks. The couple's solicitor, Nigel Priestey, said they received ""a five-figure settlement"" and the authority also agreed to pay their legal costs. ""That's the action of a local authority that's been found out,"" he added. Following on from the Star Hobson case, Mr Priestley says the DfE should look at how decisions are made within Bradford's children's services. Bradford Council said it could not comment on an individual case, but it always puts the best interests and wellbeing of children at the core of its decisions. ""When we make decisions regarding the long-term placement of a child we take into account all assessments including updated or new assessments from a range of partners working with the child. We will continue to engage with Mr and Mrs Simak to work through their concerns."" A Department for Education spokesman said it was awaiting a report from its commissioner, appointed to assess Bradford Council. ""On seeing his final report we will not hesitate to take further action to drive rapid improvements."" The Simaks now hope the Department for Education's inquiry could mean their case is reviewed and, as unlikely as it seems, the boy could come back to them. ""We worry about him"" said Sarita. ""We don't want him to spend the rest of his life in foster care, that's why we fought for him."" ""We were a family and they broke us,"" she added. ""They broke our family twice. And they did it just so casually.""

Government must publish protocol timetable - DUP,"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (right) met the foreign secretary in London on Monday, along with Lord Dodds (left) The UK government must set out a timetable for how and when changes will be made to the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Democratic Unionist Party leader has said. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was speaking after talks with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Monday. Earlier, he indicated he had paused a threat to pull DUP ministers from the Stormont Executive. Mary Lou McDonald said she was assured the protocol would stay. The Sinn FÃ©in leader held separate talks with Ms Truss on Monday. In a statement after his meeting, Sir Jeffrey did not repeat threats over the future of the executive. Instead, he said he told the foreign secretary, the UK's new lead negotiator with the EU in post-Brexit talks, that the government must guarantee there will be no checks on goods travelling from Great Britain that will stay within Northern Ireland. ""For our part we will use all measures at our disposal to continue to oppose the implementation of the current arrangements flowing from the protocol and we have made it clear to the government that we will not be implementers of protocol arrangements,"" he continued. The DUP leader said he urged the government to set out how it will deliver on proposed protocol changesoutlined in a command paper last year,external. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss replaced Lord Frost as the UK's lead negotiator with the EU in post-Brexit talks He added that the protocol had weakened Northern Ireland's governing arrangements. ""Balance can only be restored when Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market is restored and the damaging protocol consequences are reversed,"" he said. The meetings with Ms Truss come a day after she said shewould not accept a deal which meant goods from Great Britain being checked as they enter Northern Ireland. The foreign secretary said on Sunday that she was prepared to trigger Article 16 to suspend the agreement if necessary. The EU said it was ""not too impressed"" with Ms Truss' threat. Speaking after her meeting with Ms Truss on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she had been assured that the protocol was ""here to stay"". Allow Twitter content?

She added that the stakes were high in the negotiations and said the DUP's strategy ""can't hold progress back"". Michelle O'Neill accused the DUP of engaging in political stunts Mrs McDonald's party colleague, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, added that the DUP had been ""engaged in political stunts"". ""I'm very sure that they are engaged in playing to the gallery,"" she said. ""I'm very sure that their position is more about the election that's upcoming rather than what's in the best interests of the people here."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described Sir Jeffrey's strategy over the protocol as a ""foolish crusade"" which is creating uncertainty and chaos. ""Parties that are serious about government should be seeking to work together to improve the lives of people in our communities,"" the Foyle MP continued. ""Instead we have establishment parties in a toxic race to see who can bring the government down first to meet their own selfish needs. People are sick of it."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the DUP's actions were ""beyond embarrassing at this stage"". ""Could we all now just focus on ensuring devolution delivers for those who elected us during the last few weeks of this mandate?"" she questioned in a social media post. In 2019, the prime ministeragreed a deal, known as the protocol,and for the last six months the UK has been attempting to renegotiate it. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. That also creates a new Irish Sea trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, with some goods needing to be checked as they enter Northern Ireland. In July, the UK proposed an arrangement in which goods from Great Britain, which are due to stay in Northern Ireland, would not be checked and would have minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to move onwards to the Republic of Ireland would be checked at Northern Ireland's ports. The EU published its own proposals in October, which it said would significantly reduce, but not eliminate, checks on goods. It has previously said that the easiest way to reduce checks would be for the UK to sign up to a Swiss-style agri-food agreement. That would involve all of the UK following the relevant EU rules, something the government says it could not accept. ""I will not sign up to anything which sees the people of Northern Ireland unable to benefit from the same decisions on taxation and spending as the rest of the UK, or which still sees goods moving within our own country being subject to checks,"" Ms Truss saidin the Sunday Telegraph.,external The EU's ambassador to the UK said it was not helpful to keep agitating the issue of triggering Article 16. Ms Truss is due to hold two days of talks with her European Union counterpart, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, over Thursday and Friday. Sir Jeffrey feels that the UK government should provide imminently the plan to put in place the measures set out in the UK's command paper and also to list the timeline which they have in mind. He is being careful not to set any dates in his statement, nor does he go as far as to suggest that the institutions at Stormont are under threat. He does not, for instance, talk about things being unsustainable at Stormont if the protocol remains intact. But what he does say is that he will use all measures at his disposal to continue to oppose the implementation of the current arrangements, whatever he means by that. Ms Truss said that when she meets Mr Å efÄoviÄ, the EU's lead post-Brexit negotiator, she will be ""putting forward our constructive proposals to resolve the situation"". It is not yet clear if these differ from the July proposals. What is Article 16? Liz Truss replaces Lord Frost in post-Brexit talks A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is Article 16 and why does it matter? She has also repeated the UK's willingness to use the Article 16 mechanism of the protocol. Article 16 sets out the process for taking unilateral ""safeguard""measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. Those safeguards would amount to suspending parts of the deal. Ms Truss said: ""I want a negotiated solution, but if we have to use legitimate provisions including Article 16, I am willing to do that. ""This safeguard clause was explicitly designed - and agreed to by all sides - to ease acute problems because of the sensitivity of the issues at play."" The protocol created a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK The EU has said it does not believe the use of Article 16 is justified and that its deployment could lead to the collapse of the wider Brexit deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. JoÃ£o Vale de Almeida, the EU's ambassador to the UK, said it was not helpful to ""keep agitating the issue"" of triggering Article 16. ""We've heard this before from the government, so we're not surprised. We are not too impressed,"" he told Sky News. ""I think we should focus on - at least that's where we are focused on - is trying to find solutions for difficulties in the implementation of the protocol"". The EU was ""even more eager"" to find compromises, he added. What is Article 16 and why does it matter?

"We will not attack Ukraine, Russia tells US","A Ukrainian soldier stationed at the country's border with Russia. Moscow has deployed thousands of troops to its side of the border Russia has told the US that it has no intention of invading Ukraine, after officials from both countries met for high-stakes talks in Geneva. After a meeting that lasted for seven hours on Monday, both sides agreed to continue efforts to reduce tensions. But there was no sign of a major breakthrough following the talks. Around 100,000 Russian troops are believed to be near the border with Ukraine, prompting fears of an incursion and warnings from the West. The US has said there would be sanctions if Russia were to attack Ukraine. Russia, meanwhile, has warned the US not to ""underestimate the risks"" involved in Moscow's confrontation with the West. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to attack Ukraine,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters following the meeting. He said the Russians had told their US counterparts ""that all measures for the combat training of troops and forces are carried out within our territory"" and that there was ""no reason to fear any escalation scenario in this regard"". US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman described the talks as ""frank and forthright"" discussions designed to encourage a better understanding of each side's security concerns. This was the first chance Russian and American diplomats had to discuss face to face the standoff over Ukraine, and Russia's demands for Nato to step back from eastern Europe. And while little agreement appears to have been reached, both sides aired their concerns and set out their demands with at least the possibility of talks continuing in the future. Yet the gap between both sides remains large. The US urged Russia to de-escalate the situation and remove its troops from Ukraine's border but it received no assurance that would happen. Russia demanded that Nato should give a cast-iron guarantee it would never offer membership to Ukraine. The US rejected this outright. The US offered some ideas for both countries to limit military exercises and missile deployments but there was no sense this would be enough for Russia. Optimists will point to the fact the talks were business-like, they did not break up in acrimony and Russia insisted it had no intention of invading Ukraine. Pessimists will note that even after such assurances, US officials said they were still not sure if Russia was serious about finding a diplomatic solution to this crisis. Ms Sherman said the US had pushed back on Russian proposals that were ""non-starters"" for the US government, including Russia's demand that Nato commit to never include Ukraine in the alliance. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed Nato's open-door policy, which has always been central to the Nato alliance,"" she said. According to Ms Sherman, the US delegation told the Russians that any invasion would be met with ""significant cost and consequences well beyond what they faced in 2014"" when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine. Ukraine leader alleges coup plan involving Russians Nato warning over Russian build-up near Ukraine These measures could include sanctions against key financial institutions, export controls, ""enhancements of Nato force posture on allied territory"" and increased security assistance to Ukraine, she added. Mr Ryabkov said the talks had been ""business-like and professional"" but warned the US not to ""underestimate the risks"" of the tensions. The Geneva talks are the first of several meetings between US, allied and Russian officials this week, which will also include a meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels and at the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes Russia. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Monday's meeting, however, took place without the participation of US European allies, including Ukraine, prompting reassurances from Ms Sherman and other US officials that Ukraine, Europe and Nato would be included in any decisions. Earlier on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell Fontelles said he believed a Russian invasion was still possible. ""There are 100,000 Russian troops on the other side of the border,"" he said. ""I suppose they haven't gone there to drink coffee!"" Mr Borrell added that he'd been told nothing would be agreed without the EU's ""strong co-operation, co-ordination and participation"". Russia has repeatedly denied it has any plans to launch a military operation in Ukraine.

Vast Roman settlement found by HS2 archaeologists,"James West said this was one of the most impressive sites that had been discovered during HS2 excavations Archaeologists working on the route of the HS2 high-speed railway have found a vast wealthy Roman trading settlement. The discovery was made during excavations at the site in south Northamptonshire. A team of about 80 archaeologists have been working on the site for a year and discovered numerous artefacts, including more than 300 Roman coins. Site manager James West said it was ""extraordinary and tells us so much about the people who lived here"". The site, known as Blackgrounds after the black soil found there, is near the villages of Edgcote and Chipping Warden. Walls of a domestic building were uncovered during the archaeological excavation in south Northamptonshire Archaeologists said it was an Iron Age village, formed of more than 30 roundhouses, believed to have been established in about 400 BC, that developed into a wealthy Roman trading town. Discoveries showed the settlement expanded over time, becoming more prosperous during the Roman period, with new stone buildings and roads being built. The team uncovered a 10m (33ft) wide Roman road, described as ""exceptional in its size"", running through the site. A Roman pot was among the artefacts found by archaeologists HS2 archaeologists found evidence of workshops, kilns, several ""beautifully preserved wells"" and fiery red-coloured earth, which indicates activities such as bread-making and metal work occurred. War of words over Royal Mail's battle spelling Alongside the coins found, glass vessels, highly decorative pottery, jewellery and evidence of make-up was uncovered. Traces of the mineral galena - lead sulphide - a substance that was crushed and mixed with oil as make-up, was found on the site, archaeologists said. The Roman road found at the site was described as well-preserved and large Mr West said it was one of the ""most impressive sites"" Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) had discovered working on HS2.

Couple says troubled council 'broke our family',"Sonny and Sarita Simak spent three years fighting to be reunited with a boy they planned to adopt A couple have received an apology and a ""very significant"" financial payout from a council over a failed adoption. Sonny and Sarita Simak spent three years fighting to be reunited with a boy they planned to adopt after he was wrongly removed by Bradford Council. They were approved by an independent expert and two adoption panels - but the council then told them he wasn't suitable for adoption. The council said it put the ""interests and wellbeing"" of children at its core. The young boy was a toddler when he was first placed with the Simaks. He is now going to school and is likely to now stay in long-term foster care. It comes as Bradford's children's services have been heavily criticised for failing to protect Star Hobson, the toddlerwho was killed by her mother's partner. A commissioner from the Department for Education is currently assessing the department. Sonny and Sarita Simak were thrilled when ""their"" little boy - as they still call him - came to live with them in Slough, in November 2017. They had been approved by an adoption panel and were matched with him. ""He was just a joy, a delight, a lovely little boy. We love him,"" Sarita told the BBC. The little boy, who we are not naming, had some problems settling in - as they'd been warned he would. However, according to the Simaks' account, he quickly became accustomed to his new home and they planned to go through the final adoption process. ""He thrived in adoption placement with us,"" Sarita said. ""He loved having a mummy and daddy. He was doing very well."" This video can not be played Watch Sonny and Sarita speak emotionally about their failed adoption So it was a shock to them in July 2018, just eight months later, when the little boy was removed from their home. They say this was done with just 12 hours' notice. They challenged his removal. However, they were told social workers doubted the long-term placement would work because the couple suffered from low moods and hadn't taken advice about feeding the boy. The Simaks didn't accept this and their GP and health visitor said the little boy had thrived in their care. A year after he'd been taken away, they had a formal meeting with the council. Star Hobson: The short life and death of a beloved toddler Third children service's boss quits council post Bradford apologised and said if the Simaks still wanted to adopt the boy, an independent social worker could assess them all to determine what was in his best interests. They agreed and, nearly a year later, the independent report concluded he should be returned to them as soon as possible. The Simaks were assessed and approved by a second adoption panel, in September 2020. It had been more than two years since the Simaks had the child, but they were regularly sent photos and videos of him. The last one they received was in April 2021. But a fortnight later, they were told he would not be coming back after all. They discovered Bradford had commissioned a new therapeutic assessment. It said the boy wasn't suitable for adoption and should stay in long-term foster care for the rest of his childhood. The couple decided to take legal action. ""We felt there was injustice against our little boy,"" Sonny said. ""He had a family waiting for him and they took that away. How can you do that ? We felt we needed to be his voice."" Before the case came to court, Bradford Council offered to settle the claim without contesting any of the assertions made by the Simaks. The couple's solicitor, Nigel Priestey, said they received ""a five-figure settlement"" and the authority also agreed to pay their legal costs. ""That's the action of a local authority that's been found out,"" he added. Following on from the Star Hobson case, Mr Priestley says the DfE should look at how decisions are made within Bradford's children's services. Bradford Council said it could not comment on an individual case, but it always puts the best interests and wellbeing of children at the core of its decisions. ""When we make decisions regarding the long-term placement of a child we take into account all assessments including updated or new assessments from a range of partners working with the child. We will continue to engage with Mr and Mrs Simak to work through their concerns."" A Department for Education spokesman said it was awaiting a report from its commissioner, appointed to assess Bradford Council. ""On seeing his final report we will not hesitate to take further action to drive rapid improvements."" The Simaks now hope the Department for Education's inquiry could mean their case is reviewed and, as unlikely as it seems, the boy could come back to them. ""We worry about him"" said Sarita. ""We don't want him to spend the rest of his life in foster care, that's why we fought for him."" ""We were a family and they broke us,"" she added. ""They broke our family twice. And they did it just so casually.""

"North Korea fires suspected ballistic missileIt comes as six nations, including the US, call for the North to stop its ""destabilising actions.""Asia","Kim Jong-un vowed to bolster the North's defences during a key meeting of the ruling party in December last year North Korea has fired a suspected ballistic missile, less than a week after it launched what it claimed was a hypersonic missile. South Korea said it detected the launch at 07:27 local time on Tuesday (22:27 GMT on Monday). Japan's coast guard also reported the launch, saying North Korea had fired a ""ballistic missile-like object"". It comes shortly after six countries issued a statement urging the North to cease its ""destabilising actions"". ""Our military detected a suspected ballistic missile fired by North Korea from land towards the East Sea,"" South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) said, adding that intelligence authorities from South Korea and the US were in the process of conducting a detailed analysis. The latest launch underscores North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's pledge to bolster the country's defences as part of its policy priorities for 2022, which were outlined during a key meeting in December. On Monday, the US mission to the United Nations, joined by France, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Albania, issued a joint statement condemning last week's apparent test. ""These actions increase the risk of miscalculation and escalation and pose a significant threat to regional stability,"" said US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield. The group called for North Korea ""to refrain from further destabilising actions... and engage in meaningful dialogue towards our shared goal of complete denuclearisation."" North Korea has welcomed in the new year with two missile tests in quick succession. Today's test could be timed to coincide with a UN Security Council meeting in New York - where the US and its allies condemned last week's launch. But it could also serve several other functions. One could be to divert public attention from an increasingly severe economic situation in the country, which has been worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. Another could be to get the attention of Washington, which has shown little interest in resuming negotiations with Pyongyang after the failed summit between former President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in 2019. There a third reason, which is less often reported. North and South Korea are engaged in what observers say is an increasingly intense arms race, with both sides working to perfect smaller, more accurate and more deadly missile systems with which they can threaten each other's leaderships. The latest tests come as Pyongyang struggles with food shortages due to a coronavirus blockade that has severely affected its economy. At the end-of-year meeting of the ruling party, Mr Kim said the country was facing a ""great life-and-death struggle"", adding that increasing development and improving people's living standards were among this year's goals. UN officials had earlier warned that vulnerable children and elderly people in North Korea were at risk of starvation. The US has been calling for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang's relationship with President Joe Biden's administration has so far been fraught with tension. North Korea has also repeatedly accused South Korea of double standards over its military activities. South Korea recently tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, which it said was needed as deterrence against North Korea's ""provocations"".

Vast Roman settlement found by HS2 archaeologistsThe site manager says it has the potential to transform our understanding of the Roman landscape.Northampton,"James West said this was one of the most impressive sites that had been discovered during HS2 excavations Archaeologists working on the route of the HS2 high-speed railway have found a vast wealthy Roman trading settlement. The discovery was made during excavations at the site in south Northamptonshire. A team of about 80 archaeologists have been working on the site for a year and discovered numerous artefacts, including more than 300 Roman coins. Site manager James West said it was ""extraordinary and tells us so much about the people who lived here"". The site, known as Blackgrounds after the black soil found there, is near the villages of Edgcote and Chipping Warden. Walls of a domestic building were uncovered during the archaeological excavation in south Northamptonshire Archaeologists said it was an Iron Age village, formed of more than 30 roundhouses, believed to have been established in about 400 BC, that developed into a wealthy Roman trading town. Discoveries showed the settlement expanded over time, becoming more prosperous during the Roman period, with new stone buildings and roads being built. The team uncovered a 10m (33ft) wide Roman road, described as ""exceptional in its size"", running through the site. A Roman pot was among the artefacts found by archaeologists HS2 archaeologists found evidence of workshops, kilns, several ""beautifully preserved wells"" and fiery red-coloured earth, which indicates activities such as bread-making and metal work occurred. War of words over Royal Mail's battle spelling Alongside the coins found, glass vessels, highly decorative pottery, jewellery and evidence of make-up was uncovered. Traces of the mineral galena - lead sulphide - a substance that was crushed and mixed with oil as make-up, was found on the site, archaeologists said. The Roman road found at the site was described as well-preserved and large Mr West said it was one of the ""most impressive sites"" Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) had discovered working on HS2. He said the Blackgrounds area ""spans multiple time periods"" and had given the team several ""high-quality finds"". ""The site really does have the potential to transform our understanding of the Roman landscape in the region and beyond,"" he added.

Millionaire murderer Robert Durst dies in prisonThe real estate heir was placed on a ventilator shortly after receiving a life sentence in October.,"This video can not be played Watch: The moment Durst is sentenced to life in prison for murder Millionaire convicted murderer Robert Durst has died in prison at the age of 78, according to his lawyer. Durst died as a California prisoner after being convicted in September of killing his friend Susan Berman. He murdered her to stop her talking to police about his wife's disappearance. Police believe he killed two others. The US real estate heir turned fugitive unwittingly confessed in an HBO crime documentary series about himself. Durst's lawyer, Chip Lewis, confirmed that he died at the San Joaquin General Hospital while in the custody of the California Department of Corrections. He said that his death was due to ""natural causes"" and that he had been suffering from numerous medical issues. Durst was sentenced to life in prison in October for the 2000 killing of Berman, who was his long-time confidante and spokeswoman. His trial had been delayed for more than a year due to the Covid pandemic. Two days after his sentencinghe was admitted to hospital with Covid and placed on a ventilator, according to his trial lawyer. Durst - whose family have owned a series of New York City skyscrapers, including an investment in the World Trade Center - was investigated after a recording of him confessing was used in the 2015 HBO documentary series The Jinx. ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course,""he was recorded saying to himselfin an apparent hot mic moment. Robert Durst: A life of violence Prosecutors say that he also murdered his neighbour, Morris Black, while living as a fugitive in Texas nine months after killing Berman. Durst claimed to have shot him accidentally, before going on to dismember his body and dump the parts in Galveston Bay. After a 45-day manhunt, he was arrested for shoplifting a chicken sandwich from a grocery store in Pennsylvania, only a few miles from where he attended university. He was found with thousands of dollars in cash in his rental car, as well as cannabis and Black's driving licence. He claimed self-defence at his 2003 trial, and was acquitted after arguing that he fled because he thought his story would not be believed. Durst is also suspected in the 1982 death of his wife Kathie Durst, whose body has never been found. She was legally declared dead in 2017. He was formally indicted for her murder in November by the Westchester Country District Attorney's office in New York. ""After 40 years spent seeking justice for her death, IÂ knowÂ how upsetting this newsÂ must be for Kathleen Durst'sÂ family,"" District Attorney MiriamÂ Rocah said in a statement on Monday. ""WeÂ hadÂ hoped to allow them the opportunity to see Mr Durst finally face chargesÂ for Kathleen's murderÂ because we know that all families never stop wanting closure, justice and accountability."" The office added that more information on the Kathie Durst case would be released to the public in the coming days.

PCR tests end in England for no-symptoms casesA positive lateral flow result can now be taken as a first and final confirmation that you have Covid.UK,"A positive lateral flow result can be taken as a confirmation that you have Covid if you have no symptoms, the UK Health Security Agency says People without Covid symptoms no longer need a PCR test to confirm a positive lateral flow in England. The change reflects the high prevalence of coronavirus in the community and the accuracy of rapid tests,the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.,external The surge in Omicron cases has seen many with positive lateral flow tests struggling to book a follow-up PCR. The UK has capacity for more than 800,000 daily lab tests but moved closer to its limit in December. On 23 December, a total of 622,948 PCR tests were taken and on 28 December the figure was 630,768,government figures show.,external And the demand grew further in the first week of 2022, reaching 698,502 PCR tests on 6 January and 613,496 on Sunday 9 January. It is hoped the change will improve access to PCR tests for people with symptoms and for healthcare, transport and other key workers required to test regularly. Those who have one of the three main Covid symptoms - high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to the sense of smell or taste -  must still get a PCR test, the government said. On Monday, daily testing of 100,000 critical workers in industries such as food processing, transport and the border force began. Reported coronavirus cases in the UK reached a 218,724 high last Tuesday but then fell, with the latest data showing 142,224 new infections on Monday. When should I take a Covid test now? What are the Covid self-isolation rules? How do I know I have Omicron? When can I have a booster? Announcing the temporary halting of follow-up PCR tests,externalon Wednesday, the UKHSA said lateral flows were more than 80% effective ""at finding people with high viral loads who are most infectious"". And it added that, for every 10,000 lateral flow tests carried out, there were likely to be fewer than three false positive results. The requirement was previously suspended between January and March 2021 at a time of high virus prevalence. Those who test positive on a lateral flow but have no symptoms must still self-isolate for up to 10 days, but they can end quarantine if they receive two negative lateral flow test results, 24 hours apart, on days six and seven. The changes, which have already been introduced in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, do not apply to people who have symptoms. They will still need to book a follow up PCR test. Lateral flow tests can be done at home, and show results in 20-30 minutes. PCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis, with results provided in 24-48 hours Health officials stress it is still important asymptomatic people register a positive lateral flow test on the government website so case numbers can be reflected accurately and contact tracing can take place. There are some exemptions to the new rule. People who receive Test and Trace financial support, those taking part in Covid research studies and about one million people in England eligible for new NHS treatments for Covid will all be asked to take a follow-up PCR. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would ""look at the science"" on the possibility of cutting the minimum isolation period for people who tested positive, from seven days to five. However, the possibility was not discussed by cabinet ministers on Tuesday, Downing Street has confirmed. The PM's official spokesman said the government was ""gathering the latest evidence"" and keeping the issue under review to ""make sure we have the right approach"". He said: ""But what we're absolutely not doing is prejudging anything. ""The prime minister hasn't received formal advice either way yet. So, we'll await that and then make a decision."" The UKHSA, which is leading work on the issue along with the government's Covid taskforce based in the Cabinet Office, has now clarified the recommended self-isolation period in the US is five days and therefore shorter than in the UK. It had previously said the isolation period was effectively the same in both countries. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cut the recommended isolation period there to five days in December.
