Snacking and family meals increase in lockdown,"Christina Adane's campaign over free school meals was backed by Marcus Rashford Changes in young people's eating habits, tracked during the lockdown in England, show both increases in snacking and families eating together. Researchers found 60% of young people thought more shared family meal times were positive for health and wellbeing. Young people in the study said they wanted to keep having meals together. The research, from the Guy's and St Thomas's Charity and the Bite Back 2030 healthy eating charity, studied over 1,000 14-19 year olds. The youth co-chair of Bite Back 2030 is Christina Adane, the 16-year-old Londoner who set up the petition for free school meals over the summer holidays, which footballer Marcus Rashford supported. ""I don't want us to be the victims of endless fast food advertisement and celebrities endorsing stuff that everyone knows is bad for us,"" said Ms Adane. ""I want to be part of a world where our health is the priority of the food industry."" Should I worry about my lockdown eating? Free school meal U-turn after Rashford campaign The girl behind Marcus Rashford's school meal campaign The study of lockdown eating found contrasting trends for more unhealthy snacks, such as ""grazing"" on crisps and chocolate, but also more shared meals as families spent more time at home together. It also found a widening social divide in healthy and unhealthy eating. The report describes snacking as the ""biggest negative consequence"" in eating habits during the pandemic, with a 40% increase in snacks. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Young people in poorer families were ""more likely to snack, less likely to eat fresh fruit and vegetables"" than their wealthier counterparts. ""Some days I don't eat a lot at all as I'm not hungry, but others I snack more on things like chocolate, which I didn't do as much before,"" a 16-year-old girl told researchers. But there was also a trend for more home-cooked food and families eating together in a way that was not usually possible. ""Food during this period allowed me to reconnect with members of my family, we've been cooking together and enjoying meals together. I'd love to continue doing it,"" said a 19-year-old young woman in the study. ""I think I want to continue to eat together with my family, really make an effort of that, as we didn't normally do that, and it's nice to sit together and eat,"" an 18-year-old told researchers. This rise in shared meal times during the lockdown was greater among better-off families - although there was also an increase among disadvantaged families too. And most young people saw this as healthier and more sociable. Sarah Hickey, the childhood obesity programme director at Guy's and St Thomas' Charity, said it showed the social divide in nutrition getting worse during the lockdown. ""Even before the pandemic, families' food options were strongly shaped by where they lived, and their socio-economic background,"" she said. ""This research shows that the inequality gap around access to nutritious food has been further widened by the Covid-19 lockdown.""

May criticises PM over choice of security adviser,"This video can not be played Theresa May asks why is the new national security advisor is a âpolitical appointee with no proven experience"" Theresa May has criticised the PM's appointment of his Brexit negotiator to be his new national security adviser. Speaking in the Commons, she suggested David Frost did not have the required expertise or independence to succeed Sir Mark Sedwill in the role. Labour said the choice of Mr Frost, who is currently leading the UK's trade talks with the EU, was ""dangerous"". But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said Mr Frost was highly qualified and would be accountable to the PM. Mr Frost is a former civil servant, having left the Foreign Office in 2013 to work in the private sector. He is due to take on the role at the end of August, at which point Sir Mark will also stand down from his other role as cabinet secretary, the UK's top civil servant. Does it matter if the national security adviser is politically appointed? UK's top civil servant announces exit Sedwill's exit speeds up Whitehall reform Mrs May, who appointed Sir Mark Sedwill to both roles when she was PM, told MPs that during her nine years as a member of the National Security Council, she had ""listened to the expert, independent advice from national security advisers"". She asked Mr Gove how Mr Frost's appointment squared with remarks he made in a recent speech on civil service reform on the need to ""promote people with proven expertise"". ""Why is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?"" Mr Gove said there were precedents for non civil servants to take on key roles serving the PM and that the official that oversees senior government appointments agreed this was appropriate in this case. He said Mr Frost would neither be a civil servant nor a special adviser but would have the status of an envoy. David Frost left the Diplomatic Service in 2013 to work in the private sector before being hired by Boris Johnson ""We have had excellent national security advisers in the past, not all of whom were steeped in the national security world but were distinguished diplomats in their own right,"" he said. ""David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right and it is entirely appropriate that the prime minister of the day should choose an adviser appropriate to the needs of the hour."" But Mrs May was seen to shake her head vigorously while Mr Gove was speaking. The two have clashed in the past, most notably over extremism in schools, when they were members of David Cameron's cabinet. Mrs May sacked Mr Gove when she became PM in 2016 but subsequently brought him back. The role of national security adviser was created by David Cameron in 2010. Its previous occupants, Sir Peter Ricketts, Sir Kim Darroch and Sir Mark Lyall Grant, were all senior career diplomats. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague has added his voice to those concerned at Mr Frost's appointment, saying it had ""raised eyebrows"" and possibly ""sharpened daggers"" within the defence and intelligence communities. In his weekly column for the Daily Telegraph,external, the former Tory leader said that while the ex-diplomat was ""highly capable"", the role was better suited to someone with first-hand experience of security operations. Warning about the danger of US-style politicisation of senior government roles, he added: ""If we want the most promising people to serve the country, they have to come from varied points of view. ""All of us who have dealt with US administrations have witnessed the nightmare of changing long lists of officials when a new President comes in, leading to extended vacancies, loss of expertise and serious damage to diplomacy.""

It is now 100 days since Covid-19 forced Scotland into an unprecedented lockdown. Since then the virus has touched everything and changed everything. BBC Scotland looks back on some of thekey developments during a remarkable three months here. Below are some of the people who have lost their lives to Covid-19. Read about them here. Only essential visitors have been allowed into hospitals during the coronavirus crisis A study has suggested between 7,000 and 40,000 people could have died from coronavirus in Scotland if the country had not gone into lockdown. Scientists have tried to estimate would have happened if Scotland had copied theapproach taken in Sweden, where a lockdown was not imposed. Rowland Kao, a professor of epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University, led the team which carried out the research for BBC Scotland. He said: ""An obvious question to ask is if Scotland had done something similar to Sweden, would we have had a similar outcome without all the restrictions."" Read more here. Allow Twitter content?

A leading figure in Scottish tourism has warned against
Scotland and England taking different approaches to travel, as lockdown
measures are eased. Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism
Alliance, was responding to hints that theScottish government could treatairport arrivals differently, and even block travellers coming north across the
border. He said 70% of Scotland's tourism depends on the UK market
and that any restrictions on domestic travel would have a significantly
negative impact on the sector. Mr Crothall said tourism firms had told him about enquiries
from English people who have become concerned about a potential quarantine, and
have asked for a guarantee of a full refund should that come into force. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Rats have been thriving more than ever in urban areas during lockdown. ""There has been more rubbish building up in residential areas,"" says Brian O'Donnell, a rat catcher at
Graham Pest Control. ""Rats can live in various areas. Once they find a food source they will never venture too far away. Cutting back trees and hedgerows, putting waste in the bins properly can help. ""They are not dangerous. Rats are more scared of us than we are of them. They can carry disease, so we would never recommend picking a dead one up."" NHS Tayside has taken
delivery of thousands of reusable face coverings, which were produced for staff as
part of a local scrubs initiative. The collaborative project between NHS Tayside, local
industry, Dundee University, and community volunteers saw 5,000 sets of scrubs produced for frontline staff, with 1,000 of these being
made by volunteers from the local community. Once the scrubs target had been reached, the volunteer
sewers turned their focus to face coverings, making about 10,000
reusable masks for staff across Tayside to use when in public spaces. Officers made more than 53,000 interventions between 27 March and 17 June, the Scottish Police Authority hears. The rule is still only essential travel over 5 miles until Friday From Friday 3 July, the rule which currently restricts people to travelling no more than five miles for leisure or recreation is expected to be relaxed. The use of self-contained holiday accommodation - such as cottages, lodges and caravans with no shared services - will also be allowed from that date, along with second homes. Find out moreindicative dates for further measures to ease the lockdown here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland CalMac ferries' website crashed this morning as it opened up for bookings following the lockdown and it is not the only business to be overwhelmed by the public's thirst for holidays and entertainment. Aberdeen hotel manager Stephen Gow tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""We took somewhere over 1,000 bookings in the first hour of going live at 12 noon yesterday. Exciting times."" Mr Gow has created two new outdoor areas, utilising car parks, and says ""people are desperate to get back out gain and have lots of celebrations they want to catch up with"". Glasgow's Brel venue has a new outdoor area Glasgow pub and eatery owner Oli Norman says reports that his drive-in movie event took 4,000 bookings in the first hour. ""We open our bookings live for Brel tomorrow at 12 and we're pretty confident,"" he says. ""We've had about 150 enquiries per day for bookings. ""So many businesses are going to the wall and we're determined we're not going to be one of them. Weather is a challenge, but people are happy to sit outside in a cagoule and enjoy a pint."" Scotland and the UK have nowbeen in lockdown for 100 daysas part of efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. Nicola Sturgeon today warnedtough and unpopular decisions may still need to be takento prevent a resurgence of coronavirus in Scotland. However the first minister said there has been ""massive and very welcome progress"" since lockdown began. Nicola Sturgeon led the briefing as ever Here's the other key points from today's Scottish government coronavirus briefing: Ms Sturgeon is still taking advice on whether to follow the UK government in relaxing the 2m distancing rul Tough and unpopular decisions may still need to be taken to prevent a resurgence of coronavirus in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has warned. The first minister said there had been a ""sustained and significant"" reduction in cases and deaths from the virus. But she said there was still a risk of people letting down their guard and allowing the virus to spread again. Ms Sturgeon is to announce on Thursday whether the 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule is to be relaxed. Read more here. Sarah SmithScotland Editor Nicola Sturgeon says she has no plans, right now, tointroduce a quarantine periodfor visitors coming into Scotland from other parts of the UK. But by saying she is also ""not ruling anything out"", the first minister has ignited another heated constitutional debate. Ms Sturgeon says we are not dealing with politics at the moment, but with a virus that doesn't respect borders or boundaries. ""Anyone who is trotting out political or constitutional arguments is in the wrong place,"" she says. But the first minister was obviously well aware that even mentioning such an idea would cause a huge political controversy. The Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, has said the virus ""should not be used as an issue to drive a wedge between Scotland and England"". The suggestion of a quarantine was not the idea of impatient pro-independence campaigners, but was first raised by one of the most eminent public health experts in the country, Professor Devi Sridhar, who is also an advisor to the first minister. As experts now predict that Scotlandcould be on course to eliminate (not eradicate) the virus by the end of the summer, questions are being asked about whether Boris Johnson is aiming at a policy of elimination for England - or if the UK government is content to allow Covid-19 to continue to circulate at a higher level as long as it does not threaten to overwhelm the NHS.

On the prime minister's speech this morning, in which headvocated the UK ""bouncing back better"" from coronavirus,the first minister said she was ""to put it mildly, extremely underwhelmed"" by Boris Johnson's plans. ""This is not new money - this is simply shuffling around money that was in the system"", the FM said. She added that her expectation was that there would be no additional Barnett consequentials coming to Holyrood as a result of the package announced by the PM this morning. Instead, she said, there may be a ""re-profiling"" of what they were already expecting. ""I don't think that's commensurate with the scale of the challenge we face"", Ms Sturgeon added. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says Britain must 'build, build, build' Boris Johnson has said now is the time to be ""ambitious"" about the UK's future, as he set out a post-coronavirus recovery plan. The PM vowed to ""use this moment"" to fix longstanding economic problems and promised a Â£5bn ""new deal"" to build homes and infrastructure. Plans set out in the Tory election manifesto would be speeded up and ""intensified,"" he added. Labour and the CBI said he was not focusing enough on saving jobs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""not much of a deal and not much that's new"". It came asnew figures showed the UK economyshrank faster than at any time since 1979 between January and March. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland has had 100 days of lockdown and Drivetime will be discussing First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's assertion that the country has made ""massive progress"" in tackling the virus and her warning about not becoming complacent. The programme, which is starting at 16:00 BST, also delves into the Prime Minister's announcement of an infrastructure plan to combat the looming economic crisis and considers what it means for Scotland. Boris Johnson has had to impose the first full local lockdown since measures were eased in England and host John Beattie will have the latest from Leicester. Meanwhile, the programme will be finding out why rodents are on the rise during the pandemic. Only essential visitors have been allowed into hospitals during the coronavirus crisis Hospitals in Scotland will be able to accept visitors again from 13 July, thehealth secretary has announced,external. Jeane Freeman said patients in non-Covid areas will be able to have a visit from one named visitor. The visits must be agreed in advance with the ward where the patient is being treated. Strict social-distancing and hygiene measures will be in place to limit the risk of transmitting the virus. Read more here.,external Mornings with Kaye AdamsBBC Radio Scotland A view of Iceland's capital Reykjavik Iceland has been a success story in dealing with Covid-19, with
fewer than 2,000 cases and just 10 deaths. A rapid response and widespread testing was key in getting the
virus under control early, with more than 60,000 people checked from a
population of just over 360,000. Social distancing remains in place, while life for most Icelanders is pretty much back to normal after a period of reduced working hours. There are very few foreign visitors at the moment but all arrivals are
tested at the airport and instructed to isolate until their results are known -
usually on the same day. This initiative was initially free but there is now a
fee of around Â£40. Dr Poppy Lamberton, a global health specialist at Glasgow
University, told Radio Scotland testing started on arrivals from overseas on 24 January,
saying that the UK ""missed an opportunity"" to implement something similar. She also stressed that Iceland did a good job of shielding care homes, while the population was markedly fitter than the UK, with fewer problems with underlying health
conditions. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Life sentences for breaking Hong Kong security law,"Protesters took part in months of demonstrations last year People in Hong Kong could face life in jail for breaking a controversial and sweeping new security law imposed by China. The legislation came into force on Tuesday but the full text was only revealed hours afterwards. It was brought in by Beijing following increasing unrest and a widening pro-democracy movement. Critics say the new law effectively curtails protest and undermines Hong Kong's freedoms. The territory was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement supposed to protect certain freedoms that people in mainland China do not enjoy - including freedom of speech. Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security. Details have been closely guarded and the Beijing-backed politician admitted she had not seen the draft before commenting. Why are there protests in Hong Kong? All the context you need Do protests ever work in China? But Ted Hui, an opposition legislator, told the BBC: ""Our rights are (being) taken away; our freedom is gone; our rule of law, our judicial independence is gone."" The UK, EU and Nato have all expressed concern and anger, while pro-democracy groups have started to disband amid fears of immediate reprisals. Washington, which also urged Beijing to reconsider, had already begun to end the preferential treatment Hong Kong enjoys in trade and travel with the US, bringing it in line with mainland China. Full details of the new law only emerged after it had come into effect at about 23:00 local time on Tuesday (16:00 BST). It applies to both permanent and non-permanent residents. Among the details: Crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a minimum sentence of three years, with the maximum being life Inciting hatred of China's central government and Hong Kong's regional government are now offences under Article 29 Damaging public transport facilities can be considered terrorism - protesters often targeted city infrastructure during the long-running demonstrations Those found guilty will not be allowed to stand for public office Beijing will establish a new security office in Hong Kong, with its own law enforcement personnel - neither of which would come under the local authority's jurisdiction Hong Kong's chief executive can appoint judges in national security cases, and the justice secretary can decide whether or not there is a jury Decisions made by the national security commission, set up by local authorities, cannot be challenged legally China also says it will take over prosecution in cases which are considered ""very serious"", while some trials will be heard behind closed doors. Management of foreign non-governmental organisations and news agencies will be strengthened The law can also apparently be broken from abroad by non-residents, under Article 38 The law will not apply to acts which happened before it came into force. Under the national security law, many of the acts of protest that have rocked Hong Kong over the past year could now be classed as subversion or secessionâ¦ and punished with up to life in prison. The city's pro-Beijing leader, Carrie Lam, said the law was long overdue. Fearing repercussions, political activists are resigning their posts and one pro-democracy protester, who asked to remain anonymous, told me that ordinary people are now deleting posts on social media. Many people are just stopping talking about politics, and stopping talking about freedom and democracy because they want to save their own lives. They want to save their freedom and avoid being arrested. One contact of mine, a lawyer and human rights activist, sent me a message shortly after the law was passed. Please delete everything on this chat, he wrote. The reaction began the moment the law - which was first announced six weeks ago - was signed by China's President Xi Jinping. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong began to quit immediately, fearful of the new law, and the punishment it allows. According to the South China Morning Post,,externalpro-democracy businesses began clearing away any sign they had once supported the protests. This video can not be played Hong Kong residents on controversial security law Joshua Wong, secretary-general and founding member of pro-democracy group Demosisto, warned the city would ""turn into a secret police state"". ""Beijing's promise to the world that Hong Kong will have a high degree of autonomy is proven to be a lie,"" opposition legislator Ted Hui told the BBC's Newshour programme. But despite the risks, some remained determined to go ahead with the banned traditional 1 July rally planned for Wednesday, amid reports of large numbers of police descending onto Hong Kong's financial district. Read more:Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit The move also provoked international reaction, with the UK's Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, saying China had broken the promises it had made to the people of Hong Kong under the terms of the 1997 handover. He added thatthe government ""fully"" intends to see through plans to change visa rules, offering millions of people in Hong Kong a way to acquire UK citizenship. That agreement enshrined the ""one country, two systems"" principle in a document called the Basic Law - Hong Kong's mini constitution - for 50 years. The Basic Law protects rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech - neither of which exist in mainland China - and also sets out the structure of governance for the territory.

"Plane-maker Airbus to cut 15,000 jobs","Airbus has two UK sites, in Flintshire in Wales and Filton near Bristol Aerospace giant Airbus says it plans to cut 15,000 jobs as it deals with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. It will cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, along with thousands more in Germany, Spain and elsewhere. The move is subject to talks with unions which have opposed compulsory redundancies. The Unite union said the Airbus announcement was ""another act of industrial vandalism"" against the UK aerospace sector. Some 134,000 people work for Airbus worldwide, with around a tenth of them in the UK. The firm said the UK cuts would fall only on the commercial aircraft division at its two sites at Broughton in Flintshire and Filton, Bristol. Airbus furloughs 3,200 after 'bleeding cash' alert Aerospace industry 'will take years' to recover More details of the job losses and how they will break down between the two giant factories will come at the end of the week after talks with unions. However, Unite said it expected 1,116 manufacturing jobs and 611 office-based jobs to go, shrinking Airbus's UK workforce by 15%. These cuts were inevitable. The only question was just how severe the pain would be. The Covid-19 pandemic has been little short of catastrophic for the airline industry. At one point in April, global air traffic was down by more than 90%. When planes aren't flying, they aren't earning money. Yet they still need to be maintained and leasing costs or loans still need to be paid. The result? Airlines are struggling to survive and simply can't afford to take on new planes right now. And that, of course, means Airbus has had to curb production. Airbus has delayed these cuts and has made full use of support from governments. But ultimately it had little choice. And the pain being felt in places such as Broughton, Toulouse and Hamburg will echo through the entire supply chain. The firm expects to make the cuts by summer 2021, but hopes the majority of redundancies will be voluntary or through early retirement of staff. The company warned in April that it was ""bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed"" as it struggled with the impact of the coronavirus crisis. It said on Tuesday that production had dropped by 40% in recent months, and that it did not expect air traffic to get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 at the earliest. ""Airbus is facing the gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced,"" said chief executive Guillaume Faury. ""The measures we have taken so far have enabled us to absorb the initial shock of this global pandemic. ""Now, we must ensure that we can sustain our enterprise and emerge from the crisis as a healthy, global aerospace leader, adjusting to the overwhelming challenges of our customers."" News of the cuts comes as the international aviation industry reels from the impact of the pandemic. On Tuesday, EasyJet said it would close three UK bases and cut about 2,000 staff. And Reuters reported that Air France/KLM was targeting more than 6,500 job cuts over the next two years. Jim McMahon, Labour's shadow transport secretary, called for more government support in the UK. ""Labour has consistently called for an extension to the furlough in the most impacted industries, and a sectoral deal that supports the whole aviation industry including securing jobs and protecting the supply chain, while continuing to press for higher environmental standards."" A government spokesman said: ""We understand this will be a difficult time for Airbus's employees and their families, and we stand ready to support anyone affected in any way we can. ""We will continue to work closely with the sector to ensure firms are able to rebuild as the civil aviation market recovers.""

Police given 'minimal guidance' on local lockdown,"Leicester will not join the rest of the UK in seeing restrictions eased on Saturday Police in Leicester were not issued a map of the area affected by the UK's first local lockdown until ""well after the announcement"", the county's police and crime commissioner has said. Lord Willy Bach said the information ""has now been issued"" but law enforcement had ""received minimal guidance"" on the tighter restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced the lockdown at 21:15 BST on Monday. Non-essential shops have shut and schools will be closed to most pupils. The tightening of restrictions in Leicesterwill last until at least 18 July and apply to the city centre and a number of suburbs. Mr Hancock said the measures would be enforced by police ""in some cases"". Lord Bach said: ""Amazingly we were not even provided with a map of the area until well after the announcement. ""That has now been issued, but, unfortunately, we received minimal guidance regarding practical implementation at the time the measures were imposed. ""I have a great deal of sympathy with the agencies charged with delivery. They needed clarity from the start, and I am astonished that it is being drip-fed as the day progresses."" Lord Willy Bach said law enforcement had ""received minimal guidance"" on the tighter restrictions Announcing measures for the lockdown, Mr Hancock said Leicester had ""10% of all positive cases in the country over the past week"". The Department of Health said as of 17:00 on Monday, 43,730 people had died in hospital of coronavirus in the UK, an increase of 155 on the day before. Leicester's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, has urged people in the city to ""stick together"" and stay at home. Sir Peter said he was glad the health secretary had introduced measures that went beyond just extending the current level of restrictions. ""What we got was more wide-ranging than we'd anticipated and I'm really grateful for that,"" he said. ""Because while it is a pain and a nuisance for us in the city to be subject to that level of restriction and to have the clock, as it were, turned back, it is nonetheless something that has some realistic prospect of being effective."" The loosening of restrictions in England which are due on Saturday, including the reopening of bars, restaurants and hair salons, will also not be taking place in the city. The relaxation of shielding measures on 6 July - which will allow the most clinically vulnerable to spend more time outside - has been cancelled in Leicester. The Bishop of Leicester said no weddings or funerals would take place in church buildings as a result of the local lockdown. Mr Hancock said advice on people not travelling in or out of Leicester was a ""recommendation for now"", but laws could be put in place to enforce the lockdown. He said the lockdown was ""profoundly in the interest of people in Leicester, and across the country that we get this virus under control"". However, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government had left people in the city ""anxious and confused"". This video can not be played Leicester city mayor urges residents to stay at home Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer echoed calls for a government press conference, saying the people of Leicester were ""crying out for answers to perfectly legitimate questions"". Downing Street said legislation already existed to allow the government to enforce the local lockdown but it needed to be signed off by the health secretary. A spokesman said there were no plans for a news conference, whilePrime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ""stay in close contact"",externalwith Leicester's mayor ""as we monitor the situation"". Is Leicester the first of many local lockdowns? Locked-out Leicester holidaymaker 'felt like leper' 'It's upsetting but better safe than sorry' Why has action taken so long in Leicester? Sir Peter also criticised the government and Public Health England for being too slow to share testing data with the city's officials. He said local leaders had tried to get figures from the government ""for weeks"". ""I wish they had taken a more speedy decision rather than leaving it 11 days from the secretary of state's first announcement,"" he said. ""That's a long gap, and a long time for the virus to spread."" Mr Hancock said Leicester's seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people - three times that of the next highest city. Bradford, Barnsley and Rochdale have all seen 45 or more cases per 100,000 people in the last week. Dave Stokes, chairman of Leicestershire Police Federation, called on the government to provide more detail on what the public can and cannot do during the lockdown. ""As we have seen over recent weeks and months, if the guidance and messaging from government is confusing for the public, then it will be almost impossible for our colleagues to police,"" he said. Nottinghamshire Police said officers could fine visitors from Leicester who they suspected had travelled to Nottingham for a ""night out"". The force said it would work with British Transport Police to ensure people were not coming to the city on trains from Leicester to shop or visit pubs. Teresa Lander is worried about ""a massive gap"" in her daughter's education Teresa Lander, 51, whose daughter goes to Launde Primary School in Oadby said the local lockdown was ""a surprise and a bit upsetting"" for parents and pupils. ""It's worrying how much school they are missing, it's a massive gap in their learning if they're not in from March to September,"" she said. ""They were having fun being back at school, it's disappointing for them, but you've got to respect it."" Read more reactionfrom local parents here. The local lockdown has also affected Leicester residents who had made holiday plans. Tracy Jebbett, 50, was due to travel to Pentewan Sands in Cornwall with her husband and daughter on 11 July. But the campsite the family had booked put up a Facebook post on Tuesday,saying they would not allow anyone from Leicester to visit the site. ""I feel like a Leicester leper,"" she said. ""I understand why, but I think they should've contacted the holiday goers from Leicester privately by email."" Tracy Jebbett, her daughter Jessica and husband Martin were due to go on holiday Businesses also said they had been left reeling by the abrupt nature of the announcement. Blake Edwards, owner of Flappers and Gentlemen salon, said he was ""devastated"" by the news as he was due to reopen on Saturday and had bookings for the next five weeks. ""Time is running out [for the business], we're going to need more support,"" he said. ""Even though the staff is being furloughed, rent still needs to be paid, all the other bills still need to be paid."" Blake Edwards said his salon was fully booked for the next five weeks The government has confirmed businesses that have been forced to shut their doors because of the local lockdown can re-furlough staff. Restaurant owner Shaf Islam said: ""I had a spring in my step getting ready for the reopening on the fourth of July. ""To say the news is a big disappointment is an understatement. We'd spent a lot of money and I'd called staff back from furlough."" Leicester City said it hoped its home games could go ahead despite the stricter lockdown. The club is due to host Crystal Palace on Saturday, and said the Premier League remains ""completely satisfied"" with its ""Covid operations plan"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Plane-maker Airbus plans to cut 1,700 UK jobs","Airbus has two UK sites, in Flintshire in Wales and Filton near Bristol Aerospace giant Airbus says it plans to cut 15,000 jobs as it deals with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. It will cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, along with thousands more in Germany, Spain and elsewhere. The move is subject to talks with unions which have opposed compulsory redundancies. The Unite union said the Airbus announcement was ""another act of industrial vandalism"" against the UK aerospace sector. Some 134,000 people work for Airbus worldwide, with around a tenth of them in the UK. The firm said the UK cuts would fall only on the commercial aircraft division at its two sites at Broughton in Flintshire and Filton, Bristol. Airbus furloughs 3,200 after 'bleeding cash' alert Aerospace industry 'will take years' to recover More details of the job losses and how they will break down between the two giant factories will come at the end of the week after talks with unions. However, Unite said it expected 1,116 manufacturing jobs and 611 office-based jobs to go, shrinking Airbus's UK workforce by 15%. These cuts were inevitable. The only question was just how severe the pain would be. The Covid-19 pandemic has been little short of catastrophic for the airline industry. At one point in April, global air traffic was down by more than 90%. When planes aren't flying, they aren't earning money. Yet they still need to be maintained and leasing costs or loans still need to be paid. The result? Airlines are struggling to survive and simply can't afford to take on new planes right now. And that, of course, means Airbus has had to curb production. Airbus has delayed these cuts and has made full use of support from governments. But ultimately it had little choice. And the pain being felt in places such as Broughton, Toulouse and Hamburg will echo through the entire supply chain. The firm expects to make the cuts by summer 2021, but hopes the majority of redundancies will be voluntary or through early retirement of staff. The company warned in April that it was ""bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed"" as it struggled with the impact of the coronavirus crisis. It said on Tuesday that production had dropped by 40% in recent months, and that it did not expect air traffic to get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 at the earliest. ""Airbus is facing the gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced,"" said chief executive Guillaume Faury. ""The measures we have taken so far have enabled us to absorb the initial shock of this global pandemic. ""Now, we must ensure that we can sustain our enterprise and emerge from the crisis as a healthy, global aerospace leader, adjusting to the overwhelming challenges of our customers."" News of the cuts comes as the international aviation industry reels from the impact of the pandemic. On Tuesday, EasyJet said it would close three UK bases and cut about 2,000 staff. And Reuters reported that Air France/KLM was targeting more than 6,500 job cuts over the next two years. Jim McMahon, Labour's shadow transport secretary, called for more government support in the UK. ""Labour has consistently called for an extension to the furlough in the most impacted industries, and a sectoral deal that supports the whole aviation industry including securing jobs and protecting the supply chain, while continuing to press for higher environmental standards."" A government spokesman said: ""We understand this will be a difficult time for Airbus's employees and their families, and we stand ready to support anyone affected in any way we can. ""We will continue to work closely with the sector to ensure firms are able to rebuild as the civil aviation market recovers.""

This is the moment to be ambitious â PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain must ""build, build, build"" to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis Boris Johnson has said now is the time to be ""ambitious"" about the UK's future, as he set out a post-coronavirus recovery plan. The PM vowed to ""use this moment"" to fix longstanding economic problems and promised a Â£5bn ""new deal"" to build homes and infrastructure. Plans set out in the Tory election manifesto would be speeded up and ""intensified,"" he added. Labour and the CBI said he was not focusing enough on saving jobs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""not much of a deal and not much that's new"". The BBC's economic editor, Faisal Islam, said there was ""nothing really new"" in the plans, but was a pledge from the Treasury to ""speed up capital investment that has already been announced and tolerate higher levels of debt"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak later confirmed he would deliver an economic update on 8 July ""setting out the next stage in our plan to secure the recovery"". The PM's speech came asnew figures showed the UK economyshrank faster than at any time since 1979 between January and March. Boris Johnson's economy speech fact-checked What a shrinking economy means in one town Where do governments go when they need money? In a wide-ranging speech in Dudley, in the West Midlands, Mr Johnson vowed to ""build, build, build"" to soften the ""economic aftershock"" of coronavirus. He said the government wanted to continue with its plans to ""level up"" - one of its main slogans of last December's election - as ""too many parts"" of the country had been ""left behind, neglected, unloved"". Infrastructure projects in England would be ""accelerated"" and there would be investment in new academy schools, green buses and new broadband, the PM added. Projects in the Â£5bn investment plan include: Â£1.5bn for hospital maintenance and building, eradicating mental health dormitories and improving A&E capacity - the government said this is ""new"" money in addition to Â£1.1bn in its Spring Budget Â£100m for 29 road projects including bridge repairs in Sandwell and improving the A15 in the Humber region - this money had already been announced Over Â£1bn for new school buildings, as announced on Monday - this cash comes from the government's existing infrastructure plan Â£12bn to help build 180,000 new affordable homes for ownership and rent over the next eight years - brings together three pots of money already announced by previous Tory governments and Mr Johnson's administration Other projects announced in the government's Spring Budget, which will now be accelerated, include: Â£83m for maintenance of prisons and youth offender facilities, and Â£60m for temporary prison places. Â£900m for ""shovel ready"" local projects in England this year and in 2021 Â£500,000 - Â£1m for each area in the towns fund to spend on improvements to parks, high street and transport Mr Johnson acknowledged jobs might be lost because of the economic hit from the pandemic, but said a new ""opportunity guarantee"" would ensure every young person had the chance of an apprenticeship or placement. Asked whether the plans went far enough for those who end up unemployed, the PM said the strategy was for ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" and there would not be a return to austerity. But he could not put a figure on how many roles would be created through his plan, adding: ""We don't yet know what the full economic impact is going to be... [but] we will do everything we can to get this economy moving."" The prime minister loves a big, historical comparison. He is a keen student of Winston Churchill - and has even written a book about him. Over the last few days, the comparisons the government has sought to draw have been with former American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his ""New Deal."" Asmy colleagues at Reality Check point out, the plan set out today is a tiddler compared to what FDR did, and a fair chunk of it is re-announcing what we already knew the government was planning. But Boris Johnson is attempting to set out in a broader context the government's vision - and his pride in saying he wants to spend a lot to revitalise the economy and haul it out of the doldrums. Under what Mr Johnson dubbed ""project speed,"" planning laws would also be streamlined to encourage building. Changes, planned for September, include: Allowing many commercial buildings to change to residential use without planning application Cutting the normal planning process for builders who want to demolish and rebuild vacant residential and commercial buildings as homes Allowing homeowners to build above their properties ""via a fast track approval process"" and subject to neighbour consultation Pubs, libraries, village shops will be protected from the changes as they were ""essential to the lifeblood of communities,"" the government said. Mr Johnson acknowledged the planning changes might meet resistance in traditional Tory-voting areas, but said: ""Sometimes you have got to get on with things."" The government believes their existing plans for boosting infrastructure spending are already a significant fillip to the economy, and they want to see what happens as it re-opens. One set of figures released today shows household savings increased during lockdown, but will people have the confidence to spend? The scale of government support for businesses and employees in recent months probably does justify New Deal-style rhetoric. Extending support at that level may yet be required, and is far from ruled out. But for now, they are holding fire as they assess the permanent scars to the UK economy. Mr Johnson also attempted to calm Tory fears that he had shifted to the left, saying: ""I am not a communist"". Instead, he claimed he had been inspired by US president Franklin D Roosevelt, who led America out of the Great Depression with his New Deal in the 1930s. In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, President Roosevelt launched one of the largest, most expensive US government programmes which included building schools, hospitals and dams. Youth Worker Lisa Williams is worried young people will be hit hard In the former ""red wall"" seat of Rother Valley - which the Conservatives won from Labour for the first time at last year's general election - there has been a mixed reaction to the announcement from employees and business owners. David Shaw, operations manager for a manufacturing company, said the investment announcement was ""positive"" and praised the government's furlough scheme during the crisis for saving businesses. But Lisa Williams, manager of a youth and community centre in Dinnington, said of the promised investment that ""we've yet to see that happen"". ""Year-on-year, successive governments have made promises, and these areas have yet to see that,"" she said, adding she was concerned about the economic impact on young people. And Jayne Maxwell, a shop owner in Maltby, said she was sceptical about how much investment would go into high streets, saying more short-term help was needed. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""We're facing an economic crisis, the biggest we've seen in a generation and the recovery needs to match that. What's been announced amounts to less than Â£100 per person. ""And it's the re-announcement of many manifesto pledges and commitments, so it's not enough."" Sir Keir Starmer says more focus is needed on jobs The Labour leader added: ""We're not going to argue against a recovery plan, but the focus has to be on jobs."" CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said the prime minister had set out the ""first steps on the path to recovery"" but added that ""the focus on rescuing viable firms cannot slip"".

Johnson's economy speech fact-checked,"The prime minister has set out Â£5bn worth of infrastructure spending that he says will mean the UK can ""bounce back better"". Reality Check has taken a closer look at some of the announcements: Boris Johnson said: ""It sounds like a New Deal... because that is what the times demand."" In the early 1930s, President Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal programme increased the state's role in the economy and was designed to help the US recover from the Great Depression. Comparisons between government programmes in different countries, 90 years apart, are very difficult to make. Also, there are strong arguments that it was Roosevelt's structural reforms involving things like banking and social security that brought about the recovery. Nonetheless, there have been a few valiant attempts at trying to get New Deal spending into some sort of modern context. Remember that the New Deal ran over several years, with spending each year between about 5% and 7% of the total output of the economy (GDP) each year. Boris Johnson's Â£5bn would be less than a quarter of one percent of GDP if it were spent in a single year (which is unlikely). To get an idea of the scale of increased government spending in the 1930s, US federal government debt grew from 16% of GDP in 1929 to 44% of GDP in 1939. Before the speech, it was announced Â£1.5bn would be made available for hospital maintenance and construction, the removal of mental health dormitories and increasing A&E capacity. It would be part of the pot of money known as the capital budget. This spending is the money we use to build new hospitals or fix existing ones. It is also spent on new equipment, such as MRI machines. This spending was cut between 2010-11 - when the Conservatives entered power - and 2017-18 by about 7% in England, according to the Health Foundation. This was because the NHS was focusing its resources on day-to-day running of the health service, such as staff pay. However, recent announcements have seen spending refocus on capital projects. In the Spring Budget 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care's capital budget increased by Â£1.1bn, taking the annual budget to Â£8.2bn. The department has said that the Â£1.5bn announced on Tuesday is all on top of the earlier Â£1.1bn. There is an existing backlog of Â£6.5bn already needed to fix problems in NHS buildings. Boris Johnson: This is the moment to be ambitious What a shrinking economy means in one town Where do governments go when they need money? The government has pledged Â£100m this year for 29 projects to ""get Britain moving"", including: bridge repairs in Sandwell, in the West Midlands improving the A15 in the Humber region Â£10m for ''unblocking the central Manchester bottleneck'' But this is a relatively small amount of money for a large number of projects. And it is not new. It has been allocated from the money set out in the Spring Budget for infrastructure investment. The prime minister said ""we will build fantastic new homes on brownfield sites"" and promised the ""most radical reforms"" of the planning system since World War Two. The UK's planning system was effectively established in 1947, two years after the end of the war, with the Town and Country Planning Act. There has been criticism in recent years of the amount of time it takes to get planning permission. But it has also been pointed out  that many developers secure planning permission and then don't immediately build. Homeless charity Shelter said 280,000 homes were given planning permission in England between 2011 and 2016 but were never built. In 2017-18, 382,997 applications were granted, which would be more than enough to meet the government target of 300,000 new homes a year. The government has also said that it would spend Â£12bn to build houses over the next eight years, something which had been announced previously. That includes Â£9.5bn announced in the Spring Budget, which is to be spent over the next five years as well as Â£2bn announced by Theresa May's government in 2018, which has to be spent in the next eight years. The prime minister repeated Monday's pledge of Â£1bn for 50 school-building programmes starting in September 2021. This is also the allocation of some of the infrastructure spending announced in the Spring Budget. And there have been no details of which 50 schools will be given the money. On Monday, Mr Johnson announced Â£200m for further education. But this turned out to be just bringing forward some of the Â£1.5bn over five years promised in the Conservative manifesto for further education. And on Tuesday, Mr Johnson made no mention of this Â£200m, referring to the whole Â£1.5bn instead. The PM repeated a commitment to plant over 75,000 acres of trees (about 30,000 hectares) every year by 2025. But Conservative-led governments over the past decade have consistently fallen short of targets for tree-planting set out in their election manifestos. Tree-planting is a devolved issue in the UK, but England's tree-planting record is particularly poor compared with other European countries. Government funding and support saw about 3.6 million trees newly planted in England in the two years from 2017 to 2019, covering an area of about 2,300 hectares. That figure does not include trees planted to replace others that have been cut down. In the same period, Scotland planted 18,300 hectares - including 84% of all the new trees planted in the UK in 2018-19. The prime minister spoke about wanting ""to end the lunacy that stops us - for instance - deporting some violent offenders"". He didn't give any details, but the Conservative 2019 manifesto said: ""We will use our new freedoms after Brexit to prevent more foreign national offenders entering our country. We will cut the number of foreign nationals in our prisons."" After the transition deal ends on 31 December, it will be easier to deport criminals who are EU citizens. Previously deportations of EU citizens had to be ""proportionate"" to the crime and after an assessment on the actual threat they present to the UK. But after 31 December both EU and non-EU citizens will still be covered by human rights rules - these include whether someone might be tortured on return to their country of origin or if they had a close family link to the UK. In 2019, 5,110 foreign national offenders were deported. This piece was updated on 1 July to give more detail of the housebuilding scheme. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

""Because while it is a pain and a nuisance for us in the city to be subject to that level of restriction and to have the clock, as it were, turned back, it is nonetheless something that has some realistic prospect of being effective."" The loosening of restrictions in England which are due on Saturday, including the reopening of bars, restaurants and hair salons, will also not be taking place in the city. The relaxation of shielding measures on 6 July - which will allow the most clinically vulnerable to spend more time outside - has been cancelled in Leicester. The Bishop of Leicester said no weddings or funerals would take place in church buildings as a result of the local lockdown. Mr Hancock said advice on people not travelling in or out of Leicester was a ""recommendation for now"", but laws could be put in place to enforce the lockdown. He said the lockdown was ""profoundly in the interest of people in Leicester, and across the country that we get this virus under control"". However, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government had left people in the city ""anxious and confused"". This video can not be played Leicester city mayor urges residents to stay at home Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer echoed calls for a government press conference, saying the people of Leicester were ""crying out for answers to perfectly legitimate questions"". Downing Street said legislation already existed to allow the government to enforce the local lockdown but it needed to be signed off by the health secretary. A spokesman said there were no plans for a news conference, whilePrime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ""stay in close contact"",externalwith Leicester's mayor ""as we monitor the situation"". Is Leicester the first of many local lockdowns? Locked-out Leicester holidaymaker 'felt like leper' 'It's upsetting but better safe than sorry' Why has action taken so long in Leicester? Sir Peter also criticised the government and Public Health England for being too slow to share testing data with the city's officials. He said local leaders had tried to get figures from the government ""for weeks"". ""I wish they had taken a more speedy decision rather than leaving it 11 days from the secretary of state's first announcement,"" he said. ""That's a long gap, and a long time for the virus to spread."" Mr Hancock said Leicester's seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people - three times that of the next highest city. Bradford, Barnsley and Rochdale have all seen 45 or more cases per 100,000 people in the last week. Dave Stokes, chairman of Leicestershire Police Federation, called on the government to provide more detail on what the public can and cannot do during the lockdown. ""As we have seen over recent weeks and months, if the guidance and messaging from government is confusing for the public, then it will be almost impossible for our colleagues to police,"" he said. Nottinghamshire Police said officers could fine visitors from Leicester who they suspected had travelled to Nottingham for a ""night out"". The force said it would work with British Transport Police to ensure people were not coming to the city on trains from Leicester to shop or visit pubs. Teresa Lander is worried about ""a massive gap"" in her daughter's education Teresa Lander, 51, whose daughter goes to Launde Primary School in Oadby said the local lockdown was ""a surprise and a bit upsetting"" for parents and pupils. ""It's worrying how much school they are missing, it's a massive gap in their learning if they're not in from March to September,"" she said. ""They were having fun being back at school, it's disappointing for them, but you've got to respect it."" Read more reactionfrom local parents here. The local lockdown has also affected Leicester residents who had made holiday plans. Tracy Jebbett, 50, was due to travel to Pentewan Sands in Cornwall with her husband and daughter on 11 July. But the campsite the family had booked put up a Facebook post on Tuesday,saying they would not allow anyone from Leicester to visit the site. ""I feel like a Leicester leper,"" she said. ""I understand why, but I think they should've contacted the holiday goers from Leicester privately by email."" Tracy Jebbett, her daughter Jessica and husband Martin were due to go on holiday Businesses also said they had been left reeling by the abrupt nature of the announcement. Blake Edwards, owner of Flappers and Gentlemen salon, said he was ""devastated"" by the news as he was due to reopen on Saturday and had bookings for the next five weeks. ""Time is running out [for the business], we're going to need more support,"" he said. ""Even though the staff is being furloughed, rent still needs to be paid, all the other bills still need to be paid."" Blake Edwards said his salon was fully booked for the next five weeks The government has confirmed businesses that have been forced to shut their doors because of the local lockdown can re-furlough staff. Restaurant owner Shaf Islam said: ""I had a spring in my step getting ready for the reopening on the fourth of July. ""To say the news is a big disappointment is an understatement. We'd spent a lot of money and I'd called staff back from furlough."" Leicester City said it hoped its home games could go ahead despite the stricter lockdown. The club is due to host Crystal Palace on Saturday, and said the Premier League remains ""completely satisfied"" with its ""Covid operations plan"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

Lockdown has altered all our lives in a fundamental way. It has challenged many of us in ways we never would have imagined. Families have lost loved ones while others have been forced to stay apart when every instinct would normally have led them to spend time together. And in some cases it's brought out the very best in human nature with acts of extraordinary kindness. We hope you've found it interesting looking back on this fast-moving, ever-changing three months. And we hope to see you again tomorrow. From Saturday people can get a haircut, see a film and enjoy a pint in the pub once more. Venues closed since the middle of March will be able to welcome visitors as long as safety measures are in place. The vast majority of English galleries and museums won't reopen on Saturday, despitebeing given the go-ahead by the government to do so last week. Holiday accommodation - including hotels, B&Bs, cottages, campsites and caravan parks - can also reopen, and people in England will be free to stay away from home overnight for the first time since lockdown began in March. The lifting of the restrictions don't apply in Leicester,which is having to re-impose some lockdown measures due to a rise in cases. Read more about this weekend's changes here. They have become the staple of socially distant socialising - the virtual quiz. All over the country people have fancied themselves the next Alexander Armstrong, Bradley Walsh, Sue Barker or Anne Robinson as they set brainteasers for their friends in the absence of the pub. Now you can quiz yourself with our quiz quiz, all about quizzes. There have been calls for work to prevent further flooding in Fishlake to resume as soon as possible following the easing of lockdown measures. Church warden Peter Pridham said work to stop a repeat of the scenes of flooding in November 2019, was needed urgently following the disruption of the coronavirus crisis. He said: ""It's most unfortunate the two things have coincided."" The Environment Agency said site visits to Fishlake had now recommenced in line with government advice. A spokesperson said:
""Residents will see our staff and contractors gathering additional
information through land surveys, ground investigations and inspections to
inform work to improve flood defences."" We've been looking at 100 days of lockdown today but this is what else has been going on: Andrew AloiaBBC Sport Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford
campaigned for children to be able to claim free school meal vouchers in the
summer holidays. The 22-year-oldâs efforts prompted aU-turn from the government, meaning about 1.3m youngsters in England would be better off. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the England star's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". Rashford, who just 11 years earlier was among those who needed breakfast clubs and free school meals to supplement what his mum could provide, said he wants to do more to help those in need after the success of his campaign As England marks 100 days of lockdown, one photographer shares thepictures he took to document the impact on Skegness- one of the UK's most popular seaside resorts. Thousands of Lego-builders took advantage of lockdown and made use of their time at home to create stop-motion movies and models of real-life constructions. The Danish toy was the subject of more internet searches during lockdown than in the same months in previous years. Jon Opstad, his six-year-old son Ollie and four-year-old daughter Alice, recreated famous James Bond scenes from the likes of Thunderball and The Living Daylights. Whenshops in England reopenedon 15 July demand surged and queues formed. Research firm Springboard said that by 17:00 that day, footfall was 38.8% higher than the week before. But shopper numbers were generally far below the same time last year. At Bicester Village, near Oxford,crowding was so great that 3,000 people signed a petition to close it. Andrew AloiaBBC Sport Despite not kicking a ball for almost three months,Chelseawere named Womenâs Super League championsafter the season was curtailed in June. Days after collecting the title, the London club said they
would donate the Â£100,00 in prize money to Refuge, a charity which supports
women and children experiencing domestic abuse. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said they had
seen a âhuge increaseâ in demand for its services during the pandemic. ""We are incredibly grateful to Chelsea Women for not
only shining a light on domestic abuse, but also supporting us with a
significant financial commitment - this is an incredible gesture,"" Horley
said. Before lockdown the sight of someone in a face mask on the bus might have drawn a few glances, but as June got under way the governmentannounced plans to make them compulsory on public transport. To keep supplies of surgical masks for medical professionals, people have instead been advised on how tomake their own cloth coverings. Staff at a Liverpool care home share their experiences of working during the pandemic. This video can not be played Bob DaleBBC Live reporter At the start of Junewe met 103-year-old Joan Willett, who is
walking to raise money for charity. Unable to get out during lockdown, she's tackling a steep hill at
her care home in Hastings every day. Inspired by Captain Tom, the 100-year-old who raised millions for
the NHS, she's being sponsored and has so far raised about Â£9,000 for the
British Heart Foundation as a thank you for the care she received when she
needed heart surgery in her 80s. Joan is still going - she plans to climb the hill every day until
she turns 104 on 19 July. This video can not be played One-hundred days of lockdown have inevitably taken their toll on medics working on the coronavirus frontline right across the UK. The BBC caught up with three members of staff at City Hospital, in Birmingham, who have been reflecting on a period that one describes as ""the hardest three months"" of more than 20 years of work in intensive care medicine. This video can not be played Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit The beginning of June saw children in Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 allowed back in school in ""bubbles"". As the month has gone on more children have been going back, with just under 1.6 million pupils in last week. But that's still less than 16% of all children. Bob DaleBBC Live reporter Adrian Backshall knew exactly how he was going to spend lockdown. The former British Rail worker used the time to assemble the
track, signals and wagon he had collected over the years into a working 30ft
(9m) railway in his back garden, in Eastbourne. Since theBBC highlighted his story in Aprilhe
has been busy adding lights, and says he has even been able to sleep in it on
warmer nights. He's also entering it in the 2020 shed of the
year contest.  This video can not be played However, Adrian's attempts to persuade his wife Ruth to let him extend the track to the end of the garden have so far failed. One of Ruth's prize flower beds stands in the way and she won't let him dig it up. On Thursday evening many of us in the UK grabbed our pots and pans, scooped up the dog, and nervously looked out of the window to make sure our neighbours were doing the same. Then, when the clock struck 20:00 BST, the sound of clapping, cheering and wooden spoons hitting saucepan lids once again filled the street as we celebrated those working on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic. But founder Annemarie Plas saidthe 10th week of clapping would be a good time for it to endand for it to instead become an annual event. Ms Plas, a Dutch-born Londoner, said it had been ""overwhelming"" to see how far the weekly clapping she founded had spread. But she said it had now ""had its moment"", saying it would be ""beautiful"" to end while people still felt positive about it. Hot weather towards the end of May saw people flock to beaches and beauty spots. At Durdle Door in Dorset police had to respond to reports of concern for the safety of people who were jumping off the cliff into the sea. Two helicopters landed on the beach and people ended up crowding together to make room. The sight of crowded beaches, bringing concerns about the possible further spread of coronavirus, would be seen again on several occasions as the good weather made its return the following the month.

Channel - in her garden. Connie Emmett has done the 34,000 strokes of the crawl needed to cover 23 miles in a paddling pool - all for her local hospital. The BBC first spoke to Connie Emmett, from Cranleigh, when she embarked on her task, with comedian and Channel swimmer David Walliams sending her his best wishes. Connie raised Â£2,300 for the Royal Surrey County Hospital in
Guildford. A serious competition swimmer, Connie has continued to use the
pool during lockdown, and her mum Sarah estimates that she's probably covered
enough distance now to have returned from France. Unsurprisingly, Connie wants to have a go at swimming the real
thing when she's old enough. This video can not be played People living a North Lincolnshire street say they'll keep working out together. Neighbours have become friends in this street

"Plane-maker Airbus plans to cut 15,000 jobsIt comes as the aerospace firm deals with the fallout of the coronavirus crisis.Business","Airbus has two UK sites, in Flintshire in Wales and Filton near Bristol Aerospace giant Airbus says it plans to cut 15,000 jobs as it deals with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. It will cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, along with thousands more in Germany, Spain and elsewhere. The move is subject to talks with unions which have opposed compulsory redundancies. The Unite union said the Airbus announcement was ""another act of industrial vandalism"" against the UK aerospace sector. Some 134,000 people work for Airbus worldwide, with around a tenth of them in the UK. The firm said the UK cuts would fall only on the commercial aircraft division at its two sites at Broughton in Flintshire and Filton, Bristol. Airbus furloughs 3,200 after 'bleeding cash' alert Aerospace industry 'will take years' to recover More details of the job losses and how they will break down between the two giant factories will come at the end of the week after talks with unions. However, Unite said it expected 1,116 manufacturing jobs and 611 office-based jobs to go, shrinking Airbus's UK workforce by 15%. These cuts were inevitable. The only question was just how severe the pain would be. The Covid-19 pandemic has been little short of catastrophic for the airline industry. At one point in April, global air traffic was down by more than 90%. When planes aren't flying, they aren't earning money. Yet they still need to be maintained and leasing costs or loans still need to be paid. The result? Airlines are struggling to survive and simply can't afford to take on new planes right now. And that, of course, means Airbus has had to curb production. Airbus has delayed these cuts and has made full use of support from governments. But ultimately it had little choice. And the pain being felt in places such as Broughton, Toulouse and Hamburg will echo through the entire supply chain. The firm expects to make the cuts by summer 2021, but hopes the majority of redundancies will be voluntary or through early retirement of staff. The company warned in April that it was ""bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed"" as it struggled with the impact of the coronavirus crisis. It said on Tuesday that production had dropped by 40% in recent months, and that it did not expect air traffic to get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 at the earliest. ""Airbus is facing the gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced,"" said chief executive Guillaume Faury. ""The measures we have taken so far have enabled us to absorb the initial shock of this global pandemic. ""Now, we must ensure that we can sustain our enterprise and emerge from the crisis as a healthy, global aerospace leader, adjusting to the overwhelming challenges of our customers."" News of the cuts comes as the international aviation industry reels from the impact of the pandemic. On Tuesday, EasyJet said it would close three UK bases and cut about 2,000 staff. And Reuters reported that Air France/KLM was targeting more than 6,500 job cuts over the next two years. Jim McMahon, Labour's shadow transport secretary, called for more government support in the UK. ""Labour has consistently called for an extension to the furlough in the most impacted industries, and a sectoral deal that supports the whole aviation industry including securing jobs and protecting the supply chain, while continuing to press for higher environmental standards."" A government spokesman said: ""We understand this will be a difficult time for Airbus's employees and their families, and we stand ready to support anyone affected in any way we can. ""We will continue to work closely with the sector to ensure firms are able to rebuild as the civil aviation market recovers.""

May criticises PM over choice of security adviserTheresa May questions Brexit envoy David Frost's qualifications to replace Sir Mark Sedwill in role.,"This video can not be played Theresa May asks why is the new national security advisor is a âpolitical appointee with no proven experience"" Theresa May has criticised the PM's appointment of his Brexit negotiator to be his new national security adviser. Speaking in the Commons, she suggested David Frost did not have the required expertise or independence to succeed Sir Mark Sedwill in the role. Labour said the choice of Mr Frost, who is currently leading the UK's trade talks with the EU, was ""dangerous"". But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said Mr Frost was highly qualified and would be accountable to the PM. Mr Frost is a former civil servant, having left the Foreign Office in 2013 to work in the private sector. He is due to take on the role at the end of August, at which point Sir Mark will also stand down from his other role as cabinet secretary, the UK's top civil servant. Does it matter if the national security adviser is politically appointed? UK's top civil servant announces exit Sedwill's exit speeds up Whitehall reform Mrs May, who appointed Sir Mark Sedwill to both roles when she was PM, told MPs that during her nine years as a member of the National Security Council, she had ""listened to the expert, independent advice from national security advisers"". She asked Mr Gove how Mr Frost's appointment squared with remarks he made in a recent speech on civil service reform on the need to ""promote people with proven expertise"". ""Why is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?"" Mr Gove said there were precedents for non civil servants to take on key roles serving the PM and that the official that oversees senior government appointments agreed this was appropriate in this case. He said Mr Frost would neither be a civil servant nor a special adviser but would have the status of an envoy. David Frost left the Diplomatic Service in 2013 to work in the private sector before being hired by Boris Johnson ""We have had excellent national security advisers in the past, not all of whom were steeped in the national security world but were distinguished diplomats in their own right,"" he said. ""David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right and it is entirely appropriate that the prime minister of the day should choose an adviser appropriate to the needs of the hour."" But Mrs May was seen to shake her head vigorously while Mr Gove was speaking. The two have clashed in the past, most notably over extremism in schools, when they were members of David Cameron's cabinet. Mrs May sacked Mr Gove when she became PM in 2016 but subsequently brought him back. The role of national security adviser was created by David Cameron in 2010. Its previous occupants, Sir Peter Ricketts, Sir Kim Darroch and Sir Mark Lyall Grant, were all senior career diplomats. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague has added his voice to those concerned at Mr Frost's appointment, saying it had ""raised eyebrows"" and possibly ""sharpened daggers"" within the defence and intelligence communities. In his weekly column for the Daily Telegraph,external, the former Tory leader said that while the ex-diplomat was ""highly capable"", the role was better suited to someone with first-hand experience of security operations. Warning about the danger of US-style politicisation of senior government roles, he added: ""If we want the most promising people to serve the country, they have to come from varied points of view. ""All of us who have dealt with US administrations have witnessed the nightmare of changing long lists of officials when a new President comes in, leading to extended vacancies, loss of expertise and serious damage to diplomacy.""

May criticises PM over choice of security adviserTheresa May questions Brexit envoy David Frost's qualifications to replace Sir Mark Sedwill in role.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Theresa May asks why is the new national security advisor is a âpolitical appointee with no proven experience"" Theresa May has criticised the PM's appointment of his Brexit negotiator to be his new national security adviser. Speaking in the Commons, she suggested David Frost did not have the required expertise or independence to succeed Sir Mark Sedwill in the role. Labour said the choice of Mr Frost, who is currently leading the UK's trade talks with the EU, was ""dangerous"". But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said Mr Frost was highly qualified and would be accountable to the PM. Mr Frost is a former civil servant, having left the Foreign Office in 2013 to work in the private sector. He is due to take on the role at the end of August, at which point Sir Mark will also stand down from his other role as cabinet secretary, the UK's top civil servant. Does it matter if the national security adviser is politically appointed? UK's top civil servant announces exit Sedwill's exit speeds up Whitehall reform Mrs May, who appointed Sir Mark Sedwill to both roles when she was PM, told MPs that during her nine years as a member of the National Security Council, she had ""listened to the expert, independent advice from national security advisers"". She asked Mr Gove how Mr Frost's appointment squared with remarks he made in a recent speech on civil service reform on the need to ""promote people with proven expertise"". ""Why is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?"" Mr Gove said there were precedents for non civil servants to take on key roles serving the PM and that the official that oversees senior government appointments agreed this was appropriate in this case. He said Mr Frost would neither be a civil servant nor a special adviser but would have the status of an envoy. David Frost left the Diplomatic Service in 2013 to work in the private sector before being hired by Boris Johnson ""We have had excellent national security advisers in the past, not all of whom were steeped in the national security world but were distinguished diplomats in their own right,"" he said. ""David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right and it is entirely appropriate that the prime minister of the day should choose an adviser appropriate to the needs of the hour."" But Mrs May was seen to shake her head vigorously while Mr Gove was speaking. The two have clashed in the past, most notably over extremism in schools, when they were members of David Cameron's cabinet. Mrs May sacked Mr Gove when she became PM in 2016 but subsequently brought him back. The role of national security adviser was created by David Cameron in 2010. Its previous occupants, Sir Peter Ricketts, Sir Kim Darroch and Sir Mark Lyall Grant, were all senior career diplomats. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague has added his voice to those concerned at Mr Frost's appointment, saying it had ""raised eyebrows"" and possibly ""sharpened daggers"" within the defence and intelligence communities. In his weekly column for the Daily Telegraph,external, the former Tory leader said that while the ex-diplomat was ""highly capable"", the role was better suited to someone with first-hand experience of security operations. Warning about the danger of US-style politicisation of senior government roles, he added: ""If we want the most promising people to serve the country, they have to come from varied points of view. ""All of us who have dealt with US administrations have witnessed the nightmare of changing long lists of officials when a new President comes in, leading to extended vacancies, loss of expertise and serious damage to diplomacy.""

UK economy hit by worst contraction in 41 years,"The UK economy shrank more than first thought between January and March, contracting 2.2% in the joint largest fall since 1979, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalrevised down its previous estimate of a 2% contraction, with all the main economic sectors dropping. There was a significant economic impact in March, as the coronavirus pandemic began to have an effect. The data comes as the prime minister set out a post-lockdown recovery plan. Boris Johnson said in a speech in Dudley, in the West Midlands, that there would be investment in infrastructure and schools. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""Our more detailed picture of the economy in the first quarter showed GDP shrank a little more than first estimated. ""Information from government showed health activities declined more than we previously showed. ""All main sectors of the economy shrank significantly in March as the effects of the pandemic hit."" The first-quarter contraction is now the joint biggest drop since the July-to-September period in 1979. What is GDP and why does it matter? PM pledges to 'build back better' post-virus Mr Athow said: ""The sharp fall in consumer spending at the end of March led to a notable increase in households' savings."" The new data showed that GDP contracted by 6.9% in March. The first-quarter figures show that the services sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of UK GDP - shrank by a record 2.3%. The ONS said production output fell by a revised 1.5% in the three months, driven by declines in manufacturing as factories temporarily shut down, while there was a fall in construction output of 1.7%. The coronavirus lockdown only came into force on 23 March, so figures for the second quarter of the year will show the full hit on the economy. Recent ONS monthly figuresshowed the economy plummeted by 20.4% in April- the largest drop in a single month since records began. That contraction was three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. It says something that the first quarter of the year was the worst for the economy in 41 years - and yet it was still barely a tenth the size of the contraction in activity in just one month - last April. The figures put the government's ""build build build"" announcement in perspective. The Â£5bn infrastructure spending being ""brought forward"" is not new money in any case. It was set aside in the pre-election manifesto at a time when the economy looked very different. Compare it, say, to the Â£69bn it's estimated that small businesses will lose in the pandemic because they've had to stop trading (according to research by small business insurers Simply Business). Or compare it to total public spending of more than Â£1,000bn, and it's less than 0.5%. Against the size of the economy based on the latest GDP numbers, the mooted infrastructure spend is more like 0.25%. The government's going to have to spend a lot more than that to stimulate a recovery from a slump on this scale. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest figures could be summed up in one line: ""The biggest contraction for 40 years, even though Q1 contained just nine lockdown days."" The data ""was just the prelude"", with worse to come, he added. However, while economists are braced for a dire set of second-quarter figures, Howard Archer, at the EY Item Club, believes April's sharp contraction is likely to have been the low point. He predicted the economy would ""return to clear growth in the third quarter with GDP expanding close to 10% quarter-on-quarter"" as lockdown restrictions are eased further. In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Johnson promised an ""infrastructure revolution"", arguing the government needed to ""work fast"" to support jobs whilst also seeking to ""level up"" the economy so that all parts of the country can benefit. He said the government would introduce ""the most radical reforms of our planning system since the end of the Second World War"" to speed up building and infrastructure projects where, he argued, the UK compares unfavourably with other European countries. As part of what he called a ""new deal"", the prime minister set out plans to accelerate Â£5bn of spending on infrastructure projects. Meanwhile,separate ONS data on the nation's finances,externalshowed that Britain's current account deficit widened by more than expected in the first quarter. The balance of payments deficit - the difference between the value of the goods and services that a country imports and the goods and services it exports - rose to Â£21.1bn, or 3.8% of GDP. This means the UK is reliant on inflows of cash from abroad and leaves the pound vulnerable, according to Mr Tombs. ""Sterling almost certainly would depreciate sharply again if a major second wave of Covid-19 emerges or if the UK and EU fail to either sign a trade deal or to extend the transition period before the end of this year,"" he said.

Anger as China approves Hong Kong security law,"Opponents fear the law will curtail the right to protest The UK, EU and Nato have expressed concern and anger after China passed a controversial security law giving it new powers over Hong Kong. The law makes secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison. It took effect from 2300 local time (1500 GMT) on Tuesday. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security. One key pro-democracy group said it was now ceasing all operations. Demosistoannounced the move on Facebook,externalafter Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, said he was leaving the group, which he had spearheaded. Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit The law has come into effect just a day before the 23rd anniversary of the return of sovereignty to China - a day that usually draws large pro-democracy protests. This video can not be played Artist and activist Ai Weiwei: ""Today is the darkest day for Hong Kong"" China says the law is needed to tackle unrest and instability linked to a broadening pro-democracy movement. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The city of two masks faces a new crisis Opponents say it undermines the autonomy set out in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which was agreed when the territory's sovereignty was returned by the UK in 1997. Civil liberties such as free speech, the right to protest and an independent and robust judiciary are at risk, they say. There has been a mixture of concern for personal safety and defiance at the news. Demosisto said several members had asked to be delisted and it had decided to ""dissolve and stop all meetings"". It said that the fight against ""totalitarian oppression"" would have to continue in a ""more flexible manner"". Joshua Wong said the law marked ""the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before"". Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions The background you need on Hong Kong's protests But Democratic Party leader Wu Chi-wai said he would defy a ban on a ""handover day"" march scheduled for Wednesday, the South China Morning Post reports. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai: China's security law 'spells the death knell for Hong Kong' (Interview from June 2020) He will be joined by Figo Chan, of the Civil Human Rights Front, who urged people to take to the streets, saying: ""We are aware of the risks of being prosecuted. But we insist on taking the lead, as we want to tell Hongkongers not to fear."" Police plan to have 4,000 riot officers on standby. UK Foreign SecretaryDominic Raab urged China to ""step back from the brink""and respect the rights of the people of Hong Kong. He said: ""The success of Hong Kong, the entrepreneurial spirit, the vibrancy, the economic success, has been built on its autonomy in 'one country, two systems'... That clearly is at threat."" What is the BNO and what does the UK move mean? The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said: ""It risks seriously undermining the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong and will have a detrimental impact on the judiciary and the rule of law and we deplore this decision."" Tear gas is fired to disperse a protest in Hong Kong in May The last UK governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, said the law marked the end of one-country, two-systems. Meanwhile, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""It is clear that China does not share our values - democracy, freedom, and the rule of law."" Japan called the law ""regrettable"" and Taiwan even warned its citizens of risks in visiting Hong Kong. The US has already begun taking steps to end Hong Kong's special status trade relationship, a move China on Tuesday said would be met with unspecified ""countermeasures"". Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent Hong Kong's sweeping new security law is a frighteningly open-ended tool to suppress political agitation. Like similar laws on the Chinese mainland it appears that it can be manipulated to meet the needs of the Communist Party as required to crush almost any action deemed threatening. Unlike elsewhere in China, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary. For this reason, the Party's leadership was not going to leave interpretation of this law in the hands of just any old judges. No. Those who'll be allowed to preside in these matters will be hand-picked by Carrie Lam, the city's leader who was effectively installed by Beijing. So, prior to the new security bill, which actions by activists - no matter how subversive - could not be dealt with under existing laws? What were ""extremists"" getting away with to warrant this new legislation? Bomb making? No. Smashing up buildings? No. Meeting with international NGOs to talk about the city's deteriorating freedoms? Ahhhh. Perhaps. Publicly advocating Hong Kong independence? Almost certainly. The more that Beijing, under Xi Jinping's leadership, has sought to control Hong Kong, the more it has driven residents into the pro-democracy camp. But he is playing a long game. Sure, handover promises to the UK were made but he was not going to let some Western attachment to liberty trump loyalty to the motherland. Not on his watch. Enter the security law. The law, announced by Beijing in May, will make criminal any act of secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign or external forces. State news agency Xinhua said the six-chapter law had 66 articles, clearly setting out the terms of the four offences. Beijing to set up new security office in Hong Kong A new office in Hong Kong will deal with national security cases, but will also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 In addition, the city will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser. Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, a move which has raised fears about judicial independence. Importantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes priority. In a video address to the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said crimes under the new law would be clearly defined. She said the law would only target a ""small minority"" and would not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We respect differences in opinion."" In recent years, Hong Kong has seen waves of protests demanding more rights. Last year, rallies over a now-scrapped bill permitting extraditions to the mainland turned violent and fuelled a broad pro-democracy movement. What is Hong Kong's national security law?

Cineworld delays reopening UK cinemas to 31 July,"Cineworld has pushed back the reopening of its UK and US cinemas to 31 July, blaming a delay in new film releases. The world's second-largest cinema chain had previously announced cinemas in both countries would open on 10 July. Cineworld said films including Mulan and Tenet had been delayed from July to August. The company said cinemas would open with new safety measures in place, but some staff say the measures do not go far enough. A petition signed by almost 1,500 people,externaland started by Cineworld staff has called for masks to be made mandatory for customers in cinema foyers. A leader of the Cineworld Action Group, who spoke to the BBC but did not want to give their name, said: ""Some studies have shown that masks do help to protect. We don't have a choice about returning to work. If it makes it safer for us and for other customers, I think it's a small ask. ""It's a luxury to come to the cinema but our lives shouldn't be treated as a luxury, it's important."" The BBC has asked Cineworld to comment on the staff demands. How and when will cinemas reopen in England? The cinema chain says new safety measures will include contactless payments and seating capacity limits in line with local regulations. Advice for all cinemas from the film trade body, the UK Cinema Association, advises cinema companies to sell a reduced number of tickets to each screening, with people from different households sitting apart. The association also says pick 'n' mix stands should be removed, and moviegoers should be encouraged to pre-order popcorn. Earlier this year, the coronavirus pandemic forced Cineworld to close its 787 cinemas in 10 countries, whilecompany bosses waived their salariesand bonuses. The UK-based firm also halted dividend payments to mitigate the impact on trading. Cineworld chief executive Mooky Greidinger said other films that will be released this summer include A Quiet Place Part II, The Broken Hearts Gallery, Bill & Ted Face the Music and Antebellum, as well as a re-release of Christopher Nolan's Inception on Imax.

100 days of lockdown: How life changed in a UK town,"""Never known anything like it in my lifetime."" That's a line we'll all have heard in the 100 days since Boris Johnson announced the coronavirus lockdown on 23 March. Normally it'd be something your nan might say. For Telford in Shropshire, it's true of an entire town. Throughout the last 100 days, Radio 1 Newsbeat has been in touch with people in Telford about how lockdown has changed them and their lives. There's the local footballer who has no idea what will happen to his career, the personal trainer who had to change her business overnight and the rapper who thought 2020 would be his best yet. Telford has only existed since the late 1960s - built then to offer new housing to people from much busier cities. After 50 years, it's still called ""a new town"". ""It's got a perfect blend of rural and urban,"" 18-year-old Molly Morgan tells us about her hometown. ""It's a great place to grow up."" ""I've grown up here, my family's here, my future's here,"" adds personal trainer Esther Williams. ""It's got a great community. When I was younger, I'd have gone to Birmingham or Wolverhampton for the day but now there's so much to do in Telford."" Telford was a far more ambitious project than other new towns of the era, like Stevenage and Crawley. The aim was for 225,000 people to live there by 1991. In 2020 there are around 155,000. The town is cut down the middle by the motorway linking Shropshire with the Black Country. Famous brands including Hitachi take sites on the industrial Stafford Park to the east, with the world famous Iron Bridge, arching over the River Severn, a couple of miles to the south. This was the first major bridge in the world made of cast iron when it opened in 1781 The idea for Telford was to bring smaller towns, like Dawley and Lawley, together into one community. ""It's got a magnificent situation overlooking Shropshireâ¦ I think it's got the makings of a very fine town indeed,"" were the words of Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, former City Architect of Birmingham, who helped with the plans. ""Once an attractive town is built there - industry will go,"" he said. In lockdown, Telford is a community facing some of its biggest challenges - and the people we've been talking to spoke about challenges that will feel very familiar. In many of the stories you hear, it's the mood of uncertainty which keeps coming up. Esther's personal training firm, Ruthless, takes up a small corrugated unit on the sprawling industrial estate of Hortonwood, where both Epson and Heinz have bases. She only started her business in 2018 and its whole model was transformed overnight on 23 March when the prime minister addressed the country and told us that all non-essential businesses, including gyms, must close. Esther's been paying full rent on the unit during lockdown and is still waiting for the government to say she can re-open. In the meantime, her focus is online sessions and small exercise classes in the park. ""The work I'm doing is great, and I'm so grateful for that, but it's not quite enough to be able to keep paying the rent there."" Like so many people, Esther's working life was transformed by coronavirus During that first week of lockdown, Esther told her clients on Facebook: ""We will be back. We will be stronger. We will be unstoppable."" Looking back now, she adds: ""I've never done online so I was quite nervous. I went to Zoom having never used Zoom before. ""For me, it was completely different. It was daunting to begin with but I'm so glad I did."" You can't help but notice Esther says ""so grateful"" and ""so glad"" a lot. She acknowledges others businesses have not had her flexibility. Esther's husband lost his job in sales but couldn't get furlough as he'd only been with his company a short time. ""He's just starting now to get interviews. The stress of trying to find a job - even a temporary job - they just go so quick. Things are getting better now. I'm just lucky I can work now and things are starting to move."" From Esther's unit to one of the town's focal points - the New Bucks Head, home to non-league AFC Telford United - is just a seven-minute drive. For the sixth tier of English football, it's impressive. A 6,000-capacity stadium would surely be one of the bigger days out in the National League North. Guiseley AFC and Curzon Ashton are typical visitors. AFC Telford United take on their famous neighbours Wolverhampton Wanderers in a friendly match AFC Telford United typically get a thousand people turning up to home games but there's been nobody through the turnstiles since Kettering Town on 14 March - and without any income from tickets, the club's faced desperate measures. On a Go Fund Me page seeking donations, a message reads: ""All of our income streams have dramatically reduced to virtually zero for several weeks now and it's almost certain as a business it will take some time to recover."" Midfielder Adam Walker says the months without football have been tough on the players too. They said goodbye to each other after a fairly regular match - minus the handshakes - expecting to see each other again later in the same week. ""And that never happened. So it's been a big gap in everyone's lives really."" Adam says coronavirus started to feel real when they were no longer allowed to shake hands with opposing players Adam has become something of an unofficial spokesman for the players. He says some are having to look at a career change. ""There's a very dark mist overhead still until this is resolved. There's massive uncertainty on how many clubs will be able to survive."" He points to the potential impact that could have on this community. ""A club like Telford have always had a very good side and a lovely stadium. You take that away from the community and there'd be a massive hole there."" Without the guarantees of gate receipts, the club's been helping its players find other work, such as coaching. Adam says there has been a massive hole in the life of Telford United's players ""The gaffer's tried to help players at the end of their career or maybe the younger ones who don't know yet whether they'll get paid for football and they might have young families. ""It's showing them how to be employable because a lot of people will be looking for jobs in this period. ""It's to try to help people have an income and still play football."" There has been football on the Bucks Head site for a century, but the area's not had the biggest live music scene recently. ""Telford has had a shortage of actual live music venues. One of the main ones closed down a few years ago,"" says Tim Rogers - a financial services worker by day, who takes off the suit and tie to become rapper Trademark Blud out of office hours. Trademark Blud was expecting to play at a few festivals this summer This year felt like a moment of change - with a new 300-capacity venue opening in the town's Southwater Square. It's easy to imagine Southwater Square without ever visiting. Cineworld, Nando's, TGi Fridays, all built in the last few years - all designed to give people in Telford a new option for a night out. Tim thought the new venue was going to be a big moment for the local live scene - with the prospect of international names coming to Telford. ""It's terrible. The most important thing is being able to deliver what you've produced to people and see their reactions and let them enjoy in the way you hope they will."" One of V Festival's two sites was a few miles from Telford until 2017, when the festival was discontinued. Here's Amy Winehouse performing there in 2008 He sounds undeniably flat talking about his music. He's been doing shows online but ""they're not the same"". ""It's not even 50% - especially with rap and hip-hop as it's super energetic."" To top it off, he had festival bookings for Boomtown and B-Side festival in 2020, which obviously won't be happening. Outside of music though Tim says he's feeling ""much more comfortable"" about the pandemic - his fears of picking it up have reduced and he's settled into working at home. Covid came closer than he'd like though - a child in his son's class lost his father after he contracted the virus. Molly's university plans have changed due to Covid-19 For 18-year-old Molly, the latest lockdown easing is a bit of good news - she's got her friend's 18th birthday the week whennew measurescome into effect, so they'll get a celebration. Beyond that, Molly's future will probably be closer to Telford than she'd been planning. She should have just finished her A-Levels. But of course she never actually sat them and has tweaked her uni choices because she didn't get to finish her open day tours. Now, she's looking at PPE (not that one, she jokes, after pulling her own face covering down) in Liverpool or Birmingham. This PPE is politics, philosophy and economics. ""I'd have been more open to going further away but without the chance to visit, I was apprehensive to go somewhere without seeing the city. I'd have been a bit more adventurous."" Molly says she's nervous about the prospect of her first year at university being mostly online learning. ""I don't want to stay in my room essentially for the whole yearâ¦ I'm not sure that's right for me. I've toyed with delaying for a year to get the proper uni experience."" Trademark Blud's sound might be a bit different in the coming months... Molly will know more when the results come in August, Adam's keeping the training going waiting for news on the new season. Esther hopes her unit will be open for classes after the next wave of government announcements. And rapper Trademark Blud? He's eyeing up a plan B. ""Some of my friends are acoustic guitarists and they might get back and start gigging again. It's maybe difficult for my genre - it's more of a live venue, nightclub, big stage kind of thing. ""I'm thinking of working with some guitarists and going to do the local pubs. I don't think they'll appreciate me jumping around and jumping off the tables at six o'clock.

"UK economy hit by worst contraction in 41 yearsThe economy contracted by more than first estimated between January and March, revised figures show.BusinessComments","The UK economy shrank more than first thought between January and March, contracting 2.2% in the joint largest fall since 1979, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalrevised down its previous estimate of a 2% contraction, with all the main economic sectors dropping. There was a significant economic impact in March, as the coronavirus pandemic began to have an effect. The data comes as the prime minister set out a post-lockdown recovery plan. Boris Johnson said in a speech in Dudley, in the West Midlands, that there would be investment in infrastructure and schools. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""Our more detailed picture of the economy in the first quarter showed GDP shrank a little more than first estimated. ""Information from government showed health activities declined more than we previously showed. ""All main sectors of the economy shrank significantly in March as the effects of the pandemic hit."" The first-quarter contraction is now the joint biggest drop since the July-to-September period in 1979. What is GDP and why does it matter? PM pledges to 'build back better' post-virus Mr Athow said: ""The sharp fall in consumer spending at the end of March led to a notable increase in households' savings."" The new data showed that GDP contracted by 6.9% in March. The first-quarter figures show that the services sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of UK GDP - shrank by a record 2.3%. The ONS said production output fell by a revised 1.5% in the three months, driven by declines in manufacturing as factories temporarily shut down, while there was a fall in construction output of 1.7%. The coronavirus lockdown only came into force on 23 March, so figures for the second quarter of the year will show the full hit on the economy. Recent ONS monthly figuresshowed the economy plummeted by 20.4% in April- the largest drop in a single month since records began. That contraction was three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. It says something that the first quarter of the year was the worst for the economy in 41 years - and yet it was still barely a tenth the size of the contraction in activity in just one month - last April. The figures put the government's ""build build build"" announcement in perspective. The Â£5bn infrastructure spending being ""brought forward"" is not new money in any case. It was set aside in the pre-election manifesto at a time when the economy looked very different. Compare it, say, to the Â£69bn it's estimated that small businesses will lose in the pandemic because they've had to stop trading (according to research by small business insurers Simply Business). Or compare it to total public spending of more than Â£1,000bn, and it's less than 0.5%. Against the size of the economy based on the latest GDP numbers, the mooted infrastructure spend is more like 0.25%. The government's going to have to spend a lot more than that to stimulate a recovery from a slump on this scale. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest figures could be summed up in one line: ""The biggest contraction for 40 years, even though Q1 contained just nine lockdown days."" The data ""was just the prelude"", with worse to come, he added. However, while economists are braced for a dire set of second-quarter figures, Howard Archer, at the EY Item Club, believes April's sharp contraction is likely to have been the low point. He predicted the economy would ""return to clear growth in the third quarter with GDP expanding close to 10% quarter-on-quarter"" as lockdown restrictions are eased further. In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Johnson promised an ""infrastructure revolution"", arguing the government needed to ""work fast"" to support jobs whilst also seeking to ""level up"" the economy so that all parts of the country can benefit. He said the government would introduce ""the most radical reforms of our planning system since the end of the Second World War"" to speed up building and infrastructure projects where, he argued, the UK compares unfavourably with other European countries. As part of what he called a ""new deal"", the prime minister set out plans to accelerate Â£5bn of spending on infrastructure projects. Meanwhile,separate ONS data on the nation's finances,externalshowed that Britain's current account deficit widened by more than expected in the first quarter. The balance of payments deficit - the difference between the value of the goods and services that a country imports and the goods and services it exports - rose to Â£21.1bn, or 3.8% of GDP. This means the UK is reliant on inflows of cash from abroad and leaves the pound vulnerable, according to Mr Tombs. ""Sterling almost certainly would depreciate sharply again if a major second wave of Covid-19 emerges or if the UK and EU fail to either sign a trade deal or to extend the transition period before the end of this year,"" he said.

City 'must stick together' during local lockdown,"Leicester will not join the rest of the UK in seeing restrictions eased on Saturday Police in Leicester were not issued a map of the area affected by the UK's first local lockdown until ""well after the announcement"", the county's police and crime commissioner has said. Lord Willy Bach said the information ""has now been issued"" but law enforcement had ""received minimal guidance"" on the tighter restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced the lockdown at 21:15 BST on Monday. Non-essential shops have shut and schools will be closed to most pupils. The tightening of restrictions in Leicesterwill last until at least 18 July and apply to the city centre and a number of suburbs. Mr Hancock said the measures would be enforced by police ""in some cases"". Lord Bach said: ""Amazingly we were not even provided with a map of the area until well after the announcement. ""That has now been issued, but, unfortunately, we received minimal guidance regarding practical implementation at the time the measures were imposed. ""I have a great deal of sympathy with the agencies charged with delivery. They needed clarity from the start, and I am astonished that it is being drip-fed as the day progresses."" Lord Willy Bach said law enforcement had ""received minimal guidance"" on the tighter restrictions Announcing measures for the lockdown, Mr Hancock said Leicester had ""10% of all positive cases in the country over the past week"". The Department of Health said as of 17:00 on Monday, 43,730 people had died in hospital of coronavirus in the UK, an increase of 155 on the day before. Leicester's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, has urged people in the city to ""stick together"" and stay at home. Sir Peter said he was glad the health secretary had introduced measures that went beyond just extending the current level of restrictions. ""What we got was more wide-ranging than we'd anticipated and I'm really grateful for that,"" he said. ""Because while it is a pain and a nuisance for us in the city to be subject to that level of restriction and to have the clock, as it were, turned back, it is nonetheless something that has some realistic prospect of being effective."" The loosening of restrictions in England which are due on Saturday, including the reopening of bars, restaurants and hair salons, will also not be taking place in the city. The relaxation of shielding measures on 6 July - which will allow the most clinically vulnerable to spend more time outside - has been cancelled in Leicester. The Bishop of Leicester said no weddings or funerals would take place in church buildings as a result of the local lockdown. Mr Hancock said advice on people not travelling in or out of Leicester was a ""recommendation for now"", but laws could be put in place to enforce the lockdown. He said the lockdown was ""profoundly in the interest of people in Leicester, and across the country that we get this virus under control"". However, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government had left people in the city ""anxious and confused"". This video can not be played Leicester city mayor urges residents to stay at home Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer echoed calls for a government press conference, saying the people of Leicester were ""crying out for answers to perfectly legitimate questions"". Downing Street said legislation already existed to allow the government to enforce the local lockdown but it needed to be signed off by the health secretary. A spokesman said there were no plans for a news conference, whilePrime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ""stay in close contact"",externalwith Leicester's mayor ""as we monitor the situation"". Is Leicester the first of many local lockdowns? Locked-out Leicester holidaymaker 'felt like leper' 'It's upsetting but better safe than sorry' Why has action taken so long in Leicester? Sir Peter also criticised the government and Public Health England for being too slow to share testing data with the city's officials. He said local leaders had tried to get figures from the government ""for weeks"". ""I wish they had taken a more speedy decision rather than leaving it 11 days from the secretary of state's first announcement,"" he said. ""That's a long gap, and a long time for the virus to spread."" Mr Hancock said Leicester's seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people - three times that of the next highest city. Bradford, Barnsley and Rochdale have all seen 45 or more cases per 100,000 people in the last week. Dave Stokes, chairman of Leicestershire Police Federation, called on the government to provide more detail on what the public can and cannot do during the lockdown. ""As we have seen over recent weeks and months, if the guidance and messaging from government is confusing for the public, then it will be almost impossible for our colleagues to police,"" he said. Nottinghamshire Police said officers could fine visitors from Leicester who they suspected had travelled to Nottingham for a ""night out"". The force said it would work with British Transport Police to ensure people were not coming to the city on trains from Leicester to shop or visit pubs. Teresa Lander is worried about ""a massive gap"" in her daughter's education Teresa Lander, 51, whose daughter goes to Launde Primary School in Oadby said the local lockdown was ""a surprise and a bit upsetting"" for parents and pupils. ""It's worrying how much school they are missing, it's a massive gap in their learning if they're not in from March to September,"" she said. ""They were having fun being back at school, it's disappointing for them, but you've got to respect it."" Read more reactionfrom local parents here. The local lockdown has also affected Leicester residents who had made holiday plans. Tracy Jebbett, 50, was due to travel to Pentewan Sands in Cornwall with her husband and daughter on 11 July. But the campsite the family had booked put up a Facebook post on Tuesday,saying they would not allow anyone from Leicester to visit the site. ""I feel like a Leicester leper,"" she said. ""I understand why, but I think they should've contacted the holiday goers from Leicester privately by email."" Tracy Jebbett, her daughter Jessica and husband Martin were due to go on holiday Businesses also said they had been left reeling by the abrupt nature of the announcement. Blake Edwards, owner of Flappers and Gentlemen salon, said he was ""devastated"" by the news as he was due to reopen on Saturday and had bookings for the next five weeks. ""Time is running out [for the business], we're going to need more support,"" he said. ""Even though the staff is being furloughed, rent still needs to be paid, all the other bills still need to be paid."" Blake Edwards said his salon was fully booked for the next five weeks The government has confirmed businesses that have been forced to shut their doors because of the local lockdown can re-furlough staff. Restaurant owner Shaf Islam said: ""I had a spring in my step getting ready for the reopening on the fourth of July. ""To say the news is a big disappointment is an understatement. We'd spent a lot of money and I'd called staff back from furlough."" Leicester City said it hoped its home games could go ahead despite the stricter lockdown.

Jean was born in 1937 Maryhill and spoke often and fondly of her childhood in ""the Butney"". This involved real hardships - including war-time evacuation to Holytown - though Jean's memories were all good and Maryhill became a touchstone when dementia became a factor in recent years. Working at Rolls-Royce Hillington, Jean was transferred to its Derby HQ where, as a young woman, she made small component parts for jet engines. Even in her 80s, Jean could still perform all the machinist actions (with sound effects). She loved to paint landscapes and had a life-long passion for music, especially jazz (with Frankie and Ella being constants). She was a great singer and dancer, always up for fun and laughs, brightening up any party. Her family said Jean was a fabulous mum to two daughters, a brilliant friend, and a warm-hearted women with kindness for everyone and anyone. She died on 27 October 2020. Rashelle Baird's family describe her as ""kind, bubbly, and always the life and soul of the party"". The 27-year-old mother-of-three from Brechin had put off appointments to get the vaccine because she was busy with her children. Her family stressed she was not anti-vaccine. ""She wanted to get her vaccine but she put her kids first,"" her father Stephen said. Rashelle, who had asthma, initially thought she had caught a cold from her children, but her symptoms worsened and she was admitted to hospital. She died in November 2021 after several days in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, having been placed in an induced coma in the intensive care unit. Family's vaccine plea after 27-year-old's Covid death David Trower worked as a clerical officer in the A&E department of University Hospital Monklands in Airdrie before retiring in 2016. But he was committed to the NHS and even in retirement he chose to continue to work shifts, through NHS Lanarkshire's staff bank, right up until February. He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. His colleagues thought highly of him, saying: ""We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him."" Bernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. She added: ""The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else."" Stephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. The couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from ""very different"" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. Stephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. Outside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. He died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45. Family of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangers Nan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. She was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. After losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. Following a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a ""living wake"" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. She lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she picked up Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. Graeme McGrath's greatest passions were rowing and the River Clyde. On the day of his funeral, fellow rowers held oars in a guard of honour at Glasgow Green in a tribute appreciated by his wife Anne and their three sons. For 40 years Graeme volunteered with the Glasgow Humane Society and was often called on to row rescue boats on the Clyde, or to help evacuate families during floods. After undergoing a kidney transplant in his 50s, he was unable to get out on the river as much. He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. But he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas.

She was a real homemaker who could as easily run up a set of curtains as make a batch of jam from fruit she had grown in her own garden. She never turned anyone away who needed help. A mild-mannered woman, she never had any need to raise her voice - a look over the top of her spectacles was enough to keep her children under control.

It was a shock when he tested positive for Covid-19 after being admitted to hospital with a chest infection. He died on 24 April after more than four weeks in ICU.

Despite his worsening condition, doctors initially told his wife, Sandra, she would not be able to visit the 72-year-old who had a heart condition and diabetes. Staff eventually granted access provided she wore protective equipment - a decision which meant she could be at her husband's side when he died on 29 March.

"Anger as China approves Hong Kong security lawThe UK, EU and Nato express grave concern for Hong Kong autonomy as China's president signs the law.","Opponents fear the law will curtail the right to protest The UK, EU and Nato have expressed concern and anger after China passed a controversial security law giving it new powers over Hong Kong. The law makes secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison. It took effect from 2300 local time (1500 GMT) on Tuesday. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security. One key pro-democracy group said it was now ceasing all operations. Demosistoannounced the move on Facebook,externalafter Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, said he was leaving the group, which he had spearheaded. Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit The law has come into effect just a day before the 23rd anniversary of the return of sovereignty to China - a day that usually draws large pro-democracy protests. This video can not be played Artist and activist Ai Weiwei: ""Today is the darkest day for Hong Kong"" China says the law is needed to tackle unrest and instability linked to a broadening pro-democracy movement. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The city of two masks faces a new crisis Opponents say it undermines the autonomy set out in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which was agreed when the territory's sovereignty was returned by the UK in 1997. Civil liberties such as free speech, the right to protest and an independent and robust judiciary are at risk, they say. There has been a mixture of concern for personal safety and defiance at the news. Demosisto said several members had asked to be delisted and it had decided to ""dissolve and stop all meetings"". It said that the fight against ""totalitarian oppression"" would have to continue in a ""more flexible manner"". Joshua Wong said the law marked ""the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before"".

UK Foreign SecretaryDominic Raab urged China to ""step back from the brink""and respect the rights of the people of Hong Kong. He said: ""The success of Hong Kong, the entrepreneurial spirit, the vibrancy, the economic success, has been built on its autonomy in 'one country, two systems'... That clearly is at threat."" What is the BNO and what does the UK move mean? The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said: ""It risks seriously undermining the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong and will have a detrimental impact on the judiciary and the rule of law and we deplore this decision."" Tear gas is fired to disperse a protest in Hong Kong in May The last UK governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, said the law marked the end of one-country, two-systems. Meanwhile, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""It is clear that China does not share our values - democracy, freedom, and the rule of law."" Japan called the law ""regrettable"" and Taiwan even warned its citizens of risks in visiting Hong Kong. The US has already begun taking steps to end Hong Kong's special status trade relationship, a move China on Tuesday said would be met with unspecified ""countermeasures"". Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent Hong Kong's sweeping new security law is a frighteningly open-ended tool to suppress political agitation. Like similar laws on the Chinese mainland it appears that it can be manipulated to meet the needs of the Communist Party as required to crush almost any action deemed threatening. Unlike elsewhere in China, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary. For this reason, the Party's leadership was not going to leave interpretation of this law in the hands of just any old judges. No. Those who'll be allowed to preside in these matters will be hand-picked by Carrie Lam, the city's leader who was effectively installed by Beijing. So, prior to the new security bill, which actions by activists - no matter how subversive - could not be dealt with under existing laws? What were ""extremists"" getting away with to warrant this new legislation? Bomb making? No. Smashing up buildings? No. Meeting with international NGOs to talk about the city's deteriorating freedoms? Ahhhh. Perhaps. Publicly advocating Hong Kong independence? Almost certainly. The more that Beijing, under Xi Jinping's leadership, has sought to control Hong Kong, the more it has driven residents into the pro-democracy camp. But he is playing a long game. Sure, handover promises to the UK were made but he was not going to let some Western attachment to liberty trump loyalty to the motherland. Not on his watch. Enter the security law. The law, announced by Beijing in May, will make criminal any act of secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign or external forces. State news agency Xinhua said the six-chapter law had 66 articles, clearly setting out the terms of the four offences. Beijing to set up new security office in Hong Kong A new office in Hong Kong will deal with national security cases, but will also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools.

Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, a move which has raised fears about judicial independence. Importantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes priority. In a video address to the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said crimes under the new law would be clearly defined. She said the law would only target a ""small minority"" and would not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We respect differences in opinion."" In recent years, Hong Kong has seen waves of protests demanding more rights. Last year, rallies over a now-scrapped bill permitting extraditions to the mainland turned violent and fuelled a broad pro-democracy movement. What is Hong Kong's national security law?

How life changed in a UK town,"""Never known anything like it in my lifetime."" That's a line we'll all have heard in the 100 days since Boris Johnson announced the coronavirus lockdown on 23 March. Normally it'd be something your nan might say. For Telford in Shropshire, it's true of an entire town. Throughout the last 100 days, Radio 1 Newsbeat has been in touch with people in Telford about how lockdown has changed them and their lives. There's the local footballer who has no idea what will happen to his career, the personal trainer who had to change her business overnight and the rapper who thought 2020 would be his best yet. Telford has only existed since the late 1960s - built then to offer new housing to people from much busier cities. After 50 years, it's still called ""a new town"". ""It's got a perfect blend of rural and urban,"" 18-year-old Molly Morgan tells us about her hometown. ""It's a great place to grow up."" ""I've grown up here, my family's here, my future's here,"" adds personal trainer Esther Williams. ""It's got a great community. When I was younger, I'd have gone to Birmingham or Wolverhampton for the day but now there's so much to do in Telford."" Telford was a far more ambitious project than other new towns of the era, like Stevenage and Crawley. The aim was for 225,000 people to live there by 1991. In 2020 there are around 155,000. The town is cut down the middle by the motorway linking Shropshire with the Black Country. Famous brands including Hitachi take sites on the industrial Stafford Park to the east, with the world famous Iron Bridge, arching over the River Severn, a couple of miles to the south. This was the first major bridge in the world made of cast iron when it opened in 1781 The idea for Telford was to bring smaller towns, like Dawley and Lawley, together into one community. ""It's got a magnificent situation overlooking Shropshireâ¦ I think it's got the makings of a very fine town indeed,"" were the words of Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, former City Architect of Birmingham, who helped with the plans. ""Once an attractive town is built there - industry will go,"" he said. In lockdown, Telford is a community facing some of its biggest challenges - and the people we've been talking to spoke about challenges that will feel very familiar. In many of the stories you hear, it's the mood of uncertainty which keeps coming up. Esther's personal training firm, Ruthless, takes up a small corrugated unit on the sprawling industrial estate of Hortonwood, where both Epson and Heinz have bases. She only started her business in 2018 and its whole model was transformed overnight on 23 March when the prime minister addressed the country and told us that all non-essential businesses, including gyms, must close. Esther's been paying full rent on the unit during lockdown and is still waiting for the government to say she can re-open. In the meantime, her focus is online sessions and small exercise classes in the park. ""The work I'm doing is great, and I'm so grateful for that, but it's not quite enough to be able to keep paying the rent there."" Like so many people, Esther's working life was transformed by coronavirus During that first week of lockdown, Esther told her clients on Facebook: ""We will be back. We will be stronger. We will be unstoppable."" Looking back now, she adds: ""I've never done online so I was quite nervous. I went to Zoom having never used Zoom before. ""For me, it was completely different. It was daunting to begin with but I'm so glad I did."" You can't help but notice Esther says ""so grateful"" and ""so glad"" a lot. She acknowledges others businesses have not had her flexibility. Esther's husband lost his job in sales but couldn't get furlough as he'd only been with his company a short time. ""He's just starting now to get interviews. The stress of trying to find a job - even a temporary job - they just go so quick. Things are getting better now. I'm just lucky I can work now and things are starting to move."" From Esther's unit to one of the town's focal points - the New Bucks Head, home to non-league AFC Telford United - is just a seven-minute drive. For the sixth tier of English football, it's impressive. A 6,000-capacity stadium would surely be one of the bigger days out in the National League North. Guiseley AFC and Curzon Ashton are typical visitors. AFC Telford United take on their famous neighbours Wolverhampton Wanderers in a friendly match AFC Telford United typically get a thousand people turning up to home games but there's been nobody through the turnstiles since Kettering Town on 14 March - and without any income from tickets, the club's faced desperate measures. On a Go Fund Me page seeking donations, a message reads: ""All of our income streams have dramatically reduced to virtually zero for several weeks now and it's almost certain as a business it will take some time to recover."" Midfielder Adam Walker says the months without football have been tough on the players too. They said goodbye to each other after a fairly regular match - minus the handshakes - expecting to see each other again later in the same week. ""And that never happened. So it's been a big gap in everyone's lives really."" Adam says coronavirus started to feel real when they were no longer allowed to shake hands with opposing players Adam has become something of an unofficial spokesman for the players. He says some are having to look at a career change. ""There's a very dark mist overhead still until this is resolved. There's massive uncertainty on how many clubs will be able to survive."" He points to the potential impact that could have on this community. ""A club like Telford have always had a very good side and a lovely stadium. You take that away from the community and there'd be a massive hole there."" Without the guarantees of gate receipts, the club's been helping its players find other work, such as coaching. Adam says there has been a massive hole in the life of Telford United's players ""The gaffer's tried to help players at the end of their career or maybe the younger ones who don't know yet whether they'll get paid for football and they might have young families. ""It's showing them how to be employable because a lot of people will be looking for jobs in this period. ""It's to try to help people have an income and still play football."" There has been football on the Bucks Head site for a century, but the area's not had the biggest live music scene recently. ""Telford has had a shortage of actual live music venues. One of the main ones closed down a few years ago,"" says Tim Rogers - a financial services worker by day, who takes off the suit and tie to become rapper Trademark Blud out of office hours. Trademark Blud was expecting to play at a few festivals this summer This year felt like a moment of change - with a new 300-capacity venue opening in the town's Southwater Square. It's easy to imagine Southwater Square without ever visiting. Cineworld, Nando's, TGi Fridays, all built in the last few years - all designed to give people in Telford a new option for a night out. Tim thought the new venue was going to be a big moment for the local live scene - with the prospect of international names coming to Telford. ""It's terrible. The most important thing is being able to deliver what you've produced to people and see their reactions and let them enjoy in the way you hope they will."" One of V Festival's two sites was a few miles from Telford until 2017, when the festival was discontinued. Here's Amy Winehouse performing there in 2008 He sounds undeniably flat talking about his music. He's been doing shows online but ""they're not the same"". ""It's not even 50% - especially with rap and hip-hop as it's super energetic."" To top it off, he had festival bookings for Boomtown and B-Side festival in 2020, which obviously won't be happening. Outside of music though Tim says he's feeling ""much more comfortable"" about the pandemic - his fears of picking it up have reduced and he's settled into working at home. Covid came closer than he'd like though - a child in his son's class lost his father after he contracted the virus. Molly's university plans have changed due to Covid-19 For 18-year-old Molly, the latest lockdown easing is a bit of good news - she's got her friend's 18th birthday the week whennew measurescome into effect, so they'll get a celebration. Beyond that, Molly's future will probably be closer to Telford than she'd been planning. She should have just finished her A-Levels. But of course she never actually sat them and has tweaked her uni choices because she didn't get to finish her open day tours. Now, she's looking at PPE (not that one, she jokes, after pulling her own face covering down) in Liverpool or Birmingham. This PPE is politics, philosophy and economics. ""I'd have been more open to going further away but without the chance to visit, I was apprehensive to go somewhere without seeing the city. I'd have been a bit more adventurous."" Molly says she's nervous about the prospect of her first year at university being mostly online learning. ""I don't want to stay in my room essentially for the whole yearâ¦ I'm not sure that's right for me. I've toyed with delaying for a year to get the proper uni experience."" Trademark Blud's sound might be a bit different in the coming months... Molly will know more when the results come in August, Adam's keeping the training going waiting for news on the new season. Esther hopes her unit will be open for classes after the next wave of government announcements. And rapper Trademark Blud? He's eyeing up a plan B. ""Some of my friends are acoustic guitarists and they might get back and start gigging again. It's maybe difficult for my genre - it's more of a live venue, nightclub, big stage kind of thing. ""I'm thinking of working with some guitarists and going to do the local pubs. I don't think they'll appreciate me jumping around and jumping off the tables at six o'clock. We'll have to tone it down I think."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

Is Leicester the first of many local lockdowns?,"Leicester has become the first part of the UKto experience a local lockdown. While the rest of the country is seeing restrictions easing, the city has gone into reverse. Shops are shutting and schools will follow suit on Thursday. How did this happen? And what does it tell us about how well the virus is under control in the UK? The first major public sign that there was a growing problem with coronavirus in Leicester was on Monday 8 June. In the east of the city, Humberstone Academy, which runs an infant and junior school, closed its doors with the head teacher explaining it was linked to positive tests for coronavirus. They briefly re-opened the following day, before being closed again. The schools have not reopened since. Over the next two weeks, over 900 confirmed cases were recorded - one in 16 of all the positive tests seen in the UK. So what has caused this? In short, the virus still being present and not enough social distancing. Some have pointed to the Black Lives Matter protest - Leicester saw hundreds of people take to the streets in early June. Clearly mass gatherings are not helpful in containing the spread of the virus, but many people wore masks, it was outside and some appeared to try to keep a little distance between themselves and others where possible. It is also worth pointing out there were plenty of these marches in other cities that have not seen a spike. Instead, health officials on the ground believe there are likely to have been many factors which contributed to the spread in Leicester. The east of the city appears to be the epicentre of this local outbreak - although cases are now being seen in other parts of the city. The area includes streets with tightly packed terraced housing, and has a high proportion of ethnic minority families where multi-generational living is more common. Indeed, Leicester as a whole is one of the most culturally diverse areas in the country, with about half of its residents from ethnic minority groups. Latest updates: Leicester reacts to tightened lockdown measures  What are Leicester's new lockdown restrictions? Leicester local lockdown shows virus risk not gone Density of population is bound to be factor, but other issues are at play too. There seems to be signs of transmission in workplaces, suggesting social distancing guidelines are not been adhered to as well as they should, and also transient workers passing through. In short, there is nothing necessarily unique to Leicester that could be pointed to a single stand-out cause as restrictions have eased. But it is certainly on quite different scale to other local flare-ups that have happened so far. One in Weston-super-Mare was largely contained to the hospital, while another in Cleckheaton, which was linked to a meat-packing factory, does not seem to have spread across the community. This is a key question - and one that is already being asked. Even at this early stage, it is clear to see the signs have been there for a few weeks at least. Over the weekend the city's Mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, was saying the authorities there had only received limited data from the government and national testing system. This goes to the heart of what many fear is a weakness in the system in England - the way the national test and trace system connects up with local teams. The system, which got up and running at the end of May, relies on a national team of 25,000 call handlers to triage cases that test positive. Complex cases involving schools, care homes and prisons, for example, are automatically transferred down to local public health teams, involving councils and Public Health England. But individuals are dealt with by the national team. They ask for information from them about their close contacts and ask them to isolate. Health Secretary Matt Hancock first mentioned an ""outbreak"" in Leicester on 18 June Comprehensive information about these cases has not passed down to councils - or at least not in the detail they would like. It's like ""having one arm held behind your back in a fight"" was how one director of public health described it to me, adding: ""You are up against it from the start."" Essentially it means they cannot monitor all local cases to see what patterns are emerging. That now is beginning to change - a data-sharing agreement has been signed with councils and Public Health England has set up a system to share information. Another weakness of the system appears to be a lack of translation services. Baroness Dido Harding, the head of test and trace, has said this is being invested in. But it is noticeable that the government has said the city and county councils will be given funding to invest in communication in different languages, suggesting the lack of translation support may have had an effect on the way the local population has engaged with requests to isolate and social distance. The prospect of local lockdowns has always been on the cards. While the number of infections being reported has been falling even as restrictions have been easing over the past six weeks or so, there is still a fairly significant amount of the virus in circulation. About 1,000 positive tests a day are being reported across the UK, although the true number is bound to be higher, as the government's surveillance programme - run by the Office for National Statistics - is suggesting there are many more cases in circulation. One of the biggest problems with this virus - and why it has wreaked such havoc - is that it is very infectious, and can be spread before symptoms develop or by people who do not know they have it because they are not showing symptoms. These silent spreaders mean it is difficult to contain the virus - unlike say Sars, another coronavirus which circulated in 2002-03. People were only infectious when they were displaying symptoms, so once they were isolated the virus could be stopped in its tracks. It means it is very difficult for countries with such large populations spread across a number of densely packed cities to eliminate the virus as, say, New Zealand has. That's not to say the UK has not made mistakes - you just need to compare the high level of cases and deaths we have seen compared with Germany to see that. But even Germany has introduced local lockdowns - and experts such as Dr Bharat Pankhania, a former consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England, are already predicting other cities will follow suit in the coming months. Unfortunately these are, it seems, going to become a way of life from now on. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick What are ventilators and how do they work?

Lockdown tightened in Leicester over Covid surgeFirst local lockdown will see non-essential shops shut and schools close for most pupils in the city.Leicester,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says a number of under 18s have tested positive for coronavirus The UK's first full local lockdown has been announced in Leicester, with stricter measures imposed in the city. Non-essential shops have shut, and schools will close for most pupils on Thursday because of a rise in coronavirus cases. The loosening of restrictions for pubs and restaurants in England on Saturday will also not be taking place there. The health secretary said measures would be enforced by police ""in some cases"". Matt Hancock said the city had ""10% of all positive cases in the country over the past week"". It comes after the city council reported 944 positive tests in the two weeks to 23 June - about one in 16 of the total UK cases during that period. The health secretary told the House of Commons on Monday evening: ""We recommend to people in Leicester, stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester."" He said the new local measures would be in place for at least two weeks, but kept under constant review. Latest updates: Leicester reacts to tightened lockdown measures How will local lockdown rules be enforced?,external What are Leicester's new lockdown restrictions? Leicester local lockdown shows virus risk not gone Mr Hancock said Leicester's seven-day infection rate of 135 cases per 100,000 people was ""three times higher than the next highest city"" and admissions to hospitals were between six and 10 per day - compared to about one a day at other trusts. He said ""targeted action"" at factories, workplaces and schools over the past 10 days had not worked, meaning stronger measures were needed. ""We've been taking this highly localised approach but unfortunately that targeted action wasn't working in Leicester and that's why we have taken this much broader measure,"" he said. The relaxation of shielding measures on 6 July - which will allow the most clinically vulnerable to spend more time outside - will also not take place in the city. Mr Hancock said schools were being closed to help slow the transmission of the disease and parents in other areas should not have any fear about continuing to send their children to school. The health secretary told BBC Breakfast there had been ""an unusually high incidence"" of coronavirus among children in Leicester since increased testing began in the city 10 days ago. Closing schools on Thursday rather than immediately was ""for practical reasons"" such as parents needing to find childcare, he added. Five schools have closed since the beginning of June due to the number of Covid-19 cases and the wider closures will affect most pupils, but children of ""critical workers"" and those classed as vulnerable will still be able to attend. This video can not be played Speaking before the official announcement, Leicester residents already had mixed feelings about stricter lockdown measures Leicester City Council said the latest figures obtained by the authority showed that 3,216 Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in the city since the start of the epidemic. ""Of these, 944 cases were reported in the last two weeks,"" a spokesman said. ""These figures include the number of patients and staff testing as positive in hospitals and positive cases identified in testing centres."" Mayor of Leicester Sir Peter Soulsby said the measures imposed by the government were ""stricter than we anticipated but we understand the need for firm action"". He questioned whether a local lockdown should have been imposed earlier, adding: ""If as seems to be the case, the figures suggest there are issues in the city, I wish [the government] had taken a more speedy decision. ""[The government] are clearly determined to start with the maximum, as it were, to see how it works and then perhaps to use the learning from this in other areas I have no doubt will follow."" Leicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton said ""protecting residents is our main concern"" and added it ""makes sense to step up restrictions in areas closer to the city"". Suburbs such as Oadby, Birstall, Thurmaston and Glenfield are also subject to the stricter measures. The county council said it planned to create a postcode tool to allow people to check if they were inside the lockdown boundary. Magda Raszowska, whose five-year-old daughter Iman goes to Launde Primary School in Oadby, said the news was ""frustrating"". ""It's like we're going back to March, that was the shocking thing,"" she said. ""Closing schools, closing shops again. It's scary, it just shows how a second wave can be not far off. ""Obviously safety comes first, I understand that, we all do. [But] it seems very strict. As the mayor said, has Leicester been singled out now they're getting more cautious?"" Magda Raszowska said the news suggested a second wave was imminent Blake Edwards said his salon was fully booked for the next five weeks Blake Edwards, owner of Flappers and Gentlemen salon, said he was ""devastated"" by the news. The hairdresser was ready to reopen on Saturday but will now remain closed ""with no new date in sight"". ""It's going to be really tough for the clients too,"" he said. ""Time is running out [for the business now], we're going to need more support. ""Even though the staff is being furloughed, rent still needs to be paid, all the other bills still need to be paid. ""We don't know what the next 12 months are going to be like."" The city and county councils will be given extra funding to improve communication about coronavirus Leicester's Highcross shopping centre tweeted on Monday evening that ""only essential retail stores"", alongside ""restaurants and cafes offering takeaway or delivery"" services, would open on Tuesday. Rakesh Parmar, who owns Ye Olde Sweet Shoppe in the city centre, said the further restrictions would affect him ""financially very, very badly"". ""The impact of coronavirus hit us on 23 March, we closed for 10 weeks, and then opened again on 15 June - it's been one long slog,"" he said. Mr Parmar said he ""completely"" understood why a further lockdown would be needed, but said his customers were ""very, very scared because it's closer to home than we realised"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock says the extended lockdown measures are ""profoundly in the national interest"" Mr Hancock said the government had also ""agreed further measures"" to tackle the outbreak in Leicester: A walk-in test centre will be opened in the city, alongside mobile testing units The city and county councils will be given ""extra funding"" to enhance communications to the population on Covid-19 in all relevant languages Councils will ensure ""support is available to those who have to self-isolate"" Workplaces that have seen ""clusters of cases"" will be helped to implement stringent Covid-19 guidance He said the government was ""still getting to the bottom of"" the potential reasons why the outbreak had occurred. If there is one thing that has become clear during the pandemic, it is that the quicker action is taken the better. Given the scale of the outbreak in Leicester that has emerged, it therefore comes as no surprise that the government is taking tough action. But the question that is being asked behind the scenes is whether it took too long to spot the scale of the outbreak. One of the concerns about the test and trace system is how quickly data gets passed from the national team to local officials. The national team passes on plenty of cases - any complex cases involving care homes, schools and prisons are automatically transferred. But what local authorities are not getting quickly are comprehensive details about individuals who test positive. It means opportunities to spot trends and clusters early may be being lost. It is now clear cases in the city have been growing for a few weeks. That at least raises the concern that the outbreak has been acted on later than it should. If that is the case, it is important lessons are learned because it is highly likely there will be more flare-ups like this in the coming weeks and months. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's handling of the outbreak in Leicester had left local people ""anxious and confused"". The Leicester South MP said it was unclear what constituted ""essential"" travel and whether affected businesses would receive any financial support. Leicester West MP Liz Kendall criticised the government for being ""too slow"" to liaise with the city council, and added: ""Over [the] last few days there have been off the record briefings leaving people anxious and confused.""

""Where you have a background level of circulating virus plus a susceptible population - one that has never had this infection before - they're all sitting targets,"" he said.

Serial rapist freed by 'unstable' probation team,"Joseph McCann was found guilty of 37 offences against 11 victims A serial rapist was able to carry out a sex attack spree when he was freed from prison after ""major failings"" by a team of ""unstable"" and inexperienced probation staff, inspectors have found. Joseph McCann was given33 life sentencesin December for attacks on 11 women and children. So far only one person has since been demoted, the report said. One of McCann's victims called the probation service's actions ""shambolic and chaotic"". The 34-year-old convicted burglar had been freed after a probation service error at the start of 2019. The independent review headed up by Chief Inspector of Probation Justin Russell said this happened despite there being signs he posed a risk to the public and could commit sexual offences. McCann saw 10 staff over 11 years, with three different probation officers responsible for his case in the months leading up to his prison release. Two months after he left prison, over the course of 15 days last spring, he abducted, raped and assaulted victims aged between 11 and 71 in Watford, London, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire. He had been seen by probation officers 10 times in those two months, the final time in April just days before he carried out the first rape. This video can not be played Footage shows dramatic Joseph McCann police chase A jury found McCann guilty of 37 charges relating to 11 victims, including eight rapes, false imprisonment and kidnap. An internal review published by the Ministry of Justice in March laid bare the errors made in the case, including repeated failures to recall him to prison despite officials warning of the risks he posed. In the first of two reports from his review, Mr Russell said: ""McCann was managed by an unstable team, lacking experienced and skilled practitioners. ""They suffered from poor management oversight, high workloads, poor performance and high staff turnover. ""There were signs that he posed an increasing risk to the public. There was evidence of his potential for sexual offending."" This video can not be played Elderly victim of serial rapist Joseph McCann tells of her ordeal Crucial information, recorded on different systems by various authorities, was ""lost"" in handovers between staff, Mr Russell added. But ""most worryingly"", the report said, prison staff did not share information about the risk posed by McCann with probation, meaning probation staff did ""not have a clear picture"" of who they were dealing with and were making decisions based on inadequate assessments. The report found McCann had, in his initial time in jail, been regarded as posing a ""high risk of serious harm to family members"", having sent letters including threats of sexual violence to relatives. He had also sent a threatening letter containing a sexual reference to his probation service offender manager, causing his case to be handed to another worker. But decisions on whether to release McCann were ""too focused"" on whether he would carry out more burglaries, the report said, despite warnings as early as 2011 that he had the hallmarks of a sex offender, and were ""not based on an analysis of his patterns of behaviour"". McCann was filmed on CCTV at a Watford hotel where he had booked a room for two nights Another ""key element"" of planning for such a high risk offender to leave prison was making sure he had suitable accommodation. He should have been given a bed in a bail hostel, known as approved premises, where he could be monitored by probation after being freed. But after probation officers twice ""tried, and failed"" to get him a space he was instead allowed to live with family where he could not be monitored closely, Mr Russell said. Among 13 recommendations made to the Prison and Probation Service and the National Probation Service, Mr Russell called for more beds at approved premises. This report has echoes of the mistakes made with ""black cab rapist"" John Worboys, who was cleared for release from prison after a parole panel failed properly to assess his long history of sexual offending. In Joseph McCann's case, probation officers and other specialists didn't fully analyse his record in jail (at one stage he'd made a ""serious"" attempt to escape) nor did they spot that his ""core attitudes"" hadn't changed even though he'd completed offending behaviour programmes - the description ""manipulative"" appears in the report five times. The decision that McCann could be freed - made in 2017, the same year Worboys was recommended for release - came amid huge political pressure to monitor indeterminate sentence prisoners in the community rather than in custody. The report says the influence of this strategy was ""evident"" in the failure to send McCann back to jail. Worboys' release was eventually blocked by the High Court. McCann, however, was not stopped until it was far too late. This is a report that cannot be allowed to gather dust. Alan Collins, one of the lawyers representing McCann's victims, said the report made ""distressing reading"" and called for dangerous offenders to be ""red flagged"" across the justice system to make sure such failings never happened again. One of the victims said in a statement: ""The words shambolic and chaotic spring to mind to describe the practices of the Probation Service. ""It is obvious that McCann should have been in prison and not at liberty to commit the horrendous crimes that have changed forever the lives of eleven victims and their families."" Former victims commissioner Baroness Newlove described the report as ""laughable"", saying the system needed ""overhauling and investing in"". ""For these victims, I just feel so sorry for them because the system, the government, the funding, has completely let the public down,"" she said. Girl raped by serial sex attacker 'feels failed' The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison 'I watched as net closed in on serial rapist' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""These were horrendous crimes and we have apologised to the victims for the unacceptable failings in this case. ""We have greatly improved information sharing between prisons and probation officers and all probation staff have received new, mandatory training on when offenders should be recalled."" The second part of the review is due to be published in the autumn.

Lockdown tightened in Leicester over Covid surge,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says a number of under 18s have tested positive for coronavirus The UK's first full local lockdown has been announced in Leicester, with stricter measures imposed in the city. Non-essential shops have shut, and schools will close for most pupils on Thursday because of a rise in coronavirus cases. The loosening of restrictions for pubs and restaurants in England on Saturday will also not be taking place there. The health secretary said measures would be enforced by police ""in some cases"". Matt Hancock said the city had ""10% of all positive cases in the country over the past week"". It comes after the city council reported 944 positive tests in the two weeks to 23 June - about one in 16 of the total UK cases during that period. The health secretary told the House of Commons on Monday evening: ""We recommend to people in Leicester, stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester."" He said the new local measures would be in place for at least two weeks, but kept under constant review. Latest updates: Leicester reacts to tightened lockdown measures How will local lockdown rules be enforced?,external What are Leicester's new lockdown restrictions? Leicester local lockdown shows virus risk not gone Mr Hancock said Leicester's seven-day infection rate of 135 cases per 100,000 people was ""three times higher than the next highest city"" and admissions to hospitals were between six and 10 per day - compared to about one a day at other trusts. He said ""targeted action"" at factories, workplaces and schools over the past 10 days had not worked, meaning stronger measures were needed. ""We've been taking this highly localised approach but unfortunately that targeted action wasn't working in Leicester and that's why we have taken this much broader measure,"" he said. The relaxation of shielding measures on 6 July - which will allow the most clinically vulnerable to spend more time outside - will also not take place in the city. Mr Hancock said schools were being closed to help slow the transmission of the disease and parents in other areas should not have any fear about continuing to send their children to school. The health secretary told BBC Breakfast there had been ""an unusually high incidence"" of coronavirus among children in Leicester since increased testing began in the city 10 days ago. Closing schools on Thursday rather than immediately was ""for practical reasons"" such as parents needing to find childcare, he added. Five schools have closed since the beginning of June due to the number of Covid-19 cases and the wider closures will affect most pupils, but children of ""critical workers"" and those classed as vulnerable will still be able to attend. This video can not be played Speaking before the official announcement, Leicester residents already had mixed feelings about stricter lockdown measures Leicester City Council said the latest figures obtained by the authority showed that 3,216 Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in the city since the start of the epidemic. ""Of these, 944 cases were reported in the last two weeks,"" a spokesman said. ""These figures include the number of patients and staff testing as positive in hospitals and positive cases identified in testing centres."" Mayor of Leicester Sir Peter Soulsby said the measures imposed by the government were ""stricter than we anticipated but we understand the need for firm action"". He questioned whether a local lockdown should have been imposed earlier, adding: ""If as seems to be the case, the figures suggest there are issues in the city, I wish [the government] had taken a more speedy decision. ""[The government] are clearly determined to start with the maximum, as it were, to see how it works and then perhaps to use the learning from this in other areas I have no doubt will follow."" Leicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton said ""protecting residents is our main concern"" and added it ""makes sense to step up restrictions in areas closer to the city"". Suburbs such as Oadby, Birstall, Thurmaston and Glenfield are also subject to the stricter measures. The county council said it planned to create a postcode tool to allow people to check if they were inside the lockdown boundary. Magda Raszowska, whose five-year-old daughter Iman goes to Launde Primary School in Oadby, said the news was ""frustrating"". ""It's like we're going back to March, that was the shocking thing,"" she said. ""Closing schools, closing shops again. It's scary, it just shows how a second wave can be not far off. ""Obviously safety comes first, I understand that, we all do. [But] it seems very strict. As the mayor said, has Leicester been singled out now they're getting more cautious?"" Magda Raszowska said the news suggested a second wave was imminent Blake Edwards said his salon was fully booked for the next five weeks Blake Edwards, owner of Flappers and Gentlemen salon, said he was ""devastated"" by the news. The hairdresser was ready to reopen on Saturday but will now remain closed ""with no new date in sight"". ""It's going to be really tough for the clients too,"" he said. ""Time is running out [for the business now], we're going to need more support. ""Even though the staff is being furloughed, rent still needs to be paid, all the other bills still need to be paid. ""We don't know what the next 12 months are going to be like."" The city and county councils will be given extra funding to improve communication about coronavirus Leicester's Highcross shopping centre tweeted on Monday evening that ""only essential retail stores"", alongside ""restaurants and cafes offering takeaway or delivery"" services, would open on Tuesday. Rakesh Parmar, who owns Ye Olde Sweet Shoppe in the city centre, said the further restrictions would affect him ""financially very, very badly"". ""The impact of coronavirus hit us on 23 March, we closed for 10 weeks, and then opened again on 15 June - it's been one long slog,"" he said. Mr Parmar said he ""completely"" understood why a further lockdown would be needed, but said his customers were ""very, very scared because it's closer to home than we realised"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock says the extended lockdown measures are ""profoundly in the national interest"" Mr Hancock said the government had also ""agreed further measures"" to tackle the outbreak in Leicester: A walk-in test centre will be opened in the city, alongside mobile testing units The city and county councils will be given ""extra funding"" to enhance communications to the population on Covid-19 in all relevant languages Councils will ensure ""support is available to those who have to self-isolate"" Workplaces that have seen ""clusters of cases"" will be helped to implement stringent Covid-19 guidance He said the government was ""still getting to the bottom of"" the potential reasons why the outbreak had occurred. If there is one thing that has become clear during the pandemic, it is that the quicker action is taken the better. Given the scale of the outbreak in Leicester that has emerged, it therefore comes as no surprise that the government is taking tough action. But the question that is being asked behind the scenes is whether it took too long to spot the scale of the outbreak. One of the concerns about the test and trace system is how quickly data gets passed from the national team to local officials. The national team passes on plenty of cases - any complex cases involving care homes, schools and prisons are automatically transferred. But what local authorities are not getting quickly are comprehensive details about individuals who test positive. It means opportunities to spot trends and clusters early may be being lost. It is now clear cases in the city have been growing for a few weeks. That at least raises the concern that the outbreak has been acted on later than it should. If that is the case, it is important lessons are learned because it is highly likely there will be more flare-ups like this in the coming weeks and months. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's handling of the outbreak in Leicester had left local people ""anxious and confused"". The Leicester South MP said it was unclear what constituted ""essential"" travel and whether affected businesses would receive any financial support. Leicester West MP Liz Kendall criticised the government for being ""too slow"" to liaise with the city council, and added: ""Over [the] last few days there have been off the record briefings leaving people anxious and confused.""

""Where you have a background level of circulating virus plus a susceptible population - one that has never had this infection before - they're all sitting targets,"" he said. ""It is well overdue that we have local control for local outbreaks because going forward six or nine months we will have such outbreaks in Manchester, Birmingham, other big cities, so it's better to grease up and oil the machinery of local responsiveness.""

UK economy hit by worse contraction in 41 years,"The UK economy shrank more than first thought between January and March, contracting 2.2% in the joint largest fall since 1979, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalrevised down its previous estimate of a 2% contraction, with all the main economic sectors dropping. There was a significant economic impact in March, as the coronavirus pandemic began to have an effect. The data comes as the prime minister set out a post-lockdown recovery plan. Boris Johnson said in a speech in Dudley, in the West Midlands, that there would be investment in infrastructure and schools. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""Our more detailed picture of the economy in the first quarter showed GDP shrank a little more than first estimated. ""Information from government showed health activities declined more than we previously showed. ""All main sectors of the economy shrank significantly in March as the effects of the pandemic hit."" The first-quarter contraction is now the joint biggest drop since the July-to-September period in 1979. What is GDP and why does it matter? PM pledges to 'build back better' post-virus Mr Athow said: ""The sharp fall in consumer spending at the end of March led to a notable increase in households' savings."" The new data showed that GDP contracted by 6.9% in March. The first-quarter figures show that the services sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of UK GDP - shrank by a record 2.3%. The ONS said production output fell by a revised 1.5% in the three months, driven by declines in manufacturing as factories temporarily shut down, while there was a fall in construction output of 1.7%. The coronavirus lockdown only came into force on 23 March, so figures for the second quarter of the year will show the full hit on the economy. Recent ONS monthly figuresshowed the economy plummeted by 20.4% in April- the largest drop in a single month since records began. That contraction was three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. It says something that the first quarter of the year was the worst for the economy in 41 years - and yet it was still barely a tenth the size of the contraction in activity in just one month - last April. The figures put the government's ""build build build"" announcement in perspective. The Â£5bn infrastructure spending being ""brought forward"" is not new money in any case. It was set aside in the pre-election manifesto at a time when the economy looked very different. Compare it, say, to the Â£69bn it's estimated that small businesses will lose in the pandemic because they've had to stop trading (according to research by small business insurers Simply Business). Or compare it to total public spending of more than Â£1,000bn, and it's less than 0.5%. Against the size of the economy based on the latest GDP numbers, the mooted infrastructure spend is more like 0.25%. The government's going to have to spend a lot more than that to stimulate a recovery from a slump on this scale. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest figures could be summed up in one line: ""The biggest contraction for 40 years, even though Q1 contained just nine lockdown days."" The data ""was just the prelude"", with worse to come, he added. However, while economists are braced for a dire set of second-quarter figures, Howard Archer, at the EY Item Club, believes April's sharp contraction is likely to have been the low point. He predicted the economy would ""return to clear growth in the third quarter with GDP expanding close to 10% quarter-on-quarter"" as lockdown restrictions are eased further. In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Johnson promised an ""infrastructure revolution"", arguing the government needed to ""work fast"" to support jobs whilst also seeking to ""level up"" the economy so that all parts of the country can benefit. He said the government would introduce ""the most radical reforms of our planning system since the end of the Second World War"" to speed up building and infrastructure projects where, he argued, the UK compares unfavourably with other European countries. As part of what he called a ""new deal"", the prime minister set out plans to accelerate Â£5bn of spending on infrastructure projects. Meanwhile,separate ONS data on the nation's finances,externalshowed that Britain's current account deficit widened by more than expected in the first quarter. The balance of payments deficit - the difference between the value of the goods and services that a country imports and the goods and services it exports - rose to Â£21.1bn, or 3.8% of GDP. This means the UK is reliant on inflows of cash from abroad and leaves the pound vulnerable, according to Mr Tombs. ""Sterling almost certainly would depreciate sharply again if a major second wave of Covid-19 emerges or if the UK and EU fail to either sign a trade deal or to extend the transition period before the end of this year,"" he said.

"This is the moment to be ambitious â PMBoris Johnson sets out a 'new deal' with the economic impact of coronavirus and ""build back better"".UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain must ""build, build, build"" to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis Boris Johnson has said now is the time to be ""ambitious"" about the UK's future, as he set out a post-coronavirus recovery plan. The PM vowed to ""use this moment"" to fix longstanding economic problems and promised a Â£5bn ""new deal"" to build homes and infrastructure. Plans set out in the Tory election manifesto would be speeded up and ""intensified,"" he added. Labour and the CBI said he was not focusing enough on saving jobs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""not much of a deal and not much that's new"". The BBC's economic editor, Faisal Islam, said there was ""nothing really new"" in the plans, but was a pledge from the Treasury to ""speed up capital investment that has already been announced and tolerate higher levels of debt"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak later confirmed he would deliver an economic update on 8 July ""setting out the next stage in our plan to secure the recovery"". The PM's speech came asnew figures showed the UK economyshrank faster than at any time since 1979 between January and March. Boris Johnson's economy speech fact-checked What a shrinking economy means in one town Where do governments go when they need money? In a wide-ranging speech in Dudley, in the West Midlands, Mr Johnson vowed to ""build, build, build"" to soften the ""economic aftershock"" of coronavirus. He said the government wanted to continue with its plans to ""level up"" - one of its main slogans of last December's election - as ""too many parts"" of the country had been ""left behind, neglected, unloved"". Infrastructure projects in England would be ""accelerated"" and there would be investment in new academy schools, green buses and new broadband, the PM added. Projects in the Â£5bn investment plan include: Â£1.5bn for hospital maintenance and building, eradicating mental health dormitories and improving A&E capacity - the government said this is ""new"" money in addition to Â£1.1bn in its Spring Budget Â£100m for 29 road projects including bridge repairs in Sandwell and improving the A15 in the Humber region - this money had already been announced Over Â£1bn for new school buildings, as announced on Monday - this cash comes from the government's existing infrastructure plan Â£12bn to help build 180,000 new affordable homes for ownership and rent over the next eight years - brings together three pots of money already announced by previous Tory governments and Mr Johnson's administration Other projects announced in the government's Spring Budget, which will now be accelerated, include: Â£83m for maintenance of prisons and youth offender facilities, and Â£60m for temporary prison places. Â£900m for ""shovel ready"" local projects in England this year and in 2021 Â£500,000 - Â£1m for each area in the towns fund to spend on improvements to parks, high street and transport Mr Johnson acknowledged jobs might be lost because of the economic hit from the pandemic, but said a new ""opportunity guarantee"" would ensure every young person had the chance of an apprenticeship or placement. Asked whether the plans went far enough for those who end up unemployed, the PM said the strategy was for ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" and there would not be a return to austerity. But he could not put a figure on how many roles would be created through his plan, adding: ""We don't yet know what the full economic impact is going to be... [but] we will do everything we can to get this economy moving."" The prime minister loves a big, historical comparison. He is a keen student of Winston Churchill - and has even written a book about him. Over the last few days, the comparisons the government has sought to draw have been with former American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his ""New Deal."" Asmy colleagues at Reality Check point out, the plan set out today is a tiddler compared to what FDR did, and a fair chunk of it is re-announcing what we already knew the government was planning. But Boris Johnson is attempting to set out in a broader context the government's vision - and his pride in saying he wants to spend a lot to revitalise the economy and haul it out of the doldrums. Under what Mr Johnson dubbed ""project speed,"" planning laws would also be streamlined to encourage building. Changes, planned for September, include: Allowing many commercial buildings to change to residential use without planning application Cutting the normal planning process for builders who want to demolish and rebuild vacant residential and commercial buildings as homes Allowing homeowners to build above their properties ""via a fast track approval process"" and subject to neighbour consultation Pubs, libraries, village shops will be protected from the changes as they were ""essential to the lifeblood of communities,"" the government said. Mr Johnson acknowledged the planning changes might meet resistance in traditional Tory-voting areas, but said: ""Sometimes you have got to get on with things."" The government believes their existing plans for boosting infrastructure spending are already a significant fillip to the economy, and they want to see what happens as it re-opens. One set of figures released today shows household savings increased during lockdown, but will people have the confidence to spend? The scale of government support for businesses and employees in recent months probably does justify New Deal-style rhetoric. Extending support at that level may yet be required, and is far from ruled out. But for now, they are holding fire as they assess the permanent scars to the UK economy. Mr Johnson also attempted to calm Tory fears that he had shifted to the left, saying: ""I am not a communist"". Instead, he claimed he had been inspired by US president Franklin D Roosevelt, who led America out of the Great Depression with his New Deal in the 1930s. In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, President Roosevelt launched one of the largest, most expensive US government programmes which included building schools, hospitals and dams. Youth Worker Lisa Williams is worried young people will be hit hard In the former ""red wall"" seat of Rother Valley - which the Conservatives won from Labour for the first time at last year's general election - there has been a mixed reaction to the announcement from employees and business owners. David Shaw, operations manager for a manufacturing company, said the investment announcement was ""positive"" and praised the government's furlough scheme during the crisis for saving businesses. But Lisa Williams, manager of a youth and community centre in Dinnington, said of the promised investment that ""we've yet to see that happen"". ""Year-on-year, successive governments have made promises, and these areas have yet to see that,"" she said, adding she was concerned about the economic impact on young people. And Jayne Maxwell, a shop owner in Maltby, said she was sceptical about how much investment would go into high streets, saying more short-term help was needed. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""We're facing an economic crisis, the biggest we've seen in a generation and the recovery needs to match that. What's been announced amounts to less than Â£100 per person. ""And it's the re-announcement of many manifesto pledges and commitments, so it's not enough."" Sir Keir Starmer says more focus is needed on jobs The Labour leader added: ""We're not going to argue against a recovery plan, but the focus has to be on jobs."" CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said the prime minister had set out the ""first steps on the path to recovery"" but added that ""the focus on rescuing viable firms cannot slip"".

Covid nearly killed Mal but now he is going homeMal Martin's family were told there was almost zero chance of survival after he contracted Covid-19.Wales,"This video can not be played ""It was so hopeless and now he's coming home"" In April 2020, Sue Martin told the BBC how her husband Mal had contracted Covid-19 and his chances of survival were almost zero. Nearly three months on Sue, 49, a civil servant from south Wales, tells Ceri Jackson what has happened since and the impact of an unexpected public reaction to her family's heartache. I bumped into two friends in the supermarket yesterday. They asked me the same question I've been asked literally thousands and thousands of times over the past few months: ""How's Mal doing?"" It was exactly three months to the day that my husband was taken to hospital by ambulance from our family home gravely ill with Covid-19; three months since our two children and I video messaged him to tell him we loved him before he was put in an induced coma and placed on a ventilator; just under three months since doctors told me Mal's chances of survival were virtually zero. One friend said tearfully: ""I can't quite believe you're telling me this"" but the answer I'd given her was true. Against all odds maybe - Mal is possibly coming home this week. This video can not be played Sue Martin spoke to the BBC about Mal in April When I gave an interview to the BBC shortly after Mal was hospitalisedI didn't think too much of it. We were consumed with the pain of what had happened and what was to come and, in the early stages of lockdown, trying to get through each day without physical contact with our family and friends. The public reaction to the interview was as unexpected as it was incredible. I was sent thousands upon thousands of messages and letters of love and support from people I'd never met, people from all over the world who'd been moved by Mal's story. And those messages haven't stopped. So, for all those who've been asking, I'm finally in a position to give a meaningful update. Mal's two children Wiliam and Hana said their goodbyes to him when he was critically ill At the time I gave the interview, the children and I had been allowed to visit Mal's bedside for a few minutes. Covered from head to toe in PPE we said our goodbyes to him. We'd been told he would likely die the following day. When the dreaded call from the consultant came the next day, he told us there had been a tiny improvement which meant a drug supporting Mal's blood pressure could be reduced; not enough to raise too much hope but a glimmer nonetheless. For the next few weeks it was touch and go. Medics worked at simply keeping Mal alive, giving his body a chance of fighting the virus. 'My husband's chances are almost zero they told me' Dad 'still with us' despite slim survival hope For six weeks we existed in a sickening limbo and nightmarish rollercoaster ride. Mal remained critical with a much greater chance of him dying than pulling through. Eventually Mal tested negative for covid but his body had been ravaged by the virus and profoundly weak. The roller-coaster ride continued. Very slowly, painfully slowly, doctors began trying to wean Mal off the ventilator. He'd already had a tracheotomy in preparation for bringing him out of sedation but with acute kidney failure he had been on a kidney filter from the start. Unable to expel strong sedatives from his system he seemed to take forever to wake up with additional complications like recurrent infections   along the way. When Mal eventually woke up he was so weak he could only respond by blinking. The very first time we FaceTimed him was horrific. He was lying there, lifeless. His eyes were open but he wasn't really seeing. Had all this taken its toll on his brain? Neurological damage had always been a possibility and still he was only given maybe a 10 to 20% chance he'll pull through. Mal with his daughter Hana, who is an influencer on TikTok with 1.5m followers I remember being in tears on one phone call to him (obviously a one way conversation) when a nurse said Mal had mouthed the word 'bye' to us. It was at that point that they suggested we try FaceTime again and he mouthed ""I love you, I want to come home"". Just as we'd been warned, things did move at an agonisingly slow pace. Mal's muscle had wasted away to nothing. They'd reduce his ventilator settings to enable him to breathe on his own for half an hour but the following day he'd be exhausted. The next time they'd reduce support for an hour and so onâ¦ Gradually he'd build up enough strength to wiggle his finger, then manage a wave goodbye, then lift his arm. But even then, we were once again constantly warned ""he's not out of the woods"". They'd put a speech valve on the tracheotomy and we heard ""hiya, how are you?"" We thought it was a nurse speaking at first as the phone was obscuring Mal's mouth. Then I suddenly said ""Mal, is that you?"" and he replied ""yeah, you alright?"" They'd warned us that it might not sound like him but it did. It sounded exactly like him! He made a joke, something about the bed baths being good. It was starting to sound like him, starting to look like him, it is him, he's in there, he's come back to us! That was the first bit of light in a very dark time. Tears again but this time, for the first time, they were happy. As Mal began to be able to communicate more, it seemed to do wonders for his mental positivity and after a second bout of pneumonia and over a litre of fluid drained from his lung he made more rapid improvement. Sue and the children were able to FaceTime Mal during his stay in hospital He was on the ventilator for an agonising 61 days but even then caught pneumonia for a third time and had to stay in ICU for 80 days. But even after leaving ICU he was scared of falling asleep, fearing he wouldn't wake up and he asked me ""am I really going to make it?"". I said to him: ""Mal, the consultants always gave me the worst case scenario. When the consultant said to me that you are a long way from the danger zone, I believe him. You are out of that critical phase now and you are in recovery."" Yesterday he walked up and down two flights of stairs unaided. He's getting stronger every day, so much so the physios say he no longer needs their help, not even a care package when he comes home. He has astounded them with his determination. Mal wants to support his son Wiliam at rugby games His wish now is to be able to walk to the side of the pitch and watch our 14-year-old son Wiliam play rugby. Given the fact they probably won't be back playing until next year, knowing Mal he'll probably be back helping them train by then. Mal will have to have surgery to amputate part of both his thumbs, his index finger and the tip of his middle finger of his right hand due to lack of blood circulation. But that's a small price to pay and he was never any good at texting anyway so he'll just have to use voice control from now on. From his hospital bed, Mal told Sue ""I want to come home"" There's a chance he'll require long-term kidney dialysis but things on that score have also improved. Monitoring will continue but consultants are reasonably confident that won't be the case. His lungs will remain scarred and we're told he might suffer from breathlessness but he doesn't require oxygen. Like his kidneys, his lungs might not recover fully but they may recover enough. Whether he'll be able to run Parkruns like he used to or whether he'll have to walk Parkruns in the future, we don't know. But I do know that whatever happens Mal will make sure he is the strongest possible version of himself. There will be an emotional, psychological fall-out for sure. We've all got a lot to process. But if we need support to help us through then we'll take it. I've always considered myself a strong person. As a family we've had many tragedies, as so many people have, but we've always been able to get through it together. But this has really tested me and made me realise that you don't need to be strong all the time. There are times in your life when you do need help and you shouldn't be afraid to take it. Despite some lingering health concerns, Mal's progress has been significant For the incredible support we've had from family and friends, medical staff and our community, I haven't been able to say thank you in person. Our close family, friends, work colleagues and neighbours have been incredible. I cannot express my gratitude enough for the care Mal has received. In particular the ICU team who treated him like he was one of their own and made an horrendous situation more bearable in what extreme circumstances for them. And we are so, so sad for the families who did lose their loved ones to Covid, we send them lots of love and our deepest sympathies. But throughout this ordeal support has also come from another, totally unexpected source. So what I'd really like to say is thank you to the thousands of people, complete strangers not only from the UK, but Australia, Spain, Sweden, South Africa, New Zealand, around the world, who wrote to me, messaged me, left comments on social media, and others who held us in their thoughts for a moment. I can't describe what a comfort and help that was. All the medical staff say Mal was so close to death that his recovery can only be described as miraculous. We're not a religious family but it seemed that the world was praying for us. And maybe that played a part in the story of 'Miracle Mal' as he from now on will forever be known. The family are looking forward to being reunited at home 'My husband's chances are almost zero they told me' 'Maybe, just maybe, he might turn a corner' Video, 00:02:20'Maybe, just maybe, he might turn a corner' Dad 'still with us' despite slim survival hope Fatalities confirmed in Pacific Palisades as Los Angeles fire death toll rises Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"This is the moment to be ambitious â PMBoris Johnson sets out plan to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus and ""build back better"".UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain must ""build, build, build"" to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis Boris Johnson has said now is the time to be ""ambitious"" about the UK's future, as he set out a post-coronavirus recovery plan. The PM vowed to ""use this moment"" to fix longstanding economic problems and promised a Â£5bn ""new deal"" to build homes and infrastructure. Plans set out in the Tory election manifesto would be speeded up and ""intensified,"" he added. Labour and the CBI said he was not focusing enough on saving jobs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""not much of a deal and not much that's new"". The BBC's economic editor, Faisal Islam, said there was ""nothing really new"" in the plans, but was a pledge from the Treasury to ""speed up capital investment that has already been announced and tolerate higher levels of debt"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak later confirmed he would deliver an economic update on 8 July ""setting out the next stage in our plan to secure the recovery"". The PM's speech came asnew figures showed the UK economyshrank faster than at any time since 1979 between January and March. Boris Johnson's economy speech fact-checked What a shrinking economy means in one town Where do governments go when they need money? In a wide-ranging speech in Dudley, in the West Midlands, Mr Johnson vowed to ""build, build, build"" to soften the ""economic aftershock"" of coronavirus. He said the government wanted to continue with its plans to ""level up"" - one of its main slogans of last December's election - as ""too many parts"" of the country had been ""left behind, neglected, unloved"". Infrastructure projects in England would be ""accelerated"" and there would be investment in new academy schools, green buses and new broadband, the PM added. Projects in the Â£5bn investment plan include: Â£1.5bn for hospital maintenance and building, eradicating mental health dormitories and improving A&E capacity - the government said this is ""new"" money in addition to Â£1.1bn in its Spring Budget Â£100m for 29 road projects including bridge repairs in Sandwell and improving the A15 in the Humber region - this money had already been announced Over Â£1bn for new school buildings, as announced on Monday - this cash comes from the government's existing infrastructure plan Â£12bn to help build 180,000 new affordable homes for ownership and rent over the next eight years - brings together three pots of money already announced by previous Tory governments and Mr Johnson's administration Other projects announced in the government's Spring Budget, which will now be accelerated, include: Â£83m for maintenance of prisons and youth offender facilities, and Â£60m for temporary prison places. Â£900m for ""shovel ready"" local projects in England this year and in 2021 Â£500,000 - Â£1m for each area in the towns fund to spend on improvements to parks, high street and transport Mr Johnson acknowledged jobs might be lost because of the economic hit from the pandemic, but said a new ""opportunity guarantee"" would ensure every young person had the chance of an apprenticeship or placement. Asked whether the plans went far enough for those who end up unemployed, the PM said the strategy was for ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" and there would not be a return to austerity. But he could not put a figure on how many roles would be created through his plan, adding: ""We don't yet know what the full economic impact is going to be... [but] we will do everything we can to get this economy moving."" The prime minister loves a big, historical comparison. He is a keen student of Winston Churchill - and has even written a book about him. Over the last few days, the comparisons the government has sought to draw have been with former American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his ""New Deal."" Asmy colleagues at Reality Check point out, the plan set out today is a tiddler compared to what FDR did, and a fair chunk of it is re-announcing what we already knew the government was planning. But Boris Johnson is attempting to set out in a broader context the government's vision - and his pride in saying he wants to spend a lot to revitalise the economy and haul it out of the doldrums. Under what Mr Johnson dubbed ""project speed,"" planning laws would also be streamlined to encourage building. Changes, planned for September, include: Allowing many commercial buildings to change to residential use without planning application Cutting the normal planning process for builders who want to demolish and rebuild vacant residential and commercial buildings as homes Allowing homeowners to build above their properties ""via a fast track approval process"" and subject to neighbour consultation Pubs, libraries, village shops will be protected from the changes as they were ""essential to the lifeblood of communities,"" the government said. Mr Johnson acknowledged the planning changes might meet resistance in traditional Tory-voting areas, but said: ""Sometimes you have got to get on with things."" The government believes their existing plans for boosting infrastructure spending are already a significant fillip to the economy, and they want to see what happens as it re-opens. One set of figures released today shows household savings increased during lockdown, but will people have the confidence to spend? The scale of government support for businesses and employees in recent months probably does justify New Deal-style rhetoric. Extending support at that level may yet be required, and is far from ruled out. But for now, they are holding fire as they assess the permanent scars to the UK economy. Mr Johnson also attempted to calm Tory fears that he had shifted to the left, saying: ""I am not a communist"". Instead, he claimed he had been inspired by US president Franklin D Roosevelt, who led America out of the Great Depression with his New Deal in the 1930s. In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, President Roosevelt launched one of the largest, most expensive US government programmes which included building schools, hospitals and dams. Youth Worker Lisa Williams is worried young people will be hit hard In the former ""red wall"" seat of Rother Valley - which the Conservatives won from Labour for the first time at last year's general election - there has been a mixed reaction to the announcement from employees and business owners. David Shaw, operations manager for a manufacturing company, said the investment announcement was ""positive"" and praised the government's furlough scheme during the crisis for saving businesses. But Lisa Williams, manager of a youth and community centre in Dinnington, said of the promised investment that ""we've yet to see that happen"". ""Year-on-year, successive governments have made promises, and these areas have yet to see that,"" she said, adding she was concerned about the economic impact on young people. And Jayne Maxwell, a shop owner in Maltby, said she was sceptical about how much investment would go into high streets, saying more short-term help was needed. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""We're facing an economic crisis, the biggest we've seen in a generation and the recovery needs to match that. What's been announced amounts to less than Â£100 per person. ""And it's the re-announcement of many manifesto pledges and commitments, so it's not enough."" Sir Keir Starmer says more focus is needed on jobs The Labour leader added: ""We're not going to argue against a recovery plan, but the focus has to be on jobs."" CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said the prime minister had set out the ""first steps on the path to recovery"" but added that ""the focus on rescuing viable firms cannot slip"".

"100 days of lockdown: How life changed in a UK townWhat's lockdown been like for personal trainer, a student, a rapper and a semi-pro footballer?Newsbeat","""Never known anything like it in my lifetime."" That's a line we'll all have heard in the 100 days since Boris Johnson announced the coronavirus lockdown on 23 March. Normally it'd be something your nan might say. For Telford in Shropshire, it's true of an entire town. Throughout the last 100 days, Radio 1 Newsbeat has been in touch with people in Telford about how lockdown has changed them and their lives. There's the local footballer who has no idea what will happen to his career, the personal trainer who had to change her business overnight and the rapper who thought 2020 would be his best yet. Telford has only existed since the late 1960s - built then to offer new housing to people from much busier cities. After 50 years, it's still called ""a new town"". ""It's got a perfect blend of rural and urban,"" 18-year-old Molly Morgan tells us about her hometown. ""It's a great place to grow up."" ""I've grown up here, my family's here, my future's here,"" adds personal trainer Esther Williams. ""It's got a great community. When I was younger, I'd have gone to Birmingham or Wolverhampton for the day but now there's so much to do in Telford."" Telford was a far more ambitious project than other new towns of the era, like Stevenage and Crawley. The aim was for 225,000 people to live there by 1991. In 2020 there are around 155,000. The town is cut down the middle by the motorway linking Shropshire with the Black Country. Famous brands including Hitachi take sites on the industrial Stafford Park to the east, with the world famous Iron Bridge, arching over the River Severn, a couple of miles to the south. This was the first major bridge in the world made of cast iron when it opened in 1781 The idea for Telford was to bring smaller towns, like Dawley and Lawley, together into one community. ""It's got a magnificent situation overlooking Shropshireâ¦ I think it's got the makings of a very fine town indeed,"" were the words of Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, former City Architect of Birmingham, who helped with the plans. ""Once an attractive town is built there - industry will go,"" he said. In lockdown, Telford is a community facing some of its biggest challenges - and the people we've been talking to spoke about challenges that will feel very familiar. In many of the stories you hear, it's the mood of uncertainty which keeps coming up. Esther's personal training firm, Ruthless, takes up a small corrugated unit on the sprawling industrial estate of Hortonwood, where both Epson and Heinz have bases. She only started her business in 2018 and its whole model was transformed overnight on 23 March when the prime minister addressed the country and told us that all non-essential businesses, including gyms, must close. Esther's been paying full rent on the unit during lockdown and is still waiting for the government to say she can re-open. In the meantime, her focus is online sessions and small exercise classes in the park. ""The work I'm doing is great, and I'm so grateful for that, but it's not quite enough to be able to keep paying the rent there."" Like so many people, Esther's working life was transformed by coronavirus During that first week of lockdown, Esther told her clients on Facebook: ""We will be back. We will be stronger. We will be unstoppable."" Looking back now, she adds: ""I've never done online so I was quite nervous. I went to Zoom having never used Zoom before. ""For me, it was completely different. It was daunting to begin with but I'm so glad I did."" You can't help but notice Esther says ""so grateful"" and ""so glad"" a lot. She acknowledges others businesses have not had her flexibility. Esther's husband lost his job in sales but couldn't get furlough as he'd only been with his company a short time. ""He's just starting now to get interviews. The stress of trying to find a job - even a temporary job - they just go so quick. Things are getting better now. I'm just lucky I can work now and things are starting to move."" From Esther's unit to one of the town's focal points - the New Bucks Head, home to non-league AFC Telford United - is just a seven-minute drive. For the sixth tier of English football, it's impressive. A 6,000-capacity stadium would surely be one of the bigger days out in the National League North. Guiseley AFC and Curzon Ashton are typical visitors. AFC Telford United take on their famous neighbours Wolverhampton Wanderers in a friendly match AFC Telford United typically get a thousand people turning up to home games but there's been nobody through the turnstiles since Kettering Town on 14 March - and without any income from tickets, the club's faced desperate measures. On a Go Fund Me page seeking donations, a message reads: ""All of our income streams have dramatically reduced to virtually zero for several weeks now and it's almost certain as a business it will take some time to recover."" Midfielder Adam Walker says the months without football have been tough on the players too. They said goodbye to each other after a fairly regular match - minus the handshakes - expecting to see each other again later in the same week. ""And that never happened. So it's been a big gap in everyone's lives really."" Adam says coronavirus started to feel real when they were no longer allowed to shake hands with opposing players Adam has become something of an unofficial spokesman for the players. He says some are having to look at a career change. ""There's a very dark mist overhead still until this is resolved. There's massive uncertainty on how many clubs will be able to survive."" He points to the potential impact that could have on this community. ""A club like Telford have always had a very good side and a lovely stadium. You take that away from the community and there'd be a massive hole there."" Without the guarantees of gate receipts, the club's been helping its players find other work, such as coaching. Adam says there has been a massive hole in the life of Telford United's players ""The gaffer's tried to help players at the end of their career or maybe the younger ones who don't know yet whether they'll get paid for football and they might have young families. ""It's showing them how to be employable because a lot of people will be looking for jobs in this period. ""It's to try to help people have an income and still play football."" There has been football on the Bucks Head site for a century, but the area's not had the biggest live music scene recently. ""Telford has had a shortage of actual live music venues. One of the main ones closed down a few years ago,"" says Tim Rogers - a financial services worker by day, who takes off the suit and tie to become rapper Trademark Blud out of office hours. Trademark Blud was expecting to play at a few festivals this summer This year felt like a moment of change - with a new 300-capacity venue opening in the town's Southwater Square. It's easy to imagine Southwater Square without ever visiting. Cineworld, Nando's, TGi Fridays, all built in the last few years - all designed to give people in Telford a new option for a night out. Tim thought the new venue was going to be a big moment for the local live scene - with the prospect of international names coming to Telford. ""It's terrible. The most important thing is being able to deliver what you've produced to people and see their reactions and let them enjoy in the way you hope they will."" One of V Festival's two sites was a few miles from Telford until 2017, when the festival was discontinued. Here's Amy Winehouse performing there in 2008 He sounds undeniably flat talking about his music. He's been doing shows online but ""they're not the same"". ""It's not even 50% - especially with rap and hip-hop as it's super energetic."" To top it off, he had festival bookings for Boomtown and B-Side festival in 2020, which obviously won't be happening. Outside of music though Tim says he's feeling ""much more comfortable"" about the pandemic - his fears of picking it up have reduced and he's settled into working at home. Covid came closer than he'd like though - a child in his son's class lost his father after he contracted the virus. Molly's university plans have changed due to Covid-19 For 18-year-old Molly, the latest lockdown easing is a bit of good news - she's got her friend's 18th birthday the week whennew measurescome into effect, so they'll get a celebration. Beyond that, Molly's future will probably be closer to Telford than she'd been planning. She should have just finished her A-Levels. But of course she never actually sat them and has tweaked her uni choices because she didn't get to finish her open day tours. Now, she's looking at PPE (not that one, she jokes, after pulling her own face covering down) in Liverpool or Birmingham. This PPE is politics, philosophy and economics. ""I'd have been more open to going further away but without the chance to visit, I was apprehensive to go somewhere without seeing the city. I'd have been a bit more adventurous."" Molly says she's nervous about the prospect of her first year at university being mostly online learning. ""I don't want to stay in my room essentially for the whole yearâ¦ I'm not sure that's right for me. I've toyed with delaying for a year to get the proper uni experience."" Trademark Blud's sound might be a bit different in the coming months... Molly will know more when the results come in August, Adam's keeping the training going waiting for news on the new season. Esther hopes her unit will be open for classes after the next wave of government announcements. And rapper Trademark Blud? He's eyeing up a plan B. ""Some of my friends are acoustic guitarists and they might get back and start gigging again. It's maybe difficult for my genre - it's more of a live venue, nightclub, big stage kind of thing. ""I'm thinking of working with some guitarists and going to do the local pubs. I don't think they'll appreciate me jumping around and jumping off the tables at six o'clock. We'll have to tone it down I think."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

UK economy hit worse than first thought,"The UK economy shrank more than first thought between January and March, contracting 2.2% in the joint largest fall since 1979, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalrevised down its previous estimate of a 2% contraction, with all the main economic sectors dropping. There was a significant economic impact in March, as the coronavirus pandemic began to have an effect. The data comes as the prime minister set out a post-lockdown recovery plan. Boris Johnson said in a speech in Dudley, in the West Midlands, that there would be investment in infrastructure and schools. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""Our more detailed picture of the economy in the first quarter showed GDP shrank a little more than first estimated. ""Information from government showed health activities declined more than we previously showed. ""All main sectors of the economy shrank significantly in March as the effects of the pandemic hit."" The first-quarter contraction is now the joint biggest drop since the July-to-September period in 1979. What is GDP and why does it matter? PM pledges to 'build back better' post-virus Mr Athow said: ""The sharp fall in consumer spending at the end of March led to a notable increase in households' savings."" The new data showed that GDP contracted by 6.9% in March. The first-quarter figures show that the services sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of UK GDP - shrank by a record 2.3%. The ONS said production output fell by a revised 1.5% in the three months, driven by declines in manufacturing as factories temporarily shut down, while there was a fall in construction output of 1.7%. The coronavirus lockdown only came into force on 23 March, so figures for the second quarter of the year will show the full hit on the economy. Recent ONS monthly figuresshowed the economy plummeted by 20.4% in April- the largest drop in a single month since records began. That contraction was three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. It says something that the first quarter of the year was the worst for the economy in 41 years - and yet it was still barely a tenth the size of the contraction in activity in just one month - last April. The figures put the government's ""build build build"" announcement in perspective. The Â£5bn infrastructure spending being ""brought forward"" is not new money in any case. It was set aside in the pre-election manifesto at a time when the economy looked very different. Compare it, say, to the Â£69bn it's estimated that small businesses will lose in the pandemic because they've had to stop trading (according to research by small business insurers Simply Business). Or compare it to total public spending of more than Â£1,000bn, and it's less than 0.5%. Against the size of the economy based on the latest GDP numbers, the mooted infrastructure spend is more like 0.25%. The government's going to have to spend a lot more than that to stimulate a recovery from a slump on this scale. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest figures could be summed up in one line: ""The biggest contraction for 40 years, even though Q1 contained just nine lockdown days."" The data ""was just the prelude"", with worse to come, he added. However, while economists are braced for a dire set of second-quarter figures, Howard Archer, at the EY Item Club, believes April's sharp contraction is likely to have been the low point. He predicted the economy would ""return to clear growth in the third quarter with GDP expanding close to 10% quarter-on-quarter"" as lockdown restrictions are eased further. In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Johnson promised an ""infrastructure revolution"", arguing the government needed to ""work fast"" to support jobs whilst also seeking to ""level up"" the economy so that all parts of the country can benefit. He said the government would introduce ""the most radical reforms of our planning system since the end of the Second World War"" to speed up building and infrastructure projects where, he argued, the UK compares unfavourably with other European countries. As part of what he called a ""new deal"", the prime minister set out plans to accelerate Â£5bn of spending on infrastructure projects. Meanwhile,separate ONS data on the nation's finances,externalshowed that Britain's current account deficit widened by more than expected in the first quarter. The balance of payments deficit - the difference between the value of the goods and services that a country imports and the goods and services it exports - rose to Â£21.1bn, or 3.8% of GDP. This means the UK is reliant on inflows of cash from abroad and leaves the pound vulnerable, according to Mr Tombs. ""Sterling almost certainly would depreciate sharply again if a major second wave of Covid-19 emerges or if the UK and EU fail to either sign a trade deal or to extend the transition period before the end of this year,"" he said.

Trump political base 'hit hardest',"Tomas Philipson (top right) says low-wage earners have been hit the hardest by the coronavirus pandemic The economic impact of the coronavirus has taken a heavier toll on low-wage earners according to Tomas J Philipson, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. In an exclusive interview with the BBC before hisreported departure,external, he said: ""There's a sort of unique impact of this shock in that its very regressive, hitting the low wage part of the economy. Low-wage workers take a bigger hit than higher wage"". The virus has derailed any progress the US was making in raising the living standards of those on low pay, Prof Philipson said in an interview forCoronavirus: The Economic Shock, in which some of the world's leading economists and business leaders look at how the gravest economic downturn in nearly a hundred years may change the way we live and work. ""We had enormous success in growing lower wages before the pandemic struck, so this has taken a very regressive toll on the economy,"" he argues. This has political implications for the upcoming November election as President Trump enjoys far higher support among non-college educated voters - often used as a proxy for low vs high wage earners - than among those who have college degrees. President Trump enjoys high support among non-college educated voters Prof Philipson also plays down the chances of a rapid economic recovery. ""I'm not saying we are going to have a v-shaped recovery, in fact the data shows a sort of gradual response."" However, he also defends the United States' response to the pandemic and places some of the responsibility Covid-19 in the US at the doors of state governors. ""We were the first country to introduce travel bans from China and were criticised for that. Many state governments run by Democratic governors did not act before the federal government, even though they were free to do so."" He disagrees that a rise in US economic nationalism has been harmful to the world economy. ""I think China was justifiably demonised in the sense that we treated them a lot better selling stuff here than they treated us selling stuff there. I think the president has done a lot to balance that"". Prof Niall Ferguson says the US and China are now in a cold war Niall Ferguson, professor of history at Stanford University says the virus has seen economic tensions between the world's two biggest economies become more than a trade dispute. ""It seems to me pretty clear that we're now in 'Cold War Two'. ""It's going to be different from 'Cold War One', not least because the US and the Soviet Union were never as economically interdependent as the US and China have become over the last 20 years. ""It's hard to think of a better illustration of the downsides of globalisation than the extreme vulnerability it exposed to a virus that originated in in China.""This has, he believes, huge economic implications for the entire interconnectedness of the world economy and therefore the size and the health of the global economy. Ursula Burns: Business is an ally in the fight against inequality Globalisation has been credited with lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty but has also been blamed for deepening inequality within countries. The virus has operated like an X-ray on the global economic body and its revealed weaknesses and imbalances along economic, gender and ethnic fault lines. Ursula Burns was the first African American woman to sit on the board of a Fortune 500 company and she now sits on the boards of Nestle, Uber and ExxonMobil. She says business is emerging as an unlikely and welcome ally in the fight against inequality that she says the pandemic has laid bare. ""Amazingly enough, business is starting to be at the centre of that conversation. At the centre because governments around the world are not articulate enough or sensitive enough or informed enough to contribute positively to this conversation. So out of nowhere, businesses start to change the discourse in the world."" Will business step up? Or will the fight for survival mean savage cost-cutting and mass redundancies compounding the problems of inequality? TheInternational Labour Organization estimates that the equivalent of 305 million full-time jobs could be lost worldwide,externalin the second three months of this year. The ILO says 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy -nearly half of the global workforce - are in immediate danger of losing their livelihoods. Tony Elumelu: Many in Africa face a stark choice, of risking dying of hunger or from Covid-19 In developing countries, where government safety nets are weak and where economies are particularly vulnerable, things may be particularly tough. It is a point made by Tony Elumelu, who is one of Africa's most influential businessmen. He is a billionaire banker and founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, which invests in start-ups and SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) across the continent. ""We have endemic poverty in Africa. Over 80% of our population live from hand to mouth. They go out, they die of Covid. They sit at home, they die of hunger. Then what is better for them to do? It is a bad situation but it gives us all the opportunity to re-set."" Big business - global corporations - seem ready to reset too. The chairman of Tata Group, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, and Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, both believe global business is in the midst of a long-term rethink on how employers organise their workforce and how supply chains and resources will operate. They suggest sustainability may become more of a focus. Natarajan Chandrasekaran: Global business is rethinking how it operates In a remarkable broadcasting moment, Mr Chandrasekaran - a titan of global business - looked out across Mumbai and reflected on the change. ""You can hear the birds. We can breathe fresh airâ¦ on a clear day we can see the stars."" So will the world grasp this opportunity to change how the world economy works and address pressing challenges that include global inequality and climate change? Or when the health crises passes will things return to way they were? Will we miss an opportunity to change how the global economy functions for the welfare of us all? Coronavirus: the Economic Shockis presented by Simon Jack and produced by Kirsty MacKenzie. It includes the thoughts of Nissan's COO Ashwani Gupta, Nobel prize-winning economists Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, Tata's chairman Tata Natarajan Chandrasekaran; former UK prime minister Tony Blair, and Krishnamurthy Subramanian, the chief economic advisor to Indian PM Narendra Modi.

China passes controversial Hong Kong security law,"Protests rocked Hong Kong last year, sparked by a bill intended to enable extraditions to the mainland China has formally adopted a controversial security law, giving it new powers over Hong Kong and deepening fears for its freedoms. It is set to criminalise secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, but will also effectively curtail protests and freedom of speech. The move follows increasing unrest and a widening pro-democracy movement. Pro-democracy organisation Demosisto reacted to the news byannouncing it was ceasing all operations,external. Earlier Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, said he was leaving the group, which he had spearheaded. But some other veteran activists have said they will join a key march on Wednesday, despite the risk of arrest under the new law. Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit China's state news agency, Xinhua, confirmed that President Xi Jinping had now signed the security law. It has been added to Hong Kong's Basic Law, the 50-year mini-constitution agreed when the territory's sovereignty was returned to China by the UK in 1997. Its terms are not yet clear, meaning residents still do not know the measures they will have to abide by. The law could be implemented as early as Wednesday. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab expressed ""deep concern"" at the reports the law had been passed, saying: ""This would be a grave step."" China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The city of two masks faces a new crisis The law has sparked demonstrations in Hong Kong since it was announced by Beijing in May. China says it is needed to tackle unrest and instability and rejects criticism as interference in its affairs. Critics warn the law will shut down dissent The law went through unanimously in a session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing. It comes a day before the 23rd anniversary of the handover from Britain to China - a date usually marked by pro-democracy protests. It will make criminal any act of secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism and collusion with foreign or external forces. Beijing to set up new security office in Hong Kong A new office in Hong Kong would deal with national security cases, but would also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools. In addition, the city will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser. Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, a move which has raised fears about judicial independence. Importantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes priority. For many, the law undermines the freedoms that set Hong Kong apart from the rest of China and helped define its character. People in Hong Kong prize civil liberties such as free speech, the right to protest and an entirely independent and robust judiciary, as permitted in the Basic Law. The bill will cement Beijing's control of Hong Kong In recent years, Hong Kong has seen waves of protests demanding more rights. Last year, rallies over a now-scrapped bill permitting extraditions to the mainland turned violent and fuelled a broad pro-democracy movement. In a video address to the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said crimes under the new law would be clearly defined. She said the law would only target a ""small minority"" and would not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We respect differences in opinion."" Hong Kong's sweeping new security law is a frighteningly open-ended tool to suppress political agitation. Like similar laws on the Chinese mainland it appears that it can be manipulated to meet the needs of the Communist Party as required to crush almost any action deemed threatening. Unlike elsewhere in China, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary. For this reason, the Party's leadership was not going to leave interpretation of this law in the hands of just any old judges. No. Those who will be allowed to preside in these matters will be hand-picked by Carrie Lam, the city's leader who was effectively installed by Beijing. So, prior to the new security bill, which actions by activists - no matter how subversive - could not be dealt with under existing laws? What were ""extremists"" getting away with to warrant this new legislation? Bomb making? No. Smashing up buildings? No. Meeting with international NGOs to talk about the city's deteriorating freedoms? Ahhhh. Perhaps. Publicly advocating Hong Kong independence? Almost certainly. The more that Beijing, under Xi Jinping's leadership, has sought to control Hong Kong, the more it has driven residents into the pro-democracy camp. But he is playing a long game. Sure, handover promises to the UK were made but he was not going to let some Western attachment to liberty trump loyalty to the motherland. Not on his watch. Enter the security law. Democratic Party leader Wu Chi-wai said he would defy a police ban on Wednesday's ""handover day"" march. He will be joined by Figo Chan, of the Civil Human Rights Front, who urged people to take to the streets, saying: ""We are aware of the risks of being prosecuted. But we insist on taking the lead, as we want to tell Hongkongers not to fear."" Police plan to have 4,000 riot officers on standby, the South China Morning Post reports. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions The background you need on Hong Kong's protests Announcing that it would ""dissolve and stop all meetings"", the Demosisto group said that the fight against ""totalitarian oppression"" would have to continue in a ""more flexible manner"" and on ""different fronts"". Joshua Wong said the law marked ""the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before"". President of the European Council Charles Michel said on Tuesday the law risked seriously undermining Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We deplore this decision."" Taiwan even warned its citizens of risks in visiting Hong Kong. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Washington on Monday began moves to end Hong Kong's special status trade relationship with the US. On Tuesday, China said it would respond to the removal with unspecified ""countermeasures"". The UK earlier said it would change its immigration rules and offer millions of people in Hong Kong ""a route to citizenship"" if China went ahead with the legislation.

"'Stop childhoods being disrupted', say charities","Charities say children and families must be at the heart of the recovery process Young people are facing ""unprecedented threats"" to their futures from the Covid-19 pandemic, and should be prioritised, says a group of charities. Children are ""in an eerie world, full of uncertainty"", say 146 organisations. In a letter to the prime minister, they urge government to put children's needs on a par with health and the economy to stop their life chances being derailed. The government said that ""throughout the pandemic we've prioritised children's safety and wellbeing"". The charities and other bodies, including Action for Children, Barnardo's, the National Children's Bureau, NSPCC, the Children's Society, Unicef UK and the Child Poverty Action Group, say Covid-19 ""threatens to cast its shadow"" over the young for years to come. ""They do not know when they can go back to school. They worry about when they can see friends and family. They are anxious about family finances,"" they warn. Young carers 'can't get a break' in lockdown Youth mental health 'needs recovery plan' Children facing uncertain future, experts warn ""We know this uncertainty and worry will lead to anxiety and mental health problems. ""We know closed schools will damage the educational attainment and life chances of children - the poorest the most. ""We know black, Asian and minority ethnic communities will be hit the hardest. ""We know there is more financial hardship to come."" The charities say the voices of children, young people and families must be at the heart of the recovery and rebuilding process and there must be renewed investment in the services they rely on. Jennifer from Bristol, a mother of two children with disabilities, told the BBC the past few weeks have been very difficult for her family. She says one of her sons has had regular panic attacks in the night, while the other recently said: ""I want to throw myself out of a window, I just want this to be over."" Her younger son has been so scared that he has refused to go out in the garden ""as he thinks he's going to catch something just from being outside"". For Jennifer and her sons, the past few weeks have been very challenging ""It's a real fight for me to try to get him to go out and get some fresh air."" With the help of Action for Children, she now has a trampoline in the garden to encourage him to venture outside. Jennifer says there are times when feels she has let her children down and takes herself off to the shower when it all gets too much. ""No-one can hear you crying in the shower, can they? Then they don't know. It's not good for them to see you're not coping."" She feels the needs of children and families have been overlooked during the pandemic. ""We came out and clapped for the NHS, for carers, but did anyone think of the children - they're the Covid children - and how their little lives have been turned upside down and their routines ruined?"" Her message to the government is simple: ""They need to start putting the children first, and their mental health."" The charities say: ""The government, understandably, has so far focused on the immediate health and economic consequences. ""It's now time for the nation to put a strong, protective arm around its children, to stop childhoods being disrupted and life chances being derailed."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Schools and colleges have remained open to vulnerable children and we're keeping in touch with those most at risk. ""We've expanded frontline charity support and provided new resources for schools and teachers to  support children's mental health."" The government has announced a catch-up package for lost teaching time, an investment plan to improve schools and college buildings and will continue to invest in early years education, she added. The letter to the prime minister comes as a survey by Barnardo's suggests the lockdown has affected the mental health and wellbeing of young people. The poll of 4,000 UK children and young people, aged eight to 24, found that a third had experienced an increase in stress, loneliness and worry. Nearly three-quarters (74%) said they missed going into school or college.

Lockdown has altered all our lives in a fundamental way. It has challenged many of us in ways we never would have imagined. Families have lost loved ones while others have been forced to stay apart when every instinct would normally have led them to spend time together. And in some cases it's brought out the very best in human nature with acts of extraordinary kindness. We hope you've found it interesting looking back on this fast-moving, ever-changing three months. And we hope to see you again tomorrow. From Saturday people can get a haircut, see a film and enjoy a pint in the pub once more. Venues closed since the middle of March will be able to welcome visitors as long as safety measures are in place. The vast majority of English galleries and museums won't reopen on Saturday, despitebeing given the go-ahead by the government to do so last week. Holiday accommodation - including hotels, B&Bs, cottages, campsites and caravan parks - can also reopen, and people in England will be free to stay away from home overnight for the first time since lockdown began in March. The lifting of the restrictions don't apply in Leicester,which is having to re-impose some lockdown measures due to a rise in cases. Read more about this weekend's changes here. They have become the staple of socially distant socialising - the virtual quiz. All over the country people have fancied themselves the next Alexander Armstrong, Bradley Walsh, Sue Barker or Anne Robinson as they set brainteasers for their friends in the absence of the pub. Now you can quiz yourself with our quiz quiz, all about quizzes. There have been calls for work to prevent further flooding in Fishlake to resume as soon as possible following the easing of lockdown measures. Church warden Peter Pridham said work to stop a repeat of the scenes of flooding in November 2019, was needed urgently following the disruption of the coronavirus crisis. He said: ""It's most unfortunate the two things have coincided."" The Environment Agency said site visits to Fishlake had now recommenced in line with government advice. A spokesperson said:
""Residents will see our staff and contractors gathering additional
information through land surveys, ground investigations and inspections to
inform work to improve flood defences."" We've been looking at 100 days of lockdown today but this is what else has been going on: Andrew AloiaBBC Sport Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford
campaigned for children to be able to claim free school meal vouchers in the
summer holidays. The 22-year-oldâs efforts prompted aU-turn from the government, meaning about 1.3m youngsters in England would be better off. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the England star's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". Rashford, who just 11 years earlier was among those who needed breakfast clubs and free school meals to supplement what his mum could provide, said he wants to do more to help those in need after the success of his campaign As England marks 100 days of lockdown, one photographer shares thepictures he took to document the impact on Skegness- one of the UK's most popular seaside resorts. Thousands of Lego-builders took advantage of lockdown and made use of their time at home to create stop-motion movies and models of real-life constructions. The Danish toy was the subject of more internet searches during lockdown than in the same months in previous years. Jon Opstad, his six-year-old son Ollie and four-year-old daughter Alice, recreated famous James Bond scenes from the likes of Thunderball and The Living Daylights. Whenshops in England reopenedon 15 July demand surged and queues formed. Research firm Springboard said that by 17:00 that day, footfall was 38.8% higher than the week before. But shopper numbers were generally far below the same time last year. At Bicester Village, near Oxford,crowding was so great that 3,000 people signed a petition to close it. Andrew AloiaBBC Sport Despite not kicking a ball for almost three months,Chelseawere named Womenâs Super League championsafter the season was curtailed in June. Days after collecting the title, the London club said they
would donate the Â£100,00 in prize money to Refuge, a charity which supports
women and children experiencing domestic abuse. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said they had
seen a âhuge increaseâ in demand for its services during the pandemic. ""We are incredibly grateful to Chelsea Women for not
only shining a light on domestic abuse, but also supporting us with a
significant financial commitment - this is an incredible gesture,"" Horley
said. Before lockdown the sight of someone in a face mask on the bus might have drawn a few glances, but as June got under way the governmentannounced plans to make them compulsory on public transport. To keep supplies of surgical masks for medical professionals, people have instead been advised on how tomake their own cloth coverings. Staff at a Liverpool care home share their experiences of working during the pandemic. This video can not be played Bob DaleBBC Live reporter At the start of Junewe met 103-year-old Joan Willett, who is
walking to raise money for charity. Unable to get out during lockdown, she's tackling a steep hill at
her care home in Hastings every day. Inspired by Captain Tom, the 100-year-old who raised millions for
the NHS, she's being sponsored and has so far raised about Â£9,000 for the
British Heart Foundation as a thank you for the care she received when she
needed heart surgery in her 80s. Joan is still going - she plans to climb the hill every day until
she turns 104 on 19 July. This video can not be played One-hundred days of lockdown have inevitably taken their toll on medics working on the coronavirus frontline right across the UK. The BBC caught up with three members of staff at City Hospital, in Birmingham, who have been reflecting on a period that one describes as ""the hardest three months"" of more than 20 years of work in intensive care medicine. This video can not be played Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit The beginning of June saw children in Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 allowed back in school in ""bubbles"". As the month has gone on more children have been going back, with just under 1.6 million pupils in last week. But that's still less than 16% of all children. Bob DaleBBC Live reporter Adrian Backshall knew exactly how he was going to spend lockdown. The former British Rail worker used the time to assemble the
track, signals and wagon he had collected over the years into a working 30ft
(9m) railway in his back garden, in Eastbourne. Since theBBC highlighted his story in Aprilhe
has been busy adding lights, and says he has even been able to sleep in it on
warmer nights. He's also entering it in the 2020 shed of the
year contest.  This video can not be played However, Adrian's attempts to persuade his wife Ruth to let him extend the track to the end of the garden have so far failed. One of Ruth's prize flower beds stands in the way and she won't let him dig it up. On Thursday evening many of us in the UK grabbed our pots and pans, scooped up the dog, and nervously looked out of the window to make sure our neighbours were doing the same. Then, when the clock struck 20:00 BST, the sound of clapping, cheering and wooden spoons hitting saucepan lids once again filled the street as we celebrated those working on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic. But founder Annemarie Plas saidthe 10th week of clapping would be a good time for it to endand for it to instead become an annual event. Ms Plas, a Dutch-born Londoner, said it had been ""overwhelming"" to see how far the weekly clapping she founded had spread. But she said it had now ""had its moment"", saying it would be ""beautiful"" to end while people still felt positive about it. Hot weather towards the end of May saw people flock to beaches and beauty spots. At Durdle Door in Dorset police had to respond to reports of concern for the safety of people who were jumping off the cliff into the sea. Two helicopters landed on the beach and people ended up crowding together to make room. The sight of crowded beaches, bringing concerns about the possible further spread of coronavirus, would be seen again on several occasions as the good weather made its return the following the month.

Channel - in her garden. Connie Emmett has done the 34,000 strokes of the crawl needed to cover 23 miles in a paddling pool - all for her local hospital. The BBC first spoke to Connie Emmett, from Cranleigh, when she embarked on her task, with comedian and Channel swimmer David Walliams sending her his best wishes. Connie raised Â£2,300 for the Royal Surrey County Hospital in
Guildford. A serious competition swimmer, Connie has continued to use the
pool during lockdown, and her mum Sarah estimates that she's probably covered
enough distance now to have returned from France. Unsurprisingly, Connie wants to have a go at swimming the real
thing when she's old enough. This video can not be played People living a North Lincolnshire street say they'll keep working out together. Neighbours have become friends in this street

Lockdown tightened in Leicester over Covid surgeFirst local lockdown will see non-essential shops shut and schools close for most pupils in the city.LeicesterRelated content,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says a number of under 18s have tested positive for coronavirus The UK's first full local lockdown has been announced in Leicester, with stricter measures imposed in the city. Non-essential shops have shut, and schools will close for most pupils on Thursday because of a rise in coronavirus cases. The loosening of restrictions for pubs and restaurants in England on Saturday will also not be taking place there. The health secretary said measures would be enforced by police ""in some cases"". Matt Hancock said the city had ""10% of all positive cases in the country over the past week"". It comes after the city council reported 944 positive tests in the two weeks to 23 June - about one in 16 of the total UK cases during that period. The health secretary told the House of Commons on Monday evening: ""We recommend to people in Leicester, stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester."" He said the new local measures would be in place for at least two weeks, but kept under constant review. Latest updates: Leicester reacts to tightened lockdown measures How will local lockdown rules be enforced?,external What are Leicester's new lockdown restrictions? Leicester local lockdown shows virus risk not gone Mr Hancock said Leicester's seven-day infection rate of 135 cases per 100,000 people was ""three times higher than the next highest city"" and admissions to hospitals were between six and 10 per day - compared to about one a day at other trusts. He said ""targeted action"" at factories, workplaces and schools over the past 10 days had not worked, meaning stronger measures were needed. ""We've been taking this highly localised approach but unfortunately that targeted action wasn't working in Leicester and that's why we have taken this much broader measure,"" he said. The relaxation of shielding measures on 6 July - which will allow the most clinically vulnerable to spend more time outside - will also not take place in the city. Mr Hancock said schools were being closed to help slow the transmission of the disease and parents in other areas should not have any fear about continuing to send their children to school. The health secretary told BBC Breakfast there had been ""an unusually high incidence"" of coronavirus among children in Leicester since increased testing began in the city 10 days ago. Closing schools on Thursday rather than immediately was ""for practical reasons"" such as parents needing to find childcare, he added. Five schools have closed since the beginning of June due to the number of Covid-19 cases and the wider closures will affect most pupils, but children of ""critical workers"" and those classed as vulnerable will still be able to attend. This video can not be played Speaking before the official announcement, Leicester residents already had mixed feelings about stricter lockdown measures Leicester City Council said the latest figures obtained by the authority showed that 3,216 Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in the city since the start of the epidemic. ""Of these, 944 cases were reported in the last two weeks,"" a spokesman said. ""These figures include the number of patients and staff testing as positive in hospitals and positive cases identified in testing centres."" Mayor of Leicester Sir Peter Soulsby said the measures imposed by the government were ""stricter than we anticipated but we understand the need for firm action"". He questioned whether a local lockdown should have been imposed earlier, adding: ""If as seems to be the case, the figures suggest there are issues in the city, I wish [the government] had taken a more speedy decision. ""[The government] are clearly determined to start with the maximum, as it were, to see how it works and then perhaps to use the learning from this in other areas I have no doubt will follow."" Leicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton said ""protecting residents is our main concern"" and added it ""makes sense to step up restrictions in areas closer to the city"". Suburbs such as Oadby, Birstall, Thurmaston and Glenfield are also subject to the stricter measures. The county council said it planned to create a postcode tool to allow people to check if they were inside the lockdown boundary. Magda Raszowska, whose five-year-old daughter Iman goes to Launde Primary School in Oadby, said the news was ""frustrating"". ""It's like we're going back to March, that was the shocking thing,"" she said. ""Closing schools, closing shops again. It's scary, it just shows how a second wave can be not far off. ""Obviously safety comes first, I understand that, we all do. [But] it seems very strict. As the mayor said, has Leicester been singled out now they're getting more cautious?"" Magda Raszowska said the news suggested a second wave was imminent Blake Edwards said his salon was fully booked for the next five weeks Blake Edwards, owner of Flappers and Gentlemen salon, said he was ""devastated"" by the news. The hairdresser was ready to reopen on Saturday but will now remain closed ""with no new date in sight"". ""It's going to be really tough for the clients too,"" he said. ""Time is running out [for the business now], we're going to need more support. ""Even though the staff is being furloughed, rent still needs to be paid, all the other bills still need to be paid. ""We don't know what the next 12 months are going to be like."" The city and county councils will be given extra funding to improve communication about coronavirus Leicester's Highcross shopping centre tweeted on Monday evening that ""only essential retail stores"", alongside ""restaurants and cafes offering takeaway or delivery"" services, would open on Tuesday. Rakesh Parmar, who owns Ye Olde Sweet Shoppe in the city centre, said the further restrictions would affect him ""financially very, very badly"". ""The impact of coronavirus hit us on 23 March, we closed for 10 weeks, and then opened again on 15 June - it's been one long slog,"" he said. Mr Parmar said he ""completely"" understood why a further lockdown would be needed, but said his customers were ""very, very scared because it's closer to home than we realised"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock says the extended lockdown measures are ""profoundly in the national interest"" Mr Hancock said the government had also ""agreed further measures"" to tackle the outbreak in Leicester: A walk-in test centre will be opened in the city, alongside mobile testing units The city and county councils will be given ""extra funding"" to enhance communications to the population on Covid-19 in all relevant languages Councils will ensure ""support is available to those who have to self-isolate"" Workplaces that have seen ""clusters of cases"" will be helped to implement stringent Covid-19 guidance He said the government was ""still getting to the bottom of"" the potential reasons why the outbreak had occurred. If there is one thing that has become clear during the pandemic, it is that the quicker action is taken the better. Given the scale of the outbreak in Leicester that has emerged, it therefore comes as no surprise that the government is taking tough action. But the question that is being asked behind the scenes is whether it took too long to spot the scale of the outbreak. One of the concerns about the test and trace system is how quickly data gets passed from the national team to local officials. The national team passes on plenty of cases - any complex cases involving care homes, schools and prisons are automatically transferred. But what local authorities are not getting quickly are comprehensive details about individuals who test positive. It means opportunities to spot trends and clusters early may be being lost. It is now clear cases in the city have been growing for a few weeks. That at least raises the concern that the outbreak has been acted on later than it should. If that is the case, it is important lessons are learned because it is highly likely there will be more flare-ups like this in the coming weeks and months. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's handling of the outbreak in Leicester had left local people ""anxious and confused"". The Leicester South MP said it was unclear what constituted ""essential"" travel and whether affected businesses would receive any financial support. Leicester West MP Liz Kendall criticised the government for being ""too slow"" to liaise with the city council, and added: ""Over [the] last few days there have been off the record briefings leaving people anxious and confused.""

""Where you have a background level of circulating virus plus a susceptible population - one that has never had this infection before - they're all sitting targets,"" he said. ""It is well overdue that we have local control for local outbreaks because going forward six or nine months we will have such outbreaks in Manchester, Birmingham, other big cities, so it's better to grease up and oil the machinery of local responsiveness.""

Kuenssberg: Lockdown shows virus risks not gone,"Right at the moment when the prime minister is planning to turn the page to usher in a different political phase, the reinstatement of some restrictions on people's lives in Leicester is a reminder that the risk to our health from the coronavirus crisis is neither gone, nor forgotten. Ministers have been clear for some weeks that the possibility of 'local lockdowns' was very real. And the announcement from the health secretary on Monday evening was not just to put the brakes on easing of elements of the lockdown, he has also reversed some of the changes that have already been made: closing non-essential shops again, and schools - aside from the children of key workers, or the vulnerable - restricted. It is not a small ask of the people of Leicester, a major city, to watch the rest of the country progress, while they have to go into reverse for now, to protect everyone's health. How will local lockdown rules be enforced?,external Lockdown tightened in Leicester over Covid surge How many confirmed cases are there in your area? But this kind of on, and off, measure may become a regular feature of how the government tries to manage the infection as the months pass. And there are already questions from opposition politicians about why speculation was allowed to build over the last few days about whether it was going to happen at all. Local leaders expressed significant frustration, too, at a lack of coordination and information sharing about exactly what was going on. On TuesdayBoris Johnson will make big promisesusing echoes of the past, the New Deal that took the United States out of the Great Depression, to try to show that the government has the imagination and the drive to move the country out of the worst phases of the pandemic. But just as he and the Cabinet are starting to focus on the risk of very widespread financial hardship, what's happening in Leicester makes it clear that the balance between managing public health and how the country makes its living is still precarious too.

And British Chamber of Commerce director-general Adam Marshall said the government's plans had to ""take shape on the ground swiftly to give a real confidence boost to businesses and communities"". For weeks ministers, including Mr Johnson, have been promising a bold green recovery package to create jobs whilst cutting carbon emissions. In the pre-released summary of his speech the prime minister did pledge to ""build back greener"" - but some environmentalists consider his response inadequate. The think tank Green Alliance, for instance,calculates that ministersneed to spend Â£14bn to meet CO2 targets. It says the government is spending Â£9bn on projects that actually harm the climate. Mr Johnson re-iterated a policy of planting 75,000 acres of forest a year and said he'd create new conservation rangers. But he didn't mention home insulation - the sector consistently judged best for cutting emissions and creating jobs. And there was no suggestion of scaling back the Â£27bn roads programme, which will increase emissions and is judged by the Trades Union Congress to be poor value for job creation.

Cineworld delays reopening of UK cinemas to 31 JulyThe cinema chain said it's pushed back the opening date to tie in with upcoming movie releases.Business,"Cineworld has pushed back the reopening of its UK and US cinemas to 31 July, blaming a delay in new film releases. The world's second-largest cinema chain had previously announced cinemas in both countries would open on 10 July. Cineworld said films including Mulan and Tenet had been delayed from July to August. The company said cinemas would open with new safety measures in place, but some staff say the measures do not go far enough. A petition signed by almost 1,500 people,externaland started by Cineworld staff has called for masks to be made mandatory for customers in cinema foyers. A leader of the Cineworld Action Group, who spoke to the BBC but did not want to give their name, said: ""Some studies have shown that masks do help to protect. We don't have a choice about returning to work. If it makes it safer for us and for other customers, I think it's a small ask. ""It's a luxury to come to the cinema but our lives shouldn't be treated as a luxury, it's important."" The BBC has asked Cineworld to comment on the staff demands. How and when will cinemas reopen in England? The cinema chain says new safety measures will include contactless payments and seating capacity limits in line with local regulations. Advice for all cinemas from the film trade body, the UK Cinema Association, advises cinema companies to sell a reduced number of tickets to each screening, with people from different households sitting apart. The association also says pick 'n' mix stands should be removed, and moviegoers should be encouraged to pre-order popcorn. Earlier this year, the coronavirus pandemic forced Cineworld to close its 787 cinemas in 10 countries, whilecompany bosses waived their salariesand bonuses. The UK-based firm also halted dividend payments to mitigate the impact on trading. Cineworld chief executive Mooky Greidinger said other films that will be released this summer include A Quiet Place Part II, The Broken Hearts Gallery, Bill & Ted Face the Music and Antebellum, as well as a re-release of Christopher Nolan's Inception on Imax.

Hopes for Â£950m Dragon Island tidal energy,"A council leader hopes the Welsh Government will back plans for a dragon-shaped island that could harness tidal energy within the next few weeks.

Ban on Wirecard's UK payments business lifted,"The UK's financial watchdog has lifted restrictions on German payments company Wirecard, allowing it to resume payment activities. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed restrictions on the company's UK arm after its collapse last week. Thousands of people could notaccess their money or make payments through apps as a result. ""Our primary objective all along has been to protect the interests and money of consumers,"" the FCA said. Customers should now, or very shortly, be able to use their cards as usual. Christopher Woolard, the FCA's interim chief executive, told the BBC's Today programme the FCA had ""imposed very strict conditions"" on Wirecard's UK subsidiary based in Newcastle, which had knock-on effects for about 70 payments firms. ""When we did that we were acutely conscious that there are some really vulnerable people who rely on those services for example to get benefits payments paid to them,"" he said. Mr Woolard said the FCA had spent the last few days making sure money belonging to people in the UK was now safeguarded in UK bank accounts with strict conditions. ""What that means is, if you've got either a card direct from Wirecard or from one of these 70-odd firms that relies upon them, those cards should start working today,"" he said. On Tuesday morning, Wirecard issued a statement saying some customers may find themselves unable to make transactions immediately, but the company anticipated the delay would last no longer than 24 hours. Several British technology companies were forced to suspend services due to the FCA restrictions, leaving thousands of accounts blocked. Online firm Pockit's payment cards, for example, were locked because they used a payment processing service owned by Wirecard. Dawn Guilfoyle worried that her frozen funds would mean no hot water Dawn Guilfoyle is one of thousands who were barred from using their cash cards because of the failure of huge German payments firm Wirecard. ""It's really bad. I'm left with nothing,"" she says. ""Once the gas goes off, I'll have none for cooking or hot water."" Ms Guilfoyle's card, from the online firm Pockit, was frozen because the FCA wanted to make sure the money is safe. Read more about her story here. The FCA said any customers who were still experiencing difficulties in using their card should contact their card provider directly. The action came after the German parent firm Wirecard last week disclosed a â¬1.9bn (Â£1.7bn) hole in its accounts, and subsequently filed for insolvency. Former boss Markus Braun has been arrested and accused of inflating Wirecard's finances to make them appear healthier to investors and customers. On Monday, the FCA said: ""There continue to be certain requirements in place, which have been imposed on Wirecard's authorisation. ""These requirements include restrictions over where it can hold customer monies and restrictions over its ability to transfer its own assets."" ""The FCA continues to work with the firm to progress these matters,"" it added. Mr Woolard told the Today programme: ""Obviously there's a separate story developing around Wirecard in Germany where there's a German bank regulated by our colleagues in Germany"". He said the FCA was closely monitoring Wirecard's UK operation, but it was not in the process of trying to find a new owner for the UK subsidiary. The FCA has restricted Wirecard from some operations such as initiating payments on customers' behalf. Wirecard said it planned to ""continue working closely with the FCA to have these remaining restrictions lifted as soon as possible"". Wirecard: 'Itâs really bad.

And British Chamber of Commerce director-general Adam Marshall said the government's plans had to ""take shape on the ground swiftly to give a real confidence boost to businesses and communities"". For weeks ministers, including Mr Johnson, have been promising a bold green recovery package to create jobs whilst cutting carbon emissions. In the pre-released summary of his speech the prime minister did pledge to ""build back greener"" - but some environmentalists consider his response inadequate. The think tank Green Alliance, for instance,calculates that ministersneed to spend Â£14bn to meet CO2 targets. It says the government is spending Â£9bn on projects that actually harm the climate. Mr Johnson re-iterated a policy of planting 75,000 acres of forest a year and said he'd create new conservation rangers. But he didn't mention home insulation - the sector consistently judged best for cutting emissions and creating jobs. And there was no suggestion of scaling back the Â£27bn roads programme, which will increase emissions and is judged by the Trades Union Congress to be poor value for job creation.

UK economic hit worse than first thought,"The UK economy shrank more than first thought between January and March, contracting 2.2% in the joint largest fall since 1979, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalrevised down its previous estimate of a 2% contraction, with all the main economic sectors dropping. There was a significant economic impact in March, as the coronavirus pandemic began to have an effect. The data comes as the prime minister set out a post-lockdown recovery plan. Boris Johnson said in a speech in Dudley, in the West Midlands, that there would be investment in infrastructure and schools. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""Our more detailed picture of the economy in the first quarter showed GDP shrank a little more than first estimated. ""Information from government showed health activities declined more than we previously showed. ""All main sectors of the economy shrank significantly in March as the effects of the pandemic hit."" The first-quarter contraction is now the joint biggest drop since the July-to-September period in 1979. What is GDP and why does it matter? PM pledges to 'build back better' post-virus Mr Athow said: ""The sharp fall in consumer spending at the end of March led to a notable increase in households' savings."" The new data showed that GDP contracted by 6.9% in March. The first-quarter figures show that the services sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of UK GDP - shrank by a record 2.3%. The ONS said production output fell by a revised 1.5% in the three months, driven by declines in manufacturing as factories temporarily shut down, while there was a fall in construction output of 1.7%. The coronavirus lockdown only came into force on 23 March, so figures for the second quarter of the year will show the full hit on the economy. Recent ONS monthly figuresshowed the economy plummeted by 20.4% in April- the largest drop in a single month since records began. That contraction was three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. It says something that the first quarter of the year was the worst for the economy in 41 years - and yet it was still barely a tenth the size of the contraction in activity in just one month - last April. The figures put the government's ""build build build"" announcement in perspective. The Â£5bn infrastructure spending being ""brought forward"" is not new money in any case. It was set aside in the pre-election manifesto at a time when the economy looked very different. Compare it, say, to the Â£69bn it's estimated that small businesses will lose in the pandemic because they've had to stop trading (according to research by small business insurers Simply Business). Or compare it to total public spending of more than Â£1,000bn, and it's less than 0.5%. Against the size of the economy based on the latest GDP numbers, the mooted infrastructure spend is more like 0.25%. The government's going to have to spend a lot more than that to stimulate a recovery from a slump on this scale. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest figures could be summed up in one line: ""The biggest contraction for 40 years, even though Q1 contained just nine lockdown days."" The data ""was just the prelude"", with worse to come, he added. However, while economists are braced for a dire set of second-quarter figures, Howard Archer, at the EY Item Club, believes April's sharp contraction is likely to have been the low point. He predicted the economy would ""return to clear growth in the third quarter with GDP expanding close to 10% quarter-on-quarter"" as lockdown restrictions are eased further. In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Johnson promised an ""infrastructure revolution"", arguing the government needed to ""work fast"" to support jobs whilst also seeking to ""level up"" the economy so that all parts of the country can benefit. He said the government would introduce ""the most radical reforms of our planning system since the end of the Second World War"" to speed up building and infrastructure projects where, he argued, the UK compares unfavourably with other European countries. As part of what he called a ""new deal"", the prime minister set out plans to accelerate Â£5bn of spending on infrastructure projects. Meanwhile,separate ONS data on the nation's finances,externalshowed that Britain's current account deficit widened by more than expected in the first quarter. The balance of payments deficit - the difference between the value of the goods and services that a country imports and the goods and services it exports - rose to Â£21.1bn, or 3.8% of GDP. This means the UK is reliant on inflows of cash from abroad and leaves the pound vulnerable, according to Mr Tombs. ""Sterling almost certainly would depreciate sharply again if a major second wave of Covid-19 emerges or if the UK and EU fail to either sign a trade deal or to extend the transition period before the end of this year,"" he said.

"Serial rapist freed by 'unstable' probation teamA report finds Joseph McCann was ""managed by an unstable team"", lacking experienced staff.England","Joseph McCann was found guilty of 37 offences against 11 victims A serial rapist was able to carry out a sex attack spree when he was freed from prison after ""major failings"" by a team of ""unstable"" and inexperienced probation staff, inspectors have found. Joseph McCann was given33 life sentencesin December for attacks on 11 women and children. So far only one person has since been demoted, the report said. One of McCann's victims called the probation service's actions ""shambolic and chaotic"". The 34-year-old convicted burglar had been freed after a probation service error at the start of 2019. The independent review headed up by Chief Inspector of Probation Justin Russell said this happened despite there being signs he posed a risk to the public and could commit sexual offences. McCann saw 10 staff over 11 years, with three different probation officers responsible for his case in the months leading up to his prison release. Two months after he left prison, over the course of 15 days last spring, he abducted, raped and assaulted victims aged between 11 and 71 in Watford, London, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire. He had been seen by probation officers 10 times in those two months, the final time in April just days before he carried out the first rape. This video can not be played Footage shows dramatic Joseph McCann police chase A jury found McCann guilty of 37 charges relating to 11 victims, including eight rapes, false imprisonment and kidnap. An internal review published by the Ministry of Justice in March laid bare the errors made in the case, including repeated failures to recall him to prison despite officials warning of the risks he posed. In the first of two reports from his review, Mr Russell said: ""McCann was managed by an unstable team, lacking experienced and skilled practitioners. ""They suffered from poor management oversight, high workloads, poor performance and high staff turnover. ""There were signs that he posed an increasing risk to the public. There was evidence of his potential for sexual offending."" This video can not be played Elderly victim of serial rapist Joseph McCann tells of her ordeal Crucial information, recorded on different systems by various authorities, was ""lost"" in handovers between staff, Mr Russell added. But ""most worryingly"", the report said, prison staff did not share information about the risk posed by McCann with probation, meaning probation staff did ""not have a clear picture"" of who they were dealing with and were making decisions based on inadequate assessments. The report found McCann had, in his initial time in jail, been regarded as posing a ""high risk of serious harm to family members"", having sent letters including threats of sexual violence to relatives. He had also sent a threatening letter containing a sexual reference to his probation service offender manager, causing his case to be handed to another worker. But decisions on whether to release McCann were ""too focused"" on whether he would carry out more burglaries, the report said, despite warnings as early as 2011 that he had the hallmarks of a sex offender, and were ""not based on an analysis of his patterns of behaviour"". McCann was filmed on CCTV at a Watford hotel where he had booked a room for two nights Another ""key element"" of planning for such a high risk offender to leave prison was making sure he had suitable accommodation. He should have been given a bed in a bail hostel, known as approved premises, where he could be monitored by probation after being freed. But after probation officers twice ""tried, and failed"" to get him a space he was instead allowed to live with family where he could not be monitored closely, Mr Russell said. Among 13 recommendations made to the Prison and Probation Service and the National Probation Service, Mr Russell called for more beds at approved premises. This report has echoes of the mistakes made with ""black cab rapist"" John Worboys, who was cleared for release from prison after a parole panel failed properly to assess his long history of sexual offending. In Joseph McCann's case, probation officers and other specialists didn't fully analyse his record in jail (at one stage he'd made a ""serious"" attempt to escape) nor did they spot that his ""core attitudes"" hadn't changed even though he'd completed offending behaviour programmes - the description ""manipulative"" appears in the report five times. The decision that McCann could be freed - made in 2017, the same year Worboys was recommended for release - came amid huge political pressure to monitor indeterminate sentence prisoners in the community rather than in custody. The report says the influence of this strategy was ""evident"" in the failure to send McCann back to jail. Worboys' release was eventually blocked by the High Court. McCann, however, was not stopped until it was far too late. This is a report that cannot be allowed to gather dust. Alan Collins, one of the lawyers representing McCann's victims, said the report made ""distressing reading"" and called for dangerous offenders to be ""red flagged"" across the justice system to make sure such failings never happened again. One of the victims said in a statement: ""The words shambolic and chaotic spring to mind to describe the practices of the Probation Service. ""It is obvious that McCann should have been in prison and not at liberty to commit the horrendous crimes that have changed forever the lives of eleven victims and their families."" Former victims commissioner Baroness Newlove described the report as ""laughable"", saying the system needed ""overhauling and investing in"". ""For these victims, I just feel so sorry for them because the system, the government, the funding, has completely let the public down,"" she said. Girl raped by serial sex attacker 'feels failed' The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison 'I watched as net closed in on serial rapist' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""These were horrendous crimes and we have apologised to the victims for the unacceptable failings in this case. ""We have greatly improved information sharing between prisons and probation officers and all probation staff have received new, mandatory training on when offenders should be recalled.""

"Back-to-school safety plans for autumn in England leakedWhole school years will be in separate ""bubbles"" when pupils go back in September, say leaked plans.Family & EducationComments","Pupils will face the front, but the safety plans will not be based on social distancing The return-to-school plans for autumn in England will involve entire year groups staying in separate ""bubbles"". A draft of the plans, set to be announced later this week, has beenpublished by the Huffington Post,external. It means that groups of up to 240 pupils could be kept apart within a school, with a separate time for starting and finishing. It could also mean they would all be sent home if there was a Covid-19 case in the group. There will also be a recognition of the need for pupils to catch up after months out of regular lessons, with an emphasis on core subjects such as English and maths. The plans, understood to be draft documents shared as part of a consultation, show the approach to safety in the autumn is an expansion of the ""protective bubble"" approach already used. Penalty fines for missing school next term All pupils back in school full-time in September Â£1bn catch-up tutoring plan for autumn 2 metre distancing would mean schools part-time Rather than relying on social distancing, the aim is to limit the points at which the infection could be spread, by keeping pupils in separate, isolated groups through the school day, with their own breaks and lunchtimes. In primary schools this term, these bubbles have been up to 15 pupils, but in the plans for the autumn they could include a full secondary year group, which if there were eight classes, could be 240 pupils. In primary schools in the autumn, the bubbles are expected to be a whole class of 30 pupils. In secondary school entire year groups could be kept apart in the protective ""bubble"" system If a pupil shows coronavirus symptoms, parents will have to quickly come to collect their child. ""While waiting, the child should be kept 2m away from the supervising teacher,"" says the leaked guidance. ""If that is not possible, in the case of a young child or one with complex needs, staff should wear full PPE - disposable gloves, a disposable apron, a fluid-resistant surgical face mask and in some cases eye goggles."" There will not be any fixed social distancing requirements for pupils in primary school - and in secondary it will be 1m, but only where possible, the leaked documents suggest. But teachers will be expected to maintain social distancing at the front of a class - in classrooms in which pupils will face forward, rather than facing each other around circular tables. On Monday, the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson promised a comprehensive track and trace system would be in place for autumn. That would allow year groups or schools to be closed down if there were Covid-19 cases, or if there were signs of a local upsurge infections. There will be routines of regular hand-washing, but there are not expected to be temperature checks or masks, either for staff or pupils. Pupils will be encouraged to get back on track with their learning when schools return for full-time lessons. Attendance will be compulsory - with confirmation on Monday that penalty fines can once again be issued to parents who do not send their children back to school, at the usual level of Â£60 and then Â£120 for late payment. And there will be a push on helping children to catch up in English and maths, which could include narrowing options in GCSE subjects and repeating work from before the lockdown. An increase in disruptive behaviour is anticipated - but it is expected that Ofsted will not be carrying out routine inspections during the term. In response to the leaked documents, a Department for Education spokesman said there would be continuing consultation, ahead of the full plans being published this week.

"100 days of lockdown: How life changed in a UK townWhat's lockdown been like for personal trainer, a student, a rapper and a semi-pro footballer?","""Never known anything like it in my lifetime."" That's a line we'll all have heard in the 100 days since Boris Johnson announced the coronavirus lockdown on 23 March. Normally it'd be something your nan might say. For Telford in Shropshire, it's true of an entire town. Throughout the last 100 days, Radio 1 Newsbeat has been in touch with people in Telford about how lockdown has changed them and their lives. There's the local footballer who has no idea what will happen to his career, the personal trainer who had to change her business overnight and the rapper who thought 2020 would be his best yet. Telford has only existed since the late 1960s - built then to offer new housing to people from much busier cities. After 50 years, it's still called ""a new town"". ""It's got a perfect blend of rural and urban,"" 18-year-old Molly Morgan tells us about her hometown. ""It's a great place to grow up."" ""I've grown up here, my family's here, my future's here,"" adds personal trainer Esther Williams. ""It's got a great community. When I was younger, I'd have gone to Birmingham or Wolverhampton for the day but now there's so much to do in Telford."" Telford was a far more ambitious project than other new towns of the era, like Stevenage and Crawley. The aim was for 225,000 people to live there by 1991. In 2020 there are around 155,000. The town is cut down the middle by the motorway linking Shropshire with the Black Country. Famous brands including Hitachi take sites on the industrial Stafford Park to the east, with the world famous Iron Bridge, arching over the River Severn, a couple of miles to the south. This was the first major bridge in the world made of cast iron when it opened in 1781 The idea for Telford was to bring smaller towns, like Dawley and Lawley, together into one community. ""It's got a magnificent situation overlooking Shropshireâ¦ I think it's got the makings of a very fine town indeed,"" were the words of Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, former City Architect of Birmingham, who helped with the plans. ""Once an attractive town is built there - industry will go,"" he said. In lockdown, Telford is a community facing some of its biggest challenges - and the people we've been talking to spoke about challenges that will feel very familiar. In many of the stories you hear, it's the mood of uncertainty which keeps coming up. Esther's personal training firm, Ruthless, takes up a small corrugated unit on the sprawling industrial estate of Hortonwood, where both Epson and Heinz have bases. She only started her business in 2018 and its whole model was transformed overnight on 23 March when the prime minister addressed the country and told us that all non-essential businesses, including gyms, must close. Esther's been paying full rent on the unit during lockdown and is still waiting for the government to say she can re-open. In the meantime, her focus is online sessions and small exercise classes in the park. ""The work I'm doing is great, and I'm so grateful for that, but it's not quite enough to be able to keep paying the rent there."" Like so many people, Esther's working life was transformed by coronavirus During that first week of lockdown, Esther told her clients on Facebook: ""We will be back. We will be stronger. We will be unstoppable."" Looking back now, she adds: ""I've never done online so I was quite nervous. I went to Zoom having never used Zoom before. ""For me, it was completely different. It was daunting to begin with but I'm so glad I did."" You can't help but notice Esther says ""so grateful"" and ""so glad"" a lot. She acknowledges others businesses have not had her flexibility. Esther's husband lost his job in sales but couldn't get furlough as he'd only been with his company a short time. ""He's just starting now to get interviews. The stress of trying to find a job - even a temporary job - they just go so quick. Things are getting better now. I'm just lucky I can work now and things are starting to move."" From Esther's unit to one of the town's focal points - the New Bucks Head, home to non-league AFC Telford United - is just a seven-minute drive. For the sixth tier of English football, it's impressive. A 6,000-capacity stadium would surely be one of the bigger days out in the National League North. Guiseley AFC and Curzon Ashton are typical visitors. AFC Telford United take on their famous neighbours Wolverhampton Wanderers in a friendly match AFC Telford United typically get a thousand people turning up to home games but there's been nobody through the turnstiles since Kettering Town on 14 March - and without any income from tickets, the club's faced desperate measures. On a Go Fund Me page seeking donations, a message reads: ""All of our income streams have dramatically reduced to virtually zero for several weeks now and it's almost certain as a business it will take some time to recover."" Midfielder Adam Walker says the months without football have been tough on the players too. They said goodbye to each other after a fairly regular match - minus the handshakes - expecting to see each other again later in the same week. ""And that never happened. So it's been a big gap in everyone's lives really."" Adam says coronavirus started to feel real when they were no longer allowed to shake hands with opposing players Adam has become something of an unofficial spokesman for the players. He says some are having to look at a career change. ""There's a very dark mist overhead still until this is resolved. There's massive uncertainty on how many clubs will be able to survive."" He points to the potential impact that could have on this community. ""A club like Telford have always had a very good side and a lovely stadium. You take that away from the community and there'd be a massive hole there."" Without the guarantees of gate receipts, the club's been helping its players find other work, such as coaching. Adam says there has been a massive hole in the life of Telford United's players ""The gaffer's tried to help players at the end of their career or maybe the younger ones who don't know yet whether they'll get paid for football and they might have young families. ""It's showing them how to be employable because a lot of people will be looking for jobs in this period. ""It's to try to help people have an income and still play football."" There has been football on the Bucks Head site for a century, but the area's not had the biggest live music scene recently. ""Telford has had a shortage of actual live music venues. One of the main ones closed down a few years ago,"" says Tim Rogers - a financial services worker by day, who takes off the suit and tie to become rapper Trademark Blud out of office hours. Trademark Blud was expecting to play at a few festivals this summer This year felt like a moment of change - with a new 300-capacity venue opening in the town's Southwater Square. It's easy to imagine Southwater Square without ever visiting. Cineworld, Nando's, TGi Fridays, all built in the last few years - all designed to give people in Telford a new option for a night out. Tim thought the new venue was going to be a big moment for the local live scene - with the prospect of international names coming to Telford. ""It's terrible. The most important thing is being able to deliver what you've produced to people and see their reactions and let them enjoy in the way you hope they will."" One of V Festival's two sites was a few miles from Telford until 2017, when the festival was discontinued. Here's Amy Winehouse performing there in 2008 He sounds undeniably flat talking about his music. He's been doing shows online but ""they're not the same"". ""It's not even 50% - especially with rap and hip-hop as it's super energetic."" To top it off, he had festival bookings for Boomtown and B-Side festival in 2020, which obviously won't be happening. Outside of music though Tim says he's feeling ""much more comfortable"" about the pandemic - his fears of picking it up have reduced and he's settled into working at home. Covid came closer than he'd like though - a child in his son's class lost his father after he contracted the virus. Molly's university plans have changed due to Covid-19 For 18-year-old Molly, the latest lockdown easing is a bit of good news - she's got her friend's 18th birthday the week whennew measurescome into effect, so they'll get a celebration. Beyond that, Molly's future will probably be closer to Telford than she'd been planning. She should have just finished her A-Levels. But of course she never actually sat them and has tweaked her uni choices because she didn't get to finish her open day tours. Now, she's looking at PPE (not that one, she jokes, after pulling her own face covering down) in Liverpool or Birmingham. This PPE is politics, philosophy and economics. ""I'd have been more open to going further away but without the chance to visit, I was apprehensive to go somewhere without seeing the city. I'd have been a bit more adventurous."" Molly says she's nervous about the prospect of her first year at university being mostly online learning. ""I don't want to stay in my room essentially for the whole yearâ¦ I'm not sure that's right for me. I've toyed with delaying for a year to get the proper uni experience."" Trademark Blud's sound might be a bit different in the coming months... Molly will know more when the results come in August, Adam's keeping the training going waiting for news on the new season. Esther hopes her unit will be open for classes after the next wave of government announcements. And rapper Trademark Blud? He's eyeing up a plan B. ""Some of my friends are acoustic guitarists and they might get back and start gigging again. It's maybe difficult for my genre - it's more of a live venue, nightclub, big stage kind of thing. ""I'm thinking of working with some guitarists and going to do the local pubs. I don't think they'll appreciate me jumping around and jumping off the tables at six o'clock. We'll have to tone it down I think."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

It is now 100 days since Covid-19 forced Scotland into an unprecedented lockdown. Since then the virus has touched everything and changed everything. BBC Scotland looks back on some of thekey developments during a remarkable three months here. Below are some of the people who have lost their lives to Covid-19. Read about them here. Only essential visitors have been allowed into hospitals during the coronavirus crisis A study has suggested between 7,000 and 40,000 people could have died from coronavirus in Scotland if the country had not gone into lockdown. Scientists have tried to estimate would have happened if Scotland had copied theapproach taken in Sweden, where a lockdown was not imposed. Rowland Kao, a professor of epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University, led the team which carried out the research for BBC Scotland. He said: ""An obvious question to ask is if Scotland had done something similar to Sweden, would we have had a similar outcome without all the restrictions."" Read more here. Allow Twitter content?

A leading figure in Scottish tourism has warned against
Scotland and England taking different approaches to travel, as lockdown
measures are eased. Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism
Alliance, was responding to hints that theScottish government could treatairport arrivals differently, and even block travellers coming north across the
border. He said 70% of Scotland's tourism depends on the UK market
and that any restrictions on domestic travel would have a significantly
negative impact on the sector. Mr Crothall said tourism firms had told him about enquiries
from English people who have become concerned about a potential quarantine, and
have asked for a guarantee of a full refund should that come into force. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Rats have been thriving more than ever in urban areas during lockdown. ""There has been more rubbish building up in residential areas,"" says Brian O'Donnell, a rat catcher at
Graham Pest Control. ""Rats can live in various areas. Once they find a food source they will never venture too far away. Cutting back trees and hedgerows, putting waste in the bins properly can help. ""They are not dangerous. Rats are more scared of us than we are of them. They can carry disease, so we would never recommend picking a dead one up."" NHS Tayside has taken
delivery of thousands of reusable face coverings, which were produced for staff as
part of a local scrubs initiative. The collaborative project between NHS Tayside, local
industry, Dundee University, and community volunteers saw 5,000 sets of scrubs produced for frontline staff, with 1,000 of these being
made by volunteers from the local community. Once the scrubs target had been reached, the volunteer
sewers turned their focus to face coverings, making about 10,000
reusable masks for staff across Tayside to use when in public spaces. Officers made more than 53,000 interventions between 27 March and 17 June, the Scottish Police Authority hears. The rule is still only essential travel over 5 miles until Friday From Friday 3 July, the rule which currently restricts people to travelling no more than five miles for leisure or recreation is expected to be relaxed. The use of self-contained holiday accommodation - such as cottages, lodges and caravans with no shared services - will also be allowed from that date, along with second homes. Find out moreindicative dates for further measures to ease the lockdown here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland CalMac ferries' website crashed this morning as it opened up for bookings following the lockdown and it is not the only business to be overwhelmed by the public's thirst for holidays and entertainment. Aberdeen hotel manager Stephen Gow tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""We took somewhere over 1,000 bookings in the first hour of going live at 12 noon yesterday. Exciting times."" Mr Gow has created two new outdoor areas, utilising car parks, and says ""people are desperate to get back out gain and have lots of celebrations they want to catch up with"". Glasgow's Brel venue has a new outdoor area Glasgow pub and eatery owner Oli Norman says reports that his drive-in movie event took 4,000 bookings in the first hour. ""We open our bookings live for Brel tomorrow at 12 and we're pretty confident,"" he says. ""We've had about 150 enquiries per day for bookings. ""So many businesses are going to the wall and we're determined we're not going to be one of them. Weather is a challenge, but people are happy to sit outside in a cagoule and enjoy a pint."" Scotland and the UK have nowbeen in lockdown for 100 daysas part of efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. Nicola Sturgeon today warnedtough and unpopular decisions may still need to be takento prevent a resurgence of coronavirus in Scotland. However the first minister said there has been ""massive and very welcome progress"" since lockdown began. Nicola Sturgeon led the briefing as ever Here's the other key points from today's Scottish government coronavirus briefing: Ms Sturgeon is still taking advice on whether to follow the UK government in relaxing the 2m distancing rul Tough and unpopular decisions may still need to be taken to prevent a resurgence of coronavirus in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has warned. The first minister said there had been a ""sustained and significant"" reduction in cases and deaths from the virus. But she said there was still a risk of people letting down their guard and allowing the virus to spread again. Ms Sturgeon is to announce on Thursday whether the 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule is to be relaxed. Read more here. Sarah SmithScotland Editor Nicola Sturgeon says she has no plans, right now, tointroduce a quarantine periodfor visitors coming into Scotland from other parts of the UK. But by saying she is also ""not ruling anything out"", the first minister has ignited another heated constitutional debate. Ms Sturgeon says we are not dealing with politics at the moment, but with a virus that doesn't respect borders or boundaries. ""Anyone who is trotting out political or constitutional arguments is in the wrong place,"" she says. But the first minister was obviously well aware that even mentioning such an idea would cause a huge political controversy. The Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, has said the virus ""should not be used as an issue to drive a wedge between Scotland and England"". The suggestion of a quarantine was not the idea of impatient pro-independence campaigners, but was first raised by one of the most eminent public health experts in the country, Professor Devi Sridhar, who is also an advisor to the first minister. As experts now predict that Scotlandcould be on course to eliminate (not eradicate) the virus by the end of the summer, questions are being asked about whether Boris Johnson is aiming at a policy of elimination for England - or if the UK government is content to allow Covid-19 to continue to circulate at a higher level as long as it does not threaten to overwhelm the NHS.

On the prime minister's speech this morning, in which headvocated the UK ""bouncing back better"" from coronavirus,the first minister said she was ""to put it mildly, extremely underwhelmed"" by Boris Johnson's plans. ""This is not new money - this is simply shuffling around money that was in the system"", the FM said. She added that her expectation was that there would be no additional Barnett consequentials coming to Holyrood as a result of the package announced by the PM this morning. Instead, she said, there may be a ""re-profiling"" of what they were already expecting. ""I don't think that's commensurate with the scale of the challenge we face"", Ms Sturgeon added. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says Britain must 'build, build, build' Boris Johnson has said now is the time to be ""ambitious"" about the UK's future, as he set out a post-coronavirus recovery plan. The PM vowed to ""use this moment"" to fix longstanding economic problems and promised a Â£5bn ""new deal"" to build homes and infrastructure. Plans set out in the Tory election manifesto would be speeded up and ""intensified,"" he added. Labour and the CBI said he was not focusing enough on saving jobs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""not much of a deal and not much that's new"". It came asnew figures showed the UK economyshrank faster than at any time since 1979 between January and March. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland has had 100 days of lockdown and Drivetime will be discussing First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's assertion that the country has made ""massive progress"" in tackling the virus and her warning about not becoming complacent. The programme, which is starting at 16:00 BST, also delves into the Prime Minister's announcement of an infrastructure plan to combat the looming economic crisis and considers what it means for Scotland. Boris Johnson has had to impose the first full local lockdown since measures were eased in England and host John Beattie will have the latest from Leicester. Meanwhile, the programme will be finding out why rodents are on the rise during the pandemic. Only essential visitors have been allowed into hospitals during the coronavirus crisis Hospitals in Scotland will be able to accept visitors again from 13 July, thehealth secretary has announced,external. Jeane Freeman said patients in non-Covid areas will be able to have a visit from one named visitor. The visits must be agreed in advance with the ward where the patient is being treated. Strict social-distancing and hygiene measures will be in place to limit the risk of transmitting the virus. Read more here.,external Mornings with Kaye AdamsBBC Radio Scotland A view of Iceland's capital Reykjavik Iceland has been a success story in dealing with Covid-19, with
fewer than 2,000 cases and just 10 deaths. A rapid response and widespread testing was key in getting the
virus under control early, with more than 60,000 people checked from a
population of just over 360,000. Social distancing remains in place, while life for most Icelanders is pretty much back to normal after a period of reduced working hours. There are very few foreign visitors at the moment but all arrivals are
tested at the airport and instructed to isolate until their results are known -
usually on the same day. This initiative was initially free but there is now a
fee of around Â£40. Dr Poppy Lamberton, a global health specialist at Glasgow
University, told Radio Scotland testing started on arrivals from overseas on 24 January,
saying that the UK ""missed an opportunity"" to implement something similar. She also stressed that Iceland did a good job of shielding care homes, while the population was markedly fitter than the UK, with fewer problems with underlying health
conditions. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"PM pledges to 'build back better' post-virusBoris Johnson will set out plans to ""bring forward"" Â£5bn of project investment as part of a ""new deal"".","Boris Johnson is unveiling government plans to soften the economic impact of coronavirus with a promise to ""build build build"". Speaking in the West Midlands, the prime minister will say he wants to use the coronavirus crisis ""to tackle this country's great unresolved challenges"". As part of a ""new deal"", Mr Johnson is setting out plans to accelerate Â£5bn on infrastructure projects. Labour has called for a ""laser-like focus"" on preventing job losses. The prime minister's speech comesas BBC analysis foundthat the UK was the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations by the virus in the weeks leading up to early June. In April, the UK economy shrunk by a record 20.4% as a result of the spread of coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown measures. What a shrinking economy means in one town Where do governments go when they need money? UK 'on knife edge' ahead of lockdown easing Aiming to emulate the New Deal policies of the depression-era American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mr Johnson will say he wants a government that ""puts its arms around people at a time of crisis"". In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, President Roosevelt launched one of the largest, most expensive US government programmes which included building schools, hospitals and dams. In a bid to boost the country's financial outlook, Mr Johnson is pledging to put jobs and infrastructure at the centre of the government's economic growth with a commitment to ""build, build, build"". Unemployed men queuing for food in depression-era America - the crisis that prompted President Roosevelt's New Deal Mr Johnson will say he wants to use the coronavirus crisis as an opportunity to ""to build the homes, to fix the NHS, to tackle the skills crisis, to mend the indefensible gap in opportunity and productivity and connectivity between the regions of the UK"". ""Too many parts of this country have felt left behind, neglected, unloved, as though someone had taken a strategic decision that their fate did not matter as much as the metropolis. ""And so I want you to know that this government not only has a vision to change this country for the better, we have a mission to unite and level up."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers Projects in the Â£5bn investment plan include: Â£1.5bn for hospital maintenance, eradicating mental health dormitories, enabling hospital building and improving A&E capacity Â£100m for 29 road network projects including bridge repairs in Sandwell and improving the A15 in the Humber region Â£900m for ""shovel ready"" local projects in England this year and in 2021 Â£500,000 - Â£1m for each areain the towns fundto spend on improvements to parks, high street and transport Over Â£1bn to fund a schools building project,as announced on Monday Â£83m for maintenance of prisons and youth offender facilities, and Â£60m for temporary prison places. The government says it will bring forward funding to ""accelerate"" infrastructure projects in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the PM's plans fell ""woefully short"" of an economic recovery package recently announced in Germany. ""I also suspect there will be less to it than meets the eye in terms of genuinely new money,"" shetweeted,external. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will provide an update on the economy next week, and in the autumn the government will publish a National Infrastructure Strategy. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the focus should be on ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" Earlier, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told BBC Breakfast Labour supported investment, but a ""strong laser-like focus on unemployment"" was needed. She urged the government to abandon a ""one-size fits all approach"" to economic support, calling for measures ""more focused"" on individual sectors. She added that spending to improve prisons and courts had been promised ""quite some time ago,"" adding: ""What the prime minister is talking about appears to be mainly spending that's already been committed to"". Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman and party leadership contender Layla Moran said Mr Johnson's plans looked like ""a rehash of manifesto pledges"" and accused the government of ""running out of ideas"". The prime minister has promised to ""level up"" communities across the UK Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chairman Mike Cherry said the announcement was ""encouraging"" but said it was important that small businesses were not ""locked out of the ambition to build... because of cumbersome public sector procurement rules"". And British Chamber of Commerce director-general Adam Marshall said the government's plans had to ""take shape on the ground swiftly to give a real confidence boost to businesses and communities"". For weeks ministers, including Mr Johnson, have been promising a bold green recovery package to create jobs whilst cutting carbon emissions. In the pre-released summary of his speech the prime minister did pledge to ""build back greener"" - but some environmentalists consider his response inadequate. The think tank Green Alliance, for instance,calculates that ministersneed to spend Â£14bn to meet CO2 targets. It says the government is spending Â£9bn on projects that actually harm the climate. Mr Johnson re-iterated a policy of planting 75,000 acres of forest a year and said he'd create new conservation rangers. But he didn't mention home insulation - the sector consistently judged best for cutting emissions and creating jobs. And there was no suggestion of scaling back the Â£27bn roads programme, which will increase emissions and is judged by the Trades Union Congress to be poor value for job creation.

"Facebook defends push against 'false news'Facebook's boss in Northern Europe says a new media literacy campaign is not about ""financial considerations"".","Facebook's new media literacy campaign will ask users questions about what they see online Facebook is launching a campaign to help people spot fake news amid a growing advertising boycott putting pressure on the company to tackle misinformation and hate speech. Steve Hatch, Facebook's vice president for Northern Europe, says the media literacy campaign launched with fact-checkers FullFact is evidence that the company is ""listening and adapting"". But some experts and critics argue the effort across the UK, Europe, Africa and the Middle East is ""too little, too late"". The campaign will direct people to the websiteStampOutFalseNews.com,externaland ask users key questions about what they see online: ""Where's it from?"" ""What's missing?"" and ""How did you feel?"" Seven ways to stop fake news from going viral In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Hatch says ""financial considerations"" are not behind the new ads. In recent days, more than 150 companies - including Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Unilever - have announced temporary halts to advertising buys on Facebook as a result of the #StopHateForProfit campaign. Could a boycott kill Facebook? Facebook's Steve Hatch says the company is working to stop coronavirus fakes Misinformation or viral ""fake news"" has been a persistent issue for years on the social network, and it flared up dramatically after the emergence of Covid-19. In May, aBBC investigationfound links between coronavirus misinformation and assaults, arsons and deaths, with potential - and potentially much greater - indirect harm caused by rumours, conspiracy theories and bad health advice. The human cost of virus misinformation The (almost) complete history of 'fake news' Mr Hatch says Facebook employees have working ""night and day"" to tackle false claims during the pandemic. ""If people were sharing information that could cause real-world harm, we will take that down. We've done that in hundreds of thousands of cases,"" he says. But the media literacy effort is ""too little too late"" says Chloe Colliver, head of the digital research unit at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an anti-extremism think tank. ""We've seen Facebook try to take reactive and often quite small steps to stem the tide of disinformation on the platform,"" Ms Colliver says. ""But they haven't been able to proactively produce policies that help prevent users from seeing disinformation, false identities, false accounts, and false popularity on their platforms."" Facebook also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook and other social media companies have also come under pressure over misleading information or comments that could arguably incite violence, in particular posts by US President Donald Trump. Following widespread protests after the death of George Floyd, the President warned: ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The post was hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"", but remained on Facebook. Mr Hatch says that the US president's posts ""come under a high level of scrutiny"" by Facebook bosses. Echoing earlier comments by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, he denied that the comment in question broke Facebook's rules, and stated that the company interpreted it as a reference to the possible use of National Guard troops. ""Whether you're a political figure or anyone on the platform,"" Mr Hatch says, you will be reprimanded for sharing posts that could cause real-world harm.

China 'using birth control' to suppress Uighurs,"A file photo shows a Uighur woman with children in China's northwest Xinjiang region China is forcing women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices in Xinjiang in an apparent attempt to limit the population of Muslim Uighurs, according to new research. The report, by China scholar Adrian Zenz, has prompted international calls for the United Nations to investigate. China denies the allegations in the report, calling them ""baseless"". The state is already facing widespread criticism for holding Uighurs in detention camps. It is believed about one million Uighur people have been detained over the past few years in what what the Chinese state defines as ""re-education"" camps. China previously denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism, following separatist violence in the Xinjiang region. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on China to ""immediately end these horrific practices"". In a statement,external, he urged ""all nations to join the United States in demanding an end to these dehumanizing abuses"". China has faced mounting global scrutiny over its treatment of Uighurs in recent years. An investigation by the BBC in 2019 suggested that children in Xinjiang were being systematically separated from their families in an effort to isolate them from their Muslim communities. Mr Zenz's report was based on a combination of official regional data, policy documents and interviews with ethnic minority women in Xinjiang. It alleges that Uighur women and other ethnic minorities are being threatened with internment in the camps for refusing to abort pregnancies that exceed birth quotas. Uighur women have faced a ""ruthless"" birth control programme, the author of the report said The report also says that,externalUighur women with more than the legally permitted number of children - but also many women who had not exceeded birth quotas - were involuntarily fitted with intra-uterine devices (IUDs), while others were coerced into receiving sterilisation surgery. ""Since a sweeping crackdown starting in late 2016 transformed Xinjiang into a draconian police state, witness accounts of intrusive state interference into reproductive autonomy have become ubiquitous,"" the report says. According to Mr Zenz's analysis of the data, natural population growth in Xinjiang has declined dramatically in recent years, with growth rates falling by 84% in the two largest Uighur prefectures between 2015 and 2018 and declining further in 2019. ""This kind of drop is unprecedented, there's a ruthlessness to it,"" Mr Zenz told the Associated Press. ""This is part of a wider control campaign to subjugate the Uighurs."" Former detainees in internment camps in Xinjiang said they were given injections that stopped their periods, or caused unusual bleeding consistent with the effects of birth control drugs. ""Overall, it is likely that Xinjiang authorities are engaging in the mass sterilization of women with three or more children,"" the report said. In a statement on Monday, the Interparliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), an international cross-party group of politicians including Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, and US senator Marco Rubio, called on the UN to ""establish an international, impartial, independent investigation into the situation in the Xinjiang region"". ""A body of mounting evidence now exists, alleging mass incarceration, indoctrination, extrajudicial detention, invasive surveillance, forced labor, and the destruction of Uyghur cultural sites, including cemeteries, together with other forms of abuse,"" the statement said. ""The world cannot remain silent in the face of unfolding atrocities. Our countries are bound by solemn obligations to prevent and punish any effort to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group 'in whole or in part'."" The long read: China's hidden camps Explainer: China's Muslim 'crackdown' Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China denies Muslim children separation campaign According to a report by the Associated Press published on Monday, women in Xinjiang have faced exorbitant fines and threats of internment for breaching childbearing limits. Gulnar Omirzakh, a Chinese-born Kazakh, was ordered to get an IUD inserted after having her third child, the AP reported. Two years later, in January 2018, four officials in military camouflage knocked at her door anyway and handed Omirzakh, the penniless wife of a detained vegetable trader, three days to pay a 17,5000 RMB (Â£2,000) fine for having more than two children. She was reportedly warned that she would join her husband in an internment camp if she refused to pay. ""God bequeaths children on you. To prevent people from having children is wrong,"" Omirzakh told the AP. ""They want to destroy us as a people."" This video can not be played The BBC meets Uighur parents who say their children are missing in China Responding to the report on Monday, China's foreign ministry said the allegations were ""baseless"" and showed ""ulterior motives"". Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused media outlets of ""cooking up false information on Xinjiang-related issues"". For decades, under China's one-child policy, urban minorities were instead allowed two children, or three for rural families. A 2017 policy change, under President Xi Jinping, removed the ethnic distinction, permitting Han Chinese to have the same number of children as minorities, while preserving the urban-rural distinction. But according to the AP, Han Chinese have been largely spared the abortions, sterilisations, IUD insertions and detentions implemented against minority populations, including the Uighurs. Mr Zenz's report characterises the alleged campaign of coercive birth control in Xinjiang as part of a ""demographic campaign of genocide"" against the Uighurs. ""These findings provide the strongest evidence yet that Beijing's policies in Xinjiang meet one of the genocide criteria cited in the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,"" he writes.

"Breaking|Breaking newsChina passes controversial Hong Kong security lawChina passes a security law for Hong Kong, deepening fears for the city's freedoms, local media report.China","Protests rocked Hong Kong last year, sparked by a bill intended to enable extraditions to the mainland China has formally adopted a controversial security law, giving it new powers over Hong Kong and deepening fears for its freedoms. It is set to criminalise secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, but will also effectively curtail protests and freedom of speech. The move follows increasing unrest and a widening pro-democracy movement. Pro-democracy organisation Demosisto reacted to the news byannouncing it was ceasing all operations,external. Earlier Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, said he was leaving the group, which he had spearheaded. But some other veteran activists have said they will join a key march on Wednesday, despite the risk of arrest under the new law. Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit China's state news agency, Xinhua, confirmed that President Xi Jinping had now signed the security law. It has been added to Hong Kong's Basic Law, the 50-year mini-constitution agreed when the territory's sovereignty was returned to China by the UK in 1997. Its terms are not yet clear, meaning residents still do not know the measures they will have to abide by. The law could be implemented as early as Wednesday. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab expressed ""deep concern"" at the reports the law had been passed, saying: ""This would be a grave step."" China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The city of two masks faces a new crisis The law has sparked demonstrations in Hong Kong since it was announced by Beijing in May. China says it is needed to tackle unrest and instability and rejects criticism as interference in its affairs. Critics warn the law will shut down dissent The law went through unanimously in a session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing. It comes a day before the 23rd anniversary of the handover from Britain to China - a date usually marked by pro-democracy protests. It will make criminal any act of secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism and collusion with foreign or external forces. Beijing to set up new security office in Hong Kong A new office in Hong Kong would deal with national security cases, but would also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools. In addition, the city will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser. Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, a move which has raised fears about judicial independence. Importantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes priority. For many, the law undermines the freedoms that set Hong Kong apart from the rest of China and helped define its character. People in Hong Kong prize civil liberties such as free speech, the right to protest and an entirely independent and robust judiciary, as permitted in the Basic Law. The bill will cement Beijing's control of Hong Kong In recent years, Hong Kong has seen waves of protests demanding more rights. Last year, rallies over a now-scrapped bill permitting extraditions to the mainland turned violent and fuelled a broad pro-democracy movement. In a video address to the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said crimes under the new law would be clearly defined. She said the law would only target a ""small minority"" and would not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We respect differences in opinion."" Hong Kong's sweeping new security law is a frighteningly open-ended tool to suppress political agitation. Like similar laws on the Chinese mainland it appears that it can be manipulated to meet the needs of the Communist Party as required to crush almost any action deemed threatening. Unlike elsewhere in China, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary. For this reason, the Party's leadership was not going to leave interpretation of this law in the hands of just any old judges. No. Those who will be allowed to preside in these matters will be hand-picked by Carrie Lam, the city's leader who was effectively installed by Beijing. So, prior to the new security bill, which actions by activists - no matter how subversive - could not be dealt with under existing laws? What were ""extremists"" getting away with to warrant this new legislation? Bomb making? No. Smashing up buildings? No. Meeting with international NGOs to talk about the city's deteriorating freedoms? Ahhhh. Perhaps. Publicly advocating Hong Kong independence? Almost certainly. The more that Beijing, under Xi Jinping's leadership, has sought to control Hong Kong, the more it has driven residents into the pro-democracy camp. But he is playing a long game. Sure, handover promises to the UK were made but he was not going to let some Western attachment to liberty trump loyalty to the motherland. Not on his watch. Enter the security law. Democratic Party leader Wu Chi-wai said he would defy a police ban on Wednesday's ""handover day"" march. He will be joined by Figo Chan, of the Civil Human Rights Front, who urged people to take to the streets, saying: ""We are aware of the risks of being prosecuted. But we insist on taking the lead, as we want to tell Hongkongers not to fear."" Police plan to have 4,000 riot officers on standby, the South China Morning Post reports. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions The background you need on Hong Kong's protests Announcing that it would ""dissolve and stop all meetings"", the Demosisto group said that the fight against ""totalitarian oppression"" would have to continue in a ""more flexible manner"" and on ""different fronts"". Joshua Wong said the law marked ""the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before"". President of the European Council Charles Michel said on Tuesday the law risked seriously undermining Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We deplore this decision.""
