May's US speech is 'new and important',"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We must renew the special relationship for this new age"" Theresa May's Philadelphia speech is hugely significant - arguably the biggest by a British prime minister in the US since Tony Blair's in Chicago. Eighteen years ago - in 1999 - Mr Blair first advocated active military interventionism to overturn dictators and protect civilians. Now, Mrs May has repudiated much of what he said then. She talked of ""the failed policies of the past"", before making her crucial declaration of new foreign policy doctrine: ""The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over."" Of course, by saying that she was also overturning the approach of her predecessor, David Cameron. The current prime minister has also dismissed her predecessor's armed intervention in Libya. Its aftermath - a failed state, far from recovery - haunts Britain still. This declaration of an apparently radical shift in policy by the prime minister should be read in conjunction with what appears to be an extraordinary British U-turn over Syria, which was set out in colourful terms by her foreign secretary only a few hours earlier. Boris Johnson conceded the most bitter and recent failure of British foreign policy when he openly acknowledged what amounts to a fundamental defeat over Syria. He called Britain's stance ""catastrophic"", shifting from the pledge of support over many years to the non-jihadist opponents of President Assad, to a position where Britain - together with the United States - retreated from the field and left it open to Russian military dominance. Mr Johnson told a committee in the House of Lords that President Assad should now be permitted to run for election as part of a ""democratic resolution"" of the civil war - although he did also make clear there could be no sustainable peace in Syria as long as he remains. He admitted the downsides of doing ""such a complete flip-flop"", but said the UK had been unable at any stage to fulfil its mantra that the Syrian president should go. Boris Johnson said the UK's stance on Syria had been ""catastrophic"" Mr Johnson was accepting Russia's victory - and at the same time swallowing the bitter pill of defeat for London and for Washington. He said that had flowed from the refusal of the House of Commons, in August 2013, to back punitive British military action against President Assad for his use of chemical weapons - something the Syrian leader still denies. Within days, President Obama had followed Britain in retreat. Public appetite in both countries for almost any military intervention overseas had drained away after the years of intervention in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in Libya. It is very difficult to see circumstances in which Britain or the US will send forces against a sovereign government in the future. Extremists - non-state actors - are almost the only acceptable target now. The Foreign Office does not believe their political master was as explicit as I suggest, and believe that the essentials of British policy on Syria have not fundamentally changed. Certainly, the prime minister did leave herself some wriggle room. She argued against the sort of increased isolationism which President Donald Trump has championed, and urged the maintenance of the ""special relationship"" as a way to provide joint leadership in the world. She said the two nations should not ""stand idly by when the threat is real"". Nevertheless, the political presentation of British foreign policy by the prime minister and foreign secretary has deployed a distinctly new and sometimes startling language. The direction being set in response to past failures and disappointments is different. It may be largely a public recognition of some brutal realities, which have been emerging over several years, but it is new and important.

US-UK relations get a reboot,"President Trump invited Prime Minister Theresa May to the White House and has been trying to strengthen US-UK relations. Not everybody is happy about that. President Trump loves the UK - and seems pleased with the way that Britons voted to leave the European Union (EU). As the Atlantic Council's Reginald Dale said, describing Trump's views: ""He's very pro-British, and he doesn't like the EU."" For critics of the administration, Trump's invitation to May - she's the first foreign leader to meet with the new president - and his efforts to build a closer relationship with the UK are a troubling development. These critics see Brexit, a term that's used to describe a country's process of leaving the European Union, as a disaster. The detractors worry that Trump will try to leverage his friendship with May and her fellow Britons as a way to express support for Brexit - and in this way will encourage more countries to leave the European Union. On Friday afternoon, Trump and May stood together in the White House's East Room, an open space with an oak floor. The room was decorated with marble-topped fireplaces, white candles and heavy, gold curtains (a George Washington portrait, one that was first hung on a wall in the room in 1800, was not in its usual spot). The two leaders were in a place that was steeped in tradition - as is the so-called special relationship, a friendship between the US and the UK that dates back generations. For Trump and May, though, it's all new. They'd met only the day before in Philadelphia, where they were both attending a US congressional retreat. When White House officials first sent out a schedule for the president's meeting with May, they spelled her name wrong, inadvertently dropping the ""h"" in Theresa. Still, they had good intentions - and big plans. At the White House, the two leaders discussed Russia, counterterrorism and defence issues. They're open to the possibility of a trade deal between the US and the UK. It could only be signed once the UK leaves the European Union, a process that will take years. But on Friday they seemed eager to get started. ""Opposites attract,"" May has told reporters. Understated and reserved, she has a different style than Trump. Still, she said recently that she's ""not afraid to speak frankly to a president of the United States"". On Friday - at least in the East Room - they got along well. It was an auspicious beginning for a ""most special relationship"", as he put it. They stood at identical lecterns - six to eight feet apart. She wore a paisley scarf, while he had on a bright-red, wide tie. For most of the 18-minute press conference, they smiled at each other. At one point she congratulated him on his ""stunning"" victory. He looked at people in the audience, a group made up of presidential aides and reporters, as if he wanted to make sure that they'd heard what she said. ""We're going to have a fantastic relationship,"" he told them. A moment later he spoke exuberantly about Brexit. Then the mood changed, slightly. Up until that point, she'd been all smiles. As he spoke about Brexit, though, she looked sombre. She glanced at the people in the audience, as if she were trying to gauge their reaction to his remarks. Afterwards she spoke briefly about the way that they both value ""ordinary working people"". Then he picked up his notes, which had been typed out on sheets of paper, and put them into the pocket in his jacket. They left the room together in a show of solidarity. Their alliance rests on a solid foundation. In a speech on Thursday, May spoke about the friendship between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, two icons for conservatives in the US. Conservatives at think-tanks in Washington have been quick to bring up this friendship when talking about the relationship between the current prime minister and the president. ""Instinctively, Trump - you know - really likes Britain,"" said Nile Gardiner of the Heritage Foundation. So do Trump's aides. When Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, uses the phrase, ""special relationship"", he's not being snarky. ""I think we've always had that special relationship,"" he told a reporter at a White House briefing on 23 January. ""But we can always be closer."" Things were different with the Obama White House officials. They liked the Britons, too, but they gently mocked the phrase ""special relationship"". This reflected their views about foreign policy in Europe. As Charles Kupchan, who was a senior adviser in the Obama White House, told me the relationship between the US and the UK was important. But the president was focused on Berlin, not London. ""Diplomacy,"" Kupchan said, ""tilted towards the Continent"". This became more pronounced after UK voters expressed their desire to leave the European Union. Obama focused on the special relationship, but not to the exclusion of Europe Trump administration officials supported the decision of UK voters to leave the European Union, and in the aftermath they've been hoping for a deeper friendship between Americans and Britons and their leaders. The perception of a newfound closeness of the two leaders has rattled some Europeans. Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgium prime minister, was visiting Washington this week to promote his book, Europe's Last Chance: Why the European States Must Form a More Perfect Union. While speaking with reporters on Thursday, he described ways that Trump has tried to undermine the European alliance. Verhofstadt said he believes that Trump is ""hoping"" more countries will leave - and ""disintegrate the European Union"". Gardiner knows that not everyone is happy about the renewed relationship between the US and the UK or about the developments in Europe. But he wishes they'd embrace the new order. ""Brexit is about sovereignty, self determination and freedom,"" Gardiner told me.  ""These are all great things."" Anyway there's not much the detractors can do about it, he said, adding: ""The winds of change are blowing through Europe."" Follow @Tara_Mckelvey on Twitter. Special relationship in decline?

Aberdeen eye second spot v Dundee,"Dons move second with comfortable win Ryan Jack heads Dons into lead Niall McGinn scores in either half Clive Lindsay Thanks for staying with us until we heard from the respective managers, with Aberdeen's Derek McInnes obviously the happier of the two. Can Rangers take back second place when they visit Motherwell tomorrow? Join us tomorrow for more live coverage of that, three other Premiership games and the rest of the Scottish Professional Football League card. FT: Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee Dundee manager Paul Hartley on BBC Radio Scotland:""The start was promising. We had a shot against the bar and had the ball in the net only to be ruled off for offside. ""After that, we didn't defend properly. If you can't stop the cross, defend the balls that come in, but they seems to switch off and not do their jobs.Â ""We know Aberdeen have good players, but we have got to make it as difficult for them as possible.Â ""We want to try to bring some players in, but financially it is not going to be easy.Â ""We want to add quality as we only came here with 16 players and we need to add numbers."" FT: Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes on BBC Radio Scotland:""We had to wait a bit longer than we hoped to get into the lead, but once we made the breakthrough, I thought we brought some great quality. ""Niall's first goal was top drawer. He has scored quality goals throughout his time here, but that was right up there. ""We're working with this squad until the end of the season and I hope to add one more before the end of the January transfer window. ""As for Niall's long-term future, we have made him a strong offer and we hope that can be settled in the next few weeks. ""It is probably just the case that he wants to consider his options, but he has never indicated that he wants to leave."" FT: Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee On-loan Celtic midfielder Ryan Christie had to wait until the closing stages before making his debut as a substitute. Can Derek McInnes change his midfield to make room for the 21-year-old now that Aberdeen have secured a fifth straight victory? Ryan Christie (centre) made his Aberdeen debut as a late substitute You can now read Martin Dowden's reflections from the match from Pittodrie. Aberdeen move up to second in the Premiership after a comprehensive victory over Dundee at Pittodrie. FT: Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee Former Aberdeen manager Willie Miller is suggesting that the signs seem to be that Niall McGinn will not be at Pittodrie next season. After shining at Euro 2016, McGinn will be attracting interest as he approaches the end of his contract this summer and, at 29, a move that would increase his earnings would be very inviting for the Northern Ireland forward. Of course, two goals in front of the live TV cameras will have done his chances of attracting a big club no harm at all! Niall McGinn headed Aberdeen into a 3-0 lead over Dundee FT: Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee  For me it was a clear signal from Paul Hartley to the board to name only five substitutes. But some of his signings have not worked out and I would be a bit worried if I was a Dundee fan heading back down the road Tam McManus, Former Dundee striker on BBC Radio Scotland FT: Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee  I had a feeling Aberdeen were going to continue their fine form of late and, apart from a slow start, that was the case. Once they raised the tempo, Dundee certainly struggled. Aberdeen have class in certain areas and none more so than Niall McGinn. He was unstoppable at times and it was a privilege to watch him Willie Miller, Former Aberdeen manager on BBC Radio Scotland Aberdeen complete a comprehensive victory over Dundee that lifts them a point above Rangers and into second place in the Scottish Premiership. A disappointing and disjointed Dundee miss the chance to move into sixth and remain in eighth. Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee There's only two minutes of stoppage time for Dundee to endure. Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee Niall McGinn is given a standing ovation following his two goals as he is replaced with 19-year-old striker Scott Wright. Niall McGinn has scored twice for Aberdeen against Dundee Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee  I have been heartened by the Aberdeen performance. Niall McGinn's performance has warmed me up Willie Miller, Former Aberdeen manager on BBC Radio Scotland Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee Miles Storey, a forgotten man since his move from Swindon Town, is given a rare outing as a substitute for Aberdeen, replacing Adam Rooney. Aberdeen 3-0 Dundee Another snap shot from Niall McGinn is followed by the withdrawal of Jonny Hayes and the introduction of Ryan Christie. With the game won, manager Derek McInnes thinks it is safe enough to give the on-loan Celtic midfielder his debut for the Dons. Niall McGinn Niall McGinn springs to life again and it is thanks to his double act with Jonny Hayes. The winger's outswinging cross finds the Northern Irishman's head and he nods it powerfully past Dundee goalkeeper Scott Bain. Aberdeen 2-0 Dundee Faissal El Bakhtaoui goes close to bringing Dundee into the game out of the blue. The substitute shows the goal threat that persuaded Dundee to sign him from Dunfermline Athletic with a snap shot from 25 yards that had goalkeeper Joe Lewis worried as it missed the woodwork by a foot or two. Aberdeen 2-0 Dundee Still no sign of Ryan Christie being handed his Aberdeen debut, with the on-loan Celtic midfielder still wrapped up against the cold on the bench. Aberdeen 2-0 Dundee Graeme Shinnie appears unfortunate to go into the referee's book for a foul on Dundee's Cammy Kerr. Aberdeen 2-0 Dundee Dundee are going for broke, with manager Paul Hartley changing from a five-man defence to a four by hauling off central defender Julen Etxabeguren and bringing on striker Faissal El Bakhtaoui. Aberdeen 2-0 Dundee Adam Rooney should put Aberdeen further ahead, but the striker's low drive is pushed away superbly by goalkeeper Scott Bain after he is set up following a mazy run from Jonny Hayes.

Manor F1 fold after no buyer is found,"Manor were one of three new teams to enter F1 in 2010. Each have now folded The Manor team have collapsed after administrators failed to find a buyer for the stricken business. Manor's operating company Just Racing Services has been in administration since 6 January, and FRP Advisory has been unable to find a buyer. Just Racing ceased trading on Friday, effectively ending the Manor team. The staff were sent home on Friday and told they will be made redundant by the close of business on Tuesday after the payment of January salaries. FRP said there was ""no sustainable operational or financial structure in place to maintain the group as a going concern"". Joint administrator Geoff Rowley added the administration process ""provided a moratorium"" in the search for a buyer but ""no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form"". It is not necessarily the end of Manor - a buyer could potentially still purchase the remnants of the team. But even if that were to happen, the move makes it much harder for Manor to make it to the start of the season in Australia on 26 March. The team's collapse leaves 10 teams - 20 cars - on the grid in Melbourne and comes just five days after the sport wastaken over by US company Liberty Mediaand long-time commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone was removed as chief executive. This video can not be played New F1 boss Chase Carey on big talking points Manor started life as Virgin Racing in 2010 and has been through several guises in the intervening seven years. It previouslywent into administrationin October 2014, and was only saved by current owner Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of energy firm Ovo, on the eve of the 2015 season. Fitzpatrick has saidthe decisive moment was the team'sslip to 11th placein the constructors' championship as a result of Sauber's Felipe Nasr finishing ninth in the penultimate race of last season in Brazil. This cost the team in the region of $15m (Â£12m) in prize money. Manor were one of three new teams to enter F1 in 2010 after they were promised by then FIA president Max Mosley that a Â£40m budget cap would be introduced. But Mosley stood down as head of the governing body in 2009 after losing a fight with the teams over the plan and the cost limit was abandoned. All three teams have now collapsed. Anneliese Dodds MEP has called for a European Commission investigation into the FIA and F1 following Manor's collapse. She said: ""The collapse of Manor Racing could be the end of seven turbulent years for a team that brought highly skilled jobs to Oxfordshire. I am very concerned that this follows other job losses in small teams. ""Formula One Group, its owners and the FIA as a regulator really need to be investigated after this collapse. ""The unfair way in which prize money is allocated in the sport, permanently favouring the largest teams regardless of their finishing position, has seen many teams struggle to survive and ultimately reduced the number of cars on the grid. ""The European Commission must investigate the complaints it received last year from two F1 teams related to anti-competitive practices before even more highly skilled jobs are lost both in the South East and all around Europe. ""I will be writing to the Commission to call on them to take serious action on the way F1 is run, before a sport loved by 500 million fans is damaged beyond repair.""

Richard Westcott: Will ministers take over Southern?,"Would putting Southern rail back into public ownership solve the long-running dispute? ""I would welcome this"".  It's something you wouldn't expect to hear - Tory MPs don't normally offer a warm greeting to the idea of renationalising part of the rail network. That's how topsy-turvy the Southern situation has become. Chris Philp, the Conservative MP for Croydon South, has been calling for the government to strip the company of its contract since last May. It would mean placing it back into public hands, at least for the time being, but it's a price Chris is willing to pay. ""The franchise is too big and the current finance structure doesn't incentivise the company to perform"", he says. ""The unions must take their share of the blame, but the company has also been incompetent."" Unusually for a Conservative MP, Chris Philp would be in favour of a return to public ownership, for now Labour is pushing to renationalise the entire rail network, but its Hove and Portslade MP, Peter Kyle, isn't convinced that a Department for Transport (DfT) takeover is the right move for Southern. ""I worry that passengers will believe, falsely, that all the problems can be solved with a quick wave of the wand. Public ownership might solve some of the problems, but not all."" Peter says he wants ""muscular"" government intervention, but not necessarily officials taking charge. What other options might be on the table for ministers? The DfT is currently crunching the numbers, trying to work out if Southern's parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), has broken its contract promises on delays and cancellations. If it has, (and they've been arguing about it for months. Does a big rise in sick days, for example, count as unofficial industrial action?) ministers have the option of ditching the deal. But would that really help? Not necessarily: don't get the impression that there is a team of rail super-sub bosses sitting on the sidelines poised to make the trains run on time. The role of the guard is central to the dispute between workers and the company If the government did take over, it would remove the top layer of executives, replacing them with yet more top executives, probably semi-retired former rail bosses. The rest of Southern's staff would stay the same. And they'd be facing the same problems: Solving the longest running industrial dispute since the network was privatised.Southern has imposed changes to the role of on-board conductors, changes the unions loathe and the government supports. Doubtless the new government team would support them too. Sorting engineering problems that are nothing to do with the dispute.Network Rail is actually responsible for half of Southern's delays. Ministers recently formed a task force to bash some heads together, because they said Southern and Network Rail weren't collaborating to solve problems. Plugging a driver shortage. Terrible staff relations.Several drivers have said to me that they are dealing with the same ""decent"" local managers that they've been dealing with for years, but the tone from the top has become more ""vindictive"" and ""petty"". And I haven't even mentioned the debilitating upgrades to the Thameslink part of the franchise, including rebuilding London Bridge. Experts had predicted it would cause 10,000 delay-minutes per year. In reality, it's caused 10,000 delay-minutes per week, and there's plenty more to come. Then there's what happens afterwards. Any new team would only be caretakers until a new company was brought in and that process takes at least 18 months. Talks between the unions and the company have so far failed to reach agreement Talking to people at other train operating firms, they feel they dodged a bullet not winning the current GTR contract, so would they really bid for a new one? National Express has just pulled out of trains completely. It used to be Britain's biggest player in the sector. The government is legally obliged to keep the trains running whatever happens. It's hardly surprising that officials have been kicking around options if GTR gets ditched. They've a person in mind to be the temporary boss. Pressure is mounting for the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to take direct action, but renationalising part of the railway goes against every bone in his political body. It would be a humiliating loss in the government's effort to sell privatisation as a success story. Chris Philp MP still thinks it's worth it, though. ""You can't point at this and say privatisation doesn't work"", he says. ""This situation isn't like anywhere else."" His belief is that they tried something different with this franchise and it didn't come off. Why is there a Southern rail strike?

Ben Wright: Labour's Brexit dilemma,"Labour's Brexit bind is not hard to grasp. The vast majority of Labour MPs campaigned to keep Britain in the EU. But most now represent constituencies that voted to leave. And as Parliament prepares to vote on triggering divorce talks with Brussels, Labour MPs are being ordered to approve the start of Brexit by a party leader who spent his backbench career ignoring similar demands for discipline. These areagonising days for a parliamentary partystruggling to maintain a coherent position on the biggest issue facing British politics for a generation. Let's start with Jeremy Corbyn's decision to impose what, in parliamentary parlance, is called a three-line whip. As far as the political parties in Westminster are concerned, MPs are not sent to Parliament to carefully weigh up each issue and vote according to their own judgement or conscience. No, they are there to vote as their party leadership tells them to. Over the weekend, all MPs will receive a letter from their party's whips office telling them how to vote on various Bills before the Commons next week. Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty sets out how countries can leave the EU. The most important by far will be the Second Reading of the bill to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. It will not be the end of the parliamentary process for the Bill (a Committee stage will follow the week after and the Lords needs to approve it too) but it's a big moment. And in the letter Labour MPs will receive, the name of the bill will be underlined three times. That means they must vote as their party managers instruct - no ifs, no buts. In this case, they must vote to support the government's plan to trigger Article 50 by the end of March. It's an instruction that gives Labour MPs no wiggle-room or freedom to vote according to their conscience. Of course, Labour MPs can choose to ignore the instruction but for backbenchers that would normally mean a big black mark against their name by the party whips and for front benchers such insubordination would mean resignation or the sack. So why has Mr Corbyn decided to issue a three-line whip on Article 50? First, he has made it clear Labour will respect the result of the referendum and not block the start of Brexit in Parliament. Mr Corbyn believes it is imperative his party has a clear position on the issue. For him personally, triggering Article 50 may not cause too much discomfort. He campaigned for Remain but has been an EU sceptic most of his political life. But there are obvious political considerations at play too. Roughly two thirds of parliamentary constituencies represented by Labour MPs voted to leave the EU. UKIP leader Paul Nuttall hopes to gain from Labour's position on Brexit. As the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""You have to remember how this looks to people in post-industrial Britain, former mining areas, the North, the Midlands, south Wales - it would look as if elites were refusing to listen to them"". Swathes of Labour's traditional working-class heartlands voted to leave the EU and the leadership believes the party must stand firmly behind their decision. There are imminent electoral tests for Labour too: By-elections in Copeland and Stoke on Trent. Stoke voted to leave the EU by 69.4% and UKIP's leader Paul Nuttall is running in the city he is describing as the ""capital of Brexit"". If the Labour leadership was to look flaky on the question of triggering Brexit, the party could give up on holding Stoke Central now. And as Labour MPs who represent similar seats look ahead to the next general election they will make the same calculation. Bristol West MP Thangam Debbonaire is expected to defy her own whip. I've spoken to former Labour ministers who passionately believe that leaving the EU will be bad for Britain, but feel they must respect the referendum result. And if they want to keep their seats, they have little choice. However, there is a second category of Labour MPs with a very different perspective. According to BBC research, about 70 Labour MPs represent constituencies that voted to remain in the EU. Just four of those MPs campaigned to leave (including Kate Hoey in Vauxhall and Gisela Stuart in Birmingham Edgbaston) which means dozens of Labour MPs who wanted to keep Britain in the EU represent seats that voted the same way. And many of them look set to defy Jeremy Corbyn's orders on Article 50. Even two Labour whips  - Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire - have said they will refuse to vote in favour of the Article 50 Bill, in a bizarre show of parliamentary self-flagellation. It seems likely a number of front bench and even shadow cabinet Labour MPs will do the same. The question is, whether Mr Corbyn sacks them or allows some tacit elasticity. As one Labour MP said to me this week, party discipline on the issue is rapidly breaking down and MPs were going ""feral"". Mr Corbyn rebelled against the Labour whip 428 times during Labour's years in power and it's clear many of his MPs aren't cowed by calls for party discipline now. Remember too, polls conducted before the referendum showed a large majority of Labour Party members were strongly in favour of remaining in the EU. They will be making their views felt at constituency meetings. In the end, the government will get its Article 50 Bill through Parliament with ease. Even if dozens of Labour MPs join other opposition parties and vote against the bill or abstain, the government seems certain to secure a hefty majority. But the choice being weighed up by Labour MPs goes to the heart of what Members of Parliament are for. In this case, is it to endorse the decision of a national referendum? Is it to reflect the wishes of their constituents? Is it support the position of their party in Parliament? Or is to judge, individually, what they think is in the best interests of the country? Perhaps not since the Iraq vote in 2003 have Labour MPs faced such a testing decision.

Spicer plans to hold press to account,"This video can not be played Sean Spicer: ""We can disagree with the facts"" Some journalists are scum, many are incorrigible egoists, and yet the vast majority, in my experience, are decent coves with a high-minded view of the trade they belong to. Whether they report on the courts, local football matches, or the latest film openings, part of the job is spreading knowledge and joy - or, as Lord Reith put it, to ""inform, educate and entertain."" But there is a deeper attraction to the trade. This is the principle of holding power to account. Obviously many journalists fall short of achieving this. Some become corrupted by power themselves. But journalism at its best is the industrialisation of scrutiny. The presence of mischievous, determined, nosy hacks stops people who have immense power - some of it unjustifiably, arbitrarily or illegally obtained - from getting away with misdeeds. You might think that's pompous, but, frankly, I don't mind. Nor, I'm sure, do the White House press corps who were assembled for the astonishing press conferences thatSean Spicer, new press secretary to President Trump, gave earlier this week. I'm not interested, for the purposes of this blog, in whether or not the assertions made by Mr Spicer were true or false. President Trump wants to take his message ""directly to the American people"" I am interested in these words he uttered, the consequences of which are immense for politics, media and public life: ""There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable. ""And I'm here to tell you it goes two ways. ""We're going to hold the press accountable, as well. ""The American people deserve better. ""And as long as he serves as the messenger for this incredible movement, he will take his message directly to the American people, where his focus will always be"". Put aside the almost biblical imagery and the clear indication that, through talk radio and social media, President Trump will cut out journalists and go straight to voters. Those four words ""it goes two ways"" are doing a lot of work there. In fact, they're re-inventing government."" Last night, Steve Bannon, the former chief of Breitbart News, went even further than Spicerin an interview with The New York Times.,externalHe said: ""The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while."" As one of the most powerful voices in Trump's ear, clearly Bannon's view that the media should be subject to ferocious scrutiny now holds considerable sway in the White House. I havedecided to call,externalthis notion that it is the job of government to hold the press to account The Spicer Doctrine. Here are five thoughts about it: One:Totalitarian states use propaganda to control public information, spread fear and rally support against external foes. Donald Trump has a powerful democratic mandate: he is no totalitarian. But he seems immensely frustrated at his inability to control public information - so much so that he uses Twitter to circumvent the media, and sent out his spokesman to lambast and threaten journalists. President Trump and Mr Spicer will soon find out that, especially in the digital age, they have no hope of controlling public information. The internet is a mad bazaar. There will always be stuff that annoy this administration and send them into a fury. So expect more individual journalists to suffer the fate of the Time magazine journalist whogot his facts wrong,external. Two:There is a serious question of credibility and trust at stake here. As promised, I won't pass judgement here on the veracity of the statements Mr Spicer is making. But in just his first week as president, Mr Trump has obliterated the basic faith that many Americans had that what the White House says is true. You might argue that this faith was decimated by the Iraq War. It had, however, been rebuilt since. And the issue isn't whether anyone believes Mr Spicer when he says Mr Trump's inauguration was better attended than Barack Obama's. The problem will arise when he says something more substantial about a terror threat or America's next war. Who will believe him then? Does it matter if the press corps, who relay his message to millions of Americans, think he's not credible? Three:The traditional media is caterwauling about Mr Trump's fondness for exaggeration. Do his supporters care? Possibly not. This video can not be played Where do Donald Trump supporters get their news from? The fact is, with Fox News and various internet outlets supporting his cause, Mr Trump believes that the nationalist media who so helped him to win the presidency are also on board now. Interestingly, as a president he seems to have made little effort to unify the country: instead, he seems intent on energising his base. And that base cares less and less for the - as they see it - pompous bloviating of coastal correspondents and editors. Four:While journalists at that same traditional media are outraged by The Spicer Doctrine, seeing it as an affront to natural justice, their colleagues in the commercial department are delighted. Frankly, Mr Trump's relationship with the traditional media, while hateful, is a marriage of convenience. Subscriptions to the Hillary-Clinton-endorsing New York Timeshave rocketed,external. Ratings at CNN are up. Traffic at Buzzfeed is soaring. It turns out that the ""two way"" process Mr Spicer mentioned is a case of you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. This is a theme I shall be returning to. Five:In one sense, democratic governments have always tried to regulate the media while paying lip service to media freedom and plurality. After all, government designs the laws under which media operate. But government is too hard, too complicated, and too relentless to accommodate a war against traditional media outlets. Just as opponents of torture argue that co-operation is the better route to good intelligence, so a constructive and open relationship between government and media is better for both, so long as there is honesty about conflicting interests. Right now, The Spicer Doctrine is a useful way of energising the roughly half of Americans who backed Mr Trump. Soon enough, it could be bad for democracy, by wasting government time, preventing proper scrutiny, and filling cyberspace with sound and fury that signify nothing - of which there is no shortage of supply already.

What if Trump tries to bring back torture?,"This video can not be played Donald Trump tells ABC News that ""torture works"" President Trump has indicated that he is considering a return to the sort of harsh interrogation techniques of ""enemy combatants"" that have been widely condemned as torture, as well as a return to so-called CIA ""black sites"". In his first interview since becoming US President, Mr Trump said intelligence officials had told him that ""torture absolutely works"", but that he would defer to advice from his new CIA director and his secretary of defence. The latter, retired Marine Corps officer Gen James Mattis, says torture does not work. So what are the global implications if the president goes ahead, asks BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner. There is a South African proverb, dating from the apartheid era, that goes like this: ""How do you catch an elephant? You catch a mouse and keep beating it up until it admits it's really an elephant."" Ridiculous as this may sound, there is an echo of truth here. Torture hurts. That's the whole point of it. So if someone is tortured badly enough they will say anything to make it stop, including making things up that they think their tormentors will want to hear. Prisons in certain Middle Eastern countries, especially Syria, are crammed full of people who are being abused so badly they will eventually sign any ""confession"" to make the treatment stop. In some countries forced confessions remain to this day the primary tool in the prosecutor's armoury. In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 the US intelligence community, having failed to prevent the worst attack on the US since Pearl Harbor, became convinced that a second catastrophic attack was on its way. As President George W Bush's ""war on terror"" got underway, the normal safeguards of respect for human rights and the rule of law were cast aside in a desperate hunt to find ""the ticking bomb"". Trump insists waterboarding works First 100 days: What executive actions has Trump taken? Top al-Qaeda planners like Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, all caught in Pakistan, were ""rendered"" (transported) to so-called ""black sites"" for extreme interrogation. These were secret, unacknowledged prisons, run by the CIA and scattered around the globe in Afghanistan, Thailand, Poland, Romania and other countries. There they were subjected to repeated waterboarding, which makes the bound and helpless victim feel like they are drowning. Khaled Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded a staggering number of times, well over 100. And yet years later, when in 2014 the US Senate's Intelligence and Security Select Committee issued its report on the use of torture under the Bush administration it concluded that torture was ""not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees"". CIA lied over 'brutal' interrogations 'CIA tortured' admits former executive On Thursday, the US House Speaker, Paul Ryan, said torture was not legal and that the committee agreed it was not legal. Senator John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, also opposes it. ""The president can sign whatever executive order he likes,"" he said, ""but the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the USA."" There would be strong resistance too from both America's allies and from within the intelligence community itself. There is a general acceptance now, in most of the world, that those practices carried out in the early years after the 9/11 attacks - extraordinary rendition, detention without trial, enhanced interrogation - were not only morally wrong, they were also counter-productive. They very rarely produced useful, actionable intelligence. They traumatised not only the victims, some of whom were completely innocent, but also those who witnessed the shocking dehumanising of an individual. Undoubtedly this has given the green light to some unscrupulous practices by regimes who see America's earlier use of torture as a license to do what they like to their own citizens. Unthinkable as it sounds now, the US even rendered one ""high value detainee"" to his own country - Syria - for interrogation, knowing that there would be few restraints on his treatment there. This video can not be played John McCain said he'd have Donald Trump in court in 'a New York minute' if he reinstated waterboarding There is also the legal aspect. In 2010 David Cameron, who was then UK prime minister, set up a judge-led, independent inquiry into allegations of complicity by MI5 and MI6 officers in torture. Career intelligence officers who had thought they were doing the right thing at the time - such as, hypothetically, being within earshot of the harsh interrogation of a suspect in a Pakistani jail - found themselves being questioned by detectives from the Metropolitan Police. The inquiry was eventually scrapped but it has at least led to a widespread rethink on respect for human rights inside intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic. Senior intelligence officers who lived through this difficult period are likely to strongly resist turning the clock back and returning to those days. It is also questionable whether the US would find willing partners to host black site prisons amongst those countries only too relieved to have closed that chapter in their national histories.

"Well, that was intense","This video can not be played Trump's 'yuge' first week as president recapped Donald Trump promised that he would deliver big things for the American people from the moment he came into office. To call his first week ""yuge"", as he might say, would be an understatement. Mr Trump's first seven days in office have seen a flurry of executive orders, a war declared by his team on the mainstream media, some of the largest protests ever held in the United States, and the coining of a term - ""alternative facts"" - that could come to define the White House under his tenure. The BBC website has publishedmore than 200 stories and videosabout or relating to President Trump since inauguration day. It's been a busy week. In retrospect, this was the calmest day of them all. With his hand resting on two Bibles - one his own, the other used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 - Donald John Trump was sworn in as US President, the first man to hold the office without either political or military experience. Earlier in the day, Barack Obama was captured through a window leaving a letter for his successor in the top drawer of the Oval Office desk. What did it say? We don't know and President Trump won't say. Addressing the nation at the ceremony, President Trumpspokein fairly bleak terms of rusted-out factories, poverty-stricken families and crime-blighted cities, vowing to end ""this American carnage"" This video can not be played Trump's inauguration: Story of the day ""This was not a message to the American people as a whole - many of whom likely feel the past resident of the White House, Barack Obama, reflected their beliefs and their diversity,""our correspondent Anthony Zurcher wrote. ""This was a speech for the angry, the frustrated, the American voters who turned out in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Ohio to shake their fist at the status quo and take a chance on a man who was unlike any presidential politician who came before him."" As the Obamas left for a holiday in Palm Springs, a new era in politics began. Take a deep breath now... Whilemany protestswere held on inauguration day around the world, including one in Washington thatspiralled into violence, Saturday 21 January saw a remarkable global expression of opposition to the Trump administration and its perceived world view. Millions of people turned out to demonstrate at ""Women's Marches"" in cities around the world to make their voice heard on women's reproductive rights, gender, sexual and racial equality. This video can not be played Five countries where anti-Donald Trump protests took place But as protests continued, President Trump gave an extraordinary press conference at the CIA headquarters, telling staff that the media had fabricated a ""feud"" between him and the intelligence agencies, despitepreviously tweeting,externalthey were acting as if the US was Nazi Germany. Standing in front of the CIA's hallowed memorial wall, which honours agency employees who died in service, he also complained about reporting of the crowd size at his inauguration, and unflattering comparisons to the turn-out at Barack Obama's own ceremony in 2009. What followed saw ""post-truth"" politics kick into high gear. Trump dispatched hiscombative new press secretary Sean Spicerto lambast the media in a televised briefing. He said no-one had any crowd estimates from the inauguration before then giving his own crowd numbers - saying that the space holding 720,000 people was full when the oath was taken. This, he claimed, ""was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe"". Officials in Washington say up to half a million demonstrators joined the Women's March there He also falsely said the number of people taking Washington's subway system on the day had been higher than during Barack Obama's second inauguration in 2013. In a television interview on Sunday, Trump counsellor Kellyanne Conway defended Spicer's inaccurate claims, thereby introducing the world to the term ""alternative facts"", which is how she described what he said. ""Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods,"" NBC presenter Chuck Todd replied. The internet, of course, delivered an outpouring of #Spicerfacts. Meanwhile, the president himself was praising Barack Obama at a ceremony to swear in senior members of his team. This video can not be played President Trump reveals that Barack Obama left him a ""beautiful"" letter at the Oval Office While there, he said he would soon begin negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts. ""Mexico has been terrific. The president has been really very amazing,"" he said. More on Mexico was to come later in the week from the president. (Hint: They stopped being so amazing.) Trump also finally responded to Saturday's mass protests against him. The first working day of the Trump administration kicked off with meeting between the president and business leaders, during which Trump announced his aim to cut regulations for US-based businesses by 75%. A clutch of executive actions followed. He pulled the US out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, a key part of Obama's efforts to engage and divert attention to the Asia-Pacific. Australia swiftly said it wanted to try to keep the deal alive with a so-called 'TPP 12 minus one'. This video can not be played Donald Trump had a busy first working day as president Trump alsobanned federal moneygoing to international groups which perform or provide information on abortions. The US president's order shows he ""wants to stand up for all Americans, including the unborn,"" his press secretary Sean Spicer said. This picture went viral. Spot the women ""As long as you live you'll never see a photograph of 7 women signing legislation about what men can do with their reproductive organs,"" Guardian social editor Martin Belam said on Twitter. More than 260,000 people re-tweeted his thoughts. If the day wasn't busy enough in Trump news, a group of US ethics lawyers hadfiled a lawsuit against the president, alleging he is violating a constitutional ban on accepting payments from foreign governments through his hotels. Mr Trump described the lawsuit as ""totally without merit"". Oh, and he implementeda hiring freezeon some federal government workers. The barrage of executive actions continued on Tuesday, with two orders signed to back controversial oil pipelines - Keystone XL and the Dakota Access project - if American steel is used. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose land abuts the proposed route of the Dakota Access pipeline, called Mr Trump's decision a violation of ""law and tribal treaties"". This video can not be played US pipeline protesters: 'It's going to be war' Environmentalists said Trump was proving as dangerous to the climate as they had feared. Oil industry groups applauded. Separately, Sean Spicer sparred again with reporters, this time over Trump's claims that millions of illegal voters cast ballots in the election despite no evidence suggesting so. This video can not be played Sean Spicer: ""The president has believed this for a long time"" It was also announced the FBI Director James Comey would stay in his position under the Trump administration. Mr Comey, of course, is blamed by many Democrats for Hillary Clinton's election loss. He announced the FBI was looking into new Clinton emails just days before the election, before soon after saying it found no evidence of criminality. Just a reminder: it's only Tuesday. A visit to the Department of Homeland Security saw two more executive orders signed. One calls for ""a large physical barrier"" - the infamous wall - to be built on the US's southern border. The other toughened policy on illegal immigrants -""aliens"" -  including by withholding funding from so-called ""sanctuary cities"" that protect undocumented immigrants within their boundaries. In an interview with ABC News that aired on Wednesday evening, Trump said he believed waterboarding works, stating ""we have to fight fire with fire"". But Mr Trump also said he would consult Defence Secretary James Mattis and CIA director Mike Pompeo - both of whom have indicated they oppose the method - and ""if they don't want to do it that's fine"". This video can not be played Donald Trump tells ABC News that ""torture works"" A draft executive order - that the Trump team disavows as a White House document - also surfaces. It calls for a review into whether the ""black sites"" programme should be reintroduced and would scrap Mr Obama's move to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Another draft executive order emerges suggesting Trump would suspend the Syrian refugee programme and stop issuing visas from several Muslim-majority countries deemed to pose a threat to the security of the US.

Trump's voter fraud talk has liberals worried,"During a television interview on Wednesday, Donald Trump made some of his most detailed allegations about the fraud he says was responsible for Hillary Clinton's popular vote victory in the recently concluded presidential election. He said some Americans are registered and cast ballots in multiple states and that dead people and undocumented migrants are voting in droves. He added, confidently, that none of these illegal votes were for him. ""They would all be for the other side,"" he said, possibly forgetting that one of thefew arrests,externalfor voting fraud in 2016 was of an Iowa woman who tried to vote for him twice. When pressed for evidence to support his claims, Mr Trump cited a2012 Pew study,external. When ABC's David Muir noted that the author of that report had said he found no evidence of fraud, Mr Trump got personal. Donald Trump continues to talk about voter fraud in an election he won ""He's grovelling again,"" he said of the report's author, David Becker. ""You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they want to write something that you want to hear but not necessarily millions of people want to hear or have to hear."" In fact, while the Pew report did find that many voting rolls contained outdated or inaccurate information, Becker said at the time and has since repeated that there was no evidence that these problems - often caused by voters moving or individuals dying without election registrars receiving updates - constituted evidence of fraud. Mr Trump's comments have been accompanied by a raft of tweets over the course of the week. In one instance, he cited a conservative activist from Alabama, Gregg Phillips, who created a smart phone app that crowd-sources claims of voter fraud. (It is currently unavailable on the Apple app store and has fewer than 5,000 downloads on Google Play). ""Look forward to seeing final results of VoteStand,"" MrM,external. ""Gregg Phillips and crew say at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal. We must do better!"" Although Phillips has made these assertions since election day, he has yet to provide information on how he arrived at this number. Scientific studies conducted over the past decade havefound scant evidence,externalof any voter fraud. Both Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence have promised that the administration will conduct a ""major investigation"" into voter fraud. A formal executive action ordering such a inquiry could be issued in the coming days. ""Depending on the results, we will strengthen up voting procedures,"" MrTrump tweeted,external. Reality Check: Did millions vote illegally in the US? Trump pledges 'voter fraud' investigation That last line is likely painfully familiar to liberals. Although Mr Trump's comments were over the top and easily debunked, they mirror more nuanced justifications Republican politicians have offered at the state level to justify tightening voter registration procedures, imposing strict polling place identification rules and curtailing early voting opportunities. They are part and parcel, critics say, of a comprehensive plan to limit turnout of Democratic-leaning voting groups that are less likely to have necessary identification, less able to take time off to vote on election day and less comfortable navigating through voter registration procedures. ""Donald Trump is lying to the American people about undocumented people voting because he wants to set the stage for more voter suppression,"" Congressman Keith Ellison, a candidate for chair of the Democratic National Committee, told Washington'sThe Hill newspaper,external. ""Expect Trump and his henchmen to push restrictive photo ID, limit early voting and make it harder to register."" A national version of the state-level laws in places like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina - which Democrats attribute to causing lower turnout levels for Mrs Clinton in those key swing states - would be a worst-case scenario for liberals. But it's just part of the current battle over voting procedures. Chief Justice John Roberts penned a Supreme Court opinion that opened the door to new voting regulations The courts have been the site of some of the fiercest fights over voting rights in the past decade. There are multiple ongoing cases dealing with voter identification measures being considered by lower-level courts, including a challenge to a Texas law that had been supported by the Obama administration but could now be opposed by Trump lawyers. Perhaps the most significant change in US voting law came from the Supreme Court in 2013, when it struck down a section of the Voting Rights Act that required the federal government to pre-authorise any changes in balloting procedures in certain states and jurisdictions, many in the South, that had a history of voting discrimination. That decision made itsignificantly easierfor previously covered areas to implement the aforementioned voting restrictions - identification laws and early voting curtailment, in addition to the closing or relocation of polling stations. Conservatives have responded that such measures are necessary to ensure voting security - and, in any event, things like early voting are a recent development that have no constitutional protections. They argue that photo identification, required to board a plane or cash a cheque, are an everyday fact of life that present no significant burden to voters. Make no mistake, however, this fight over voter fraud is - at its heart - a nakedly partisan battle. As Republican legislators North Carolina made clear when they studied voting demographics and photo ID possession while crafting their state's election laws, it's a way to cut into their opposition's base. Civil rights activists in North Carolina protest to defend their voting rights ""Look, if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican, they would have kept early voting right where it was,"" long-time North Carolina Republican strategist Carter Wrenntold,externalthe Washington Post. ""It wasn't about discriminating against African Americans. They just ended up in the middle of it because they vote Democrat."" Democrats, one the other hand, tend to exaggerate the impact of identification laws and dismiss studies that show little effect on turnout. ""Despite Republican legislators' best attempts to suppress minority voters, study after study has found that voter ID laws have little to no effect on voter turnout,""writes,externalVox's German Lopez. ""At worst, the effect is small - barely detectable even in studies that employ multiple controls. At best, there's no effect at all or even an increase."" Other voting changes, like polling place consolidation and early voting curtailment, could have a more pronounced impact, however - and while it's unlikely any move in that regard would come at the national level, Mr Trump's rhetoric could provide cover for further state efforts. In particular, the Trump administration may be taking particular aim at Democratic states. During a recent briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer said that the coming voting fraud investigation could take a closer look at California and New York - two traditionally Democratic states that overwhelmingly backed Mrs Clinton last year. ' Add that to the already released plans to put the squeeze on cities - primarily in liberal states - that offer ""sanctuary"" to undocumented workers, and it seems increasingly like the Trump administration has political payback on its mind.

Rogue Twitter accounts battle Trump,"Twitter accounts - some set up by people claiming to work for US government agencies - have sprung up to ""resist"" President Trump on climate science. Borrowing the names of organisations like Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency they are directly attacking the president. Mr Trump has called climate change a hoax. The@RogueNASA,externalaccount says it is the ""unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA"". ""Not an official NASA account. Not managed by gov't employees. Come for the facts, stay for the snark,"" the account declares. BBC News contacted the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account called @ActualEPAFacts. They told us they acted to make sure ""factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration"". They claimed to be three EPA employees and said they acted after a gagging order stopped them from doing interviews relating to their research. Mediareports have suggested,externalthat the Trump administration sought to limit how certain government agencies - including the EPA - communicate with the public. The official EPA Twitter account has not posted since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration. World v Trump on global climate deal? President Trump: Seven ways the world could change ActualEPAFacts told us they were surprised by how many people are now following their account - more than 90,000 currently - but also felt exposed by what they were doing. The other rogue accounts also have large numbers of followers. More than 370,000 are following @RogueNasa after a handful of tweets in a few days. The rogue National Park Service account@AltNatParkSer,externalhas attracted even more people, with more than a million followers after less than 300 tweets. There are also rogue accounts for the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They use similar phrases such as ""resistance"" to describe themselves and post a mixture of scientific information and attacks on Mr Trump. Some of those running the other alternative accounts also claimed to be disgruntled government agency workers, at least going by their tweets. The @AltNatParkSer accounttweeted,externalon Tuesday that they were ""being run by several active NPS rangers and friends"". However, on Thursday theysaid they were handing over to a different group of people,external- activists and journalists who were former scientists.

Albright 'ready to join Muslim registry',"Madeleine Albright said she would declare herself Muslim if a registry was brought in by the Trump administration A former US Secretary of State and a Big Bang Theory actress have both vowed to register as Muslim if Donald Trump creates a database of Muslim Americans. Politician Madeleine Albright and Mayim Bialik said they ""stand ready"" to register, in defiance of the new President. ""I was raised Catholic, became Episcopalian & found out later my family was Jewish,"" Ms Albright - the first woman to be named Secretary of State - tweeted on Wednesday. ""I stand ready to register as Muslim in #solidarity."" The tweet gained tens of thousands of likes. Her comments come as rumours continue to circulate about an executive order which would announce extreme vetting, a refugee ban and a ban on arrivals from seven countries, said to include Syria, Yemen and Iraq. But there has been no mention of a register of American Muslims in recent months - something Mr Trump said he would ""certainly implement"" in an interview in 2015, but later distanced himself from. This video can not be played Which countries might be subject to Trump ban? A number of people vowedto stand in solidarity with America's Muslim populationafter Mr Trump's election in November, but Ms Albright's tweet appears to have inspired others to speak out - including Ms Bialik, who stars as Amy Farrah Fowler in the hit series The Big Bang Theory, one of America's most popular sitcoms. ""I'm Jewish. I stand ready to register as a Muslim in #solidarity if it comes to that,"" she wrote. Later, the outspoken Trump critic added: ""If we're registering people who you think are a threat, register white males too, since most serial killers & mass shooters are white males."" Donald Trump Jr compares Syrian refugees to Skittles Syrian tweeting girl pens letter to Trump Actress Mayim Bialik, who plays Amy Farrah Fowler in The Big Bang Theory, is an outspoken Trump critic It has been reported that the President will be announcing his new executive order on Thursday. ""Look, the president has talked extensively about extreme vetting,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, promising ""more action this week"". Many, including Ms Albright, a Czech immigrant, are highly critical of the move - which is rumoured to mean the US would accept no Syrian refugees. ""There is no fine print on the Statue of Liberty,"" she tweeted. ""America must remain open to people of all faiths & backgrounds. #RefugeesWelcome.""

Royal recognition,"The pair were honoured for services to broadcasting and entertainment The nation's favourite TV duo Ant and Dec were given the royal seal of approval today when they were awarded OBEs for services to broadcasting and entertainment by the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace. Earlier this week they scooped three prizes at the National Television Awards, including best TV presenter for the 16th year in a row. But why do we love these cheeky chums so much? What's the secret behind the unstoppable rise of these side-splitting sidekicks? Best friends The duo's first presenting job was on CBBC's The Ant & Dec show in 1995 TV producer Conor McAnally witnessed the transformation of Ant and Dec from success-hungry teenagers to grown-up lovable comrades. He saw instant potential in the two when they took on their first proper presenting gig on The Ant & Dec Show in 1995 on CBBC. ""As a producer, you're looking for that spark in a new presenter,"" says McAnally. ""Someone who can reach through the camera and grab an audience. Presenting skills, technical skills, hitting your marks, all that sort of stuff is less important in the initial stages because all that can be trained. ""But with Ant and Dec there was a symbiosis. They were each other's genuine best friend. They each thought the other was the funniest guy in the world. They wanted to hang out all the time, even off camera. You can't fake that. ""These guys could dance, they could sing, they could act, and they could talk to the camera like it was their best friend."" On screen camaraderie They got their first break in 1989 on children's drama Byker Grove. Unusually, Dec is on the left in this picture It's Ant and Dec's uncanny knack for talking directly to their audience that lies behind their genius. To many, it feels like watching friends rather than frontmen. Thick Geordie accents have helped to forge this bond with viewers - in a 2010 survey by call centre managers Sitel, Geordie was found to be the UK's friendliest dialect. ""They seem so natural and so off the cuff, but most people don't know that is because they work very, very hard,"" McAnally continues. ""Their early training as actors meant they really studied their scripts. ""Beyond that, they really go down in to the essence of the show. What's it about? What's their role in it? What are they bringing to the audience? They're both great students of entertainment television."" Behind the seemingly effortless on screen camaraderie lies an unparalleled understanding of TV expertise, believes McAnally. ""They're both really canny business guys. They understand their value. They understand the business end of television and rights and royalties and the value of the shows they've done. They're sometimes very tough negotiators."" Ant and Dec also fronted Pop Idol from 2001-03, which brought back talent shows to prime time TV While Ant and Dec have mastered being front of the camera, they also perfected the art of being behind it. Over the years the pals struck numerous lucrative TV rights deals through their production companies Gallowgate, which they sold in 2012, and Mitre, launched in 2013. As rights holders for many of their productions, in 2015 they pocketed a reported Â£1m per episode to license Saturday Night Takeaway to US networks. The series bombed across the pond - perhaps because its host Neil Patrick Harris couldn't recreate the Geordie duo's mischievous magic - but it didn't stop them netting a cool Â£15m by the time the series was axed, contributing to their total net worth of around Â£62m. Leave 'em wanting more Ant & Dec have won the best TV presenter prize at the National Television Awards for 16 consecutive years It's this TV prowess which has prevented Ant and Dec from becoming over saturated, despite having touched almost every audience demographic. Today, their three biggest shows - I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, Saturday Night Takeaway and Britain's Got Talent - each run for short bursts at a time, with gaps in between long enough to leave audiences wanting more. Perhaps Ant and Dec's biggest appeal is that they seem at home on screen. We've watched them grow up and adapt to the challenges of 21st Century television. ""As people they became more and more confident and comfortable with being Ant and Dec,"" says McAnally. ""When I started working with them on The Ant & Dec Show, they had been PJ and Duncan. ""It was a transition period when they went from playing characters on television to playing themselves, but they tackled that head on. Each new show brought new challenges and new opportunities to expand what they could do on screen."" Not every challenge resulted in new opportunities of course, but the pair have taken each bump on the road to stardom with grace and humility. Most notably, their 2008 attempt to bring gameshow Wanna Bet? to US audiences was branded""unintelligible"",externalby critics. It was cancelled after six episodes due to issues with viewers being unable to understand the duo's Geordie accents as well as the dull format. The future The pair signed a new three-year deal with ITV in November After The Ant & Dec Show, McAnally went on to produce five more shows with the pair - Ant & Dec Unzipped, Slap Bang, Friends Like These, CD:UK and SMTV. But it wasn't always plain sailing. ""There were moments where I wondered whether they would stick together. It happens a lot with duos, because working together over extended periods of time inevitably leads to conflict. ""They both had slightly different ambitions, but they both understood that their friendship was bigger than anything, and that working on their own wasn't as fun. It was a case of one plus one makes four, not two."" In November, the Geordie duosigned a new dealwith ITV rumoured to be worth Â£40m which will see them stay exclusively with the channel for another three years. So there's no chance of them slipping off our TV screens any time soon. McAnally concludes: ""There might be better presenters out there in a technical sense, but they absolutely deserve every single award they get, because no one else has ever gotten in to the hearts of the UK population like Ant and Dec.""

Future school,"Robots are finding their way into the classroom Classrooms are noticeably more hi-tech these days - interactive boards, laptops and online learning plans proliferate, but has the curriculum actually changed or are children simply learning the same thing on different devices? Some argue that the education this generation of children is receiving is little different from that their parents or even their grandparents had. But, in a world where artificial intelligence and robots threaten jobs, the skills that this generation of children need to learn are likely to be radically different to the three Rs that have for so long been the mainstay of education. The BBC went along to the Bett conference in London in search of different ways of teaching and learning. Pupils taught Pepper to dab A stone's throw from the Excel, where Bett is held, stands a new school that is, according to its head Geoffrey Fowler, currently little more than a Portakabin. Despite this, the London Design and Engineering university technical college - which caters for 14- to 19-year-olds - was massively oversubscribed when it opened its doors for the first time in September. The 180 pupils lucky enough to have got a place have had a very different experience of the curriculum in the 12 weeks since they joined. One group have designed from scratch a virtual reality environment that takes viewers on a journey around an Ethiopian village as part of a project to highlight the work of the charity Water Aid. Another has spent the term teaching Pepper - the school has two of SoftBank's human-looking robots - how to make a variety of moves, including the dab currently beloved of children around the country. Geoffrey Fowler (far right) showed off Pepper, with some of his pupils, teachers and industry partners at the Bett conference A third group are heading off this weekend on an unusual skiing trip. Travelling with them will be 11 Nao robots, which the pupils plan to teach how to ski. The school - which sets no homework, relying instead on pupils wanting to get on with their projects in their own time - is, according to Mr Fowler, ""inspiring children to be part of a new type of learning"". While other schools may see the projects listed above as fun ""add-ons"" to the core curriculum, Mr Fowler thinks it has to be embedded within it. Sixth-formers work on what is called an extended project qualification, which is the equivalent of half an A-level. The school works with a range of industry sponsors, including the University of East London, Thames Water and Fujitsu, all of which offer input into the types of skills they would like to see children learn to equip them for the workplace as well as offering apprenticeships. There are 48 university technical colleges (UTC) in England currently - and the scheme has proved controversial. One set up in East London in 2012 closed after just two years, having failed to attract enough pupils, while another in Bedfordshire was branded inadequate by Ofsted. Some head teachers seem to be resisting the idea of the vocational style of education, barring UTCs from recruiting pupils from their schools. But statistics suggest that pupils attending UTCs have just as good results if not better than those in more conventional schools. It is something James Culley, head of computer science at the school, sees for himself every day. ""I have never seen students learn so quickly,"" he told the BBC. One group of children in an Indiana school are loving learning with drones Lots of primary schools are now convinced of the importance of learning to code. As well as lessons devoted to it, after-school code clubs proliferate as do DIY computers such as the BBC's Micro Bit and the Raspberry Pi. Tynker, a company that has already brought its coding-through-games philosophy to 60,000 schools in the US, recently launched a new project - teaching coding through drone lessons. Hundreds of schools in the US have taken up the idea and it is now preparing to launch in the UK. Schools typically buy between six and 12 drones via Tynker's partnership with drone maker Parrot and can then download Tynker's free set of drone lessons. The children at Towne Meadow turn up early for drone club, said their teacher Children learn to make drones do back-flips, as well as more complex idea such as drones working together as a team. It would take, you may think, a rather brave teacher to commit to flying drones in the classroom, but Josie McKay, a Fourth Grade teacher at Towne Meadow Elementary School in Indiana has no such qualms. ""Over the last month, I have seen their confidence build as they went from coding their drone to hover off of the floor to flying their drone around the room without crashing into any obstacles,"" she says. ""Each week these students develop new and more challenging goals for themselves, work together, and code their drone accordingly. ""The excitement on their faces when they achieve their goal, especially when it is completed in a short amount of time, is infectious."" The drones come with a range of safety features, including a ""classroom mode"" that means they take off extra slowly. Children cannot take command of each other's drones, and there is an automatic stop button if inquisitive fingers come in proximity with the drone's blades. Tynker founder and chief executive Krishna Vedati told the BBC: ""Our goal is not to create programmers but to offer coding as a life skill."" Virtual reality and augmented reality could prove a huge boon to education Picture a classroom where, instead of handouts or text books, all pupils learn from their own headset - entering a virtual reality world to learn about the French revolution, or interacting with a hologram of the solar system to learn about space. According to Lenovo's global education specialist, Sam Morris, there are huge benefits from learning this way. ""We see AR and VR as the next frontier,"" he says. ""Early usage has suggested the devices engage pupils intently in tasks, improve group interactions and the ability to adapt to multiple disciplines."" Microsoft was at Bett showing off HoloLens - its recently released ""mixed reality"" headset. It has worked in conjunction with Case Western Reserve University to develop a hologram of the human body that can be dissected and bones, organs and veins viewed in detail. It is also working with education provider Pearson to develop other educational resources for the device. The developer edition of HoloLens currently sells for Â£2,719 which makes even buying one headset out of the reach for most cash-strapped schools. ""The declining cost of VR and AR devices will be critical to driving mass adoption in education,"" says Mr Morris.

What does Booker Group do?,"Byron is one of the restaurant chains Booker supplies Tesco took the retail world by surprise when it announced it was buying Britain's largest food wholesaler, Booker Group, in a Â£3.7bn deal. But what exactly does Booker do and why has the country's largest supermarket snapped it up? Booker may not be a household name but you may well have eaten in one of the restaurants it supplies or shopped at its stores. Its sprawling empire includes the UK's largest cash and carry business and a raft of well known convenience brands including Londis and Budgens. It racked up sales of some Â£5bn in the year to March 2016. Booker makes most of its money supplying branded and private-label goods to independent convenience stores, grocers and leisure outlets. It supplies thousands of product lines - from frozen food to tobacco - and claims more than 1.3 million customers. The company also supplies catering services for pubs, restaurants and other clients. Bookers' catering customers include the prison service in England and Wales Customers include the prison service in England and Wales, restaurant chains such as Byron and Prezzo, and most of the cinema chains in the UK. Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital, said Tesco's interest in the wholesale side of the business would have been driven by a desire to merge supply chains and cut costs. ""The UK supermarket scene is in a recovery phase and there are further growth opportunities. ""But it's also hugely competitive and store deflation is hitting margins, meaning anything that can be done to pare back costs in areas like procurement, supply chain, distribution and store footprint is a good thing."" A raft of well known convenience store brands operate under franchise agreements with Booker, buying in its goods and services. These include more than 3,200 Premier branded stores, 47 discount stores operating under the Family Shopper brand, 1,500 Londis stores, and 120 Budgens shops. Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research said that the quality of these shops was likely to improve through the Tesco deal. Booker operates more than 1,500 Londis stores under franchise agreements ""Convenience stores are not known for their fresh food, but Tesco is,"" he told the BBC. ""So I expect Bookers' stores will improve their produce offerings which will be attractive to customers."" Booker also owns Makro, the cash-and-carry brand, with 30 outlets across the UK. And it has taken its operations into India, where it claims to serve more than 21,000 customers through franchise convenience stores.

Barbara Plett Usher: Top US diplomats leave State,"The resignations put pressure on incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Top US diplomats in the State Department's senior management team are leaving their posts during President Donald Trump's first week on the job. Their departure puts more pressure on the incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is still awaiting confirmation by the Senate, to fill the crucial positions that keep the Department running smoothly. They include the Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, two assistant secretaries, Joyce Barr and Michele Bond, and Gentry Smith, who directs the office of foreign missions. This quartet were among a number of senior employees at the State Department who had submitted resignations for their current posts, which were limited-term appointments, as is standard practice during a transition. These four were career foreign service officers who'd had years of experience managing both the department and foreign missions, and they leave a void. ""It's the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember, and that's incredibly difficult to replicate,"" a chief of staff for former Secretary of State John Kerry, David Wade, told the Washington Post. Rex Tillerson - the wild card diplomat Trump and trade: A radical agenda? Trump's 'control-alt-delete' on climate change policy Donald Trump's Mexico wall: Who is going to pay for it? It is not uncommon for senior officials to stay on for a while to smooth the transition to a new administration, or to be given other jobs within the foreign service. But it appears Mr Tillerson will be assembling a new team. None of the departing officers has linked his or her exit to President Trump's unorthodox positions on foreign policy issues. Questions have been raised over how smoothly the department will be run in their absence And some were of retirement age, having spent upwards of 40 years in the foreign service. ""To be honest, where else do you go when you've been an assistant or under secretary,"" said a senior US official. The American Foreign Service Association, which represents the labour rights of foreign service officers, said there was nothing unusual about rotations and retirements during a change of administration. But in a statement it noted that this ""appears to be a large turnover in a short period of time.""

Saints fans in post box celebration,"This post box in Bargate was one of two to be decorated with white paint Southampton football fans have celebrated their team reaching the EFL Cup final by painting the city's post boxes in the club's famous stripes. Two red post boxes have been given white stripes to match the Saints' colours since Wednesday's semi-final win over Liverpool at Anfield. The makeovers have been met with support by local business owners and residents who called it a ""fun"" change. But Royal Mail said it planned to remove the stripes as soon as possible. Southamptonbeat Liverpool 2-0 across two legsto earn trip to Wembley for the cup finalagainst Manchester Unitedon 26 February. But rather than painting the town red, some fans got out the white paint to celebrate and the post boxes in Queens Way and Bargate were adorned with the stripes. Shane Long sealed Southampton's progress against Liverpool Southampton wore their away kit in the win over Liverpool but usually play in red and white Graeme McLeish, owner of Oceans Gift Shop, said: ""It appeals to my sense of humour, I suppose technically it is vandalism but it's just a bit of fun and knowing how big Saints are becoming I think it's a celebration and patriotic."" Kerry Browne, a news agent shop assistant in Above Bar Street, added: ""I just think why not, it's not harming anyone and it's a bit of fun. Maybe if they manage to win the cup we should get them re-painted and make it a proper tribute."" A Royal Mail spokesman said: ""We congratulate Southampton FC on their success however will be returning the post boxes to their original colour as soon as it is reasonably possible.""

Theresa May's name misspelled in US memo,"A White House schedule sent to journalistsahead of a press conference with US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas misspelled her name. The schedule referred to the prime minister three times as ""Teresa May"", leaving out the ""h"" in her first name. The mistake happened after the prime minister addressed US politicians in Philadelphia on Thursday. In her speech, Mrs May called for closer ties between the UK and US. The press schedule, which was sent from the office of the new White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, originally said: ""In the afternoon, the president will partake in a bilateral meeting with United Kingdom Prime Minister, Teresa May."" Part of the uncorrected White House schedule sent out on Friday. It later repeated the mistake, saying: ""The president participates in a working luncheon with Teresa May, Prime Minister of United Kingdom."" The same error was also made once in a guidance note from the office of Vice-President Mike Pence. The prime minister's name was, however, spelled correctly elsewhere in the same note. The White House press office later sent out an updated guidance note with the correct spelling. The White House press secretary later tweeted about the day, including Theresa May's Twitter handle Mrs May's speech on Thursday mentioned the ""special relationship"" between the UK and US eight times. The phrase is an unofficial term for the close cultural, historical and political relationship between the United States and the UK. It was first coined by Prime Minister Winston Churchill- a political hero of the new American president - during a 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri. Mrs May's meeting on Friday will be the first between a foreign leader and President Trump. May and Trump hold talks at White House Mrs May goes to Washington Trump and May - Do opposites attract?

"Allan Little: Beware hate speech, says Auschwitz survivor","More than a million people, mostly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz At the age of 13, Susan Pollack - now a retired grandmother living in north London - was taken from her home in rural Hungary, loaded into a cattle truck and transported by rail through German-occupied Poland. She and her family were told they were going to be resettled. The journey took six days and some in the truck died on the way. ""There was some straw on the floor,"" she told me. ""It was dark, it was cold, it was so hostile. And hardly any space for sitting down. There was a lot of crying, lots of children. And we were trapped. Doors were shut, we knew this was not going to be any resettlement but we had no imagination of course of what was to come."" The doors opened at Auschwitz. Susan Pollack survived because she lied about her age There, on the railway platform, Nazi officers separated those chosen to live and work from those sent immediately to die. Susan lied about her age. A prisoner on the platform whispered to her that she should say she was 15. It saved her life, but her mother was sent immediately to the gas chamber. ""There were no hugs, no kisses, no embrace. My mum was just pushed away with the other women and children. The dehumanisation began immediately. I didn't cry, it was as though I'd lost all my emotions."" Soviet forces entered Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945. The Nazis had abandoned the camp days earlier, leaving much of it intact. More than a million people, mostly Jews - but Poles, Roma and political prisoners as well - had been murdered there. Those railway lines - which can be still seen at Auschwitz-Birkenau today - extended to almost every corner of Europe. The Holocaust was not a solely German enterprise. It required the active collaboration of Norwegian civil servants, French police and Ukrainian paramilitaries. Every occupied country in Europe had its enthusiastic participants. MPs mark Holocaust Memorial Day Holocaust Memorial Day: What can we learn? Antiques Roadshow sheds new light on ring belonging to Jane Haining iWonder: Why did ordinary people commit atrocities in the Holocaust? After 1945, a great silence fell across the continent. The Jews who survived found that the world beyond the perimeter wire of the camps did not much want to know their story. These children were photographed by a Red Army soldier on the day the camp was liberated It was only in the 1960s that popular consciousness began to catch up with the crime perpetrated against an entire people. Holocaust denial persists. The internet is full of claims that the destruction of the Jews never happened. ""Sometimes they want to call themselves revisionist historians,"" says Pawel Sawicki, who works at the Auschwitz site, which now attracts two million visitors a year. ""But they are not. They hate others. This is anti-Semitism."" At the Nuremberg trials after the war, leading Nazis were held accountable for the state-sponsored crimes that had been committed in Germany and German-occupied territories. For the first time, two new terms entered the grim lexicon of wartime atrocity - crimes against humanity and genocide. This is the Nazis' judicial legacy - that from 1945, sovereign states no longer had legal carte blanche to treat their own citizens as they pleased. ""That's the amazing, revolutionary, remarkable change that happened in 1945,"" says Philippe Sands, an international human rights lawyer who has worked extensively on war crimes prosecutions. ""Before 1945, if a state wished to kill half its population, or torture or maim or disappear, there was no rule of international law that said you couldn't do that. The change that occurred in 1945 - as we know very sadly - has not prevented horrors from taking place. Hermann Goering was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials in 1946 ""But it does mean that when horrors occur, there is now at least an objective standard that says to governments, to individual states, that as a matter of international law: 'you cannot do what you are doing'."" Near the blockhouses where Auschwitz prisoners were housed, there is a large open trench about the size and shape of a swimming pool. During the war it was filled with water. Why? It was required by the camp's fire insurance policy. There is something grotesquely chilling about this - that a camp whose purpose was mass extermination would, at the same time, concern itself with sensible precaution and compliance with insurance law. And the company that insured the camp is still trading. There is a warning in this to posterity - to us, here today. As the UK marks Holocaust Memorial Day, Mrs Pollack issues a stark warning about the importance of learning the lessons from history. ""We're not talking about barbarians,"" says Mrs Pollack. ""We're not talking about primitive society. ""The Germans were well-advanced, educated, progressive. Maybe civilization is just veneer-thin. We all need to be very careful about any hate-propaganda. ""This is very important. It starts as a small stream, but then it has the potential to erupt  - and when it does, it's too late to stop it."" Correction 28 January 2017: This article has been amended to remove a reference to Polish train drivers being among those who collaborated with Germany.

Bomber jackets and BBQs,"The traditional exchange of gifts between the US and UK leaders has not always run smoothly - with leather jackets and trench coats among the notable rejections. But some are the gifts that keep giving, with Queen Victoria's 1880 present - the Oval Office's Resolute desk - used by President Donald Trump on his first day in the White House. Theresa May presented the US president with aquaich, a traditional Scottish cup of friendship, while First Lady Melania Trump received a hamper of produce from the prime minister's country residence, Chequers. In return, the UK prime minister was given a framed picture of Abraham Lincoln swearing the Oath of Office on the same copy of the Bible used by Mr Trump at his inauguration. Mrs Trump, meanwhile, gave a pair of silver cufflinks by New York designer David Yurman to Mrs May's husband, Philip. But how do these gifts compare to those exchanged by leaders past? Most presents held by UK government departments include works of art, watches, wine and jewellery. But under the ministerial code of conduct, if government ministers want to keep a gift personally they are obliged to declare presents worth more than Â£140. So while smaller gifts will remain unknown, news of some of the bigger - and stranger gifts - have been disclosed to the public. Artist Ben Eine, who has worked with Banksy, began his career by ""tagging"" his name on buildings On his first trip to Washington as prime minister in 2010,David Cameron's official giftto President Barack Obama included a painting by a graffiti artist. The work, Twenty First Century City, by Ben Eine, was said to be one of Mr Cameron's wife Samantha's favourite artists. Mr Obama continued the art theme by presenting the Camerons with a signed lithograph by pop artist Ed Ruscha. The piece, Column with Speed Lines, was chosen for its red, white and blue colours matching the British and American flags. Writing on his website, Ben Eine - who has worked with Banksy - said it had been a ""weird day"" because ""David Cameron has given one of my paintings to President Obama in an art swap"". The Camerons gave the Obamas a table tennis table in a nod to the match the men played in 2011 Thefollowing year, Obama chose to give the Camerons a customised ""one-of-a-kind"" barbecue as a reminder of their time flipping burgers together in the 10 Downing Street garden during the Obamas' London visit in May 2011. In return, the Camerons gave the president and his family a customised Dunlop table tennis table. It's a nod to the match the two men played against school children in south London during the same 2011 trip. Mrs Cameron also gave First Lady Michelle Obama a printed blue scarf by Scottish designer Jonathan Saunders, inspired by Victorian wallpaper. Gordon Brown rejected the 'Camp David' jacket which was a present from George W Bush In 2009, Mr Obama was criticised for lack of thought when he presented previous Prime Minister Gordon Brown with a set of 25 DVDs of classic US films, when Mr Brown visited Washington. Mr Brown gave the US president a pen and holder carved from an anti-slavery ship and biographies of Winston Churchill, worth $16,510. Perhaps Mr Obama was trying to play it safe after Mr Bush's gift the previous year, of a fur-trimmed leather bomber jacket, had been rejected by Mr Brown. The jacket was emblazoned with the presidential logo and featured Mr Brown's name. All gifts over a certain value have to be declared by government ministers - but Mr Brown chose not to pay for the jacket, according toreports,externalat the time. It is not known if Tony Blair received one of the Camp David leather bomber jackets In 2003, a list of presents given to President George W Bush since he had taken office in 2001 included a Â£216 sponge bag from Prime Minister Tony Blair. The toilet bag was believed to have been a light-hearted reference to the president's comment on first meeting Mr Blair that they had at least one thing in common - the same toothpaste. It had ""GWB"" embossed in gold on the top. Mr Blair's gift was notably cheaper than some, with Russia's Vladimir Putin presenting a Â£12,000 pen and Afghan President Hamid Karzai gifting a Â£3,000 wool and silk rug. But it was not the cheapest on the list - Morocco gave Mr Bush a Â£2 jar of fish bait. ""I'm sure he thought: 'What in the world is going on?' said Lyndon Johnson's personal ambassador In the 1960s, Prime Minister Harold Wilson reportedly gave President Lyndon Johnson a Burberry coat. Lloyd Hand, who was the president's chief of protocol and personal ambassador at the time, told USNational Public Radio,external: ""President Johnson opened the box and put the coat on, and the sleeves came about halfway on his arms. ""He said 'Lloyd, see if you can catch the prime minister and tell him this is the wrong size.' Mr Hand said he stuffed the coat back in the box and raced down the steps, out of the diplomatic entrance and to the driveway where Mr Wilson was leaving. As the prime minister's car rolled down the driveway, Mr Hand rapped on the window. ""I'm sure he thought: 'What in the world is going on?', and I told him the story and he laughed and said, 'Of course I'll get it and I'll get the right size and get it back to him,'"" he said. The Resolute desk was moved into the Oval Office by President John F Kennedy in 1961 Considered one of the White House's ""treasures"" today, the president's desk in the Oval Office was a present from Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B Hayes in 1880. Known as the ""Resolute desk"" it was made from the oak timbers of the British ship HMS Resolute and has been used by every president since Mr Hayes, apart from Presidents Johnson, Nixon and Ford, according to the White House Historical Association. It was first used in the Oval Office in 1961 at the request of President John F Kennedy. Sir John is not the only recipient of an Akhal-Teke stallion - Russia has presented one to Bahrain Some of the more unusual gifts showered on our UK leaders in recent years may not have come from the US, but have included Mr Blair's Segway scooter - presented by the King of Jordan, and a bronze fox from the government of Belgium. Other presentsreceived by Mr Blair,externalincluded an electric car from the president of Ferrari and three guitars - one of them from rock star Bryan Adams. But perhaps the stand-out gift of note is Sir John Major's ""gift horse"". In 1993, then-Prime Minister Sir John was presented with a framed photograph of a horse called Maksat, a pure-bred Akhal-Teke stallion, by the President of Turkmenistan. The only snag was that the animal was in Turkmenistan and the UK was expected to collect it. Sir John decided he wouldn't have been able to keep the animal, so the Household Cavalry decided to take it,leading to one of the strangest assignments ever taken on by a British diplomat.

'The back way',"The Gambia is one of the poorest countries in the world Considering its population of less than two million, The Gambia accounts for a high proportion of those crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe. The BBC's Alastair Leithead asks whether the new president can change this. In a tiny shop unit along a dark corridor and through a narrow alleyway in The Gambia's biggest market, Samba Ceesay is sorting through the clothes he has for sale. He arrived back last November - just before the election - after 15 months away from home following what everyone here calls ""the back way"". It's the well-trodden migrant path to Europe through Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso to Niger, and then north through Libya to the coast, to risk a Mediterranean crossing. Mr Ceesay, 26, got as far as Burkina Faso before he was captured by an organised crime syndicate. ""They said they would help me but they took everything I had - all my money and my things - and locked me up,"" he said. ""They threatened to kill me unless my family sent ransom money, but we have nothing. They held me for a month."" Eventually they released him, and despite having lost all his money he kept going. Samba Ceesay had a terrible experience trying to reach Europe He reached southern Libya, but with no job or chance of making the money needed to cross the Sahara or pay for passage across the Mediterranean, he gave up. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) office in the migrant hub of Agadez in Niger, helped him return home to The Gambia. Mr Ceesay's family were initially disappointed he hadn't made it - they'd supported his plan to head to Europe and try to earn money to send home. Now Famara Njie from the IOM is helping him re-integrate through training to help improve his chances of getting a job. ""If you don't make your way to Europe and you come back empty-handed without any means to re-start your life, it makes things very, very difficult to re-integrate yourself back in the community,"" he said. It's known as ""irregular migration"" - most people leaving The Gambia are economic migrants, and for the size of the country there are a lot of them. There are less than two million Gambians, and by percentage of population more people head to Europe than any other nation. ""It is a growing problem, because we've seen people from all walks of life - policemen leaving their jobs, teachers leaving their jobs embarking on this way,"" said Mr Njie. ""Minors - those who should be in school to complete their basic educationâ¦ we have seen them embarking on this journey, which is a really, really very troubling situation for the country."" Top women's football side, Red Scorpions, lost their goalkeeper, who drowned in the Mediterranean last year Across The Gambia thousands of people are leaving their homes. Less than an hour's drive from the capital, in the village of Kitty, many people have left using ""the back way"". People here are poor and it's strikingly clear whose relatives have made it to Europe, because they are building fantastic new homes. Money goes a long way here and so remittances are paying for gleaming tin roofs, houses with fancy pillars and large courtyards. There are satellite TV dishes attached to the walls and plots of land cleared and pegged out waiting for construction to begin. It's this obvious incentive which drives many people to risk everything. Migrants arriving in Italy and Greece (2016) Source:International Organization for Migration,external In a dusty clearing in central Banjul, amid the beautiful, orange, late afternoon light, the Red Scorpions are training. They're the country's top women's football team and many also play for the national side. Their goalkeeper, Fatim Jawara, 20, went missing last year, and then word came that she and her friend had drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean. ""She was so friendly, humble, always laughing - we were like twins,"" said her brother Momodou Jawara, 36, sitting with a photograph of her wearing her football strip. ""Thousands and thousands of people have gone - I wish I knew why. ""I don't have that kind of mentality, but what we believe is people always talk about greener pastures, wanting to be out doing something for their family as most of them complain about a lack of jobs."" He thinks she might have gone to try and play football in Europe ""but I'm not in her mind, and I'm not sure what put her in it"". Fatim Jawara: She was so friendly, humble, always laughing, says her brother With the return of new President Adama Barrow, there are great expectations that life will improve after 22 years of Yahya Jammeh's rule. Under Mr Jammeh, human rights and freedom of speech were not respected. While this might change with a new government, it will be more difficult to raise living standards in what is one of the poorest countries in the world. ""It will take time. What kind of factories are we going to build, what kind of industry are we going to provide for the youths?"" asks Mr Jawara. A huge deposit of oil was recently found off the coast of neighbouring Senegal. It's believed that find may extend into Gambian territorial waters, which could provide a huge boost to the economy over the coming decades. The new president will serve just three years and is barred from standing in the next election, so it's hoped he can focus on laying foundations for the economy to improve. Big new houses built in poor villages show what reaching Europe means But people have high expectations, which will be hindered by the complexities of coalition politics. Seven different political parties joined forces, plucking Mr Barrow from relative obscurity to drive President Jammeh from power. The Red Scorpions have high hopes. ""This new government coming in will help the youths to have more job opportunities, schools will be available for them.  I can see a bright future for the Gambian youth,"" said striker Adama Tamba, 18. ""This new government, it will help us a lot,"" agreed Fatou Fatty, 19, the captain of the national team. But there's a lot of work to do to prevent people being lured to take ""the back way"" to bring money home and lift their families out of poverty.

Theresa May: No more wars like Iraq,"Theresa May's upcoming meeting with Donald Trump features on many of the front pages The Daily Telegraph focuses,externalon Prime Minister Theresa May's promise that there will be - in the words of its headline - ""no more wars like Iraq"". It says she was cheered by Republican politicians on Thursday night as she made what the paper sees as ""the biggest shift in UK foreign policy for more than 20 years"". Mrs May, the paper's editorial argues, is ""embracing realism"" in a change that in many ways mirrors that outlined by Donald Trump. ""May buries Blair doctrine in nod to US,"" is the headline for the Financial Times. It believes she was, in some respects, bowing to the inevitable, but notes what it sees as her ""plea to the president"" on the duty of both countries to provide world leadership. The Daily Mail says,externalMrs May's barnstorming speech wowed Republican politicians. It says she received rapturous applause after vowing ""no more failed foreign wars"" and welcomes what it calls ""an end to the era of Blair follies"". ""Let's stand together and halt eclipse of the West"" is the headline for the Times, which believes the main message of the prime minister's speech was urging President Trump not to shirk his ""obligation"" to lead the world. It says she also matched parts of Mr Trump's controversial foreign policy, including admitting it was time to engage Russia in the search for peace in Syria. But,for the i,external, Mrs May invoked the ""spirit of the Cold War"", warning the president that the UK and the US needed to engage with the Kremlin from a position of strength. The Sun,externalbelieves her ""radical change of course"" was a ""direct slap-down"" to David Cameron on Libya, as well as to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for Iraq and Afghanistan. There is also much coverage of the prime minister's comment about Mr Trump that ""sometimes, opposites attract"". For the Times,external, Mrs May's response was ""verging on the coquettish"" - acknowledging there are few obvious connections but allowing, it says, for ""the possibility of a spark"". The Guardian's editorial,externalcautions it would be naive for her to treat the visit as ""traditional statecraft"" but says it is not impossible she may be able to steer the president towards more balanced approaches - ""she must try"", it says. The Financial Times,externalbelieves her upbeat comments did little to conceal the complexity of developing the special relationship when, it says, she disagrees with Mr Trump on many fundamental issues. The Daily Mirror,externalbelieves her remarks risk enraging millions of women. It says it hopes she can secure the best outcome for Britain, without having to get too close to what it calls ""this odious and increasingly offensive leader"".

Carrie Gracie: China's global gamble in era of Trump,"Is Xi Jinping's China destined to be the world's reigning superpower? At his inauguration last week President Trump reframed the American mission from leadership of a global rules-based system in the interests of all, to 'America first'. Meanwhile the leader of Communist China rebranded his prickly protectionist power as the defender of globalisation and shared values. So after week one in this upside down new world, how stands China's bid for global leadership? A week is just a week, but when it comes to strategic focus, China is on course. It's easier to look laser sharp when the competition is in disarray. Here the internal difficulties of the US and the European Union are helpful to China. As Chinese Foreign Ministry official Zhang Jun put it in a discussion with foreign journalists: ""If people want to say China has taken a position of leadership, it's not because China suddenly thrust itself forward as a leader. It's because the original front-runners suddenly fell back and pushed China to the front."" China goes big in Davos - and here's why Can Xi Jinping be star of the show? In the past week alone, a bitter row over the size of the crowd at the Trump inauguration, followed by street protests the next day, underlined the divisions of the world's superpower even at the very moment which was supposed to heal. For China's citizens, brought up to see street protests as dangerous, this was another symptom of dysfunction in a political system they've been taught to distrust. And next, an American president echoed Beijing's message that the mainstream American media can't be trusted. So it's been a week to put a spring in the step of China's communists, to shake off the inferiority complex of an autocratic political system, and even to advance the claim that China's system is superior. Among business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Xi talked the language of global togetherness, but back home his Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily, lost no time in declaring the bankruptcy of Western politics. ""The emergence of capitalism's social crisis is the most updated evidence to show the superiority of socialism and Marxism,"" it said. Mr Xi made anti-protectionism comments aimed at the US when he spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos This ideological inoculation is invaluable for Xi Jinping ahead of the vital Communist Party Congress which will clarify China's leadership line-up for the next five years. What's more, greater political confidence at home allows him to focus out. The inauguration of a billionaire celebrity promising to make America great again through building walls confirms the view of some in Beijing that the United States is in terminal decline, and that this is a moment of opportunity for China. President Xi's favourite slogans are the ""China Dream"" and the ""great rejuvenation of the Chinese people"". But it's all happening faster than his predecessors could have imagined. It's less than two decades since China fully entered a US-led world of global capitalism. When China joined the World Trade Organization, it complained bitterly about living under rules made by the US and its friends, while fully expecting to live under those rules for decades to come. But November's American presidential election finished what the 2008 financial crisis had begun: a shift in worldview. And now we are one week into the new leadership mission set out by President Xi at Davos. Some in China believe Mr Trump's America is in terminal decline A word about character. In China there are some who compare Mr Trump's character and leadership style with China's Chairman Mao. They point to the former's relentless tweeting as a new version of the latter's daily deluge of quotations. They note other similarities: the unpredictability, distrust of media, and overwhelming self-confidence. Some admire and some despise, but Donald Trump, they say, is a great disrupter in the Maoist mould. All of which is a discussion which takes some of the heat off President Xi at home. Until recently critics accused him of Maoist tendencies after his relentless concentration of titles and power and his frenetic media personality cult. But as China's citizens look out on a world of strongmen this week, their own president may seem comparatively sober, predictable and experienced: not too much the Caesar, nor too little, for a global leader in our age. Cult of personality: Why is China dancing for 'Uncle Xi'? How China guards the Xi creation myth Meanwhile Mr Xi's outward facing message, that China wants a world of fair trade and globalisation, got a boost this week from several quarters, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The Chinese-led development bank said it is set for expansion. It currently has nearly 60 members and now says another 25 are likely to join this year. Two years ago when the AIIB was launched, it became a symbol of the pulling power of China's money and nimble diplomacy when US allies lined up to join despite strong US opposition. This week, AIIB president Jin Liqun told journalists, it was China's turn to contribute to the world: ""China needs to do something that can help it be recognised as a responsible leader."" But in the long view, if this week is to be remembered as a tipping point towards Chinese power, it will not be because of anything announced in Beijing but because of what happens in Washington. One of President Trump's first acts in office was to sign an executive order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact which the Obama administration had insisted would cement US leadership in Asia. ""Protection will lead to greater strength"", said Mr Trump. But in an open letter, outgoing US ambassadors in the region disagreed. ""Walking away from TPP may be seen by future generations as the moment America chose to cede leadership to others in this part of the world and accept a diminished role."" Certainly in response to the Trump announcement, US ally and TPP signatory Australia immediately said it hoped to recast the trade agreement without the US, and said China might be invited to join. TPP: What is it and why does it matter? How much truth is there in Trump's TPP claims? The TPP has been opposed by many in the US Asia is the key testing ground where the US stands in the way of China's ambitions. Since the end of World War Two, Washington has insisted that the US is in Asia for the good of all and invested decades in diplomacy and defence to maintain the liberal international order. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump expressed impatience with that investment. And having withdrawn from the TPP, the Trump administration will have to find a new way to nurture key allies and partners in the region and to reassure them that 'America first' does not mean everyone else last. But at the same moment, China's diplomats and bankers are stepping up their efforts and their focus does not waver. Last year, Beijing turned an international legal defeat over the South China Sea into a diplomatic triumph by charming and disarming the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. In the Trump era, it has other US allies in its sights. Only this week, Thailand confirmed funding for the purchase of a Chinese submarine. But on security, the week also saw a cloud on China's leadership horizon. The new White House spokesman Sean Spicer seemed to echo warnings to China from incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he sketched out a position on the South China Sea. ""We're going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country,"" said Mr Spicer. It's not clear exactly what he meant or exactly what Mr Tillerson meant, but a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman immediately restated China's claim to sovereignty in the region, and insisted that Beijing would be resolute in defending its own rights and interests. The Chinese navy has been carrying out military drills in the South China Sea this month If the Trump administration is to push back against China in the South China Sea it will need support from US allies who ask themselves whether Mr Trump has the strategic focus necessary for such a risky undertaking. China will naturally encourage those doubts given its preference for making domination of the South China Sea a fait accompli with as little fuss as possible. But there are many players, many unpredictable variables and many wrong moves in this game. One week into the new world order, China's leaders may feel some things are playing into their hand. But it will be many months, perhaps years, before they can judge whether China's global gamble is a win against Trump's America. Why is Xi Jinping going to Davos?

Lucky money,"Are the traditional red envelope gifts at Chinese New Year being replaced by digital versions? Over this weekend's Chinese New Year celebrations, millions of people will give each other cash-filled red envelopes, called hongbao in Mandarin. But this year, a record number of these red envelopes will be digital and sent online over social messaging services such as Tencent's WeChat, usually via smartphone. The numbers are breathtaking. Over the six-day Chinese Spring Festival period last year, 516 million people sent and received 32 billion digital red envelopes - 10 times the number as over the same period in 2015. And this year forecasters are expecting up to 100 billion digital envelopes to be sent and received by Chinese well-wishers around the world. It's a vivid illustration of how the world of money is changing, given that we can now send money to each other as easily as sending an email or text. Global research firm Ovum thinks the value of these mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) payments could top $270bn (Â£214bn) worldwide in 2019. 2017 is the Chinese Year of the Rooster So why is sending money this way proving so popular, particularly among younger people? ""Social messaging has become the defining app of the smartphone era,"" says Jeremy Allaire, chief executive of P2P payments app, Circle Pay. ""Social payments has been a natural extension of this phenomenon - it's going to be the locus of most communications activity."" Paying somebody by text is quick and easy, removing the hassle of having to go out to a cash machine and hand over money in person. All you usually need is their mobile phone number or email address. Even if they haven't yet downloaded the app they receive a message telling them money is waiting for them once they've registered. Whether you're splitting a dinner bill between friends, contributing to shared household costs, or simply sending a gift, payment apps offer convenience within an encrypted, secure environment. And the fact that these payment apps can sit within messaging apps means you can settle bills without even interrupting your group chat. Circle Pay's Jeremy Allaire thinks social messaging and payments are the future The Chinese social media platforms operated by the tech giants Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have spearheaded the social payments explosion in Asia. While in the US, PayPal-owned Venmo has been growing at a phenomenal pace and looks set to reach about $20bn in annual transaction volume this year. In Africa, M-pesa has blazed a trail and is also now available in India. Facebook Messenger, which now claims to have more than one billion users globally, has been offering in-app payments since 2015 in the US, but is now poised to expand the service throughout Europe after acquiring the relevant ""e-money"" banking licenses. ""There's an opportunity to create the WhatsApp of payments and to make this work globally,"" says Mr Allaire, whose payment service is also available within the Apple iMessage app. He envisages a world in which there are no barriers to sending money anywhere. Young people in particular are happy to use their phones as digital wallets ""I can send and receive content instantly for free, by text, email and video - so why can't I do the same with money? It's just data and software,"" he says. Circle's service is built on crypto currency Bitcoin's blockchain system, which enables transactions to be verified and completed quickly and securely, even across borders. And it is this crossborder facility that offers great potential, Mr Allaire believes, largely because banks tend to charge far more than P2P platforms. ""I can beam money to my kids wherever they happen to be in the world at a cost of 0.3%, whereas banks will typically charge 3%,"" he says. But smartphones have been around for nearly a decade, so what has changed to explain this sudden surge in the popularity of social payments? ""The regulatory environment improved,"" says James Morton, head of UK and Netherlands for Mangopay, a P2P payments platform powering several other apps, such as Pumpkin. Are we entering the era of low-cost borderless money transfers? ""To hold client money you have to be regulated, which was a big hurdle to overcome. And the payments infrastructure was quite archaic, working only from bank to bank with a complex structure of issuers, acquirers and processors - it was a very manual process."" Allowing firms to become ""e-money issuers"" opened the door to tech companies to automate a lot of these background processes, including the authentication, data protection and money laundering requirements imposed by regulators. An internationalbank-to-bank money transfer,externalcan still take days to clear - despite efforts to introduce faster payments - whereas P2P payments can be completed in seconds. And now that younger generations trust the security of their apps and phones - verifying transactions by fingerprint or even facial recognition - P2P service providers are interposing themselves between banks and acting as money repositories themselves. For example, Venmo enables its 12 million users to load their Venmo accounts with money and use this fund to pay other people and make in-app purchases. A Chinese student returning home for the Spring Festival pays her fare using the Alipay app Chinese networks Alipay and WeChat allow users to pay utility bills from their accounts. They can also transfer money back to their main bank account within a business day. It's the kind of service PayPal already offers for its customers through its PayPal.me service. ""If you look at how the gig and sharing economy is growing, I think payments infrastructure will remove the necessity for having your bank debit account for anything other than paying bills,"" says Mr Morton. New P2P payment providers have sprung up all over the place: Square Cash, FaceCash Payfriendz, TransferWise, the relaunched Google Wallet, People Pay, Popmoney, Snapcash, Dwolla - the list goes on. Not that the big banks are twiddling their thumbs while tech upstarts steal their business. In the US, a company called Early Warning, which is owned by big names such as Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, has set up a P2P payments business called ClearXchange with access to more than 100 million customers. All you need to send money to someone else's bank account for free is their email address or mobile phone number, much like the UK's PayM system. Card issuers Visa and Mastercard have joined up with ClearXchange to allow people to make P2P payments via their MasterCard Send and Visa Direct platforms. These are exciting times in the world of P2P payments - more competition, more convenience, lower costs. But in the Chinese Year of the Rooster, it remains to be seen whether a digital red envelope will bring as much luck and good fortune as the traditional paper one.

Prisons crisis?,"Levels of violence are up, staff numbers are down and complaints about overcrowding are widespread. Why are prisons in England and Wales under pressure? ""There's an incident at height - the prison's in lockdown."" I was in the gate-lodge at High Down Prison in Surrey when a message came through from the governor. BBC Special Report: Prisons under pressure,external The Ministry of Justice - which controls prisons in England and Wales - had, unusually, granted permission for me to visit a jail for aradio documentary about prison violence. High Down prison in Surrey They had chosen High Down, a prison built on the site of an old mental hospital and now home to 1,100 male inmates. I waited in the visitors centre worried my visit might be cancelled, but half an hour later the incident had been resolved. Ian Bickers, the High Down governor at the time of my visit in December 2014, brushed aside what had happened. A prisoner had clambered on to the safety netting under a landing because he was unhappy with the regime and wanted to move to another jail. Mr Bickers explained that prisoner protests were a common occurrence, but required adept handling. At that stage, High Down was on the edge of instability. Since then, a number of jails in England and Wales have fallen over the edge. This video can not be played The footage is understood to have been filmed by inmates of HMP Birmingham The recent disturbances at Lewes, Bedford, Birmingham and Swaleside prisons; the fatal stabbing of an inmate at Pentonville, followed by the escape of two of its prisoners; and therecord number of prisoner suicidesand assaults on staff all provide concrete evidence of the turmoil behind bars. In 2015, in his last annual report as Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick said jails were in their worst state for a decade. Last year, David Cameron, in one of his final domestic policy speeches as prime minister,said reoffending rates and levels of prison violence, drug-taking and self-harm ""should shame us all"". Even Liz Truss, who as justice secretary has overall responsibility for prisons, acknowledges that they're ""not working"" and are under ""serious and sustained pressure"". There have always been problems. For many years, internal reports painted a picture of daily outbreaks of violence, cell fires and self-harm across the prisons estate. This video can not be played The aftermath of the 1990 Strangeways Prison riot The worst disorder in the history of the prison service came in 1990 when two people died and hundreds were injured during rioting at Strangeways, in Manchester.  It evolved into a 25-day protest against the squalid conditions and was followed by disturbances at eight other prisons. The report into Strangeways was meant to be a watershed. It did lead to some improvements, including the beginning of the end of the practice of slopping out, where prisoners used chamber pots in their cells, but it did not herald an end to prison overcrowding. The principal reason is numbers. England and Waleswent from almost 45,000 prisoners in 1991 to 85,000 two decades later- an increase of nearly 90%. Justice and policing are devolved matters for Scotland and Northern Ireland. There has been nothing like the same rise in the jail population in Scotland, where the latest figure, around 7,200, is the lowest it has been for a decade. In Northern Ireland, there are some 1,500 people in custody, about 300 fewer than in the mid-1990s. So why did numbers rise so steeply in England and Wales? Some lobby groups and criminologists point to a ""moral panic"" following the murder in 1993 of the toddler James Bulger. Experts describe a sentencing ""arms race"" between political parties vying to be the strongest on law and order. Former Conservative leader Michael Howard's ""prison works"" versus former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"". This video can not be played Inside Wandsworth Prison: Trashed cells, hooch and legal highs Whatever the reasons, average sentence lengths have crept up,more offenders have been jailed for life or indeterminate termsand growing numbers of released prisoners have had to return to custody for breaching their licence conditions. New jails have been built, but have not kept up with demand. The Prison Reform Trust (PRT) calculates that an average of 20,000 prisoners, almost a quarter of the total, are held in overcrowded conditions. Many share cells designed for one. At times, when Labour was in power, there was so little spare capacity that cells at police stations and in court buildings were used to hold inmates. To ease the pressure, a scheme was introduced to let prisoners out up to 18 days before their standard release date, halfway through their sentence. Eighty-thousand inmates were freed under the scheme - in addition to those released early under an existing programme which required them to wear electronic tags. Overcrowding has a corrosive effect. It is, in the words of Strangeways report author Lord Woolf, ""a cancer eating at the ability of the prison service"" to deliver effective education, tackle offending behaviour and prepare prisoners for life on the outside. When the Coalition Government came to power in 2010 it began to look for savings, as part of its effort to reduce overall public spending. Five years later theNational Offender Management Service,external(NOMS), which is responsible for prisons in England and Wales, had reduced its budget by nearly a quarter. Wandsworth Prison is one of the country's most overcrowded Old jails that were expensive to operate were shut - 18 have closed since 2011. But the other tactic in the efficiency drive has been a programme of ""benchmarking"". Publicly run jails are required to peg their costs to the same level as the most efficient prisons, including those in the private sector. Fourteen jails in England and Wales, and two out of 15 prisons in Scotland, are operated by private firms - G4S, Serco and Sodexo. And benchmarking has certainly led to savings. The Ministry of Justice estimates that the average annual cost of a prison place fell by 20% between 2009-10 and 2015-16 to about Â£35,000. Benchmarking has involved major changes to the regime in prisons and cuts to staffing.  A standardised ""core day"" has been introduced in some jails, with the aim of making the most of prisoners' time out of their cells and giving them certainty about what activities they are doing. But the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, said jails which had brought in the new core days had not increased the amount of prisoners' time spent unlocked. Under half of jails were assessed as delivering ""good"" or ""reasonably good"" purposeful activities compared with more than two-thirds in 2009-10. With the benchmarking programme and other cost-cutting, there was a dramatic reduction in staff numbers. Posts were cut in the Northern Ireland Prison Service as well, but in Scotland staff numbers have risen. The overall number of staff employed across the public sector prison estate in England and Wales has fallen from 45,000 in 2010 to just under 31,000 in September 2016. Although a small part of the reduction has been because of employees switching to jails transferred to the private sector, the decline is substantial by any measure, with the number of prison officers working in key front-line roles down by more than 6,000. The jobs market in areas such as London and south-east England has been so competitive that prisons have found it hard to attract and retain replacements on a Â£20,500 starting salary. Many experienced prison officers have taken voluntary redundancy - with their know-how and jail-craft sorely missed. About 200 staff each month are brought in from other jails to work at prisons where vacancies cannot be filled. Last November, members of the Prison Officers Association took part in a24-hour walkoutin protest at what they said were the ""chronic staff shortages and impoverished regimes"" in jails which they claimed had resulted in staff no longer being safe. As thousands of prison staff departed, a seemingly intractable drugs problem began to arrive in jails - ""legal highs"", also known as new psychoactive substances (NPS). Sold under names such as Spice and Black Mamba, by 2013 the synthetic cannabis compounds had become a major problem. In contrast, Scottish prisons have had no record of any seizures of the drug. Synthetic drugs are becoming an increasing problem in England's prisons The health dangers, bizarre behaviour and violence associated with NPS led to them being banned in the UK last year. In prisons, they have proved to be an unpredictable, and occasionally lethal, alternative to cannabis. Between June 2013 and April 2016, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman identified 64 deaths in jail where the prisoner was known or strongly suspected to have used or possessed NPS before they died. Despite the dangers, these synthetic drugs are popular because they are hard to detect using conventional drug testing methods and they provide a diversion to the boredom and frustration of prison life. The drugs are a source of income for criminal gangs whose illicit use of phones and drones, combined with the help of a number of corrupt staff, has helped the trade thrive behind bars. This video can not be played Watch a drone deliver drugs and mobile phones to London prisoners in April 2016 The destabilising impact of synthetic drugs, together with the loss of so many staff in such a short space of time, against a backdrop of overcrowding, has proved to be a dangerous cocktail for our prisons. The government's policy document, entitledPrison Safety and Reform,,externalpublished in November, acknowledges the scale of the challenge.  An extra 2,500 prison officers are being recruited, there will be financial incentives for staff to stay in their jobs, while sniffer dogs and new methods of drug testing are being deployed. Labour said the announcement was ""too little, too late"", saying earlier staff cuts had created a ""crisis in safety"". And there are calls for far more radical measures. Nick Clegg, deputy prime minister in the Coalition, together with the former Home Secretaries Jacqui Smith and Ken Clarke, said prisoner numbers must be steadily cut back to the levels of the early 90s, a reduction of some 40,000 inmates. ""We believe that an escalating prison population has gone well beyond what is safe or sustainable,"" they wrote in a letter to the Times. There are no signs, however, that Liz Truss, the justice secretary, has any intention of arbitrarily cutting the jail population. Sentencing changes and early release schemes are simply not on her agenda. Justice Secretary Liz Truss wants to cut prisoner numbers by reducing reoffending Michael Spurr, the chief executive of NOMS, has even gone as far as to say that he cannot see an end to prison overcrowding until at least after the next parliament - 2025, at the earliest. Instead, Ms Truss believes that any drop in prisoner numbers should come through a reduction in reoffending - fewer people going through the revolving door of the criminal justice system. She is hoping that extra staff and security improvements will steady the ship while longer-term changes to the management of prisons take effect.  Governors will have greater autonomy, there will be closer monitoring of prison performance and education and investment in modern facilities. HMP Berwyn in north Wales will be the UK's biggest prison A new jail, HMP Berwyn, opens in north Wales next month.  It has cost Â£250m to build and will house more than 2,000 male prisoners - making it the biggest prison in the UK. The extra places will help relieve some of the pressure on a system that still relies heavily on jails constructed in the Victorian era.

Born into a cult," At exactly 11:15, the front door of a council flat in Brixton opened. Two women stepped out on to a quiet residential street. The younger woman, Rosie, had an awkward gait. Her movement was stiff and clunky, as though she simply wasn't used to walking any distance. In fact, she had spent the past 30 years - her whole life - in captivity. Now she was ill and needed urgent medical attention. Born into a “collective”, she was not allowed to see a doctor, had never been allowed outside alone and had been told that if she tried to leave she would spontaneously combust and die. Worried she might not survive her illness, on 25 October 2013, Rosie and another woman, Josie, sneaked out. Waiting for them just round the corner were members of an organisation that helps people who have been abused, trafficked or enslaved. Along with the police, they had helped organise the escape. It soon became apparent that Rosie and 57-year-old Josie weren't the only women who lived in the flat, and when police officers returned they met Aisha - a 69-year-old woman originally from Malaysia. At first she didn't want to leave, but as they talked, she changed her mind. In the weeks that followed, it became clear how extraordinary their life had been. All three women seemed extremely frightened, often referring to an all-powerful force called Jackie, which they believed might seek retribution or cause them terrible harm. They were terrified of electricity, which they called “eeee” and seemed anxious that household appliances might blow up or explode. As they revealed details of their existence and Rosie gradually became more confident, she decided to change her name to Katy, inspired by the lyrics of Katy Perry's song, Roar, which is about a woman overcoming a difficult relationship and finding her voice. Katy's own story, and everything she had managed to overcome, proved far stranger than anyone could have imagined. The household in Brixton was run by Aravindan Balakrishnan, who the women called Comrade Bala or AB. Describing life with him, Katy explains how he exercised total control over his so-called comrades. He said that “he's God, he rules the world, he's immortal and he's our leader and teacher and we just have to obey him”. He claimed to have an all-powerful machine at his disposal which he called Jackie, an acronym for Jehovah, Allah, Christ, Krishna and Immortal Easwaran. Jackie was supposedly an invisible computer satellite built by the Chinese. Aravindan Balakrishnan Balakrishnan claimed that with Jackie's help he could control the world from inside the flat. He took credit for all global events, including wars and natural disasters. Balakrishnan told his followers it was only a matter of time until he would become ‘the overt ruler of the world’ One day in 1995, a pizza delivery man rang their doorbell by mistake. “Bala said this was the British fascist state trying to provoke him by bringing a pizza he hadn't ordered and ringing on his bell to disturb his important political work,” says Katy. Later that day, there was a huge earthquake in Japan. “So the same day as the fascist state knocked on God's door, Bala's door, there was a huge earthquake in Kobe to punish the fascist state,” she says. In Japanese, Kobe means God's door. Kobe after the earthquake, 1995 “From what he said, if something happens anywhere in the world, it's going to affect everything else in other parts of the world,” says Aisha. “Nothing exists in isolation, everything has its consequences. That's all I understand.  I just accept it because it's beyond my comprehension.” Balakrishnan told his followers it was only a matter of time until he would become “the overt ruler of the world”, adds Katy. “He used to look at the newspapers and say: 'You see this article, they're coming closer to me.'  And then he would ask: 'Who's coming to whom?' And everybody used to say: 'They're coming to you,' all in unison around him.” Throughout her life, Balakrishnan warned Katy that she would experience spontaneous human combustion, or SHC, if she ever stepped outside - Jackie would know and make her burst into flames. Once, when she was a small child, he put her outside the front door as a punishment and she became hysterical with fear, assuming she was about to die. Later, wondering why she had survived, she rationalised away the inconsistency thinking that because Balakrishnan himself had put her outside, Jackie knew to spare her on this occasion. Katy describes how Balakrishnan persuaded his followers to believe that, if they misbehaved, Jackie even had the power to stop the household plumbing from working as a punishment.  Daily life was hard. The comrades were expected to rise early to do the housework, make meals and serve Balakrishnan. They competed for his favour and it was considered a great honour to be allowed to turn on the shower for him or to enter the bathroom after he had finished to turn the shower off. In the early years, when the group was larger, some of the comrades would be sent out to work to make money for the collective, although neither Balakrishnan nor his wife ever had a job. Aisha worked at one time in Superdrug and then in the department store Morleys in Brixton, while Josie worked in a local industrial laundry. One comrade was a nurse and another a midwife. Those who didn't go out to work remained indoors inside the collective, where every day they had to attend Balakrishnan's morning lectures, standing to attention, sometimes for three or four hours. Anyone who sat down was punished. The bedrock of Balakrishnan's belief system was the tenets and teachings of Marx, Lenin and Mao. The group wanted to bring about a communist revolution and believed they were building the new world. They operated in secret and hid themselves from the “British fascist state”. Lectures were extended rants that often consisted of Balakrishnan denouncing individual comrades for perceived misdemeanours or identifying what he called synchronisations in the world, based on things he had read in the papers or seen on the news. “Someone used to have to log these synchronisations and write them down. As a child, I would spend ages copying these out,” says Katy. Balakrishnan created a mythology around himself. Every day, comrades had to sing songs celebrating his existence. The anniversary of his conception and his birthday - 16 October and 16 July - were celebrated and significant world events which happened on or close to these dates were seen as being synchronised with his life, providing evidence of his greatness. He claimed that the splitting of the atom, the moon landing and the storming of the Bastille - which happened about 150 years before he was born - were all linked to him in this way. Comrades came to believe that everything was interconnected and that Balakrishnan, with the help of Jackie, was all-powerful. “I received a nasty letter from my brother in Malaysia,"" says Aisha. “AB opened it and read it and then a few years after that my brother passed away, so I said to myself, 'OK, that's Jackie's work.'” When the Space Shuttle Challenger blew up in 1986, Balakrishnan claimed this was because people in the household were challenging him. “He said that his name Aravindan began with the sound 'AR', so it was 'Challenge - AR'.  People in the house were challenging him, so that's why Challenge-AR blew up,” says Katy. Balakrishnan believed in his own immortality and told his followers that they too would become immortal if they lived according to his rules. Remaining inside the flat was one way of extending their lives. “Captive animals live longer,” was one of his oft-repeated mantras. “He didn't believe in going to the dentist because he says we should let our teeth drop naturally and then when you're 100, your teeth will re-grow and you'll get another set,” says Aisha. Comrades were not allowed to see a doctor either. “He used to say that NHS means Never Help Self. So if we get ill, we have to focus on him and then we will get better as if by magic,” explains Katy. Balakrishnan introduced many acronyms into the language of the collective - the “British fascist state” became BFS and Nato was known as Farto, which stood for Fascist and Racist Terror Organisation. Our brains… they were dirty - they had to be washed of all ideas The collective itself was commonly referred to as AB's CCF(P), which stood for Aravindan Balakrishnan's Communist Collective Family Pilot Unit. So why did the women stay with Balakrishnan for so long? The group had started as a left-wing political organisation but evolved as Balakrishnan developed a raft of pseudo-religious ideas. Over time “we were brainwashed” explains Aisha. “Our brains… they were dirty. They had to be washed of all ideas. When you want to build a new world, you can't bring the old into it, so we had to chip away the old and fill the void with new ideas.” Aisha and Katy both report that beatings were a regular feature of life within the collective and if there was ever any dissent or disobedience, violence would ensue. Once, when the thought of leaving did cross her mind, Aisha quickly realised she had nowhere to go. “I had nobody outside, I had lost contact with my family, I had no money, I had no job, and I might have been deported.” However, Josie defends Balakrishnan and fervently denies that he ever used force. Katy was born in 1983. Her mother, Sian Davies, had joined the collective voluntarily and began a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan in the early 80s. Sian became pregnant and their child was given the name Prem Maopinduzi. Prem means love in Hindi, and Maopinduzi appears to be a combination of the Swahili word for revolution, mapinduzi, and Mao. Katy's birth certificate “It meant Love Revolution and I hated that… he thought that when he rules the world I'm meant to be like a soldier for him or his mouthpiece,” says Katy, and in her teens she started to refer to herself as Rosie. Members of the collective were not told who her father was and were led to believe that Sian had been impregnated by Jackie. “He used to say I was the product of electronic warfare,” says Katy. Katy's mother, Sian Davies At this point, Balakrishnan coined the term Project Prem. Project Prem was an experiment in child rearing intended to eliminate the nuclear family - a pilot for a new form of social organisation that would be implemented globally once Balakrishnan ruled the world. Comrade Prem, as Katy was known, was dressed in genderless clothing, never went to school, never got to know any other children and only rarely left the house. She was not told who her parents were and was brought up collectively by the group, who were not allowed to show her affection. Only Balakrishnan was allowed to cuddle her. “If I was to cuddle other people, he used to say that that's like being a lesbian, to cuddle other women,” she says. Balakrishnan's own childhood was spent in Asia. He was born in India in 1940 and moved to Singapore with his family when he was eight.  In 1963, he travelled to the UK on a British Council scholarship to study at the London School of Economics. As a student, he became increasingly involved in left-wing politics and eventually abandoned his studies. In 1974 he set up the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought, which he described as a “Chinese-initiated World Revolutionary Party”.  Its slogan was “China's Chairman is Our Chairman. China's Path is Our Path”. By 1976, his Workers' Institute had moved into premises on Acre Lane in Brixton, south London.  On the ground floor was a meeting room and a shop selling communist tracts. Upstairs was a communal living area where about 15 of Balakrishnan's core followers slept on the floor, with men in one room and women in another. Along with his Tanzanian wife Chandra and her disabled sister, the group consisted mainly of fellow students from Singapore and Malaysia, who felt ambivalent about Britain's colonial and imperialist past. Aisha Wahab had come to the UK from Malaysia at the age of 24 to study quantity surveying. She joined the group in its early days. Aisha Wahab “I was really inspired by him and drawn to him. I thought he was great to have been able to clarify our minds as to what to do with our lives,” she says. Other members included Josie Herivel, a brilliant young violinist studying at the Royal College of Music and Sian Davies, a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, who used family money to pay the rent on the Acre Lane premises. An old school friend, Sally Unwin, remembers Sian as very academic, “a deep thinker”. But the last time she remembers seeing her, Sian was “dressed like a Maoist, with all the blue and the collar… and the way she talked to me, I didn't know who she was… It was quite scary”.  It was not long before the political activities at the Workers' Institute attracted the attention of the police and in March 1978, it was raided by officers searching for drugs. Although no drugs were found, nine members of the group, including Balakrishnan, were sent to prison for assaulting police officers during the raid. At their trial, they refused to recognise the authority of the court and when called to the stand, they shouted “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China! Death to the British fascist state! Victory to world revolution!” After a brief period of incarceration, Balakrishnan decided that in order to escape the attention of the “British fascist state”, the group must go underground. So from then on, it operated in secret, frequently moving house.  By 1980, it consisted of only seven followers, all of whom were women. As the women stopped going out to work, the group came to rely on Chandra's sister's disability allowance and Chandra's carer's allowance for an income. Balakrishnan exerted control over the collective for many years.  As well as threatening and beating them, he would use each individual's past to further undermine them. Sian Davies's father had killed himself when she was a teenager and Balakrishnan would repeatedly tell her this was her fault.  By 1996, Sian's mental health had become fragile and on Christmas Eve of that year, she fell from the second floor bathroom window of a terraced house in Shakespeare Road, Brixton in an apparent suicide attempt. The house in Shakespeare Road where the collective lived for several years “Sian was acting really oddly saying she's a devil and was starting to behave really unlike herself,” says Katy. “There was screaming in the middle of the night and subsequently I learned that Sian had tried to stab herself with a knife. She had tried to run out the door... then because she couldn't escape that way, she went out through the window “On the morning of Christmas Eve, I went downstairs and Sian was lying on the floor.  Her hands and legs were tied and she was gagged and she had this piece of cloth in her mouth.  It may have been a sock or something.” Balakrishnan and Chandra were both shouting at Sian. “She had tried to run out the door, that's why she was tied up, because she was trying to escape. Then because she couldn't escape that way, she went out through the window.” Sian was taken to hospital, where she fell into a coma. Balakrishnan insisted that Sian's family should not be told what had happened and Josie told them on the phone that Sian was “away travelling in India and sends her love”. After lying in a coma for seven months, Sian died. At the inquest into her death, the coroner asked Aisha whether Sian had any children. On Balakrishnan's instructions, Aisha said she didn't. “We definitely didn't want Katy to be taken away and live a life as of old and not participate in building a new society,” she explains. It was around this time that Katy guessed Sian was her mother, but paradoxically, after Sian's death, life got better for Katy in some respects. “She was one of the worst servants of Bala, so it was such a relief with her not there. His worst enforcer had gone,” she says. And Sian was not the only person to die in the course of the collective's existence.  In 2004, Oh Kar Eng, a nurse from Malaysia, who had been with Balakrishnan since the 1970s, banged her head on a kitchen cabinet and had a stroke. The following day, she too died. Oh Kar Eng died in 2004 These two deaths reinforced the idea in the minds of the remaining members that Balakrishnan had the power of life and death over them. “AB said that he helps people to live and that those who die have not internalised his teachings enough. That's why it frightened me,” says Aisha. “Sian and Oh had died and I thought 'OK, next time, it will be me.' I didn't want to die.” By 2005, Katy’s situation had caused her to become deeply depressed. Observing life outside her window, she began to doubt Balakrishnan’s account of the world. At the age of 22, having never gone outside on her own and despite believing she might be killed by Jackie, she decided to try to escape. She packed a bag and let herself out of the back door of the flat. When she asked a passer-by for help, they suggested she go to the police station. But with no experience of the outside world, she struggled to explain her situation to the officer at the desk, only saying that she had “run away from home”. The officer persuaded Katy to let her phone Balakrishnan, who came to collect her.  He reassured the police that all was well and took Katy back to the collective, where he denounced her and told her she was ungrateful. Katy remained in captivity for another eight years. Over the summer of 2013 Katy lost weight dramatically and became so unwell that Josie feared she might not survive. Arranging a doctor's appointment was not an option so the two women came up with a plan. In early October, they saw a story about forced marriage on the BBC News and at the end the newsreader gave out a helpline number. I just couldn't take living like an animal like that any more Josie committed the number to memory and saved change in secret from her regular trips to the grocery shop.  She smuggled a mobile phone into their home and, while Balakrishnan and Chandra watched Neighbours on television, they called for help. Katy, a few days after her escape They made a series of calls and were passed on to Gerard Stocks and Yvonne Hall at the Palm Cove Society, who, together with the Metropolitan Police, co-ordinated the women's rescue. Each week Balakrishnan and Chandra went shopping at the same time, so Katy knew when there would be an opportunity to escape. “We had to make sure they were not anywhere near when we walked out of the house… so 11:15 sharp we left, Josie and me, with our trolleys.” Yvonne and Gerard were waiting just round the corner. Katy was “delighted” but Josie already appeared to be having second thoughts. Left toright: Aisha, Katy, Yvonne Hall and Josie “She knew the police were involved, she was beginning to regret it, thinking it'll make trouble for Bala,” says Katy. But Katy was determined to leave and never go back: “I just couldn't take living like an animal like that any more, being treated with such disrespect and just being a non-person.” She felt confident she could trust Yvonne. “After what I had come from, anything was better than that. That's all I knew for sure.” When Katy left the collective she had “a hundred feelings at once, you can't really say what”. She couldn't believe it was true and was afraid that she would “wake up and find that I'm still stuck”. As they slowly walked to the meeting point “Katy had a beaming smile” remembers Yvonne. “We just hugged each other.” Aisha wanted to know why the cars coming towards us had white lights and the cars in front of us had red lights That same day, Yvonne and Gerard drove Katy, Josie and Aisha to Leeds where they gave them a place to stay. Katy was treated in hospital for diabetes. “The women seemed to start and finish one another's sentences. They spoke in unison, as if they'd had the same conversations with each other for years and years and years, so if one of them started a sentence, the others knew what the next bit was going to be,” says Gerard. “Aisha wanted to know why the cars coming towards us had white lights and the cars in front of us had red lights,” he adds. It rapidly became clear that Katy in particular had very few life skills. She was “overwhelmed by the enormity of everything, because she had been confined,"" says Yvonne. “She couldn't cross a road, had never handled money and couldn't look around or make eye contact.” Katy at Gerard and Yvonne's house After a while, Josie and Aisha were housed locally in sheltered accommodation, but Katy's needs were greater and she lived with Yvonne and Gerard for more than a year, while they helped her to develop the skills she would need to live independently. Balakrishnan was brought to trial in 2015 and was charged with sexual offences as well as with imprisoning his daughter. In the course of the police investigation, it emerged that he had sexually abused two women, Woman A and Woman B, over a period of years. Woman A described in court how Balakrishnan had made her write an account of her sexual history, which he then used to humiliate her in front of the others. Later he sexually abused her, raped her and regularly beat her. In 1989, after 13 years, she left the collective. Woman B was a nurse from Malaysia, who had moved into the Acre Lane commune in 1978. She too was beaten, sexually assaulted and raped. In 1992, she worked a night shift and found the courage not to return to the collective. In January 2016, Balakrishnan was convicted of crimes including rape, sexual assault, child cruelty and the false imprisonment of his daughter. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison. Josie and Chandra during Balakrishnan's trial His wife Chandra and Josie Herivel stood by him and made a statement to the press, declaring his innocence and claiming he had been framed by the “British fascist state”. Despite having voluntarily left the collective, Josie continues to follow his teachings and now devotes her time to trying to clear his name. Josie still campaigns for Balakrishnan's release Aisha is now 72 and lives in sheltered housing in Leeds. She claims she was unaware of any sexual abuse taking place in the collective. Although she has regrets about the way Katy was treated, she still believes in campaigning to make the world a better place and volunteers once a week in a local charity shop. She also has regular dentist appointments to get her teeth fixed. Katy has adopted the last name Morgan-Davies, consisting of two surnames from her mother’s side of the family. She is doing her best to leave the indoctrination of her past behind and has made remarkable progress. She is studying English and maths at college and has recently moved out of supported accommodation into a flat of her own. DNA tests carried out by the police confirmed that Balakrishnan is her father. Somehow she has managed to find it within herself to forgive him “I used to hate him, but not any more. Nelson Mandela said that you are still in prison if you hold on to your anger, hatred and bitterness, so there’s no place for that in my life.  I would like to reconcile with him in the future if he wants that.  But you can’t clap with one hand.” Vanessa Engle's documentary, The Cult Next Door, is broadcast on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT, 26 January -watch it on BBC iPlayer All images subject to copyright"
What if Trump tries to bring back torture?1:27US mayors vow war over Trump edictRogue Twitter accounts battle TrumpAlbright 'ready to join Muslim registry',"This video can not be played Donald Trump tells ABC News that ""torture works"" President Trump has indicated that he is considering a return to the sort of harsh interrogation techniques of ""enemy combatants"" that have been widely condemned as torture, as well as a return to so-called CIA ""black sites"". In his first interview since becoming US President, Mr Trump said intelligence officials had told him that ""torture absolutely works"", but that he would defer to advice from his new CIA director and his secretary of defence. The latter, retired Marine Corps officer Gen James Mattis, says torture does not work. So what are the global implications if the president goes ahead, asks BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner. There is a South African proverb, dating from the apartheid era, that goes like this: ""How do you catch an elephant? You catch a mouse and keep beating it up until it admits it's really an elephant."" Ridiculous as this may sound, there is an echo of truth here. Torture hurts. That's the whole point of it. So if someone is tortured badly enough they will say anything to make it stop, including making things up that they think their tormentors will want to hear. Prisons in certain Middle Eastern countries, especially Syria, are crammed full of people who are being abused so badly they will eventually sign any ""confession"" to make the treatment stop. In some countries forced confessions remain to this day the primary tool in the prosecutor's armoury. In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 the US intelligence community, having failed to prevent the worst attack on the US since Pearl Harbor, became convinced that a second catastrophic attack was on its way. As President George W Bush's ""war on terror"" got underway, the normal safeguards of respect for human rights and the rule of law were cast aside in a desperate hunt to find ""the ticking bomb"". Trump insists waterboarding works First 100 days: What executive actions has Trump taken? Top al-Qaeda planners like Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, all caught in Pakistan, were ""rendered"" (transported) to so-called ""black sites"" for extreme interrogation. These were secret, unacknowledged prisons, run by the CIA and scattered around the globe in Afghanistan, Thailand, Poland, Romania and other countries. There they were subjected to repeated waterboarding, which makes the bound and helpless victim feel like they are drowning. Khaled Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded a staggering number of times, well over 100. And yet years later, when in 2014 the US Senate's Intelligence and Security Select Committee issued its report on the use of torture under the Bush administration it concluded that torture was ""not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees"". CIA lied over 'brutal' interrogations 'CIA tortured' admits former executive On Thursday, the US House Speaker, Paul Ryan, said torture was not legal and that the committee agreed it was not legal. Senator John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, also opposes it. ""The president can sign whatever executive order he likes,"" he said, ""but the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the USA."" There would be strong resistance too from both America's allies and from within the intelligence community itself. There is a general acceptance now, in most of the world, that those practices carried out in the early years after the 9/11 attacks - extraordinary rendition, detention without trial, enhanced interrogation - were not only morally wrong, they were also counter-productive. They very rarely produced useful, actionable intelligence. They traumatised not only the victims, some of whom were completely innocent, but also those who witnessed the shocking dehumanising of an individual. Undoubtedly this has given the green light to some unscrupulous practices by regimes who see America's earlier use of torture as a license to do what they like to their own citizens. Unthinkable as it sounds now, the US even rendered one ""high value detainee"" to his own country - Syria - for interrogation, knowing that there would be few restraints on his treatment there. This video can not be played John McCain said he'd have Donald Trump in court in 'a New York minute' if he reinstated waterboarding There is also the legal aspect. In 2010 David Cameron, who was then UK prime minister, set up a judge-led, independent inquiry into allegations of complicity by MI5 and MI6 officers in torture. Career intelligence officers who had thought they were doing the right thing at the time - such as, hypothetically, being within earshot of the harsh interrogation of a suspect in a Pakistani jail - found themselves being questioned by detectives from the Metropolitan Police. The inquiry was eventually scrapped but it has at least led to a widespread rethink on respect for human rights inside intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic. Senior intelligence officers who lived through this difficult period are likely to strongly resist turning the clock back and returning to those days. It is also questionable whether the US would find willing partners to host black site prisons amongst those countries only too relieved to have closed that chapter in their national histories.

Rogue Twitter accounts battle TrumpAlbright 'ready to join Muslim registry',"Twitter accounts - some set up by people claiming to work for US government agencies - have sprung up to ""resist"" President Trump on climate science. Borrowing the names of organisations like Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency they are directly attacking the president. Mr Trump has called climate change a hoax. The@RogueNASA,externalaccount says it is the ""unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA"". ""Not an official NASA account. Not managed by gov't employees.

The village gorilla who went to school,"The gorilla would play with the village children and sometimes attended school with them The true tale of a gorilla who was raised like a child in an English village has been rediscovered. The ape, called John Daniel, was adopted by Alyce Cunningham, from Uley, Gloucestershire, in 1918 after her brother bought it for Â£300 in London. Village archivist Margaret Groom has published a collection of pictures of John Daniel in a book about Uley. The animal was sold to an American when it became too big for Ms Cunningham to look after. It died in 1922. Mrs Groom found the collection of photos in the village archives and said it was ""quite unique to have a gorilla grow up here"". She said: ""People still talk about it and a lot of people don't believe it. They say 'oh no that can't be possible'."" John Daniel was captured as a baby in Gabon and brought to the UK, where Ms Cunnigham's brother Rupert Penny saw it for sale in a department store. John Daniel was adopted by Alyse Cunningham and lived with her at her country house in Uley She adopted the ape and nicknamed him Sultan. Mrs Groom said John Daniel was raised like a normal child, had its own bedroom and could use the light switch and toilet. She said the villagers were very fond of the ape, which would play with children, eat roses from garden and drink cups of tea. Chidlren in Uley had fun wheeling John Daniel around the village in a wheelbarrow Once it grew to adult size Ms Cunningham could no longer look after it so, in 1921, she sold it to an American for one thousand guineas. She thought it would be sent to a home in Florida, but instead the ape ended up in Barnum and Baileys Circus. There its health deteriorated, with reports reaching Ms Cunningham that the animal was pining for her. She set sail for New York but the gorilla, by now aged four-and-a-half, died from pneumonia before she arrived. The story of John Daniel is also set to be part of an exhibition later this year in Uley.
