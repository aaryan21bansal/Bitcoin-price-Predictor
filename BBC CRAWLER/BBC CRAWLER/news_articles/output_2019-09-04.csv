She stands in front of her own artwork She was known as Emily Doe when her victim impact statement, read out in the sexual assault trial of Brock Turner, went viral. Now, she has revealed her identity as 27-year-old Chanel Miller as she prepares to have her memoir published. The case sparked controversy when Turner, then a Stanford University student, was sentenced to six months in jail. He served three. Ms Miller's book, Know My Name, is being released later this month. The memoir's publisher said it would ""change the way we think about sexual assault forever"". Ms Miller, a writer and artist from California, was known by the pseudonym Emily Doe during the trial of Turner, a former star swimmer from Ohio, in San Jose, California, for the 2015 assault. He had attacked her while she was unconscious on the ground outside a university fraternity house party. Two Swedish students, cycling past, challenged Turner when they realised Ms Miller, who was found partly dressed near a dumpster, was not moving. In 2016, a jury would find Turner - then 20 - guilty of three charges: sexually assaulting an intoxicated victim, sexually assaulting an unconscious victim and attempting to rape her. He was sentenced to six months and three years' probation. Prosecutors had sought a six-year sentence. The trial sparked a national debate about sexual assault and whether white men from wealthy backgrounds were treated more favourably by the US justice system.

Jeremy Kyle guests 'treated like police suspects',"The Jeremy Kyle Show was cancelled in May The Jeremy Kyle Show producers treated guests like criminal suspects, the MP leading an inquiry into reality TV has claimed. The House of Commons culture select committee heard from two of the show's former guests on Wednesday. Dwayne Davison, who first appeared in 2014, told MPs he was locked in a small room and had his phone taken off him. ""I think someone in police custody would have more rights and better treatment,"" Damian Collins MP said. The committee is investigating whether enough support is offered during and after filming on reality TV. The inquiry was set up after the death of a man who had taken a lie detector test on The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the suicides of two former Love Island contestants. Mr Davison, who became known as Kyle's ""most-hated guest"", told the committee he was exploited by the show, and that it ""ruined my life"", receiving death threats and losing two jobs as a result. Dwayne Davison said his life ""drastically"" changed after appearing on The Jeremy Kyle Show His requests to have clips of his appearance taken off the show's YouTube channel were repeatedly turned down, ""I asked them multiple times, cried, they weren't interested one bit."" Mr Davison said he even attempted suicide at one point: ""In 2018, I took 30 codeine tablets, swallowed them all, I don't remember what happened."" ""If I knew what my life would have turned into I would never have gone on that show,"" he added. He said the only thing he would class as ""aftercare"" was a ""one-minute phone call"". He said he was given his taxi fare home and kicked out 20 minutes after the recording and ""that was it"". 'I was traumatised': Kyle guests relive their appearances Jeremy Kyle working on new ITV show How The Jeremy Kyle Show became a 'toxic brand' Before the recording, he was kept in a locked room, he said. ""The smallest, tiniest room you've ever seen. Your phone is taken off you. I'm sat in this room for 10 hours, the door's locked. My partner has been taken away from me. So you're anxious."" Mr Collins, who chairs the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee, said that sounded ""astonishing"" and ""horrific"". Mr Davison appeared on the show a second time, in 2015, but only because a ""charismatic"" producer persuaded him he could ""redeem"" himself, he said. ""I came onto the stage and it was like a war zone,"" he said, adding that the host was goading him, but those parts were not shown. ""They completely edited that out and only showed my reaction. How unfair is that?"" Another former Kyle guest, Robert Gregory, who was contacted by the programme after a man told producers he wanted to prove he was his father, said he had been ""totally humiliated"". ""They crucified me. They absolutely ripped me apart,"" he told the committee. ""I said, 'You've obviously decided I am a bad person.'"" He added: ""There is no aftercare, it doesn't exist."" The Jeremy Kyle Show was cancelled by ITV in May after the death of Steve Dymond, who took a lie detector test during an appearance. After the hearing, an ITV statement said: ""As a producer and broadcaster ITV takes its responsibilities around duty of care to participants very seriously. Supporting the physical and mental health of everyone involved in our programmes is our highest priority. It added: ""We were truly sorry to hear that Dwayne was experiencing mental health problems and suicidal thoughts and have apologised to him that we did not remove the clips from our official ITV YouTube channel. We have offered to pay for counselling, as he has requested."" Love Island's Yewande Biala and Marcel Somerville spoke to the committee Earlier on Wednesday, former Love Island stars Yewande Biala and Marcel Somerville gave evidence about their experiences on that show. Both told the committee they were given psychiatric evaluations by ITV before they appeared on the show and saw doctors in the days and weeks after the series ended. ""The whole time on the show is fine, when you come off it's fine, but because you are in the spotlight, no matter what you do, there will be a story about it,"" Somerville said. ""The press will jump on to anything. If you have a public break-up, you think, this is the worst period ever and then you get trolls who add fire to it - that was the worst part of being on the show. ""They do a psych (evaluation) before you go on and when the show is finished you do another psych, and then again a week later. But it should be one three or six months down the line because that's when you're dealing with it."" In its statement, ITV said it ""constantly strives for best practice in all our programmes"", pointing out that last year it asked former chief medical officer Dr Paul Litchfield to carry out an independent review of the processes on Love Island. ""This review led us to extend our support processes for this year's series to a level that we consider industry-leading,"" it said. Former Blazin' Squad member Somerville also revealed he refused to go on the show the first year he was asked because he had concerns about the diversity of the line-up. ""I spoke to the casting producers, done a medical, but they wanted me to go on for the last two weeks of the show,"" he said. ""I basically said I wasn't too sure if I wanted to go on the show at that time because the show didn't look very diverse. ""I didn't want to be the first black person to be on the show as a bombshell because you've go to go in there and try and steal someone's girlfriend.""

Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes,"UK-based Ryanair pilots have voted for seven further days of strikes as part of a row over pay and conditions. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) said it wanted to settle the dispute, but Ryanair has refused to seek conciliation. Pilots are currently on strike after also walking out from 22-23 August. Ryanair said the strikes were ""pointless"" as the industrial action had not resulted in any flight cancellations. The next rounds of strikes will be: 18-19 September for 48 hours 21 September for 24 hours 23 September for 24 hours 25 September for 24 hours 27 September for 24 hours 29 September for 24 hours Balpa said its members want the same kind of agreements that exist in other airlines on pensions, loss of licence insurance, maternity benefits, allowances and pay. ""While this action has considerably disrupted Ryanair, forcing them to engage contractors and bring in foreign crews to run its operation, it has had limited impact on the public's travel plans,"" said Balpa's general secretary Brian Strutton. ""Ryanair should stop dragging its feet and get back to the negotiating table."" Ryanair said most of its pilots had flown during the strike action in August and early September. ""These latest Balpa strikes are pointless given that during five days of Balpa strikes [on] 22,23 August and 2,3,4 September all Ryanair flights to and from UK airports operated as scheduled - with zero cancellations - thanks to the efforts of over 95% of our UK pilots who flew as rostered and did not support these failed Balpa strikes. ""We again call on Balpa to return to talks as these failed strikes have not achieved anything."" In August Ryanair said job losses were coming following a 21% fall in quarterly profits after higher costs for fuel and staff, and reduced ticket prices. On 31 July, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary told staff in a video message the airline has 900 too many pilots and cabin crew members. He said the two weakest markets are the UK, where there were Brexit uncertainties, and Germany, where Ryanair faced fierce competition on price.

LiveLivePM's bid for 15 October election fails3 minutes ago3 minutes ago Goodnight and thanks for joining usGoodnight and thanks for joining us14 minutes ago 'Britain's worst PM' - according to the Mirror'Britain's worst PM' - according to the MirrorLive PM's bid for 15 October election fails  3 minutes ago,"Brexit delay bill passes the House of Commons It would force Boris Johnson to ask EU for delay to Brexit to prevent no deal PM says there must now be a general election But his bid to hold one on 15 October fails due to lack of opposition support Earlier, chancellor set out spending plans for coming year Hamish Mackay, Kate Whannel and Matt Cannon That ends our rolling coverage for today on yet another eventful day in the Commons. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a double defeat in the Commons after MPs turned down his motion for a general election. There has been a lot to take in, so if you're still catching up - and who would blame you - here's a quick reminder of the major happenings: The Daily Mirror uses its front page to declare Mr Johnson ""Britain's worst PM (since the last one)"". An image of what the paper calls a ""deflated"" Mr Johnson looking downward fills the front page. Theresa May smiles out from an inset picture. A more animated photo of the prime minister fills the front page of the Daily Express. ""Boris urges 'people power' to force election,"" is the headline. It calls Jeremy Corbyn's decision not to support a general election until a bill designed to help avert a no-deal Brexit is passed ""an extraordinary act of cowardice"". The front pages of the Daily Mail and the Sun both pick up on Boris Johnson calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""chicken"" for refusing to back a general election before the Hilary Benn's bill is passed into law. The Sun goes as far as superimposing the Labour leader's face onto a chicken, alongside the headline ""Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?"". Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph opts for the headline ""'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock"". The newspapers are responding to another momentous day in Parliament. The front pages of the i, the Guardian and the Financial Times all say the prime minister has been left ""cornered"" by MPs after losing three votes in the Commons.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"". Find our how your local MP voted on the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and on the PM's call for an early general election. MPs have voted on an early general election and a bill that could delay Brexit. Sir Michael Fallon has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced he will be standing down at the next election. In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Those arriving in the UK before the end of next year will be able to apply to the new scheme, the government confirmed on Wednesday evening.

Over in the House of Lords, peers are still voting on amendments to the business motion which aims at ensuring the no-deal bill has time to become law before the suspension of Parliament. They are currently discussing amendment 2C but there are over 100 to get through. BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'arcy says: ""There is talk of them talking til they drop to get through all these amendments so they can then deal with the bill. ""It is not going very fast.

Michigan bans flavoured e-cigarettes in US first,"Michigan has become the first US state to ban flavoured e-cigarettes as part of efforts to curb youth vaping. The measure goes into effect in the next 30 days and bars the sale of any flavoured vaping products in retail stores and online. ""My number one priority is keeping our kids safe,"" said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in a statement. The measure will last six months, with the possibility of an extension and comes amid other action against vaping. First death linked to vaping reported in US Tobacco giants in $200bn merger talks Vaping firm attracts fresh funding despite lawsuits Ms Whitmer, a Democrat, also banned what she described as misleading marketing of such products, prohibiting adverts that describe vaping products as ""clean"", ""safe"" or ""healthy"". ""We've seen an explosive increase in the number of Michigan kids exposed to vaping products,"" said Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive for Michigan. ""This is a public health crisis."" E-cigarettes have experienced huge growth in recent years, especially among young people. In just one year - from 2017-18 - the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported a 78% jump in school students vaping. Last year, more than 3.6 million children were using e-cigarettes, a ""sharp and startling reversal of overall declines"" in tobacco use among young people, according to the FDA. ""Youth use of electronic cigarettes has reached an epidemic proportion,"" said FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb. But the rise of e-cigarettes has provoked mounting opposition from lawmakers. Ms Whitmer said: ""Right now, companies selling vaping products are using candy flavours to hook children on nicotine and misleading claims to promote the belief that these products are safe. That ends today."" Michigan has joined a number of US states and cities taking steps to block the sale of e-cigarettes. In June, San Francisco became the first US city to ban sales of e-cigarettes and lawmakers in Boulder, Colorado, passed a similar ban last week. Nancy Brown, chief executive of the American Heart Association, called the measure a ""bold and appropriate"" response ""to the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use"", noting the recent outbreak in illnesses associated with e-cigarettes. Last week, Juul - the market leader in e-cigarettes - said in a statement that it recognised youth vaping in the US was a ""serious and urgent problem"". The e-cigarette giant ended sales of most flavoured products in 2018 in an effort to deter teenage use of the product, and stopped sales to anyone under 21 years of age. ""We want to be the off-ramp for adult smokers to switch from cigarettes, not an on-ramp for America's youth to initiate on nicotine,"" the company said in a statement announcing the changes. Defenders of e-cigarettes called the Michigan ban misguided, arguing that e-cigarettes are much less unhealthy than cigarettes. JUUL halts flavoured e-cigarette sales E-cigarettes 'better for quitting smoking' ""This shameless attempt at backdoor prohibition will close down several hundred Michigan small businesses and could send tens of thousands of ex-smokers back to deadly combustible cigarettes,"" Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a statement. According to the FDA, 34.3 million US adults and nearly 1.4 million young people in the US, ages 12-17, currently smoke cigarettes. Despite declines in cigarette smoking, tobacco use is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the US, killing about 480,000 Americans every year. The battle surrounding e-cigarettes has been heightened by a recent spike in respiratory illnesses linked to e-cigarettes. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last month there were 193 ""potential cases"" of a mystery lung disease related to vaping across 22 US states. The possible cases include one death in Illinois, the first death linked to vaping. Last year, the FDA announced a series of enforcement actions against more than 1,300 retailers and five major manufacturers for catering vaping products to children. According to the American Lung Association, 97% of current youth e-cigarette users used a flavoured product in the last month, and 70% list flavours as a key reason for their use. It says there are 15,000 flavours on the market, from mango and mint to cotton candy and gummy bear.

Where do we go from here?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Do voters support a no-deal Brexit?,"Boris Johnson is insistent - if a new deal on the terms of Brexit is not agreed with the EU by the end of October, the UK should be prepared to leave without a deal. But attempts are being made by MPs to pass legislation that would outlaw a no-deal Brexit. Both sides claim voters support their point of view. So, what is the evidence of the polls? Within the past two months, four polls have asked people if they are for or against leaving without a deal. Despite differences in the wording of the questions, the results are remarkably consistent. Slightly more people say they are opposed to leaving without a deal than state they are in favour. However, there is a sharp difference between Remain and Leave voters. Whereas about three out of four of those who voted Remain in 2016 say they are opposed to leaving without a deal, the position among Leave voters is almost exactly the reverse. The debate divides the country in much the same way as the 2016 referendum did. At that time, 52% voted Leave and 48% Remain. So, why do the polls suggest more people oppose than support leaving without a deal? The answer lies in the views of those who did not vote three years ago. Only about one in five (21%) of non-voters support leaving without a deal, while twice as many (43%) are opposed. Still, the government's policy is not to leave the EU without a deal whatever the circumstances. Rather, it only proposes doing so if a satisfactory deal is not obtained by the end of October. Is this reflected in how voters approach the prospect of no deal? A first indication comes from the answers YouGov obtained when they asked a more detailed question about ""leaving the European Union without any deal"". People were asked not only if that would be a good outcome or a bad outcome, but also whether it would be ""an acceptable compromise"". Eight out of 10 Remain supporters claim that a no-deal Brexit would be a bad outcome. This is in line with the 76% who say they are against leaving the EU without a deal, when offered a straight choice between support and oppose. However, a different story emerges among Leave voters. The proportion who say that leaving without a deal would be a good outcome is 46%. This is well below the 73% who say they back leaving the EU without a deal, when offered a straight choice. Why the difference? About a quarter (27%) of Leave voters prefer to say a no-deal Brexit would be an ""acceptable compromise"", rather than a ""good outcome"". Here, perhaps, is a sign that leaving without a deal is, for some Leave voters, something they might ultimately be willing to back, rather than an outcome they would most like to happen. Further evidence in this direction emerges when voters are asked which Brexit outcome they prefer. In June, YouGov asked people to place four possibilities in order of preference: leaving without a deal accepting the deal that has already been negotiated leaving with an alternative deal that included membership of the single market and the EU customs union remaining in the EU after all While 59% of Leave voters said that leaving without a deal was their first preference, 33% preferred one of the two possible deals. Very similar results were found by Kantar when it put much the same set of options before voters. What is no-deal Brexit? Everything you need to know about Brexit Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? The willingness of some voters to back leaving without a deal might well depend on whether or not they think the government could in fact have secured an acceptable deal - or whether the fault lies with the EU. When ORB asked whether the UK should leave without a deal, ""if the EU is unwilling to reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement"", supporters (46%) outnumbered opponents (39%). In contrast, when Ipsos MORI asked people whether they would support leaving without a deal, ""if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU by October"", as many as 50% said they were opposed and only 38% in favour. Persuading Remain supporters of the necessity of a no-deal Brexit looks likely to be a tall order. But Leave supporters may well back the idea if they are persuaded that Brussels is to blame.

UK 'at risk of slipping into recession',"The UK is at risk of slipping into recession, according to a closely watched survey of industry managers. The dominant services sector grew only slightly in August, the purchasing managers' index (PMI) from IHS Markit/CIPS suggests. ""The lack of any meaningful growth... raises the likelihood that the UK economy is slipping into recession,"" said IHS economist Chris Williamson. The construction and manufacturing sectors also shrunk in August. The services sector accounts for 80% of the UK economy. According to IHS' survey, the sector barely expanded in August, achieving a score of 50.6 - down from 51.4 in July. Anything above 50 marks growth, while a lower number indicates a contraction. However, the figure including manufacturing and construction was 49.7, the second contraction for the private sector in three months. IHS Markit said Brexit uncertainty and higher business costs were to blame. ""While the current downturn remains only mild overall, the summer's malaise could intensify as we move into autumn,"" added Mr Williamson. UK economy shrinks for the first time since 2012 Factory output 'falls at fastest pace since 2012' Between April and June the UK's economy contracted for the first time since 2012. A recession occurs when the economy contracts in two consecutive quarters. According to IHS Markit, UK firms are hiring and taking on new clients at a slower pace as they try to gauge whether the government will quit the European Union without a deal at the end of October. Service-based firms, which include hotels, restaurants, banks and insurers, are also seeing profit margins squeezed by rising staff wages , fuel costs and utility bills, the survey found. This measure also slipped into negative growth in 2016 following the Brexit referendum and in 2012, around the time of the European sovereign debt crisis. The numbers should be taken with a pinch of salt, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty. Note too that they exclude the retail and government sectors, which still are growing,"" he said. He expects a 0.4% gain for the economy in the July to September period, assuming a deal is struck with the EU ahead of the UK's departure. When official estimates were published last month showing the economy contracting in the second quarter of the year, it didn't yet indicate a recession. For that, according to convention, you need two consecutive quarters where the economy shrinks. Optimists hoped that the second quarter had been artificially depressed: as companies ran down stocks they had built up ahead of the cancelled March 29 Brexit deadline, they had less need to buy new supplies and that meant less economic activity. The hope was that once that stockpiling effect was in the past, the economy would show a bounce-back. The latest figures from purchasing managers (the finance directors and senior managers who watch their new orders and buy new supplies) - suggest activity in production and manufacturing shrank sharply in August. Today's figures suggest the services sector which makes up about 80% of the economy is growing, but only just: perhaps not enough to compensate for contractions in the rest of the economy. Taken together, they suggest the economy shrank in the third quarter of the year by 0.1%. The figures are by no means the final word on economic growth in the third quarter. But the concern that we may already be in recession no longer looks fanciful.

PM challenges Corbyn to back October election,"This video can not be played Corbyn to Johnson: ""A lot of people have a great deal to fear"" Boris Johnson will call for a general election on 15 October if Labour and rebel Tories succeed in blocking a no-deal Brexit. He challenged Jeremy Corbyn to put his policy of ""dither and delay"" over EU withdrawal to the British people. Mr Johnson needs the support of two-thirds of MPs to trigger an election. But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told Labour MPs the leadership would not back an election until a delay had been agreed with the EU. Chancellor Sajid Javid has presented his spending planto MPs in the Commons, with the health service, education and the police expected to fare well. He told MPs the government had ""turned the page on austerity"", outlining Â£13.8bn of investment on areas including health and education. Mr Javid said it was the fastest spending increase for 15 years, but the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused him of ""meaningless platitudes"". Meanwhile, No 10's decision to expel 21 Tory MPs for defying the party whip on Tuesday continues to causes recriminations in the party. Live updates: Johnson to face MPs after Brexit defeat Kuenssberg: Politics is upside down Do the UK's voters support a no-deal Brexit? Brexit's big week: Five things we learned on Tuesday Will there be an early election? One of those booted out of the party, Margot James, has publicly questioned the role played by Dominic Cummings, the PM's senior aide, in the decision. Raising the issue at PMQs, she urged Mr Johnson to bear in mind his predecessor Margaret Thatcher's famous adage that ""advisers advise and ministers decide"". And in Scotland, a judgehas rejected a bid to have Mr Johnson's plan to shut down Parliament ahead of Brexit declared illegal. The showdown between the government and opponents of a no-deal Brexit will continue later as Labour and other opposition parties seek to pass a bill requesting a further delay if there is no deal by 19 October. A total of 21 Tories defied the PM on Tuesday to vote with the opposition to enable the bill to be considered, as Mr Johnson suffered his first Commons defeat as prime minister by a margin of 328 votes to 301. This video can not be played Margot James: ""Advisers advise, ministers decide"" If the Brexit delay bill passes later on and moves to the Lords, as is expected, Mr Johnson will push for an immediate vote on an early general election. What does the no-deal bill say? Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said it was ""absolutely clear"" that the UK would get a new deal from Brussels, with the controversial Irish backstop removed. He suggested that Mr Corbyn was afraid of the judgement of the people, joking that ""there is only one chlorinated chicken I can see this House and he is on that bench"". But the Labour leader said the PM was ""running down the clock"" on a no-deal Brexit and ""hiding the facts"" about the likelihood of food and medicine shortages. ""I don't see how I can be accused of undermining the negotiations because there are no negotiations taking place,"" he told MPs. How feasible are the government spending plans? Social care and prisons 'need money most' Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Radio 4's Today that Labour wanted a general election but ""on its terms not Boris Johnson's terms"". He said the party did not ""trust"" the PM to hold the election before the Brexit deadline, as No 10 had ""lied"" last month when it denied reports that it planned to suspend Parliament. ""We are not shy of a general election but we are not going to be trapped into abandoning control of Parliament or be taken in what Boris Johnson says because we don't trust him."" But, at a meeting in London, a succession of Labour MPs called on the leadership to hold off backing an election until after Brexit had been delayed. The BBC's Chris Mason said one MP reportedly told colleagues: ""Johnson said it is Brexit do or die on October 31st. I want him to die."" Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a prime minister must have the backing of at least two-thirds of the UK's 650 MPs before a poll can be called outside of the fixed five-year terms. The Lib Dems say they will vote against an early election at this stage. Downing Street said the 21 Tory MPs who rebelled in Tuesday's vote would have the whip removed, effectively expelling them from the parliamentary party and meaning they could not stand as Conservative candidates in the election. Among the jettisoned rebels are former justice secretary David Gauke, Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames, and Rory Stewart, who recently stood against Boris Johnson to be the party leader. The former international development secretary told the Today programme he was sacked by text message, as he was being given the GQ magazine award for politician of the year. ""It was a pretty astonishing moment,"" he said. ""It feels a little bit like something you associate with other countries - one opposes the leader, one loses the leadership race, no longer in the cabinet and now apparently thrown out of the party and one's seat too."" Mr Stewart said the decision to stop him standing as a candidate was ""un-Conservative"" and the final decision should rest with local associations and not be made centrally. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Another of the rebels, Richard Benyon, said he would continue to sit on the Tory benches and support the PM's domestic agenda, saying he hoped to return to the fold ""one day"". But there have been calls from loyal MPs for No 10 to rethink its conduct amid anger over the treatment of rebels and the suspension of Parliament. Sir Roger Gale said Dominic Cummings, one of Mr Johnson's closest advisers, had ""abused and swore"" at Tory rebels and should be disciplined. ""The fact that you have at the heart of No 10 as the PM's senior advisor an unelected, foul-mouthed oaf throwing his weight around is completely unacceptable,"" he told the BBC. ""If the PM doesn't have Dominic Cummings frogmarched out of Downing Street himself then the chances are it not be the Tory rebels or Jeremy Corbyn but Mr Cummings who will bring down this administration.""

YouTube fined over using kids' data to target ads,"YouTube has been fined a record $170m (Â£139m) by a US regulator for violating children's privacy laws. Google, which owns YouTube, agreed to pay the sum in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The video-streaming site had been accused of collecting data on children under 13, without parental consent. The FTC said the data was used to target ads to the children, which contravened the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (Coppa). ""There's no excuse for YouTube's violations of the law,"" said FTC chairman Joe Simons. He added that when it came to complying with Coppa, Google had refused to acknowledge that parts of its main YouTube service were directed at children.

PM challenges Corbyn to October election,"This video can not be played Corbyn to Johnson: ""A lot of people have a great deal to fear"" Boris Johnson will call for a general election on 15 October if Labour and rebel Tories succeed in blocking a no-deal Brexit. He challenged Jeremy Corbyn to put his policy of ""dither and delay"" over EU withdrawal to the British people. Mr Johnson needs the support of two-thirds of MPs to trigger an election. But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told Labour MPs the leadership would not back an election until a delay had been agreed with the EU. Chancellor Sajid Javid has presented his spending planto MPs in the Commons, with the health service, education and the police expected to fare well. He told MPs the government had ""turned the page on austerity"", outlining Â£13.8bn of investment on areas including health and education. Mr Javid said it was the fastest spending increase for 15 years, but the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused him of ""meaningless platitudes"". Meanwhile, No 10's decision to expel 21 Tory MPs for defying the party whip on Tuesday continues to causes recriminations in the party. Live updates: Johnson to face MPs after Brexit defeat Kuenssberg: Politics is upside down Do the UK's voters support a no-deal Brexit? Brexit's big week: Five things we learned on Tuesday Will there be an early election? One of those booted out of the party, Margot James, has publicly questioned the role played by Dominic Cummings, the PM's senior aide, in the decision. Raising the issue at PMQs, she urged Mr Johnson to bear in mind his predecessor Margaret Thatcher's famous adage that ""advisers advise and ministers decide"". And in Scotland, a judgehas rejected a bid to have Mr Johnson's plan to shut down Parliament ahead of Brexit declared illegal. The showdown between the government and opponents of a no-deal Brexit will continue later as Labour and other opposition parties seek to pass a bill requesting a further delay if there is no deal by 19 October. A total of 21 Tories defied the PM on Tuesday to vote with the opposition to enable the bill to be considered, as Mr Johnson suffered his first Commons defeat as prime minister by a margin of 328 votes to 301. This video can not be played Margot James: ""Advisers advise, ministers decide"" If the Brexit delay bill passes later on and moves to the Lords, as is expected, Mr Johnson will push for an immediate vote on an early general election. What does the no-deal bill say? Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said it was ""absolutely clear"" that the UK would get a new deal from Brussels, with the controversial Irish backstop removed. He suggested that Mr Corbyn was afraid of the judgement of the people, joking that ""there is only one chlorinated chicken I can see this House and he is on that bench"". But the Labour leader said the PM was ""running down the clock"" on a no-deal Brexit and ""hiding the facts"" about the likelihood of food and medicine shortages. ""I don't see how I can be accused of undermining the negotiations because there are no negotiations taking place,"" he told MPs. How feasible are the government spending plans? Social care and prisons 'need money most' Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Radio 4's Today that Labour wanted a general election but ""on its terms not Boris Johnson's terms"". He said the party did not ""trust"" the PM to hold the election before the Brexit deadline, as No 10 had ""lied"" last month when it denied reports that it planned to suspend Parliament. ""We are not shy of a general election but we are not going to be trapped into abandoning control of Parliament or be taken in what Boris Johnson says because we don't trust him."" But, at a meeting in London, a succession of Labour MPs called on the leadership to hold off backing an election until after Brexit had been delayed. The BBC's Chris Mason said one MP reportedly told colleagues: ""Johnson said it is Brexit do or die on October 31st. I want him to die."" Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a prime minister must have the backing of at least two-thirds of the UK's 650 MPs before a poll can be called outside of the fixed five-year terms. The Lib Dems say they will vote against an early election at this stage. Downing Street said the 21 Tory MPs who rebelled in Tuesday's vote would have the whip removed, effectively expelling them from the parliamentary party and meaning they could not stand as Conservative candidates in the election. Among the jettisoned rebels are former justice secretary David Gauke, Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames, and Rory Stewart, who recently stood against Boris Johnson to be the party leader. The former international development secretary told the Today programme he was sacked by text message, as he was being given the GQ magazine award for politician of the year. ""It was a pretty astonishing moment,"" he said. ""It feels a little bit like something you associate with other countries - one opposes the leader, one loses the leadership race, no longer in the cabinet and now apparently thrown out of the party and one's seat too."" Mr Stewart said the decision to stop him standing as a candidate was ""un-Conservative"" and the final decision should rest with local associations and not be made centrally. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Another of the rebels, Richard Benyon, said he would continue to sit on the Tory benches and support the PM's domestic agenda, saying he hoped to return to the fold ""one day"". But there have been calls from loyal MPs for No 10 to rethink its conduct amid anger over the treatment of rebels and the suspension of Parliament. Sir Roger Gale said Dominic Cummings, one of Mr Johnson's closest advisers, had ""abused and swore"" at Tory rebels and should be disciplined. ""The fact that you have at the heart of No 10 as the PM's senior advisor an unelected, foul-mouthed oaf throwing his weight around is completely unacceptable,"" he told the BBC. ""If the PM doesn't have Dominic Cummings frogmarched out of Downing Street himself then the chances are it not be the Tory rebels or Jeremy Corbyn but Mr Cummings who will bring down this administration.""

School funding boost to reverse cuts,"Schools in England will receive Â£2.6bn extra next year under Chancellor Sajid Javid's spending plans. This will be the first step towards reversing budget cuts and returning school funding to pre-austerity levels. The announcement follows last week's unveiling of a three-year plan to boost school funding by Â£7.1bn by 2022-23. School leaders have raised concerns about relying on a funding plan that will take three years at a time of such political and economic volatility. The chancellor told the House of Commons putting more money into schools was investing in ""lifelines of opportunity"". This announcement, relating to spending for 2020-21, confirms the first slice of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge to significantly increase school spending. When it was outlined last week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the full three-year funding package would be sufficient to reverse the budget reductions of the past decade. Mr Javid said improving school funding was vital to ""national renewal"" and schools that had been underfunded would receive the biggest increases. His plans will mean: a new minimum level of per pupil spending of Â£5,000 in secondary and Â£4,000 in primary schools an extra Â£700m for pupils with special educational needs teachers will have a starting salary of Â£30,000, from 2022-23, to tackle recruitment difficulties Â£400m extra to support further and vocational education Â£66m extra for early-years provision schools in Wales and Northern Ireland are also expected to receive increased funding The promise of more money for schools follows a long-running campaign over cash shortages - with head teachers writing to millions of parents about budget problems. Along with supporting the NHS and increasing police numbers, school funding has been seen by the government as a priority for the public. The chancellor has promised extra money for further education and vocational qualifications The extra cash announced by the chancellor will deliver a real-terms increase. The Â£2.6bn for the first year includes about Â£1.8bn in additional money, above the increase that would have been in the pipeline from rising pupil numbers and inflation. And the government has separately committed to spending an extra Â£1.5bn per year to cover the rising costs of school staff pensions. For the third year of the package - the Â£7.1bn increase - this will be worth Â£4.6bn extra after inflation is taken into account. Jules White, the West Sussex head teacher who has organised a campaign involving thousands of schools, described the funding increase as a ""welcome step in the right direction"". But, he said, the initial Â£2.6bn announced would still leave ""some way to go"" before pre-austerity spending levels were reached. Multi-billion cash promise for schools Teacher starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000 Further education promised Â£400m extra ""At a time of deep political uncertainty, relentlessly reasonable head teachers will monitor the situation and take time to consider our next steps,"" he said. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""We've won the argument that the Treasury needed to come up with new money. ""The government has made a significant stride in the right direction and the money that's been announced is good news - but we're not there yet and we can see where some of the gaps still remain."" Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union, said the funding promises ""go some way towards closing the gap, but are still significantly short of what is required"". Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, had rejected the three-year funding plan as a ""con trick"" that would still leave schools waiting years for funding they needed straight away.

Chancellor declares end of austerityThe government has unveiled the biggest spending increase in 15 years.BusinessComments,"This video can not be played The chancellor's spending plans include investment in healthcare, education and policing The government has declared it has ""turned the page on austerity"" as it set out plans to raise spending across all departments. Chancellor Sajid Javid outlined Â£13.8bn of investment in areas including health, education and the police in what he said was the fastest increase in spending for 15 years. The plans cover one year and come amid intense political turmoil over Brexit. Labour criticised the spending plans as ""grubby electioneering"". Mr Javid said: ""No department will be cut next year. Every single department has had its budget for day to day spending increased at least in line with inflation. ""That's what I mean by the end of austerity."" But the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused Mr Javid of ""meaningless platitudes"". ""Do not insult the intelligence of the British people,"" he said. He accused the government of ""pretending to end austerity when they do nothing of the sort"". This video can not be played Shadow chancellor John McDonnell criticised the spending plans as ""grubby electioneering"" Mr Javid is not first chancellor to claim that austerity is on the way out. His predecessor Philip Hammond said that the ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end"" in his autumn Budget last year, when he promised a Â£30bn boost in public spending by 2024. The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, said Mr Javid's plan signalled a ""real change in direction on spending but most areas of public service spending were still much below 2010 levels"". ""Health is the big exception,"" he said. Overall, the IFS said spending would still be 3% below its level a decade ago, and more than 9% lower in per person terms. ""Non-health budgets have also lost out to rising NHS funding: real spending outside the Department of Health will still be 16% lower (21% lower in per person terms) next year than in 2010â11,"" it added. Mr Johnson also warned that the current weakness in the UK economy could weigh on the government's declaration of the end of austerity. ""We of course live in a time of extreme economic uncertainty and I think the big risk in saying that austerity is over is that the economy starts to do significantly worse, which it might if we have a no-deal Brexit,"" he said. ""Then the deficit and debt will start rising and we are in danger of having another dose of austerity to get that over with for a second time."" Â£13.8bn in extra day-to-day spending for 2020-21, representing a 4.1% uptick NHS funding increase of Â£6.2bn next year, most of which was already announced under Theresa May's government Education spending increase of Â£7.1bn by 2022-23 compared to the current fiscal year Secondary schools to be allocated a minimum Â£5,000 per pupil, primary schools will get Â£3,750 Â£750m for 20,000 police officers including Â£45m to hire 2,000 police by March next year Home Office day-to-day spending to increase by 6.3% Ministry of Defence funding to increase by Â£2.2bn or 2.6% Confirmation of an additional Â£2bn in Brexit preparation funding, on top of Â£2.1bn already announced. This was a spending round not a review. The difference is that Mr Javid's plans are only for one year and not the usual three-year strategy set out by the chancellor because of the ongoing uncertainty over the impact of Brexit. Mr Javid's was also a very political speech. He laid out the spending plans against the possibility that the UK is heading for another general election - the country's third in five years. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain will go to the polls if he is forced to request an extension to the 31 October deadline for the UK to leave the European Union. Mr Javid was criticised twice during his speech by the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow for talking about a bill - which MPs will vote on later today - that would force Mr Johnson to ask the EU for a delay in Britain's exit, instead of focusing on the spending round. Mr Bercow said that it was  ""very, very unseemly"", adding: ""It bothers me greatly that the right honourable gentleman in the course of a statement seems to be veering into matters, not even tangential but unrelated to the spending round upon which he is focused."" The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) hasn't said anything because this is a separate spending round and has been sperated from the Budget. As a result, there are no new forecasts from the independent fiscal watchdog which means the chancellor's spending plan is based on predictions published back in March by the OBR. PM challenges Corbyn to back October election How feasible are the government's spending plans? Brexit: PM in new battle after Commons vote defeat Spending Review: What's it all about? Under those forecasts, the government had around Â£15bn to borrow within its self-imposed overdraft limit of 2% of the value of the national economy. Since then, the UK's gross domestic product (GDP)shrank by 0.2% during the second quarter. If it contracts again between July and September, the country will officially be in recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. On Wednesday,data measuring activity in the UK's dominant services sector, which accounts for nearly three quarters of GDP, showed that growth slowed in August following poor figures from both manufacturing and construction during the same month. If the UK falls into recession, it would mean that the government would break its own fiscal rules. Although Mr Javid said on Wednesday that ahead of the Budget later this year he will review its fiscal framework: ""To ensure it meets the economic priorities of today not of a decade ago"". Separately, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that the worst case hit to the economy of a no-deal Brexit is now ""less severe"" thanks to preparations made since the end of last year. In a Treasury Select Committee hearing, Mr Carney said if the UK left the EU with no deal, the economy would shrink by 5.5% rather than the 8% slump it had predicted in November.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a double defeat in the Commons after MPs turned down his motion for a general election. There has been a lot to take in, so if you're still catching up - and who would blame you - here's a quick reminder of the major happenings: The Daily Mirror uses its front page to declare Mr Johnson ""Britain's worst PM (since the last one)"". An image of what the paper calls a ""deflated"" Mr Johnson looking downward fills the front page. Theresa May smiles out from an inset picture. A more animated photo of the prime minister fills the front page of the Daily Express. ""Boris urges 'people power' to force election,"" is the headline. It calls Jeremy Corbyn's decision not to support a general election until a bill designed to help avert a no-deal Brexit is passed ""an extraordinary act of cowardice"". The front pages of the Daily Mail and the Sun both pick up on Boris Johnson calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""chicken"" for refusing to back a general election before the Hilary Benn's bill is passed into law. The Sun goes as far as superimposing the Labour leader's face onto a chicken, alongside the headline ""Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?"". Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph opts for the headline ""'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock"". The newspapers are responding to another momentous day in Parliament. The front pages of the i, the Guardian and the Financial Times all say the prime minister has been left ""cornered"" by MPs after losing three votes in the Commons.

Police use of facial recognition ruled lawfulHigh Court rules against a Cardiff shopper who brought a judicial review against South Wales Police.,"The South Wales force demonstrated the technology after the case with a member of staff standing in Judges have ruled against a shopper who brought a legal challenge against police use of automated facial recognition (AFR) technology. The court refused the judicial review on all grounds, finding South Wales Police had followed the rules and their use of AFR was justified. The High Court said this was the first time any court in the world had considered the use of the technology. Civil rights group Liberty said its client would appeal against the ruling. It had argued it was akin to the unregulated taking of DNA or fingerprints without consent, and it is campaigning for an outright ban of the practice. Ed Bridges has had his image captured twice by AFR technology The judicial review washeld in Mayafter Ed Bridges, from Cardiff, claimed his human rights were breached when he was photographed while Christmas shopping. His legal challenge argued the use of the tool breached his right to privacy as well as data protection and equality laws. The court's key findings included: South Wales Police's use of AFR met the requirements of the Human Rights Act and its actions were subject to sufficient legal controls On data protection, the force was processing personal data, but in a lawful manner that met the conditions set out in the legislation The force had complied with equality laws The current legal regime is adequate to ensure the appropriate and non-arbitrary use of AFR. Liberty lawyer Megan Goulding said: ""This disappointing judgment does not reflect the very serious threat that facial recognition poses to our rights and freedoms. ""Facial recognition is a highly intrusive surveillance technology that allows the police to monitor and track us all."" South Wales Police are considered the national lead force on its use Police operating the system inside the van Mr Bridges said he had his image captured by the technology a second time at a peaceful protest against the arms trade. On Wednesday he added: ""South Wales Police has been using facial recognition indiscriminately against thousands of innocent people, without our knowledge or consent. ""This sinister technology undermines our privacy and I will continue to fight against its unlawful use to ensure our rights are protected and we are free from disproportionate government surveillance."" A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner, which had argued during the judicial review the legal framework for police use of AFR was not sufficient, said they would be reviewing the judgment carefully. They welcomed the finding that the police use of the technology involved processing sensitive personal data. ""Our investigation into the first police pilots of this technology has recently finished. We will now consider the court's findings in finalising our recommendations and guidance to police forces about how to plan, authorise and deploy any future [facial recognition] systems. ""In the meantime, any police forces or private organisations using these systems should be aware that existing data protection law and guidance still apply."" There are worries the technology is more likely to return false matches for women and people from ethnic minorities Automated facial recognition technology maps faces in a crowd by measuring the distance between features, then compares results with a ""watch list"" of images - which can include suspects, missing people and persons of interest. Concerns have been raised the technology is intrusive and more likely to return false positives for women and people from ethnic minorities. South Wales Police, Metropolitan Police and Leicestershire Police have used facial recognition in public spaces since June 2015. South Wales Chief Constable Matt Jukes said the decision was welcome but not the end of the ""wider debate"". ""I recognise that the use of AI and face-matching technologies around the world is of great interest and, at times, concern. ""So, I'm pleased that the court has recognised the responsibility that South Wales Police has shown in our programme. With the benefit of this judgment, we will continue to explore how to ensure the ongoing fairness and transparency of our approach."" South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said his priority had been to ensure the police ""make best use of technology to keep the public safe while also working within the law and protecting civil liberties."" The Home Office welcomed the judgment confirming there was a ""clear and sufficient legal framework"" for the use of AFR. Mr Justice Swift and Lord Justice Haddon-Cave, who gave their decision on Wednesday, had previously described it as ""an important case that makes novel and potentially far-reaching"" conclusions.

Police use of facial recognition ruled lawful,"The South Wales force demonstrated the technology after the case with a member of staff standing in Judges have ruled against a shopper who brought a legal challenge against police use of automated facial recognition (AFR) technology. The court refused the judicial review on all grounds, finding South Wales Police had followed the rules and their use of AFR was justified. The High Court said this was the first time any court in the world had considered the use of the technology. Civil rights group Liberty said its client would appeal against the ruling. It had argued it was akin to the unregulated taking of DNA or fingerprints without consent, and it is campaigning for an outright ban of the practice. Ed Bridges has had his image captured twice by AFR technology The judicial review washeld in Mayafter Ed Bridges, from Cardiff, claimed his human rights were breached when he was photographed while Christmas shopping. His legal challenge argued the use of the tool breached his right to privacy as well as data protection and equality laws. The court's key findings included: South Wales Police's use of AFR met the requirements of the Human Rights Act and its actions were subject to sufficient legal controls On data protection, the force was processing personal data, but in a lawful manner that met the conditions set out in the legislation The force had complied with equality laws The current legal regime is adequate to ensure the appropriate and non-arbitrary use of AFR. Liberty lawyer Megan Goulding said: ""This disappointing judgment does not reflect the very serious threat that facial recognition poses to our rights and freedoms. ""Facial recognition is a highly intrusive surveillance technology that allows the police to monitor and track us all."" South Wales Police are considered the national lead force on its use Police operating the system inside the van Mr Bridges said he had his image captured by the technology a second time at a peaceful protest against the arms trade. On Wednesday he added: ""South Wales Police has been using facial recognition indiscriminately against thousands of innocent people, without our knowledge or consent. ""This sinister technology undermines our privacy and I will continue to fight against its unlawful use to ensure our rights are protected and we are free from disproportionate government surveillance."" A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner, which had argued during the judicial review the legal framework for police use of AFR was not sufficient, said they would be reviewing the judgment carefully. They welcomed the finding that the police use of the technology involved processing sensitive personal data. ""Our investigation into the first police pilots of this technology has recently finished. We will now consider the court's findings in finalising our recommendations and guidance to police forces about how to plan, authorise and deploy any future [facial recognition] systems. ""In the meantime, any police forces or private organisations using these systems should be aware that existing data protection law and guidance still apply."" There are worries the technology is more likely to return false matches for women and people from ethnic minorities Automated facial recognition technology maps faces in a crowd by measuring the distance between features, then compares results with a ""watch list"" of images - which can include suspects, missing people and persons of interest. Concerns have been raised the technology is intrusive and more likely to return false positives for women and people from ethnic minorities. South Wales Police, Metropolitan Police and Leicestershire Police have used facial recognition in public spaces since June 2015. South Wales Chief Constable Matt Jukes said the decision was welcome but not the end of the ""wider debate"". ""I recognise that the use of AI and face-matching technologies around the world is of great interest and, at times, concern. ""So, I'm pleased that the court has recognised the responsibility that South Wales Police has shown in our programme. With the benefit of this judgment, we will continue to explore how to ensure the ongoing fairness and transparency of our approach."" South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said his priority had been to ensure the police ""make best use of technology to keep the public safe while also working within the law and protecting civil liberties."" The Home Office welcomed the judgment confirming there was a ""clear and sufficient legal framework"" for the use of AFR. Mr Justice Swift and Lord Justice Haddon-Cave, who gave their decision on Wednesday, had previously described it as ""an important case that makes novel and potentially far-reaching"" conclusions.

Scale of Bahamas hurricane devastation emerges,"This video can not be played Aerials show scale of destruction in the Bahamas caused by Hurricane Dorian Rescuers have begun to reach areas of the northern Bahamas devastated by Hurricane Dorian, with aerial images showing a trail of destruction. PM Hubert Minnis said some areas had been ""decimated"" as the death toll rose to at least 20. The hurricane made landfall on 1 September and battered the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama, in the north of the archipelago, for two days. Dorian has moved off north and still threatens the eastern US seaboard. Forecasters have warned it could make landfall on the coast of South or North Carolina on Thursday. From the air - the destruction of the Abaco Islands Hurricane Dorian: Who's at risk? Although the hurricane has weakened to a category two storm with maximum sustained winds of 105mph (165km/h), it has grown larger in area. This video can not be played Residents in the Bahamas say 'it's total devastation' Mr Minnis said the Bahamas was facing ""one of the greatest national crises in our country's history"". Late on Wednesday,the country's health minister, Duane Sands, confirmed that the death toll had risen from seven to at least 20,external. Lia Head-Rigby, who runs a relief group and overflew the Abacos, previously said her representatives had told her there were ""a lot more dead"". ""It's total devastation. It's decimated. Apocalyptic,"" she told the Associated Press (AP) news agency. Aerial images over the Abacos, including the port town of Marsh Harbour, showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels. ""There's nothing left in most of Marsh Harbour,"" said Alicia Cook, who evacuated from the area. ""People are starting to panic: pillaging, looting... it's just no way everyone's going to get out."" Residents share images of devastation Bob Cornea also spoke to the BBC in the capital Nassau after being evacuated from Marsh Harbour. He said he and his wife took shelter on the second storey of their son's house. ""Water was up to my neck. It stayed like that for two or three hours... My son... he got us out and we got over to safety. ""We've been through all kinds of hurricanes, all kinds of storms: never anything that bad. I mean, it was like we were standing in the middle of the ocean. That's what it looked like. Waves, the water just crashing in over us. Horrifying. Absolutely horrifying."" Opposition leader Philip Brave Davis described the scenes from a flight over the islands as a ""horrible sight"". Parts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain. The situation on Grand Bahama is less clear, as Dorian only moved on late on Tuesday after nearly two days of pummelling, cutting many communication lines. Most rescue work was being done on an ad hoc basis by locals using boats and jet skis, but it was being hampered by flooded roads, fallen trees and submerged debris. Rescue teams were ""beginning to get on the ground"", National Security Minister Marvin Dames said on Wednesday, according to AP. This video can not be played Watch BBC Weather's forecast amid concerns for Florida, Georgia and Carolinas Mr Minnis said: ""Our priority at this time is search, rescue and recovery. It will take all of us as a caring community - government, church, businesses and individuals - to help restore the lives of our people."" People have taken to social media to post lists of those they have lost contact with during the storm. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - have been severely damaged or destroyed. Some 60,000 people will need food aid and clean water, UN officials say. A map from the Finnish satellite company ICEYE showed the extent of the flooding on Grand Bahama: At 18:00 GMT, the National Hurricane Center,externalsaid Dorian was located about 115 miles (185km) east of Jacksonville in Florida and about 180 miles south of Charleston, South Carolina. The storm - moving at 9mph (15km/h) - would travel parallel to the Florida and Georgia coasts through Wednesday night, then ""near or over"" the coasts of the Carolinas through Thursday and Friday, it said. The NHC warned there was a danger of life-threatening storm surges for coastal communities north of Port Canaveral in Florida all the way to the North Carolina-Virginia border. Dorian is expected to weaken over the next few days but will remain a powerful hurricane. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian rips into Bahamas Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

Love Island stars appear at MPs' inquiry,"The Jeremy Kyle Show was cancelled in May The Jeremy Kyle Show producers treated guests like criminal suspects, the MP leading an inquiry into reality TV has claimed. The House of Commons culture select committee heard from two of the show's former guests on Wednesday. Dwayne Davison, who first appeared in 2014, told MPs he was locked in a small room and had his phone taken off him. ""I think someone in police custody would have more rights and better treatment,"" Damian Collins MP said. The committee is investigating whether enough support is offered during and after filming on reality TV. The inquiry was set up after the death of a man who had taken a lie detector test on The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the suicides of two former Love Island contestants. Mr Davison, who became known as Kyle's ""most-hated guest"", told the committee he was exploited by the show, and that it ""ruined my life"", receiving death threats and losing two jobs as a result. Dwayne Davison said his life ""drastically"" changed after appearing on The Jeremy Kyle Show His requests to have clips of his appearance taken off the show's YouTube channel were repeatedly turned down, ""I asked them multiple times, cried, they weren't interested one bit."" Mr Davison said he even attempted suicide at one point: ""In 2018, I took 30 codeine tablets, swallowed them all, I don't remember what happened."" ""If I knew what my life would have turned into I would never have gone on that show,"" he added. He said the only thing he would class as ""aftercare"" was a ""one-minute phone call"". He said he was given his taxi fare home and kicked out 20 minutes after the recording and ""that was it"". 'I was traumatised': Kyle guests relive their appearances Jeremy Kyle working on new ITV show How The Jeremy Kyle Show became a 'toxic brand' Before the recording, he was kept in a locked room, he said. ""The smallest, tiniest room you've ever seen. Your phone is taken off you. I'm sat in this room for 10 hours, the door's locked. My partner has been taken away from me. So you're anxious."" Mr Collins, who chairs the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee, said that sounded ""astonishing"" and ""horrific"". Mr Davison appeared on the show a second time, in 2015, but only because a ""charismatic"" producer persuaded him he could ""redeem"" himself, he said. ""I came onto the stage and it was like a war zone,"" he said, adding that the host was goading him, but those parts were not shown. ""They completely edited that out and only showed my reaction. How unfair is that?"" Another former Kyle guest, Robert Gregory, who was contacted by the programme after a man told producers he wanted to prove he was his father, said he had been ""totally humiliated"". ""They crucified me. They absolutely ripped me apart,"" he told the committee. ""I said, 'You've obviously decided I am a bad person.'"" He added: ""There is no aftercare, it doesn't exist."" The Jeremy Kyle Show was cancelled by ITV in May after the death of Steve Dymond, who took a lie detector test during an appearance. After the hearing, an ITV statement said: ""As a producer and broadcaster ITV takes its responsibilities around duty of care to participants very seriously. Supporting the physical and mental health of everyone involved in our programmes is our highest priority. It added: ""We were truly sorry to hear that Dwayne was experiencing mental health problems and suicidal thoughts and have apologised to him that we did not remove the clips from our official ITV YouTube channel. We have offered to pay for counselling, as he has requested."" Love Island's Yewande Biala and Marcel Somerville spoke to the committee Earlier on Wednesday, former Love Island stars Yewande Biala and Marcel Somerville gave evidence about their experiences on that show. Both told the committee they were given psychiatric evaluations by ITV before they appeared on the show and saw doctors in the days and weeks after the series ended. ""The whole time on the show is fine, when you come off it's fine, but because you are in the spotlight, no matter what you do, there will be a story about it,"" Somerville said. ""The press will jump on to anything. If you have a public break-up, you think, this is the worst period ever and then you get trolls who add fire to it - that was the worst part of being on the show. ""They do a psych (evaluation) before you go on and when the show is finished you do another psych, and then again a week later. But it should be one three or six months down the line because that's when you're dealing with it."" In its statement, ITV said it ""constantly strives for best practice in all our programmes"", pointing out that last year it asked former chief medical officer Dr Paul Litchfield to carry out an independent review of the processes on Love Island. ""This review led us to extend our support processes for this year's series to a level that we consider industry-leading,"" it said. Former Blazin' Squad member Somerville also revealed he refused to go on the show the first year he was asked because he had concerns about the diversity of the line-up. ""I spoke to the casting producers, done a medical, but they wanted me to go on for the last two weeks of the show,"" he said. ""I basically said I wasn't too sure if I wanted to go on the show at that time because the show didn't look very diverse. ""I didn't want to be the first black person to be on the show as a bombshell because you've go to go in there and try and steal someone's girlfriend.""

RBS faces up to Â£900m in new PPI charges,"RBS says its profits could fall by a third this year after a surge of last-minute claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance ahead of the August deadline. The bank said it expects to take an additional charge of between Â£600m and Â£900m after receiving a ""significantly higher"" amount of claims last month. It is a blow for the bank which only recently returned to profitability. The state-owned lender had previously forecast profits of Â£2.7bn for 2019. PPI was designed to cover loan repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost their job, but many were sold to people who did not want or need them. Banks hard to reach as PPI deadline arrives Lloyds Banking Group sets aside further Â£100m for PPI PPI: 'It was a jaw-dropping amount' Banks and other providers sold millions of the policies, mainly between 1990 and 2010. The deadline to seek compensation was 29 August, prompting a surge of last minute claims from consumers. Santander was forced to extend its deadline for claims until 20:00 on 30 August after its online complaints formstopped working on 28 August. Nat West, which is owned by RBS, also experienced issues online and there were long waits to get through to its phone lines. RBS has set aside Â£5.3bn in total to cover PPI compensation, Â£4.9bn of which has already been spent. However, the latest charges have come as a surprise for the bank which is still 62% owned by the taxpayer. In 2018 it posted itsfirst annual profit in a decade, after struggling to recover from the impact of the 2008 financial crisis. And in its half-year results this year, it reported a 130% jump in earnings to Â£2bn - its best half-year performance for a decade - as well as a special dividend of 12p a share. An astonishing Â£36bn in compensation has been paid out so far, with the typical payout amounting to Â£2,000. In MayLloyds Banking Group set aside a further Â£100mas compensation in May, bringing its total provision to Â£19.5bn.

An unusual flurry of drama from the Treasury, that department better known for the staid crunching of numbers, saw Chancellor Sajid Javid's much-touted speech, in which he was to set out his vision for the economy, cancelled at short notice. Instead, the instruction was to stand by for the spending review next week. The idea is to get the spending plans out of the way, so that the focus can be on Brexit. That, of course, is the official line, but the speculation is that this is the precursor to a snap election, a touting of sweeteners for voters in the form of extra cash for areas such as health, education and policing. Boris Johnson was elected by party members on the back of a list of spending intentions (and tax cuts). That list was sparse on detail, but some estimates put the total cost at north of Â£30bn. How much of the former are likely to be delivered next Wednesday? Mr Javid says there'll be no blank cheque. Instead, this chancellor - who'll have been in the post just six weeks come the spending review - appears to be borrowing his predecessor Philip Hammond's playbook. That chancellor first told me back in April that if a Brexit deal hadn't been struck by the autumn, it'd be sensible to lay out plans for just one year, not the usual three, in case extra funds needed to be used to support the economy in the event of a no-deal. Mr Hammond's successor is not only doing that, but also sticking to the existing borrowing rules. In the short term, that primarily means limiting the deficit to below 2% of GDP, after adjusting for the ups and downs of the economic cycle up to 2021, with an eye to  eliminating the deficit altogether by 2025. That means Mr Javid can afford to borrow a bit more to spend. He has up to Â£15bn of such ""headroom"" up to 2021 (down from an earlier Â£27bn, because of changes in the way student loans are accounted for). Given the question marks over the path of Brexit, he probably won't use it all. And it won't be enough to cover the prime minister's wishlist: areas such as defence and culture may not get much of a look in. An emphasis on ""choices"" and ""priorities"" again suggests that Mr Javid is sticking to the Hammond script and emphasising fiscal responsibility. But there's still enough to spend and he will inevitably claim to be ending austerity - although there's a way to go to reverse all the cuts in real terms of recent years. However, for the big picture, his vision for the economy, we'll have to wait until the Budget, which may not happen until late autumn. It is only then that we'll get updated forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility on the state of the economy and the public purse. There's speculation abound that No 10 was behind the decision to ditch the chancellor's speech and bring forward the spending review. But that doesn't mean the prime minister is calling all the shots. The game has changed, but the rules No 11 is playing by seem to remain very much the same - for now.

Chancellor declares end of austerity,"This video can not be played The chancellor's spending plans include investment in healthcare, education and policing The government has declared it has ""turned the page on austerity"" as it set out plans to raise spending across all departments. Chancellor Sajid Javid outlined Â£13.8bn of investment in areas including health, education and the police in what he said was the fastest increase in spending for 15 years. The plans cover one year and come amid intense political turmoil over Brexit. Labour criticised the spending plans as ""grubby electioneering"". Mr Javid said: ""No department will be cut next year. Every single department has had its budget for day to day spending increased at least in line with inflation. ""That's what I mean by the end of austerity."" But the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused Mr Javid of ""meaningless platitudes"". ""Do not insult the intelligence of the British people,"" he said. He accused the government of ""pretending to end austerity when they do nothing of the sort"". This video can not be played Shadow chancellor John McDonnell criticised the spending plans as ""grubby electioneering"" Mr Javid is not first chancellor to claim that austerity is on the way out. His predecessor Philip Hammond said that the ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end"" in his autumn Budget last year, when he promised a Â£30bn boost in public spending by 2024. The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, said Mr Javid's plan signalled a ""real change in direction on spending but most areas of public service spending were still much below 2010 levels"". ""Health is the big exception,"" he said. Overall, the IFS said spending would still be 3% below its level a decade ago, and more than 9% lower in per person terms. ""Non-health budgets have also lost out to rising NHS funding: real spending outside the Department of Health will still be 16% lower (21% lower in per person terms) next year than in 2010â11,"" it added. Mr Johnson also warned that the current weakness in the UK economy could weigh on the government's declaration of the end of austerity. ""We of course live in a time of extreme economic uncertainty and I think the big risk in saying that austerity is over is that the economy starts to do significantly worse, which it might if we have a no-deal Brexit,"" he said. ""Then the deficit and debt will start rising and we are in danger of having another dose of austerity to get that over with for a second time."" Â£13.8bn in extra day-to-day spending for 2020-21, representing a 4.1% uptick NHS funding increase of Â£6.2bn next year, most of which was already announced under Theresa May's government Education spending increase of Â£7.1bn by 2022-23 compared to the current fiscal year Secondary schools to be allocated a minimum Â£5,000 per pupil, primary schools will get Â£3,750 Â£750m for 20,000 police officers including Â£45m to hire 2,000 police by March next year Home Office day-to-day spending to increase by 6.3% Ministry of Defence funding to increase by Â£2.2bn or 2.6% Confirmation of an additional Â£2bn in Brexit preparation funding, on top of Â£2.1bn already announced. This was a spending round not a review. The difference is that Mr Javid's plans are only for one year and not the usual three-year strategy set out by the chancellor because of the ongoing uncertainty over the impact of Brexit. Mr Javid's was also a very political speech. He laid out the spending plans against the possibility that the UK is heading for another general election - the country's third in five years. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain will go to the polls if he is forced to request an extension to the 31 October deadline for the UK to leave the European Union. Mr Javid was criticised twice during his speech by the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow for talking about a bill - which MPs will vote on later today - that would force Mr Johnson to ask the EU for a delay in Britain's exit, instead of focusing on the spending round. Mr Bercow said that it was  ""very, very unseemly"", adding: ""It bothers me greatly that the right honourable gentleman in the course of a statement seems to be veering into matters, not even tangential but unrelated to the spending round upon which he is focused."" The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) hasn't said anything because this is a separate spending round and has been sperated from the Budget. As a result, there are no new forecasts from the independent fiscal watchdog which means the chancellor's spending plan is based on predictions published back in March by the OBR. PM challenges Corbyn to back October election How feasible are the government's spending plans? Brexit: PM in new battle after Commons vote defeat Spending Review: What's it all about? Under those forecasts, the government had around Â£15bn to borrow within its self-imposed overdraft limit of 2% of the value of the national economy. Since then, the UK's gross domestic product (GDP)shrank by 0.2% during the second quarter. If it contracts again between July and September, the country will officially be in recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. On Wednesday,data measuring activity in the UK's dominant services sector, which accounts for nearly three quarters of GDP, showed that growth slowed in August following poor figures from both manufacturing and construction during the same month. If the UK falls into recession, it would mean that the government would break its own fiscal rules. Although Mr Javid said on Wednesday that ahead of the Budget later this year he will review its fiscal framework: ""To ensure it meets the economic priorities of today not of a decade ago"". Separately, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that the worst case hit to the economy of a no-deal Brexit is now ""less severe"" thanks to preparations made since the end of last year. In a Treasury Select Committee hearing, Mr Carney said if the UK left the EU with no deal, the economy would shrink by 5.5% rather than the 8% slump it had predicted in November.

Spending plans unveiled after testy PMQs,"Brexit delay bill passes the House of Commons It would force Boris Johnson to ask EU for delay to Brexit to prevent no deal PM says there must now be a general election But his bid to hold one on 15 October fails due to lack of opposition support Earlier, chancellor set out spending plans for coming year Hamish Mackay, Kate Whannel and Matt Cannon That ends our rolling coverage for today on yet another eventful day in the Commons. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a double defeat in the Commons after MPs turned down his motion for a general election. There has been a lot to take in, so if you're still catching up - and who would blame you - here's a quick reminder of the major happenings: The Daily Mirror uses its front page to declare Mr Johnson ""Britain's worst PM (since the last one)"". An image of what the paper calls a ""deflated"" Mr Johnson looking downward fills the front page. Theresa May smiles out from an inset picture. A more animated photo of the prime minister fills the front page of the Daily Express. ""Boris urges 'people power' to force election,"" is the headline. It calls Jeremy Corbyn's decision not to support a general election until a bill designed to help avert a no-deal Brexit is passed ""an extraordinary act of cowardice"". The front pages of the Daily Mail and the Sun both pick up on Boris Johnson calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""chicken"" for refusing to back a general election before the Hilary Benn's bill is passed into law. The Sun goes as far as superimposing the Labour leader's face onto a chicken, alongside the headline ""Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?"". Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph opts for the headline ""'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock"". The newspapers are responding to another momentous day in Parliament. The front pages of the i, the Guardian and the Financial Times all say the prime minister has been left ""cornered"" by MPs after losing three votes in the Commons.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"".

In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Those arriving in the UK before the end of next year will be able to apply to the new scheme, the government confirmed on Wednesday evening.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In terms of health and care, there were two eye-catching
numbers in the Chancellorâs spending announcement - Â£6.2bn extra for the NHS
and Â£1.5bn for social care. Neither are quite what they seem. The Â£6.2bn refers to the
extra cash the frontline of the NHS is getting next year as part of the
five-year settlement announced a year ago by Theresa May. What is new however is how much extra the rest of health is
getting. This is money that goes on the likes of buildings maintenance and
training for staff. It is rising by Â£400m to Â£9bn. Experts have welcomed the
money, but say it comes off the back of cuts in previous years. In comparison, the social care announcement for councils is
genuinely new. Although the Â£1.5bn includes Â£500m which will only be raised
from a 2% increase in council tax. The County Councils Network says the extra
money is just about enough to stand still.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The worst impacts of a potential no-deal Brexit can only be mitigated rather than avoided, said Catherine McGuinness from the City of London Corporation, the financial centre's local authority. She was responding to the Sajid Javid's spending plans, acknowledging: âThe Chancellor is right to accelerate preparations for Brexit as
we draw close to 31 October."" âItâs vital that businesses â small and large â also make sure
they are doing everything possible to prepare in case there is a no-deal
Brexit."" ""A deal would still be the best outcome for businesses and
households on both sides of the Channel,"" she said. âDespite the current uncertainty, London remains home to a unique
combination of time zone, language, legal system, global talent, and financial
services ecosystem. These fundamental strengths will underpin our long-term
success.â Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent The Chancellor, more than anyone else in the Commons, will know how police have struggled with rising violent crime: he listened to their warnings of underfunding when he was Home Secretary. So long-trailed funding for more officers is no surprise. There are 21,000 fewer police today than in 2010 because of the cuts that began under David Cameron and George Osborne. Boris Johnson says that will be reversed within three years. Today's starting pledge to have recruited an extra 2,000 by next March will only cover about 10% of those who have been lost. But ... about 6% of police officers leave the job each year. That means the forces may in fact need to attract as many as 44,000 new officers to meet the pledge. Responding to a question from the Lib Dems' Ed Davey, Mr Javid said his party had no plans to ""crash out of the EU"" and said to avoid a no-deal Brexit, MPs should vote against a bill that could extend the 31 October deadline.

How feasible are the government's spending plans?,"The big message the government will try to send with its spending round is about the austerity decade ending. In particular the thing it will want to get across is that funding is pouring into those public services most visibly problematic for the Conservatives in the 2017 general election, ahead of yet another fairly imminent visit to the polls. Health, education, and the police will be boosted just in time. Total departmental spending will rise for the first time since before the crisis. The political strategy will be clear: neutralise the toxicity of visible spending cuts made to shrink the deficit since the crisis - in order to help win over Leave voters in traditionally Labour seats. And the good news for the Chancellor and the First Lord of the Treasury, the PM, is that there is some space for this spending. Borrowing costs are low. And deficits have not been lower for 17 years too. So we will hear a lot about the phrase ""fiscal headroom"". This is not extra money that can be spent, it is extra borrowing. It is room to borrow more within the government's self-imposed overdraft limit of 2% of the value of the national economy. The magic number is Â£15bn. It had been Â£27bn, but there have been some changes in the way student loans are accounted for, that have served the purpose of helping the Treasury apply at least some limits. So Â£15bn it is, and already the bulk of that has been allocated in announcements to fund the NHS, schools, further education, defence, policing, and foreign aid. We will get further detail on the rest of it, and there is enough space essentially to provide at least inflation-terms rises for all departmental spending. It will be quite a moment. But the real question is for just how long? Firstly this is not the ordinary three-year spending review. That has effectively been delayed until after Brexit. This is a one-year spending round. It is also being separated from the Budget. This has the happy coincidence that there are no new independent fiscal forecasts from the Office of Budget Responsibility. If there had been, it turns out that - both because the economy has slowed since March, and also because the deficit is running larger than forecast - the Â£15bn number could be considerably smaller, perhaps more than halved. On top of that, one has to note that the headroom was left by the previous Chancellor to help deal with the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. The OBR said in July that even in a modest scenario that could mean a Â£30bn annual hit to the public finances. And yet the plan is not to just to spend the headroom that might not exist, but to go further in the coming weeks and cut taxes on fuel, housing and beyond. Small wonder that at the next Budget the government's tax and spending constraints - its fiscal rules - will be reviewed. Generally speaking, new Chancellors want to establish fiscal credibility in their first fiscal events. In some ways, at least for a few hours, the shadow chancellor, whose plans are, on paper, funded from tax rises, will. The very point of the fiscal framework that has been created over the past few decades was to try to inject some long-term thinking, some stability, and avoid the temptation to rig forecasts to enable unsustainable pre-election giveaways. A pre-election spending round risks undermining that. But that's a small price for the greater prizes sought by politicians within weeks of a possible election.

LiveSpending plans unveiled after testy PMQs,"Brexit delay bill passes the House of Commons It would force Boris Johnson to ask EU for delay to Brexit to prevent no deal PM says there must now be a general election But his bid to hold one on 15 October fails due to lack of opposition support Earlier, chancellor set out spending plans for coming year Hamish Mackay, Kate Whannel and Matt Cannon That ends our rolling coverage for today on yet another eventful day in the Commons. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a double defeat in the Commons after MPs turned down his motion for a general election. There has been a lot to take in, so if you're still catching up - and who would blame you - here's a quick reminder of the major happenings: The Daily Mirror uses its front page to declare Mr Johnson ""Britain's worst PM (since the last one)"". An image of what the paper calls a ""deflated"" Mr Johnson looking downward fills the front page. Theresa May smiles out from an inset picture. A more animated photo of the prime minister fills the front page of the Daily Express. ""Boris urges 'people power' to force election,"" is the headline. It calls Jeremy Corbyn's decision not to support a general election until a bill designed to help avert a no-deal Brexit is passed ""an extraordinary act of cowardice"". The front pages of the Daily Mail and the Sun both pick up on Boris Johnson calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""chicken"" for refusing to back a general election before the Hilary Benn's bill is passed into law. The Sun goes as far as superimposing the Labour leader's face onto a chicken, alongside the headline ""Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?"". Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph opts for the headline ""'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock"". The newspapers are responding to another momentous day in Parliament. The front pages of the i, the Guardian and the Financial Times all say the prime minister has been left ""cornered"" by MPs after losing three votes in the Commons.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"". Find our how your local MP voted on the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and on the PM's call for an early general election. MPs have voted on an early general election and a bill that could delay Brexit. Sir Michael Fallon has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced he will be standing down at the next election. In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Those arriving in the UK before the end of next year will be able to apply to the new scheme, the government confirmed on Wednesday evening. This would allow EU nationals who arrive before the end of 2020 to stay until December 2023. You canread the full story here.

Lego working with shops to avoid Brexit disruption,"Harry Potter was among Lego's best sellers in 2018 The boss of Lego has said the toymaker is working with UK retailers to ""make sure they have enough stock"" this Christmas in case of a no-deal Brexit. Niels Christiansen said the Danish firm was not expecting problems but that he was ""monitoring the situation"" nonetheless. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. But some have warned this could cause chaos for British retailers. Potential risks include delays at ports and higher prices for imported goods caused by further falls in the pound - although others say the claims have been exaggerated. Lego imports its bricks into the UK from the Czech Republic, Denmark and Hungary, suggesting it could be at risk from new trade barriers. 'Everything awesome' at Lego as sales rise It also raised wholesale prices by 5% in the UK in 2016 in response to the pound's devaluation after the Brexit referendum. The firm declined to comment on whether its Christmas pricing might be affected in the case of a no-deal scenario, but Mr Christiansen said the toymaker was unlikely to be ""majorly affected"" by no deal. ""We have been working with customers to make sure the flow of product won't be disrupted,"" he said, but declined to specify what those measures might be. Mr Christiansen made the comments after Lego announced a 4% rise in revenue for the first half of the year to 14.8bn Danish Krone (Â£1.8bn), although profits fell 16% as it reinvested in its business. Lego plans to open a further 80 stores in China this year And at a time when rival toymakers are struggling, the family-owned firm said it planned to open 160 new stores this year globally - 16 of them in the UK. Eighty of the shops will be in China, with the Danish firm on track to have 140 stores in the country by the end of 2019. Asked if he was concerned about a recent slowdown in China's economy, driven by Beijing's trade war with Washington, Mr Christiansen said he still saw the country as a growth market. ""We have been helped by the fact that we produce our products around the world close to where the demand is, so for China we produce in Asia,"" he said. ""There are also many Chinese kids that don't know Lego and whose parents don't know Lego, so we see a real opportunity there."" Despite this, the firm has come up against a wave of counterfeit Lego products in China which Mr Christiansen admitted had been challenging. Copycat brands have even made their way to the UK, although Mr Christiansen said the Chinese authorities were getting tougher on the practice. ""There have been some court rulings in our favour in China, so we do see an element of progress."" China dismantles '$30m fake Lego gang' Lego has committed to use only sustainable materials in its core products and packaging by 2030 amid rising concerns about plastic waste. And last year it launched its first ever Lego products made from polyethylene, a type of plastic derived from sugar cane, to replace materials sourced from fossil fuels. The products only represent 1-2% of the total amount of plastic produced by Lego - leading some to question how committed the firm was to its 2030 goal. But Mr Christiansen stressed that Lego bricks were durable, not ""single use"" plastics and rarely thrown away. ""Our bricks are sometimes kept for 40-60 years,"" he said. Despite this, he said the firm was investing heavily in finding durable yet sustainable alternatives. ""The safety and durability of blocks is not trivial, and we are looking for the right materials.""

Chancellor set to unveil government spending plans,"Chancellor Sajid Javid is set to unveil the government's spending plans for the coming year on Wednesday. The statement will set departmental budgets for just one year rather than the usual three years, due to uncertainty over the impact of Brexit. Mr Javid will announce a further Â£2bn of Brexit funding for the government, as well as confirm additional funds for health, schools and the police. The extra spending will be funded by borrowing rather than tax rises. Independent think-tank the Institute for Government (IFG) says the government is likely to favour vote-winning measures ahead of a ""potentially imminent"" election. But it argues the government should be prioritising other areas of spending, such as social care and prisons which it says are the services most in need of extra money. Spending Review: What's it all about? Here we look at each of the public services, and which needs the most funding, according to the IFG'sreport,external. It has graded services, according to need based on which are able to keep up with demand: amber for some concerns and red for significant concerns. What has already been announced?Theresa May's government announced that annual funding would rise by Â£20 billion by 2023.  Boris Johnson also announced a one-off injection of Â£1.8bn, butnot all of that is agreed to be new money. Spending on hospitals and GP services in England has risen since 2009-10, although more slowly than in the past. IFG estimates suggest that the workload of GPs has risen faster than spending, meaning they have had to do more for less. Despite practices increasing the number of telephone consultations and pooling resources, patients have been waiting longer for appointments. This suggests that GPs, despite becoming more efficient, have not been able to keep up with demand. NHS 'reality check' for PM Boris Johnson However, the amount of work hospitals do has risen faster. While hospitals have made efficiencies, hospitals have not been able to keep pace with the growing cost and demand for care, according to the IFG. The result has been financial deficits and longer waiting times for treatment. The frontline of the NHS knows what its budget is until 2023-24: it was given a five-year settlement last summer. The rises, an average of 3.4% a year, are generous compared to what the rest of the public sector can expect and reflect the fact the health service is constantly among the top priorities for voters and facing rising demand from the ageing population. But there are still question marks around more than Â£13bn of funding that goes to things like staff training, buildings and healthy lifestyle initiatives, such as stop smoking. What has already been announced?The government hasannounced that funding will riseby Â£2.6bn in 2020-21, Â£4.8bn in 2021-22 and Â£7.1bn in 2022-23. Schools in England have not faced the same financial pressures as many other public services, according to the IFG. However, after a rise in spending per pupil in most years since 2009-10, since 2014-15 the growth in pupil numbers has outpaced spending growth, meaning the per-pupil spending has fallen in both primary and secondary schools. On top of this, schools have increasingly been paying for services that would have been previously provided by local authorities - such as educational psychology and extra support for special educational needs - following cuts to local authority budgets. There are also signs that this increased workload is putting pressure on the workforce, with schools finding it harder to recruit and retain teachers, the IFG says. But overall, schools have become more productive, it adds, with more pupils per teacher and pupil attainment increasing - particularly in primary schools. School funding in England had become a political headache and vote loser for the government, with both headteachers and parents campaigning.  Rising costs such as national insurance and teachers pensions, as well as running costs such as utility bills, have contributed to an 8% real terms reduction in money spent in schools since 2010. The extra money promised for 5-to-16 year-olds' education will almost reverse that squeeze by 2023. But that leaves financial pressures in England in other areas such as early years, and despite some extra cash for colleges educating 16-19 year-olds, an historic legacy under many governments of relative underfunding of further education. What has already been announced?The government has promised20,000 extra police officers over three yearsat a likely cost of Â£0.5 billion next year but has not yet confirmed how this will be funded. Spending on the police in England and Wales has fallen sharply since 2009-10, says the IFG. The number of police officers has also declined, with total police reserves now 9% lower in real terms than they were in 2009-10. ""Victim-reported crime has fallen over this period, but police-recorded crime has increased,"" the IFG says. What has Boris Johson promised on law and order? ""Overall police performance - as judged by inspection reports - has improved, although other indicators - such as public confidence in the police and the length of time taken to bring charges - have deteriorated. ""There is evidence that the police are struggling to maintain performance with current levels of spending."" The strength of policing reached a record high at the end of the Labour government that left office in 2010 - and then fell back by 21,000 as older officers left and cuts restricted recruitment. The prime minister's pledge to re-recruit 20,000 officers in the coming three years is a huge task, because natural loss means forces may need to recruit more than double that number to hit the target. What has already been announced?Â£0.1 billion pledged to boost security;promise of 10,000 extra prison places, but funding arrangements unclear Prisons have experienced large spending cuts and a reduction in staff numbers since 2009-10. This meansprison safety has declined dramatically since 2012-13,external, according to the IFG. Violence has risen and prisoners are less likely to have access to learning and development activities. The 2016 Autumn Statement saw an injection of extra cash to tackle these safety issues and spending has risen again recently. As a result, staff numbers are starting to rise again. The IFG hailed a pilot programme to curb violence and drug use in 10 prisons, undertaken last year by the then Prisons Minister, Rory Stewart. ""This was largely successful, but replicating it across the whole prison system will require extra spending in every future year,"" the IFG says. The Ministry of Justice was one of the first big spending departments to settle with the Treasury in 2010, when the then Chancellor, George Osborne, demanded major cuts to public spending. Today, it has 25% fewer staff than back then. The departure of experienced prison officers under the cuts coincided with a rise in smuggling of new psychoactive drugs into jails, leading to an increase in violence that the remaining prison officers struggled to control. What has already been announced?In aSunday Times interview,external, Boris Johnson said he would give councils Â£1bn for adult social care, but no formal announcement has yet been made. Spending on adult social care in England fell between 2010-11 and 2014-15, but has since seen a rise. The number of adults receiving publicly funded care packages has decreased,,externalaccording to the IFG, even though an ageing population would suggest that demand is increasing. Local authorities, responsible for providing adult social care, have driven down the price of care commissioned from private and voluntary sector providers following cuts to funding. However, this has not enabled them to meet demand, the IFG says, and unpaid care - such as by family, friends or neighbours - has partially filled the gap. In his first speech from Downing Street, Boris Johnson promised to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all"". However, the IFG says there are no signs that plans to do so will be unveiled in the Spending Review. Not only has adult social care lost out in terms of funding, the long-awaited reform of the system has also been dodged. Care services for the elderly and disabled simply do not have the profile of the NHS, although that is beginning to change a little as the problems worsen. But the challenge remains what to do about money. Only the poorest and neediest get support from the state. But that means four-fifths of older people who need care go without, rely on family and friends or pay for it themselves. Each of the areas covered by the IFG's report are devolved: the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland run their own services. So announcements on Wednesday will effect England (or England and Wales for policing and justice). The devolved governments will receive extra money proportionate to the increases in spending, but they will decide how that money is spent. Since 2010, the Westminster parliament has increased health spending faster and cut education and local government spendingfaster than the devolved governments,external.

PM in new Brexit battle after Commons vote defeatBoris Johnson will call for an election if he is forced to request a Brexit extension but Labour says it won't back it.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Corbyn to Johnson: ""A lot of people have a great deal to fear"" Boris Johnson will call for a general election on 15 October if Labour and rebel Tories succeed in blocking a no-deal Brexit. He challenged Jeremy Corbyn to put his policy of ""dither and delay"" over EU withdrawal to the British people. Mr Johnson needs the support of two-thirds of MPs to trigger an election. But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told Labour MPs the leadership would not back an election until a delay had been agreed with the EU. Chancellor Sajid Javid has presented his spending planto MPs in the Commons, with the health service, education and the police expected to fare well. He told MPs the government had ""turned the page on austerity"", outlining Â£13.8bn of investment on areas including health and education. Mr Javid said it was the fastest spending increase for 15 years, but the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused him of ""meaningless platitudes"". Meanwhile, No 10's decision to expel 21 Tory MPs for defying the party whip on Tuesday continues to causes recriminations in the party. Live updates: Johnson to face MPs after Brexit defeat Kuenssberg: Politics is upside down Do the UK's voters support a no-deal Brexit? Brexit's big week: Five things we learned on Tuesday Will there be an early election? One of those booted out of the party, Margot James, has publicly questioned the role played by Dominic Cummings, the PM's senior aide, in the decision. Raising the issue at PMQs, she urged Mr Johnson to bear in mind his predecessor Margaret Thatcher's famous adage that ""advisers advise and ministers decide"". And in Scotland, a judgehas rejected a bid to have Mr Johnson's plan to shut down Parliament ahead of Brexit declared illegal. The showdown between the government and opponents of a no-deal Brexit will continue later as Labour and other opposition parties seek to pass a bill requesting a further delay if there is no deal by 19 October. A total of 21 Tories defied the PM on Tuesday to vote with the opposition to enable the bill to be considered, as Mr Johnson suffered his first Commons defeat as prime minister by a margin of 328 votes to 301. This video can not be played Margot James: ""Advisers advise, ministers decide"" If the Brexit delay bill passes later on and moves to the Lords, as is expected, Mr Johnson will push for an immediate vote on an early general election. What does the no-deal bill say? Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said it was ""absolutely clear"" that the UK would get a new deal from Brussels, with the controversial Irish backstop removed. He suggested that Mr Corbyn was afraid of the judgement of the people, joking that ""there is only one chlorinated chicken I can see this House and he is on that bench"". But the Labour leader said the PM was ""running down the clock"" on a no-deal Brexit and ""hiding the facts"" about the likelihood of food and medicine shortages. ""I don't see how I can be accused of undermining the negotiations because there are no negotiations taking place,"" he told MPs. How feasible are the government spending plans? Social care and prisons 'need money most' Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Radio 4's Today that Labour wanted a general election but ""on its terms not Boris Johnson's terms"". He said the party did not ""trust"" the PM to hold the election before the Brexit deadline, as No 10 had ""lied"" last month when it denied reports that it planned to suspend Parliament. ""We are not shy of a general election but we are not going to be trapped into abandoning control of Parliament or be taken in what Boris Johnson says because we don't trust him."" But, at a meeting in London, a succession of Labour MPs called on the leadership to hold off backing an election until after Brexit had been delayed. The BBC's Chris Mason said one MP reportedly told colleagues: ""Johnson said it is Brexit do or die on October 31st. I want him to die."" Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a prime minister must have the backing of at least two-thirds of the UK's 650 MPs before a poll can be called outside of the fixed five-year terms. The Lib Dems say they will vote against an early election at this stage. Downing Street said the 21 Tory MPs who rebelled in Tuesday's vote would have the whip removed, effectively expelling them from the parliamentary party and meaning they could not stand as Conservative candidates in the election. Among the jettisoned rebels are former justice secretary David Gauke, Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames, and Rory Stewart, who recently stood against Boris Johnson to be the party leader. The former international development secretary told the Today programme he was sacked by text message, as he was being given the GQ magazine award for politician of the year. ""It was a pretty astonishing moment,"" he said. ""It feels a little bit like something you associate with other countries - one opposes the leader, one loses the leadership race, no longer in the cabinet and now apparently thrown out of the party and one's seat too."" Mr Stewart said the decision to stop him standing as a candidate was ""un-Conservative"" and the final decision should rest with local associations and not be made centrally. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Another of the rebels, Richard Benyon, said he would continue to sit on the Tory benches and support the PM's domestic agenda, saying he hoped to return to the fold ""one day"". But there have been calls from loyal MPs for No 10 to rethink its conduct amid anger over the treatment of rebels and the suspension of Parliament. Sir Roger Gale said Dominic Cummings, one of Mr Johnson's closest advisers, had ""abused and swore"" at Tory rebels and should be disciplined. ""The fact that you have at the heart of No 10 as the PM's senior advisor an unelected, foul-mouthed oaf throwing his weight around is completely unacceptable,"" he told the BBC. ""If the PM doesn't have Dominic Cummings frogmarched out of Downing Street himself then the chances are it not be the Tory rebels or Jeremy Corbyn but Mr Cummings who will bring down this administration.""

backdrop of dismal construction output stats forecasting a fall of up to

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In terms of health and care, there were two eye-catching
numbers in the Chancellorâs spending announcement - Â£6.2bn extra for the NHS
and Â£1.5bn for social care. Neither are quite what they seem. The Â£6.2bn refers to the
extra cash the frontline of the NHS is getting next year as part of the
five-year settlement announced a year ago by Theresa May. What is new however is how much extra the rest of health is
getting. This is money that goes on the likes of buildings maintenance and
training for staff. It is rising by Â£400m to Â£9bn. Experts have welcomed the
money, but say it comes off the back of cuts in previous years. In comparison, the social care announcement for councils is
genuinely new. Although the Â£1.5bn includes Â£500m which will only be raised
from a 2% increase in council tax. The County Councils Network says the extra
money is just about enough to stand still.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The worst impacts of a potential no-deal Brexit can only be mitigated rather than avoided, said Catherine McGuinness from the City of London Corporation, the financial centre's local authority. She was responding to the Sajid Javid's spending plans, acknowledging: âThe Chancellor is right to accelerate preparations for Brexit as
we draw close to 31 October."" âItâs vital that businesses â small and large â also make sure
they are doing everything possible to prepare in case there is a no-deal
Brexit."" ""A deal would still be the best outcome for businesses and
households on both sides of the Channel,"" she said. âDespite the current uncertainty, London remains home to a unique
combination of time zone, language, legal system, global talent, and financial
services ecosystem. These fundamental strengths will underpin our long-term
success.â Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent The Chancellor, more than anyone else in the Commons, will know how police have struggled with rising violent crime: he listened to their warnings of underfunding when he was Home Secretary. So long-trailed funding for more officers is no surprise. There are 21,000 fewer police today than in 2010 because of the cuts that began under David Cameron and George Osborne. Boris Johnson says that will be reversed within three years. Today's starting pledge to have recruited an extra 2,000 by next March will only cover about 10% of those who have been lost. But ... about 6% of police officers leave the job each year. That means the forces may in fact need to attract as many as 44,000 new officers to meet the pledge. Responding to a question from the Lib Dems' Ed Davey, Mr Javid said his party had no plans to ""crash out of the EU"" and said to avoid a no-deal Brexit, MPs should vote against a bill that could extend the 31 October deadline.

Chancellor set to unveil government spending plansThe statement will set departmental budgets for one year rather than the usual three years.BusinessComments,"Chancellor Sajid Javid is set to unveil the government's spending plans for the coming year on Wednesday. The statement will set departmental budgets for just one year rather than the usual three years, due to uncertainty over the impact of Brexit. Mr Javid will announce a further Â£2bn of Brexit funding for the government, as well as confirm additional funds for health, schools and the police. The extra spending will be funded by borrowing rather than tax rises. Independent think-tank the Institute for Government (IFG) says the government is likely to favour vote-winning measures ahead of a ""potentially imminent"" election. But it argues the government should be prioritising other areas of spending, such as social care and prisons which it says are the services most in need of extra money. Spending Review: What's it all about? Here we look at each of the public services, and which needs the most funding, according to the IFG'sreport,external. It has graded services, according to need based on which are able to keep up with demand: amber for some concerns and red for significant concerns. What has already been announced?Theresa May's government announced that annual funding would rise by Â£20 billion by 2023.  Boris Johnson also announced a one-off injection of Â£1.8bn, butnot all of that is agreed to be new money. Spending on hospitals and GP services in England has risen since 2009-10, although more slowly than in the past. IFG estimates suggest that the workload of GPs has risen faster than spending, meaning they have had to do more for less. Despite practices increasing the number of telephone consultations and pooling resources, patients have been waiting longer for appointments. This suggests that GPs, despite becoming more efficient, have not been able to keep up with demand. NHS 'reality check' for PM Boris Johnson However, the amount of work hospitals do has risen faster. While hospitals have made efficiencies, hospitals have not been able to keep pace with the growing cost and demand for care, according to the IFG. The result has been financial deficits and longer waiting times for treatment. The frontline of the NHS knows what its budget is until 2023-24: it was given a five-year settlement last summer. The rises, an average of 3.4% a year, are generous compared to what the rest of the public sector can expect and reflect the fact the health service is constantly among the top priorities for voters and facing rising demand from the ageing population. But there are still question marks around more than Â£13bn of funding that goes to things like staff training, buildings and healthy lifestyle initiatives, such as stop smoking. What has already been announced?The government hasannounced that funding will riseby Â£2.6bn in 2020-21, Â£4.8bn in 2021-22 and Â£7.1bn in 2022-23. Schools in England have not faced the same financial pressures as many other public services, according to the IFG. However, after a rise in spending per pupil in most years since 2009-10, since 2014-15 the growth in pupil numbers has outpaced spending growth, meaning the per-pupil spending has fallen in both primary and secondary schools. On top of this, schools have increasingly been paying for services that would have been previously provided by local authorities - such as educational psychology and extra support for special educational needs - following cuts to local authority budgets. There are also signs that this increased workload is putting pressure on the workforce, with schools finding it harder to recruit and retain teachers, the IFG says. But overall, schools have become more productive, it adds, with more pupils per teacher and pupil attainment increasing - particularly in primary schools. School funding in England had become a political headache and vote loser for the government, with both headteachers and parents campaigning.  Rising costs such as national insurance and teachers pensions, as well as running costs such as utility bills, have contributed to an 8% real terms reduction in money spent in schools since 2010. The extra money promised for 5-to-16 year-olds' education will almost reverse that squeeze by 2023. But that leaves financial pressures in England in other areas such as early years, and despite some extra cash for colleges educating 16-19 year-olds, an historic legacy under many governments of relative underfunding of further education. What has already been announced?The government has promised20,000 extra police officers over three yearsat a likely cost of Â£0.5 billion next year but has not yet confirmed how this will be funded. Spending on the police in England and Wales has fallen sharply since 2009-10, says the IFG. The number of police officers has also declined, with total police reserves now 9% lower in real terms than they were in 2009-10. ""Victim-reported crime has fallen over this period, but police-recorded crime has increased,"" the IFG says. What has Boris Johson promised on law and order? ""Overall police performance - as judged by inspection reports - has improved, although other indicators - such as public confidence in the police and the length of time taken to bring charges - have deteriorated. ""There is evidence that the police are struggling to maintain performance with current levels of spending."" The strength of policing reached a record high at the end of the Labour government that left office in 2010 - and then fell back by 21,000 as older officers left and cuts restricted recruitment. The prime minister's pledge to re-recruit 20,000 officers in the coming three years is a huge task, because natural loss means forces may need to recruit more than double that number to hit the target. What has already been announced?Â£0.1 billion pledged to boost security;promise of 10,000 extra prison places, but funding arrangements unclear Prisons have experienced large spending cuts and a reduction in staff numbers since 2009-10. This meansprison safety has declined dramatically since 2012-13,external, according to the IFG. Violence has risen and prisoners are less likely to have access to learning and development activities. The 2016 Autumn Statement saw an injection of extra cash to tackle these safety issues and spending has risen again recently. As a result, staff numbers are starting to rise again. The IFG hailed a pilot programme to curb violence and drug use in 10 prisons, undertaken last year by the then Prisons Minister, Rory Stewart. ""This was largely successful, but replicating it across the whole prison system will require extra spending in every future year,"" the IFG says. The Ministry of Justice was one of the first big spending departments to settle with the Treasury in 2010, when the then Chancellor, George Osborne, demanded major cuts to public spending. Today, it has 25% fewer staff than back then. The departure of experienced prison officers under the cuts coincided with a rise in smuggling of new psychoactive drugs into jails, leading to an increase in violence that the remaining prison officers struggled to control. What has already been announced?In aSunday Times interview,external, Boris Johnson said he would give councils Â£1bn for adult social care, but no formal announcement has yet been made. Spending on adult social care in England fell between 2010-11 and 2014-15, but has since seen a rise. The number of adults receiving publicly funded care packages has decreased,,externalaccording to the IFG, even though an ageing population would suggest that demand is increasing. Local authorities, responsible for providing adult social care, have driven down the price of care commissioned from private and voluntary sector providers following cuts to funding. However, this has not enabled them to meet demand, the IFG says, and unpaid care - such as by family, friends or neighbours - has partially filled the gap. In his first speech from Downing Street, Boris Johnson promised to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all"". However, the IFG says there are no signs that plans to do so will be unveiled in the Spending Review. Not only has adult social care lost out in terms of funding, the long-awaited reform of the system has also been dodged. Care services for the elderly and disabled simply do not have the profile of the NHS, although that is beginning to change a little as the problems worsen. But the challenge remains what to do about money. Only the poorest and neediest get support from the state. But that means four-fifths of older people who need care go without, rely on family and friends or pay for it themselves. Each of the areas covered by the IFG's report are devolved: the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland run their own services. So announcements on Wednesday will effect England (or England and Wales for policing and justice). The devolved governments will receive extra money proportionate to the increases in spending, but they will decide how that money is spent. Since 2010, the Westminster parliament has increased health spending faster and cut education and local government spendingfaster than the devolved governments,external.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In terms of health and care, there were two eye-catching
numbers in the Chancellorâs spending announcement - Â£6.2bn extra for the NHS
and Â£1.5bn for social care. Neither are quite what they seem. The Â£6.2bn refers to the
extra cash the frontline of the NHS is getting next year as part of the
five-year settlement announced a year ago by Theresa May. What is new however is how much extra the rest of health is
getting. This is money that goes on the likes of buildings maintenance and
training for staff. It is rising by Â£400m to Â£9bn. Experts have welcomed the
money, but say it comes off the back of cuts in previous years. In comparison, the social care announcement for councils is
genuinely new. Although the Â£1.5bn includes Â£500m which will only be raised
from a 2% increase in council tax. The County Councils Network says the extra
money is just about enough to stand still.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The worst impacts of a potential no-deal Brexit can only be mitigated rather than avoided, said Catherine McGuinness from the City of London Corporation, the financial centre's local authority. She was responding to the Sajid Javid's spending plans, acknowledging: âThe Chancellor is right to accelerate preparations for Brexit as
we draw close to 31 October."" âItâs vital that businesses â small and large â also make sure
they are doing everything possible to prepare in case there is a no-deal
Brexit."" ""A deal would still be the best outcome for businesses and
households on both sides of the Channel,"" she said. âDespite the current uncertainty, London remains home to a unique
combination of time zone, language, legal system, global talent, and financial
services ecosystem. These fundamental strengths will underpin our long-term
success.â Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent The Chancellor, more than anyone else in the Commons, will know how police have struggled with rising violent crime: he listened to their warnings of underfunding when he was Home Secretary. So long-trailed funding for more officers is no surprise. There are 21,000 fewer police today than in 2010 because of the cuts that began under David Cameron and George Osborne. Boris Johnson says that will be reversed within three years. Today's starting pledge to have recruited an extra 2,000 by next March will only cover about 10% of those who have been lost. But ... about 6% of police officers leave the job each year. That means the forces may in fact need to attract as many as 44,000 new officers to meet the pledge. Responding to a question from the Lib Dems' Ed Davey, Mr Javid said his party had no plans to ""crash out of the EU"" and said to avoid a no-deal Brexit, MPs should vote against a bill that could extend the 31 October deadline.

End of an era as M&S drops out of FTSE 100,"It is the end of an era for Marks and Spencer, which has been relegated from the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest listed companies. It is the first time the retailer has not been a FTSE 100 member since the index was launched in 1984. Based on the closing price of its stock on Tuesday, its market value fell below the threshold for inclusion. The official announcement was made on Wednesday night, with the decision implemented on 23 September. The food and fashion giant has had a hard year, with its shares down 40%. M&S to start home delivery next year M&S sales and profits fall amid shake-up Its all-important clothing business has continued to struggle, and its food business has shown signs of weakness. ""Symbolically, falling out of the FTSE is just another milestone in the slow-but-steady decline of what used to be a great British institution,"" says retail expert Richard Hyman. The FTSE 100 contains the 100 largest UK-listed firms, ranked by market value. Membership of the index is seen as a mark of prestige. The index is reshuffled four times a year, allowing a handful of companies to enter, while a number of stragglers slip out into the lower tier FTSE 250. M&S has been close to relegation for about a year as investors have steadily lost faith in the brand. As of Tuesday evening, it had a market value of Â£3.7bn - less than half of what it was worth back in November 2015. By comparison FTSE-listed fashion rival Next was worth Â£7.9bn. Demotion will be a huge fall from grace for M&S, which in 1998 became the first British retailer to make a pre-tax profit of more than Â£1bn. The biggest issue, say analysts, has been the decline of its clothing business, which accounts for a large portion of profits. M&S boss Steve Rowe is trying to turn the business around ""There has been a decade-long complaint by investors and customers that it has failed to revamp its clothing lines, especially within womenswear, and lacks appeal for the younger generations,"" says Helal Miah, an analyst at the Share Centre. ""The group has also been too slow to adapt to online retailing and has been left behind by others who offer a more compelling online service."" M&S now faces enormous competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos online. Accusations that its clothing is too dowdy and conservative still linger, too. However, for Richard Hyman the issue goes deeper - he thinks the brand has lost touch with its customers. ""M&S was about quality at an unbeatable price, not fashion for fashion's sake. But over time they have sacrificed those values to try and cut costs and become too corporate."" This has created a ""negative spiral"", he says, where less is invested in its product, quality falls, and design goes by the wayside. ""Your sales keep falling so you cut costs further. It is very hard to get out of."" Until recently M&S's food business had been a bright spot amid the gloom, but over the past few years sales in this part of the business have struggled as well. Falling food sales hit Marks & Spencer To stem the decline, in February this year M&S forged a joint venture with Ocado, agreeing to buy 50% of its retail business for a whopping Â£750m. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the deal makes sense in many ways, as it will allow M&S to offer a much broader range of food. Online shopping is also a growth area. However, he says investors have been sceptical about the partnership and many think M&S has overpaid. ""Ocado is not yet making a profit from food sales so the rewards of this partnership are uncertain. On top of these problems, M&S is dealing with a nationwide consumer spending slowdown that has forced some High Street retailers to close stores. To try to revive the business, chief executive Steve Rowe launched a ""radical"" turnaround plan last year which will see 100 under-performing stores closed by 2022 - although the number could be higher. However, analysts are sceptical that this will be enough to get it back on track. ""I think it is possible but unfortunately a lot of things are outside of their control,"" says Mr Khalaf. ""One of those is the UK economy and all the uncertainty about Brexit, which has also been big factor in denting the share price. ""If there is a further fall in the pound [because of Brexit] that could hit retailers as they buy many imported goods in dollars. A wider downturn in the economy could also hit M&S."" Mr Hyman also has his doubts about the strategy. ""M&S used to be the pivotal player on the High Street but they are going down the wrong road in my opinion. When you see a business which is more about cutting costs than driving sales the alarm bells should be ringing.""

Heroin worth Â£120m found in 'UK's biggest haul',"This video can not be played The drugs were found concealed in a consignment of towels and bathrobes Nearly 1.3 tonnes of heroin with a street value of Â£120m has been found in what is thought to be the UK's largest ever seizure of the drug. The drugs were found concealed in towels and bathrobes on a container ship after it docked in Suffolk. National Crime Agency (NCA) officers removed the drugs and returned the container before tracking it to the Netherlands and making arrests. The ship docked in Felixstowe, where it was intercepted by the NCA. It came in the month Â£40m of heroin, about 400kg (62st 13lb), was found insimilar circumstancesat Felixstowe dock on 2 August. In the latest seizure, blocks of heroin - each weighing 1kg (2.2lb) - were found stitched inside some of the towels, and it took Border Force officers six hours to remove all of the drugs, weighing a total of 1,297kg (204st). The haul was labelled ""one of the largest ever in Europe"" After taking the drugs out on 30 August, officers put the container back on to the ship, which continued on to its destination in Antwerp where it docked two days later. The container was then driven by lorry to a warehouse in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam, where upon arrival officers arrested four men in the process of unloading it. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the drugs had originated in Pakistan. NCA deputy director of investigations, Matt Horne, called the haul ""a record heroin seizure in the UK and one of the largest ever in Europe"". He said: ""The size of this and other recent shipments demonstrate the scale of the threat we face. ""We can be certain that some of these drugs would eventually have been sold in the UK, fuelling high levels of violence and exploitation including what we see in county lines offending nationwide.

"Scale of Bahamas hurricane devastation emergesAerial images show a trail of destruction, with the death toll of seven expected to rise.","This video can not be played Aerials show scale of destruction in the Bahamas caused by Hurricane Dorian Rescuers have begun to reach areas of the northern Bahamas devastated by Hurricane Dorian, with aerial images showing a trail of destruction. PM Hubert Minnis said some areas had been ""decimated"" as the death toll rose to at least 20. The hurricane made landfall on 1 September and battered the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama, in the north of the archipelago, for two days. Dorian has moved off north and still threatens the eastern US seaboard. Forecasters have warned it could make landfall on the coast of South or North Carolina on Thursday. From the air - the destruction of the Abaco Islands Hurricane Dorian: Who's at risk? Although the hurricane has weakened to a category two storm with maximum sustained winds of 105mph (165km/h), it has grown larger in area. This video can not be played Residents in the Bahamas say 'it's total devastation' Mr Minnis said the Bahamas was facing ""one of the greatest national crises in our country's history"". Late on Wednesday,the country's health minister, Duane Sands, confirmed that the death toll had risen from seven to at least 20,external. Lia Head-Rigby, who runs a relief group and overflew the Abacos, previously said her representatives had told her there were ""a lot more dead"". ""It's total devastation. It's decimated. Apocalyptic,"" she told the Associated Press (AP) news agency. Aerial images over the Abacos, including the port town of Marsh Harbour, showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels. ""There's nothing left in most of Marsh Harbour,"" said Alicia Cook, who evacuated from the area. ""People are starting to panic: pillaging, looting... it's just no way everyone's going to get out."" Residents share images of devastation Bob Cornea also spoke to the BBC in the capital Nassau after being evacuated from Marsh Harbour. He said he and his wife took shelter on the second storey of their son's house. ""Water was up to my neck. It stayed like that for two or three hours... My son... he got us out and we got over to safety. ""We've been through all kinds of hurricanes, all kinds of storms: never anything that bad. I mean, it was like we were standing in the middle of the ocean. That's what it looked like. Waves, the water just crashing in over us. Horrifying. Absolutely horrifying."" Opposition leader Philip Brave Davis described the scenes from a flight over the islands as a ""horrible sight"". Parts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain. The situation on Grand Bahama is less clear, as Dorian only moved on late on Tuesday after nearly two days of pummelling, cutting many communication lines. Most rescue work was being done on an ad hoc basis by locals using boats and jet skis, but it was being hampered by flooded roads, fallen trees and submerged debris. Rescue teams were ""beginning to get on the ground"", National Security Minister Marvin Dames said on Wednesday, according to AP. This video can not be played Watch BBC Weather's forecast amid concerns for Florida, Georgia and Carolinas Mr Minnis said: ""Our priority at this time is search, rescue and recovery. It will take all of us as a caring community - government, church, businesses and individuals - to help restore the lives of our people."" People have taken to social media to post lists of those they have lost contact with during the storm. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - have been severely damaged or destroyed. Some 60,000 people will need food aid and clean water, UN officials say. A map from the Finnish satellite company ICEYE showed the extent of the flooding on Grand Bahama: At 18:00 GMT, the National Hurricane Center,externalsaid Dorian was located about 115 miles (185km) east of Jacksonville in Florida and about 180 miles south of Charleston, South Carolina. The storm - moving at 9mph (15km/h) - would travel parallel to the Florida and Georgia coasts through Wednesday night, then ""near or over"" the coasts of the Carolinas through Thursday and Friday, it said. The NHC warned there was a danger of life-threatening storm surges for coastal communities north of Port Canaveral in Florida all the way to the North Carolina-Virginia border. Dorian is expected to weaken over the next few days but will remain a powerful hurricane. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian rips into Bahamas Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

Police use of facial recognition ruled lawfulHigh Court rules against a Cardiff shopper who brought a judicial review against South Wales Police.Wales,"The South Wales force demonstrated the technology after the case with a member of staff standing in Judges have ruled against a shopper who brought a legal challenge against police use of automated facial recognition (AFR) technology. The court refused the judicial review on all grounds, finding South Wales Police had followed the rules and their use of AFR was justified. The High Court said this was the first time any court in the world had considered the use of the technology. Civil rights group Liberty said its client would appeal against the ruling. It had argued it was akin to the unregulated taking of DNA or fingerprints without consent, and it is campaigning for an outright ban of the practice. Ed Bridges has had his image captured twice by AFR technology The judicial review washeld in Mayafter Ed Bridges, from Cardiff, claimed his human rights were breached when he was photographed while Christmas shopping. His legal challenge argued the use of the tool breached his right to privacy as well as data protection and equality laws. The court's key findings included: South Wales Police's use of AFR met the requirements of the Human Rights Act and its actions were subject to sufficient legal controls On data protection, the force was processing personal data, but in a lawful manner that met the conditions set out in the legislation The force had complied with equality laws The current legal regime is adequate to ensure the appropriate and non-arbitrary use of AFR. Liberty lawyer Megan Goulding said: ""This disappointing judgment does not reflect the very serious threat that facial recognition poses to our rights and freedoms. ""Facial recognition is a highly intrusive surveillance technology that allows the police to monitor and track us all."" South Wales Police are considered the national lead force on its use Police operating the system inside the van Mr Bridges said he had his image captured by the technology a second time at a peaceful protest against the arms trade. On Wednesday he added: ""South Wales Police has been using facial recognition indiscriminately against thousands of innocent people, without our knowledge or consent. ""This sinister technology undermines our privacy and I will continue to fight against its unlawful use to ensure our rights are protected and we are free from disproportionate government surveillance."" A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner, which had argued during the judicial review the legal framework for police use of AFR was not sufficient, said they would be reviewing the judgment carefully. They welcomed the finding that the police use of the technology involved processing sensitive personal data. ""Our investigation into the first police pilots of this technology has recently finished. We will now consider the court's findings in finalising our recommendations and guidance to police forces about how to plan, authorise and deploy any future [facial recognition] systems. ""In the meantime, any police forces or private organisations using these systems should be aware that existing data protection law and guidance still apply."" There are worries the technology is more likely to return false matches for women and people from ethnic minorities Automated facial recognition technology maps faces in a crowd by measuring the distance between features, then compares results with a ""watch list"" of images - which can include suspects, missing people and persons of interest. Concerns have been raised the technology is intrusive and more likely to return false positives for women and people from ethnic minorities. South Wales Police, Metropolitan Police and Leicestershire Police have used facial recognition in public spaces since June 2015. South Wales Chief Constable Matt Jukes said the decision was welcome but not the end of the ""wider debate"". ""I recognise that the use of AI and face-matching technologies around the world is of great interest and, at times, concern. ""So, I'm pleased that the court has recognised the responsibility that South Wales Police has shown in our programme. With the benefit of this judgment, we will continue to explore how to ensure the ongoing fairness and transparency of our approach."" South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said his priority had been to ensure the police ""make best use of technology to keep the public safe while also working within the law and protecting civil liberties."" The Home Office welcomed the judgment confirming there was a ""clear and sufficient legal framework"" for the use of AFR. Mr Justice Swift and Lord Justice Haddon-Cave, who gave their decision on Wednesday, had previously described it as ""an important case that makes novel and potentially far-reaching"" conclusions.

In pictures: The devastated Abacos,"Hurricane Dorian has brought devastation to the northern Bahamas. The first aerial pictures have now emerged of the destruction on the Abaco Islands. Most of the other badly hit island - Grand Bahama, home to about 50,000 people - has still to be reached. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said this was""one of the greatest national crises in our country's history"". He also said he expected the death toll to rise. The image below is of the airport at Marsh Harbour on the Abacos. The airport on Grand Bahama was on Tuesday said to be under 6ft (1.8m) of water. The Abaco Islands are home to about 17,000 people. The UN says almost all will need food aid and clean water. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - have been severely damaged or destroyed. When the Abaco Islands were hit over the weekend, the wind speeds of 185mph (298km/h) equalled the fastest ever inflicted by the landfall of a hurricane, matched only by the Labor Day hurricane of 1935. PM Minnis said the priority now was for search and rescue, but added: ""We can expect more deaths to be recorded."" Photos are copyright.

Walmart changes gun policies after shootings,"Walmart boss Doug McMillon has announced changes to gun policies Walmart is to stop sales of some types of ammunition followingrecent shootings, including one at one of its stores in Texas that left 22 dead. The head of the company said it would discontinue sales of some bullets that can be used in assault-style weapons, and those used in handguns. The move comes amidincreasing pressure on the company, often cited as the largest firearms seller in the US. Chief executive Doug McMillon said the company had been ""listening"". ""It's clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,"" he said ina note to employees and published on the firm's website,external. The firm also said it would discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, the only place it still offered such weapons. The firm asked customers at Walmart and its Sam's Club stores to stop carrying firearms openly, even in states where it is legally permitted, saying such actions have caused fear and evacuations. Mr McMillon said: ""We know these decisions will inconvenience some of our customers, and we hope they will understand."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another major US retailer joined Walmart on Tuesday. Kroger changed its policy by ""respectfully asking"" customers to stop openly carrying guns in stores where state laws allow it. Jessica Adelman, group vice-president of corporate affairs, said in a statement that only authorised law enforcement officers should be carrying weapons in Kroger outlets. Walmart's chief executive, who also called on the US Congress to pass stricter gun laws, said he expected the changes to reduce the firm's share of the ammunition market from about 20% to a range of 6% to 9%. The company will continue to sell hunting rifles and shotguns, and much of the ammunition for those weapons, he added. Walmart stock was little changed after the announcement. Shares in some gun-makers, such as Vista Outdoors, slumped. Guns and ammunition represent a tiny fraction of overall Walmart sales, said Burt Flickinger III, a managing director of the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. He predicted the decision would pay off, allowing the retailer to provide more store space to faster growing categories such as nappies for babies. ""Walmart will be significantly ahead in sales growth and significantly ahead in profitable sales and market share growth by concentrating on children and health categories, rather than the declining guns and ammo categories,"" he said. Walmart's competitive prices will be likely to help it retain customers, no matter what their politics, he added. Walmart's decision follows two incidents at stores in August, in which a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, and a former employee killed two workers at a Walmart store in Mississippi. Last month, other mass shootings - defined since 2012 as incidents as those that kill at least three people - in Ohio and Texas left more than a dozen dead. There have been more than 110 mass shootings in the US since 1982, according toinvestigative magazine Mother Jones,external. This video can not be played America's gun laws explained However, Walmart has lagged behind other US retailers in changes to its gun policies. Kroger-owned Fred Meyer stopped selling guns in 2018 after a mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida. That same year, Dick's Sporting Goods ended the sale of assault weapons and raised the minimum age to 21 for gun purchases. Mr Flickinger said the move reflected a shift since Walmart stopped being a family-run company. Sam Walton, who founded the company in 1962, was a known hunting enthusiast. ""It shows a very constructive change from a family-managed and run business,"" Mr Flickinger said.

Chancellor set to unveil government spending plansThe statement will set departmental budgets for one year rather than the usual three years.Business,"Chancellor Sajid Javid is set to unveil the government's spending plans for the coming year on Wednesday. The statement will set departmental budgets for just one year rather than the usual three years, due to uncertainty over the impact of Brexit. Mr Javid will announce a further Â£2bn of Brexit funding for the government, as well as confirm additional funds for health, schools and the police. The extra spending will be funded by borrowing rather than tax rises. Independent think-tank the Institute for Government (IFG) says the government is likely to favour vote-winning measures ahead of a ""potentially imminent"" election. But it argues the government should be prioritising other areas of spending, such as social care and prisons which it says are the services most in need of extra money. Spending Review: What's it all about? Here we look at each of the public services, and which needs the most funding, according to the IFG'sreport,external. It has graded services, according to need based on which are able to keep up with demand: amber for some concerns and red for significant concerns. What has already been announced?Theresa May's government announced that annual funding would rise by Â£20 billion by 2023.  Boris Johnson also announced a one-off injection of Â£1.8bn, butnot all of that is agreed to be new money. Spending on hospitals and GP services in England has risen since 2009-10, although more slowly than in the past. IFG estimates suggest that the workload of GPs has risen faster than spending, meaning they have had to do more for less. Despite practices increasing the number of telephone consultations and pooling resources, patients have been waiting longer for appointments. This suggests that GPs, despite becoming more efficient, have not been able to keep up with demand. NHS 'reality check' for PM Boris Johnson However, the amount of work hospitals do has risen faster. While hospitals have made efficiencies, hospitals have not been able to keep pace with the growing cost and demand for care, according to the IFG. The result has been financial deficits and longer waiting times for treatment. The frontline of the NHS knows what its budget is until 2023-24: it was given a five-year settlement last summer. The rises, an average of 3.4% a year, are generous compared to what the rest of the public sector can expect and reflect the fact the health service is constantly among the top priorities for voters and facing rising demand from the ageing population. But there are still question marks around more than Â£13bn of funding that goes to things like staff training, buildings and healthy lifestyle initiatives, such as stop smoking. What has already been announced?The government hasannounced that funding will riseby Â£2.6bn in 2020-21, Â£4.8bn in 2021-22 and Â£7.1bn in 2022-23. Schools in England have not faced the same financial pressures as many other public services, according to the IFG. However, after a rise in spending per pupil in most years since 2009-10, since 2014-15 the growth in pupil numbers has outpaced spending growth, meaning the per-pupil spending has fallen in both primary and secondary schools. On top of this, schools have increasingly been paying for services that would have been previously provided by local authorities - such as educational psychology and extra support for special educational needs - following cuts to local authority budgets. There are also signs that this increased workload is putting pressure on the workforce, with schools finding it harder to recruit and retain teachers, the IFG says. But overall, schools have become more productive, it adds, with more pupils per teacher and pupil attainment increasing - particularly in primary schools. School funding in England had become a political headache and vote loser for the government, with both headteachers and parents campaigning.  Rising costs such as national insurance and teachers pensions, as well as running costs such as utility bills, have contributed to an 8% real terms reduction in money spent in schools since 2010. The extra money promised for 5-to-16 year-olds' education will almost reverse that squeeze by 2023. But that leaves financial pressures in England in other areas such as early years, and despite some extra cash for colleges educating 16-19 year-olds, an historic legacy under many governments of relative underfunding of further education. What has already been announced?The government has promised20,000 extra police officers over three yearsat a likely cost of Â£0.5 billion next year but has not yet confirmed how this will be funded. Spending on the police in England and Wales has fallen sharply since 2009-10, says the IFG. The number of police officers has also declined, with total police reserves now 9% lower in real terms than they were in 2009-10. ""Victim-reported crime has fallen over this period, but police-recorded crime has increased,"" the IFG says. What has Boris Johson promised on law and order? ""Overall police performance - as judged by inspection reports - has improved, although other indicators - such as public confidence in the police and the length of time taken to bring charges - have deteriorated. ""There is evidence that the police are struggling to maintain performance with current levels of spending."" The strength of policing reached a record high at the end of the Labour government that left office in 2010 - and then fell back by 21,000 as older officers left and cuts restricted recruitment. The prime minister's pledge to re-recruit 20,000 officers in the coming three years is a huge task, because natural loss means forces may need to recruit more than double that number to hit the target. What has already been announced?Â£0.1 billion pledged to boost security;promise of 10,000 extra prison places, but funding arrangements unclear Prisons have experienced large spending cuts and a reduction in staff numbers since 2009-10. This meansprison safety has declined dramatically since 2012-13,external, according to the IFG. Violence has risen and prisoners are less likely to have access to learning and development activities. The 2016 Autumn Statement saw an injection of extra cash to tackle these safety issues and spending has risen again recently. As a result, staff numbers are starting to rise again. The IFG hailed a pilot programme to curb violence and drug use in 10 prisons, undertaken last year by the then Prisons Minister, Rory Stewart. ""This was largely successful, but replicating it across the whole prison system will require extra spending in every future year,"" the IFG says. The Ministry of Justice was one of the first big spending departments to settle with the Treasury in 2010, when the then Chancellor, George Osborne, demanded major cuts to public spending. Today, it has 25% fewer staff than back then. The departure of experienced prison officers under the cuts coincided with a rise in smuggling of new psychoactive drugs into jails, leading to an increase in violence that the remaining prison officers struggled to control. What has already been announced?In aSunday Times interview,external, Boris Johnson said he would give councils Â£1bn for adult social care, but no formal announcement has yet been made. Spending on adult social care in England fell between 2010-11 and 2014-15, but has since seen a rise. The number of adults receiving publicly funded care packages has decreased,,externalaccording to the IFG, even though an ageing population would suggest that demand is increasing. Local authorities, responsible for providing adult social care, have driven down the price of care commissioned from private and voluntary sector providers following cuts to funding. However, this has not enabled them to meet demand, the IFG says, and unpaid care - such as by family, friends or neighbours - has partially filled the gap. In his first speech from Downing Street, Boris Johnson promised to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all"". However, the IFG says there are no signs that plans to do so will be unveiled in the Spending Review. Not only has adult social care lost out in terms of funding, the long-awaited reform of the system has also been dodged. Care services for the elderly and disabled simply do not have the profile of the NHS, although that is beginning to change a little as the problems worsen. But the challenge remains what to do about money. Only the poorest and neediest get support from the state. But that means four-fifths of older people who need care go without, rely on family and friends or pay for it themselves. Each of the areas covered by the IFG's report are devolved: the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland run their own services. So announcements on Wednesday will effect England (or England and Wales for policing and justice). The devolved governments will receive extra money proportionate to the increases in spending, but they will decide how that money is spent. Since 2010, the Westminster parliament has increased health spending faster and cut education and local government spendingfaster than the devolved governments,external.

A guide to the world's deadliest storms,"As we enter hurricane season, when there is a greater chance of more powerful storms developing in the Atlantic, here is a guide to how deadly storms form, how they are measured and why they happen where they do. Hurricanes are the biggest and most violent storms on the planet. Every year, between June and November they hit the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern coast of the United States, sometimes leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. In the Pacific Ocean, they are known as cyclones. In the Indian Ocean and southern Pacific, they are known as typhoons. They are all tropical storms, but they are only called hurricanes in the north Atlantic and north-eastern Pacific. Most hurricanes that form in the Atlantic are the result of an atmospheric phenomenon known as a tropical wave. The wave starts as a type of atmospheric trough that creates an area of relatively low air pressure - usually in western Africa, in mid-July. If the conditions are right for it to develop, the low pressure starts to move west, with the help of the trade winds or easterlies. When it reaches the Atlantic, the tropical wave has the potential to become a hurricane - but for this to happen it needs enough energy in the form of heat and wind. In fact, it needs a deep layer of warm water, with a surface water temperature above 27C. It also needs the right winds - horizontally swirling winds to concentrate the storm and a weak vertical wind shear rising from the surface of the sea. If the wind shear changes too much as it rises, it can disrupt the flow of heat and humidity needed to create the hurricane. The final ingredient is a concentration of rain clouds and high humidity in the area. This all needs to happen in the right place - generally between 10 and 30 degrees latitude in the northern hemisphere, where the rotation of the Earth helps the winds converge and rise in the area of low pressure. When a tropical wave encounters all these elements, they all start to interact over an area between 50km (31 miles) and 100km wide. ""The movement of the tropical wave is a trigger for the storm,"" says Jorge Zaval Hidalgo, general co-ordinator of Mexico's National Weather Service. The storm is the catalyst - and the dance of heat, air and water begins. The area of low pressure cools the humid, warm air rising from the ocean, which fills the clouds. The condensation of this air releases heat, which lowers the pressure even more, drawing more humidity from the ocean and the storm builds. The winds converge and rise within the area of low pressure, spinning counter clockwise, giving the hurricane its trademark shape. While the storm becomes more powerful, the eye of the hurricane - the central area about 30-60km wide on average - remains relatively calm. Around it, rises the eye wall of dense clouds and most intense winds. Beyond that are the spiral bands of cloud, where there is the most rain. The wind speeds are what determine the moment at which we can call this phenomenon a hurricane. At its birth, it is a tropical depression. As it gathers strength, it becomes a tropical storm. When speeds reach more than 118km an hour, it is a hurricane. However, hurricanes can be classified in five categories depending on the sustained wind speeds. In the Atlantic, the Saffir-Simpson wind scale is used to measure their destructive power. One hurricane's winds can produce about half as much energy as the electrical generating capacity of the entire world, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). However, it is not the winds that cause the most destruction and loss of life, but the storm surge and flooding caused by the hurricane's rain. In the United States, for example, the storm surge caused by tropical cyclones in the Atlantic were responsible for nearly half of hurricane-related deaths between 1963 and 2012, according to the American Meteorological Society. The level of destruction caused by a hurricane is also going to depend on other circumstances, such as the speed at which it hits, the terrain and local infrastructure in the affected area. ""The damage or danger associated with a tropical cyclone does not necessarily correspond to its category. For example, the highest level storm will not necessarily mean more rain,"" Mr Hidalgo told the BBC. Here is a recap: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

"Police begin identifying US boat fire victimsPolice say DNA is needed because many of the bodies show signs of ""extreme thermal damage"".US & Canada","This video can not be played California residents mourn victims of a boat disaster Californian officials have begun the process of identifying the victims of a boat fire that is suspected to have claimed 34 lives. Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said that DNA samples would be required from the families of presumed victims to identify them. Authorities have moved from search-and-rescue operations to a recovery effort. Only five people survived, all crew. The scuba-diving boat caught fire on Monday as passengers slept below decks. Twenty bodies - 11 females and nine males - have been recovered but more remain in the submerged wreckage, officials said on Tuesday. People have left flowers at the dock where the Conception is based Divers will attempt to stabilise the 75ft-long (23m) vessel, the Conception, to recover the remaining victims. The vessel is upside down in more than 60ft of water, officials said. When asked why DNA material would be necessary, Sheriff Brown told reporters it was an ""inordinately hot fire and the bodies do exhibit signs of extreme thermal damage"". According to preliminary reports, Sheriff Brown said, a 17-year-old and several people in their 60s were probably aboard the recreational diving vessel when it caught fire. The boat was totally engulfed in flames as crews tried to rescue those onboard No cause of the fire has yet been determined. Search-and-rescue operations were suspended on Tuesday morning after a reconnaissance aircraft flew over the wreck and found ""no additional signs of distress or debris"", Captain Monica Rochester of the US Coast Guard said. The debris field spanned nearly 1.5 miles (2.4km), said Sheriff Brown. More than 160 miles of ocean were also searched, he added. The boat had an ""open berthing"" plan, Cpt Rochester told reporters, meaning there were no locked doors onboard and curtains were used to section off different compartments, such as the sleeping quarters. Firefighters were unable to board the vessel to put it out as flames has already taken hold She added that smoke detectors and fire-fighting systems were required to be on the boat, which had passed its most recent annual screening. When asked if the crew were required to post a night watch, Capt Rochester said that matter was still under investigation. Five members of the boat's crew escaped the blaze and were able to steer another vessel to a nearby boat, the Grape Escape, where they called emergency services for help. The captain appears to have jumped into the water with others fleeing the burning boat, Sheriff Brown said. The Conception was split into three decks, he said, with the passengers being given the bottom level as their chambers. The middle deck housed the boat's galley and salon, and the top deck was the crew's quarters and the boat's bridge, he added. He said it was ""perfectly normal for the crew to be up on that assigned deck"" and closest to an exit when the fire broke out. None of those onboard have been formally identified, but family members have begun releasing the name of missing loved ones: The brother of one marine biologist - 41-year-old Kristy Finstad - told US media she had been leading a dive trip and was presumed dead The Pacific Collegiate School in Santa Cruz several of its students and parents had been on the boat. The trip was not part of the school curriculum St Joseph's Medical Center in Stockton, California, said one of its nurses, Evan Quitasol, had been on the ship, along with her father, Michael Quitasol, a former employee at the hospital.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a double defeat in the Commons after MPs turned down his motion for a general election. There has been a lot to take in, so if you're still catching up - and who would blame you - here's a quick reminder of the major happenings: The Daily Mirror uses its front page to declare Mr Johnson ""Britain's worst PM (since the last one)"". An image of what the paper calls a ""deflated"" Mr Johnson looking downward fills the front page. Theresa May smiles out from an inset picture. A more animated photo of the prime minister fills the front page of the Daily Express. ""Boris urges 'people power' to force election,"" is the headline. It calls Jeremy Corbyn's decision not to support a general election until a bill designed to help avert a no-deal Brexit is passed ""an extraordinary act of cowardice"". The front pages of the Daily Mail and the Sun both pick up on Boris Johnson calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""chicken"" for refusing to back a general election before the Hilary Benn's bill is passed into law. The Sun goes as far as superimposing the Labour leader's face onto a chicken, alongside the headline ""Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?"". Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph opts for the headline ""'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock"". The newspapers are responding to another momentous day in Parliament. The front pages of the i, the Guardian and the Financial Times all say the prime minister has been left ""cornered"" by MPs after losing three votes in the Commons.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"". Find our how your local MP voted on the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and on the PM's call for an early general election. MPs have voted on an early general election and a bill that could delay Brexit. Sir Michael Fallon has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced he will be standing down at the next election. In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Those arriving in the UK before the end of next year will be able to apply to the new scheme, the government confirmed on Wednesday evening. This would allow EU nationals who arrive before the end of 2020 to stay until December 2023. You canread the full story here.

Do the UK's voters support a no-deal Brexit?,"Boris Johnson is insistent - if a new deal on the terms of Brexit is not agreed with the EU by the end of October, the UK should be prepared to leave without a deal. But attempts are being made by MPs to pass legislation that would outlaw a no-deal Brexit. Both sides claim voters support their point of view. So, what is the evidence of the polls? Within the past two months, four polls have asked people if they are for or against leaving without a deal. Despite differences in the wording of the questions, the results are remarkably consistent. Slightly more people say they are opposed to leaving without a deal than state they are in favour. However, there is a sharp difference between Remain and Leave voters. Whereas about three out of four of those who voted Remain in 2016 say they are opposed to leaving without a deal, the position among Leave voters is almost exactly the reverse. The debate divides the country in much the same way as the 2016 referendum did. At that time, 52% voted Leave and 48% Remain. So, why do the polls suggest more people oppose than support leaving without a deal? The answer lies in the views of those who did not vote three years ago. Only about one in five (21%) of non-voters support leaving without a deal, while twice as many (43%) are opposed. Still, the government's policy is not to leave the EU without a deal whatever the circumstances. Rather, it only proposes doing so if a satisfactory deal is not obtained by the end of October. Is this reflected in how voters approach the prospect of no deal? A first indication comes from the answers YouGov obtained when they asked a more detailed question about ""leaving the European Union without any deal"". People were asked not only if that would be a good outcome or a bad outcome, but also whether it would be ""an acceptable compromise"". Eight out of 10 Remain supporters claim that a no-deal Brexit would be a bad outcome. This is in line with the 76% who say they are against leaving the EU without a deal, when offered a straight choice between support and oppose. However, a different story emerges among Leave voters. The proportion who say that leaving without a deal would be a good outcome is 46%. This is well below the 73% who say they back leaving the EU without a deal, when offered a straight choice. Why the difference? About a quarter (27%) of Leave voters prefer to say a no-deal Brexit would be an ""acceptable compromise"", rather than a ""good outcome"". Here, perhaps, is a sign that leaving without a deal is, for some Leave voters, something they might ultimately be willing to back, rather than an outcome they would most like to happen. Further evidence in this direction emerges when voters are asked which Brexit outcome they prefer. In June, YouGov asked people to place four possibilities in order of preference: leaving without a deal accepting the deal that has already been negotiated leaving with an alternative deal that included membership of the single market and the EU customs union remaining in the EU after all While 59% of Leave voters said that leaving without a deal was their first preference, 33% preferred one of the two possible deals. Very similar results were found by Kantar when it put much the same set of options before voters. What is no-deal Brexit? Everything you need to know about Brexit Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? The willingness of some voters to back leaving without a deal might well depend on whether or not they think the government could in fact have secured an acceptable deal - or whether the fault lies with the EU. When ORB asked whether the UK should leave without a deal, ""if the EU is unwilling to reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement"", supporters (46%) outnumbered opponents (39%). In contrast, when Ipsos MORI asked people whether they would support leaving without a deal, ""if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU by October"", as many as 50% said they were opposed and only 38% in favour. Persuading Remain supporters of the necessity of a no-deal Brexit looks likely to be a tall order. But Leave supporters may well back the idea if they are persuaded that Brussels is to blame.

Hurricane inches over devastated Bahamas,"This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian rips into Bahamas Hurricane Dorian is moving very slowly north west over the Bahamas, leaving devastation and flooding in its wake. Satellite images showed large areas under water, including the Grand Bahama International airport and the town of Marsh Harbour on Abaco Island. Dorian fell in strength on Tuesday to category two, but the northwest islands continue to endure heavy rain, high winds and storm surges. Five people were killed when the storm hit the Abaco Islands. Residents of the northern Bahamas, some trapped on roofs, sent out pleas for help as the storm thrashed the islands on Monday night, stalling at category five with 185mph winds. The eastern US coast remains on alert for the hurricane. Queen Elizabeth, the head of state of the Bahamas, said she and Prince Philip were ""shocked and saddened to learn of the devastation caused by Hurricane Dorian"" and she sent condolences to families and friends of the victims. ""At this very difficult time, my thoughts and prayers are with those who have seen their homes and property destroyed and I also send my gratitude to the emergency services and volunteers who are supporting the rescue and recovery effort,"" she said in a statement to the country's governor-general, Sir Cornelius Smith. Hurricane Dorian: Who's at risk? Residents share images of devastation Are you in the affected region? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The most recent update fromthe US National Hurricane Center (NHC),externalplaced Dorian just north of Grand Bahama, home to about 50,000 people, having moved barely 20km (12 miles) in a day. The BBC Weather service said that having remained stationary for many hours, the storm was now moving at 1mph (1.6kph) with maximum sustained winds of 115mph. But the NHC warned the storm was still producing higher gusts at 140 mph, with storm surges of 10ft-15ft (3m to 4.5m) above normal, and the agency advised residents to remain in shelter on Grand Bahama throughout Tuesday. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian approaches the US The winds at the core of the storm were spinning so fast that the centre of the storm was collapsing on itself, causing it to expand and damage a larger area, according to the BBC Weather service. Steve McAndrew, of the International Red Cross, told the BBC he had been involved in rescue operations for 20 years and could not recall a hurricane ever being listed as stationary. Palm Beach county in Florida - less than 100 miles to the west - saw gusts of up to 60mph on Tuesday. Meanwhile,the UK has sent a team of three humanitarian experts,externalto help assess damage caused by the hurricane, the government said. A Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship, equipped with a helicopter and loaded with relief supplies, is also on standby if needed by the Bahamian authorities, a statement added. Eyewitness videos and reports painted a picture of massive and widespread flooding, with panicked families fleeing to their roofs to escape rising floodwaters. The Bahamas Press showed video of the Rand Memorial Hospital in Freeport under water, with patients forced to evacuate. The news site also relayed calls for help from residents trapped on roofs for hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Freeport resident Yasmin Rigby told the Reuters agency: ""People who thought they were safe are now calling for help"". A map from the Finnish satellite company ICEYE showed the extent of the flooding on the island: Grand Bahama's international airport was under 6ft of water, while residents posting on Twitter said a church in Freeport had lost its roof and scores of people were in danger. Another Twitter posting called for the rescue of an aunt and nine others from rising waters in the town. Video posted on Twitter from Pine Bay showed the extent of the storm there.

""You can't fathom that but that's what people are showing us with their videos,"" he told the BBC. ""And you can see the water outside pressing in. It's stories like that and images like that that you can't get out of your mind."" One radio station told the Associated Press news agency it had received more than 2,000 distress messages.

The islands, with a population of about 17,000, bore the brunt of the storm. No hurricane had ever made landfall with greater wind speeds. Only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane can match Dorian's 185mph. Officials said 21 injured people were airlifted to the capital Nassau by the US Coast Guard. The capital, Nassau, was also affected by flooding Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said on Monday that reports from the Abaco Islands suggested the devastation was ""unprecedented"", calling the hurricane a ""historic tragedy"". Rescue operations were reportedly under way in areas it was safe to enter. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Neither the Abacos nor Grand Bahama are much higher than 40ft above sea level at their highest points. The International Red Cross said it feared wells may have flooded, making clean water unavailable. The organisation said 13,000 houses were feared damaged or destroyed across the nation. Images from the capital Nassau to the south showed extensive flooding. Matthew Cochrance, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said aid workers were expecting ""significant humanitarian needs"" in the Bahamas once the storm passed. Aerial photos show a harbour with many of the boats pushed out of the sea and destroyed There were concerns on Twitter for US hurricane chaser Josh Morgerman, who had not been heard from since Sunday when his last tweet sent from Marsh Harbour said the storm was ""pounding"" and ""crashing"".

A woman from Nassau, New Providence, said on Facebook that she had taken in 97 stray dogs as the storm hit the island, with 79 staying in her bedroom overnight. The latest update from the NHC predicts Dorian will begin a slow north-west move on Tuesday, with a further turn north on Wednesday. ""The hurricane will move dangerously close to the Florida east coast late [Tuesday] through Wednesday evening, very near the Georgia and South Carolina coasts Wednesday night and Thursday, and near or over the North Carolina coast late Thursday,"" it said. The BBC Weather service said the storm's current track shows it should stay offshore in Florida and Georgia but may affect South Carolina later in the week, although it is likely to have weakened by then. Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina will still feel the impact of the storm and have all declared states of emergency, with mandatory evacuation orders across many areas. Walt Disney World, Legoland and other tourist parks have announced early closures in anticipation of the hurricane. Skies darken in Florida as Hurricane Dorian looms in the Atlantic Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, said BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm.

Hurricane Dorian death toll rises in Bahamas,"This video can not be played Aerials show scale of destruction in the Bahamas caused by Hurricane Dorian Rescuers have begun to reach areas of the northern Bahamas devastated by Hurricane Dorian, with aerial images showing a trail of destruction. PM Hubert Minnis said some areas had been ""decimated"" as the death toll rose to at least 20. The hurricane made landfall on 1 September and battered the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama, in the north of the archipelago, for two days. Dorian has moved off north and still threatens the eastern US seaboard. Forecasters have warned it could make landfall on the coast of South or North Carolina on Thursday. From the air - the destruction of the Abaco Islands Hurricane Dorian: Who's at risk? Although the hurricane has weakened to a category two storm with maximum sustained winds of 105mph (165km/h), it has grown larger in area. This video can not be played Residents in the Bahamas say 'it's total devastation' Mr Minnis said the Bahamas was facing ""one of the greatest national crises in our country's history"". Late on Wednesday,the country's health minister, Duane Sands, confirmed that the death toll had risen from seven to at least 20,external. Lia Head-Rigby, who runs a relief group and overflew the Abacos, previously said her representatives had told her there were ""a lot more dead"". ""It's total devastation. It's decimated. Apocalyptic,"" she told the Associated Press (AP) news agency. Aerial images over the Abacos, including the port town of Marsh Harbour, showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels. ""There's nothing left in most of Marsh Harbour,"" said Alicia Cook, who evacuated from the area. ""People are starting to panic: pillaging, looting... it's just no way everyone's going to get out."" Residents share images of devastation Bob Cornea also spoke to the BBC in the capital Nassau after being evacuated from Marsh Harbour. He said he and his wife took shelter on the second storey of their son's house. ""Water was up to my neck. It stayed like that for two or three hours... My son... he got us out and we got over to safety. ""We've been through all kinds of hurricanes, all kinds of storms: never anything that bad. I mean, it was like we were standing in the middle of the ocean. That's what it looked like. Waves, the water just crashing in over us. Horrifying. Absolutely horrifying."" Opposition leader Philip Brave Davis described the scenes from a flight over the islands as a ""horrible sight"". Parts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain. The situation on Grand Bahama is less clear, as Dorian only moved on late on Tuesday after nearly two days of pummelling, cutting many communication lines. Most rescue work was being done on an ad hoc basis by locals using boats and jet skis, but it was being hampered by flooded roads, fallen trees and submerged debris. Rescue teams were ""beginning to get on the ground"", National Security Minister Marvin Dames said on Wednesday, according to AP. This video can not be played Watch BBC Weather's forecast amid concerns for Florida, Georgia and Carolinas Mr Minnis said: ""Our priority at this time is search, rescue and recovery. It will take all of us as a caring community - government, church, businesses and individuals - to help restore the lives of our people."" People have taken to social media to post lists of those they have lost contact with during the storm. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - have been severely damaged or destroyed. Some 60,000 people will need food aid and clean water, UN officials say. A map from the Finnish satellite company ICEYE showed the extent of the flooding on Grand Bahama: At 18:00 GMT, the National Hurricane Center,externalsaid Dorian was located about 115 miles (185km) east of Jacksonville in Florida and about 180 miles south of Charleston, South Carolina. The storm - moving at 9mph (15km/h) - would travel parallel to the Florida and Georgia coasts through Wednesday night, then ""near or over"" the coasts of the Carolinas through Thursday and Friday, it said. The NHC warned there was a danger of life-threatening storm surges for coastal communities north of Port Canaveral in Florida all the way to the North Carolina-Virginia border.

Heroin 'worth Â£120m found in UK's biggest haul',"This video can not be played The drugs were found concealed in a consignment of towels and bathrobes Nearly 1.3 tonnes of heroin with a street value of Â£120m has been found in what is thought to be the UK's largest ever seizure of the drug. The drugs were found concealed in towels and bathrobes on a container ship after it docked in Suffolk. National Crime Agency (NCA) officers removed the drugs and returned the container before tracking it to the Netherlands and making arrests. The ship docked in Felixstowe, where it was intercepted by the NCA. It came in the month Â£40m of heroin, about 400kg (62st 13lb), was found insimilar circumstancesat Felixstowe dock on 2 August. In the latest seizure, blocks of heroin - each weighing 1kg (2.2lb) - were found stitched inside some of the towels, and it took Border Force officers six hours to remove all of the drugs, weighing a total of 1,297kg (204st). The haul was labelled ""one of the largest ever in Europe"" After taking the drugs out on 30 August, officers put the container back on to the ship, which continued on to its destination in Antwerp where it docked two days later. The container was then driven by lorry to a warehouse in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam, where upon arrival officers arrested four men in the process of unloading it. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the drugs had originated in Pakistan. NCA deputy director of investigations, Matt Horne, called the haul ""a record heroin seizure in the UK and one of the largest ever in Europe"". He said: ""The size of this and other recent shipments demonstrate the scale of the threat we face. ""We can be certain that some of these drugs would eventually have been sold in the UK, fuelling high levels of violence and exploitation including what we see in county lines offending nationwide. ""The heroin trade also feeds addictions that put users' lives at risk, while giving rise to crime such as theft which make people feel unsafe in their homes and communities.""

M&S set to drop out of FTSE 100,"It is the end of an era for Marks and Spencer, which has been relegated from the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest listed companies. It is the first time the retailer has not been a FTSE 100 member since the index was launched in 1984. Based on the closing price of its stock on Tuesday, its market value fell below the threshold for inclusion. The official announcement was made on Wednesday night, with the decision implemented on 23 September. The food and fashion giant has had a hard year, with its shares down 40%. M&S to start home delivery next year M&S sales and profits fall amid shake-up Its all-important clothing business has continued to struggle, and its food business has shown signs of weakness. ""Symbolically, falling out of the FTSE is just another milestone in the slow-but-steady decline of what used to be a great British institution,"" says retail expert Richard Hyman. The FTSE 100 contains the 100 largest UK-listed firms, ranked by market value. Membership of the index is seen as a mark of prestige. The index is reshuffled four times a year, allowing a handful of companies to enter, while a number of stragglers slip out into the lower tier FTSE 250. M&S has been close to relegation for about a year as investors have steadily lost faith in the brand. As of Tuesday evening, it had a market value of Â£3.7bn - less than half of what it was worth back in November 2015. By comparison FTSE-listed fashion rival Next was worth Â£7.9bn. Demotion will be a huge fall from grace for M&S, which in 1998 became the first British retailer to make a pre-tax profit of more than Â£1bn. The biggest issue, say analysts, has been the decline of its clothing business, which accounts for a large portion of profits. M&S boss Steve Rowe is trying to turn the business around ""There has been a decade-long complaint by investors and customers that it has failed to revamp its clothing lines, especially within womenswear, and lacks appeal for the younger generations,"" says Helal Miah, an analyst at the Share Centre. ""The group has also been too slow to adapt to online retailing and has been left behind by others who offer a more compelling online service."" M&S now faces enormous competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos online. Accusations that its clothing is too dowdy and conservative still linger, too. However, for Richard Hyman the issue goes deeper - he thinks the brand has lost touch with its customers. ""M&S was about quality at an unbeatable price, not fashion for fashion's sake. But over time they have sacrificed those values to try and cut costs and become too corporate."" This has created a ""negative spiral"", he says, where less is invested in its product, quality falls, and design goes by the wayside. ""Your sales keep falling so you cut costs further. It is very hard to get out of."" Until recently M&S's food business had been a bright spot amid the gloom, but over the past few years sales in this part of the business have struggled as well. Falling food sales hit Marks & Spencer To stem the decline, in February this year M&S forged a joint venture with Ocado, agreeing to buy 50% of its retail business for a whopping Â£750m. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the deal makes sense in many ways, as it will allow M&S to offer a much broader range of food. Online shopping is also a growth area. However, he says investors have been sceptical about the partnership and many think M&S has overpaid. ""Ocado is not yet making a profit from food sales so the rewards of this partnership are uncertain. On top of these problems, M&S is dealing with a nationwide consumer spending slowdown that has forced some High Street retailers to close stores. To try to revive the business, chief executive Steve Rowe launched a ""radical"" turnaround plan last year which will see 100 under-performing stores closed by 2022 - although the number could be higher. However, analysts are sceptical that this will be enough to get it back on track. ""I think it is possible but unfortunately a lot of things are outside of their control,"" says Mr Khalaf. ""One of those is the UK economy and all the uncertainty about Brexit, which has also been big factor in denting the share price. ""If there is a further fall in the pound [because of Brexit] that could hit retailers as they buy many imported goods in dollars. A wider downturn in the economy could also hit M&S.""

Heroin 'worth Â£120m found in UK's biggest haul'Nearly 1.3 tonnes of the drug was found concealed in towels and bathrobes at Felixstowe port.,"This video can not be played The drugs were found concealed in a consignment of towels and bathrobes Nearly 1.3 tonnes of heroin with a street value of Â£120m has been found in what is thought to be the UK's largest ever seizure of the drug. The drugs were found concealed in towels and bathrobes on a container ship after it docked in Suffolk. National Crime Agency (NCA) officers removed the drugs and returned the container before tracking it to the Netherlands and making arrests. The ship docked in Felixstowe, where it was intercepted by the NCA. It came in the month Â£40m of heroin, about 400kg (62st 13lb), was found insimilar circumstancesat Felixstowe dock on 2 August. In the latest seizure, blocks of heroin - each weighing 1kg (2.2lb) - were found stitched inside some of the towels, and it took Border Force officers six hours to remove all of the drugs, weighing a total of 1,297kg (204st). The haul was labelled ""one of the largest ever in Europe"" After taking the drugs out on 30 August, officers put the container back on to the ship, which continued on to its destination in Antwerp where it docked two days later. The container was then driven by lorry to a warehouse in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam, where upon arrival officers arrested four men in the process of unloading it. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the drugs had originated in Pakistan. NCA deputy director of investigations, Matt Horne, called the haul ""a record heroin seizure in the UK and one of the largest ever in Europe"". He said: ""The size of this and other recent shipments demonstrate the scale of the threat we face. ""We can be certain that some of these drugs would eventually have been sold in the UK, fuelling high levels of violence and exploitation including what we see in county lines offending nationwide.

"West 'may be held responsible for Yemen crimes'The US, UK and France provide arms and logistical support to a Saudi-led coalition fighting there.Middle East","The UN experts investigated a coalition air strike on a bus carrying children in August 2018 The UK, US, France and Iran may be complicit in possible war crimes in Yemen over their support for parties to the conflict there, UN experts say. A new report warns the countries they could be held responsible,externalfor aiding or assisting the commission of violations. The Western powers provide weapons and logistical support to the Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen's government, while Iran backs the Houthi rebels. The experts say both sides continue to commit violations with impunity. Their report documents air strikes on civilian infrastructure, indiscriminate shelling, snipers, landmines, as well as arbitrary killings and detention, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, and the impeding of access to humanitarian aid in the midst of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The UN says the four-year conflict has claimed the lives of at least 7,290 civilians and left 80% of the population - 24 million people - in need of humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? The Group of International and Regional Eminent Experts on Yemen conducted 600 interviews with victims and witnesses, and examined documentary and open-source material, for their second report for the UN Human Rights Council. It says they found reasonable grounds to believe Yemen's government and the Saudi-led coalition, as well as the Houthis, had enjoyed a ""pervasive lack of accountability"" for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. This video can not be played The hidden victims of the Yemen war The experts investigated a number of coalition air strikes on rebel-held areas in which civilians were killed. Such strikes raised concerns about the identification of military objectives and respect for the principles of proportionality and precautions in attack, they say. If there were breaches of the latter, which the experts consider highly likely, they would amount to serious violations of international law. The experts also found reasonable grounds to believe that the Houthis were responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law for having launched indiscriminate attacks resulting in the death or injury of civilians and, in some cases, by directing attacks against civilians. All parties may also have used starvation as a method of warfare. The experts call for the immediate cessation of all acts of violence committed against civilians and urge other states to refrain from providing weapons. The third city of Taiz has been besieged by the Houthis since 2015 ""States are obliged to take all reasonable measures to ensure respect for international humanitarian law by other states. Furthermore, the Arms Trade Treaty, to which France and the United Kingdom are parties, prohibits the authorization of arms transfers with the knowledge that these would be used to commit war crimes,"" they note. ""The legality of arms transfers by France, the United Kingdom, the United States and other states remains questionable, and is the subject of various domestic court proceedings,"" they add. Melissa Parke, an Australian member of the Group of Experts, told reporters in Geneva: ""It is clear that the continued supply of weapons to parties to the conflict is perpetuating the conflict and prolonging the suffering of the Yemeni people."" Where possible, the experts have identified ""individuals who may be responsible for international crimes"" and submitted a confidential list of their names to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. There was no response to the report from the coalition, the Yemeni government or the Houthis. But they have all previously denied carrying out war crimes. A UK government spokesperson said: ""The UK has been at the forefront of international efforts to bring a diplomatic solution to the appalling conflict in Yemen. We operate one of the most robust export control regimes in the world."" UK government ministers have said in the past they cannot determine whether any civilian deaths have been the result of British bombs or planes becausethe coalition does not track their use,external. The US has argued against halting arms sales or assistance to the coalition, saying thatcontinuing them is more likely to help limit civilian casualties,external.

LiveLiveBrexit: Johnson loses first key vote4 minutes ago4 minutes ago 'Over to you Britain''Over to you Britain'12 minutes ago 'Parliament surrenders to the EU''Parliament surrenders to the EU'Live Brexit: Johnson loses first key vote  4 minutes ago,"Brexit delay bill passes the House of Commons It would force Boris Johnson to ask EU for delay to Brexit to prevent no deal PM says there must now be a general election But his bid to hold one on 15 October fails due to lack of opposition support Earlier, chancellor set out spending plans for coming year Hamish Mackay, Kate Whannel and Matt Cannon That ends our rolling coverage for today on yet another eventful day in the Commons. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a double defeat in the Commons after MPs turned down his motion for a general election. There has been a lot to take in, so if you're still catching up - and who would blame you - here's a quick reminder of the major happenings: The Daily Mirror uses its front page to declare Mr Johnson ""Britain's worst PM (since the last one)"". An image of what the paper calls a ""deflated"" Mr Johnson looking downward fills the front page. Theresa May smiles out from an inset picture. A more animated photo of the prime minister fills the front page of the Daily Express. ""Boris urges 'people power' to force election,"" is the headline. It calls Jeremy Corbyn's decision not to support a general election until a bill designed to help avert a no-deal Brexit is passed ""an extraordinary act of cowardice"". The front pages of the Daily Mail and the Sun both pick up on Boris Johnson calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""chicken"" for refusing to back a general election before the Hilary Benn's bill is passed into law. The Sun goes as far as superimposing the Labour leader's face onto a chicken, alongside the headline ""Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?"". Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph opts for the headline ""'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock"". The newspapers are responding to another momentous day in Parliament. The front pages of the i, the Guardian and the Financial Times all say the prime minister has been left ""cornered"" by MPs after losing three votes in the Commons.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"". Find our how your local MP voted on the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and on the PM's call for an early general election. MPs have voted on an early general election and a bill that could delay Brexit. Sir Michael Fallon has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced he will be standing down at the next election. In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Those arriving in the UK before the end of next year will be able to apply to the new scheme, the government confirmed on Wednesday evening. This would allow EU nationals who arrive before the end of 2020 to stay until December 2023. You canread the full story here.

Over in the House of Lords, peers are still voting on amendments to the business motion which aims at ensuring the no-deal bill has time to become law before the suspension of Parliament. They are currently discussing amendment 2C but there are over 100 to get through. BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'arcy says: ""There is talk of them talking til they drop to get through all these amendments so they can then deal with the bill. ""It is not going very fast. ""There are attempts to get behind-the-scenes talks going but the government seems prepared to just talk it out. ""The bill may have a rather bumpy ride."" Responding to the Conservative Government defeat
tonight, Leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson says her party ""cannot let Boris Johnson use an election to tip the country into a
dangerous no-deal Brexit, which neither the people nor their representatives support"". In a press statement, she reiterates the party ""relish the opportunity to fight an election"" but that stopping a no deal is their priority. ""Therefore, we will not support an election until
