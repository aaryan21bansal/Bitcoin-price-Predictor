MPs to investigate 'fast fashion' impactThe fashion industry's sustainability and how it can be remodelled will be put under the spotlight.UK Politics,"The rise of cheap, disposable clothes and their impact on the environment will be investigated by MPs. 'Fast fashion', worn a few times before being dumped, can add to landfill, release toxic chemicals in production and plastic fibres in the wash. The Commons environmental audit committee will look at how the industry could be made more sustainable. Thelatest report by campaigners Wrap,externalsuggests that about 300,000 tonnes of clothing is binned in the UK each year. That figure from 2015 is 50,000 tonnes less than it was three years earlier but Wrap says the clothing industry still has the fourth largest environmental impact, after housing, transport and food. Stella McCartney: 'We have to offer solutions' The problem with 'fast fashion' Used clothes: Why is demand declining? The fast fashion phenomenon - cheap clothing with a quick turnover that encourages people to keep buying -has come under fire,externalover its environmental impact, including water pollution, the use of toxic chemicals and textile waste. Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said: ""The way we design, make and discard clothes has a huge environmental impact. Producing clothes requires toxic chemicals and produces climate-changing emissions. ""Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres wash down the drain and into the oceans. We don't know where or how to recycle end of life clothing. ""Our inquiry will look at how the fashion industry can remodel itself to be both thriving and sustainable."" The committee is inviting people to comment by September on the environmental impact of the fashion industry, waste, unwanted clothing and working conditions in UK garment factories. Among the questions it will ask is whether fast fashion is unsustainable, and what can be done to encourage people to buy fewer clothes and think more about how they are disposed of.

"Cambridge students back academic in race rowPorters at King's College in Cambridge are accused of ""hassling"" non-white staff and students.Cambridgeshire","Priyamvada Gopal said she would no longer supervise students at the university in protest at her treatment Cambridge University students have rallied behind an academic who said racism at one college is ""widespread"". Priyamvada Gopal claimed porters at King's College frequently ""hassled"" non-white staff and students at the gates, amounting to ""racial profiling"". Since posting about the issue, current and former students have said they had similar experiences. A university spokeswoman said it ""abhors racism"" but its investigation found no wrongdoing by staff. The lecturer hit the headlines earlier this week when she said porters at King's had repeatedly refused to use her academic title of ""Dr"" and had spoken to her in a harsh and sarcastic tone. She described the incident as a ""small issue"" but said it was ""symptomatic of a wider problem"" at the university. ""They will let white people walk through unimpeded but demand ID cards from people who are not white,"" she said. ""We had two students who came crying late to class because they were hassled at the gates of King's and I've never had a white student who's had this problem."" ""Do I have 100% proof that it is racism? No. But one can only look at the fact people of colour are carded frequently or asked more questions frequently."" The academic, who specialises in post-colonial literature,announced in a Twitter post,externalthat she would be be refusing to supervise any students at the college in protest. Allow Twitter content?

Among the many messages of support for her on Twitter, one former King's student said: ""The porters liked to throw their weight around when they suspected someone shouldn't be allowed through the gates, but inevitably that suspicion didn't fall equally."" Another said: ""If King's College is to be a 'dynamic & diverse community' it must take Dr Gopal's concerns seriously."" Several posts were from people from ethnic minorities who said they had experienced similar treatment: ""I was constantly stopped by Cambridge porters to show my ID, to explain where I was going."" The role of university porters includes controlling entry to buildings and often maintenance and other administrative tasks. A spokeswoman for the University of Cambridge said: ""King's prides itself on being an inclusive and tolerant place, where students and staff of all backgrounds can feel secure, so we will always act swiftly and proportionately to remedy any wrongdoing. ""The college abhors racism or discrimination of any kind and would seek to stamp it out wherever it might be found. ""However, having conducted a thorough investigation of the events of Monday, we have found no wrongdoing on the part of our staff. ""Approximately 700,000 people pass through King's every year, and we receive fewer than three complaints annually. ""We have reviewed all complaints over the past three years and confirm that, where we have found our staff to be at fault, we have taken action.""

"Spanish court releases 'wolf pack'Five men whose conviction for sexual assault, but not rape, caused outrage, are released on bail.Europe","Women protesting in Pamplona after Thursday's ruling wore red gloves in opposition to sexual abuse A Spanish court has ordered the provisional release of five men convicted of sexually assaulting a young woman during the famous San Fermin bull-running festival. All five were sentenced to nine years for sexual abuse but acquitted of rape, a decision that sparked protests. The 18-year-old victim's ordeal caused an outcry and the sentencing of the men in April led to angry protests. New demonstrations by women's groups are under way in some Spanish cities. The men belonged to a WhatsApp group calledLa manada(the wolf pack) when the incident took place during the festival in Pamplona in July 2016. Following their conviction, defence lawyers launched an appeal and requested that the five be provisionally released pending the outcome. Magistrates in the same Navarra court that sentenced the men in April voted two to one on Thursday in favour of releasing the men on â¬6,000 (Â£5,200) bail. 'Wolf pack' gang rape trial angers Spain The court decided that the five were not a flight risk and were unlikely to reoffend, El Pais newspaper reports. The men must also report to a court three times a week and surrender their passports. They must not communicate with the victim and are banned from travelling to Madrid, where she is from. Later on Thursday, the hashtag #LaManada was trending on Twitter in Spain with street protests in several cities including Pamplona itself and Barcelona. Allow Twitter content?

Videos of the late-night encounter between the men, who are in their late 20s and originally from Seville, and the woman show how the five wandered the streets among other drunken revellers before two of them led her into a basement. According to a police report, the men surrounded the woman in a small alcove, removed her clothes and had unprotected sex. Some of them filmed the sexual act on their phones. One of the men posted messages in a WhatsApp group celebrating what they had done and promising to share the recording. According to the police report, the victim maintained a ""passive or neutral"" attitude throughout the scene, keeping her eyes closed at all times. Her phone was then stolen. The case triggered protests after the sentencing and again on Thursday She told the trial that she was still having psychological treatment to deal with trauma. Under Spanish law, the charge of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. The conviction and sentence were widely criticised across Spain by women's groups and politicians. Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a called on officials to analyse the verdict so that similar cases could be avoided.

Confusion over fate of US migrant children,"This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""I want to help reunite children with their families"" The fate of hundreds of undocumented children taken from parents remains unclear a day after President Donald Trump moved to roll back his policy. He ordered on Wednesday that the children be held with their parents while they are detained on charges of crossing the border illegally. But under US law, migrant children cannot be detained more than 20 days by immigration officials. The Pentagon has been asked to prepare up to 20,000 beds for children. It comes amid US government inquiries into whether they can house unaccompanied children who cross the US-Mexico border on US military bases. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made the request to the Department of Defense hours after First Lady Melania Trump made a surprise visit to a child migrant detention centre. Her tour of the federally funded facility in McAllen, Texas, housing dozens of Central American children, came as her husband's administration sought to quell the firestorm over migrant separations.

EU tariffs on US goods come into force,"This video can not be played What are tariffs and how do they affect us? The European Union (EU) has introduced retaliatory tariffs on US goods as a top official launched a fresh attack on President Donald Trump's trade policy. The duties on â¬2.8bn (Â£2.4bn) worth of US goods came into force on Friday. Tariffs have been imposed on products such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said duties imposed by the US on the EU go against ""all logic and history"". Addressing the Irish parliament in Dublin, he added that ""we will do what we have to do to rebalance and safeguard"" the EU.

The Trump administration announced in March that it would introduce tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US. Mr Trump has argued that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatens American steel and aluminium producers, which are vital to the US. After being deferred, the duties on steel and aluminium went ahead on 1 June and affect the EU, Canada, Mexico and other close US allies, including India. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (L) and US President Donald Trump (R) For its part, India has said it will raise taxes on 29 products imported from the US - including some agricultural goods, steel and iron products - in retaliation for the wide-ranging US tariffs. The new duties will come into effect from 4 August and will affect US almonds, walnuts and chick peas, among other products. South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil have agreed to put limits on the volume of metals they can ship to the US in lieu of tariffs. However, Canada has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6bn (Â£9.5bn) worth of US exports from 1 July. And Mexico put tariffs on $3bn worth of American products ranging from steel to pork and bourbon two weeks ago. Earlier this week, Mr Trump threatened to impose 10% duties on an additional $200bn (Â£150bn) worth of Chinese goods which he said would come into force if China ""refuses to change its practices"". However, China accused the US of an act of ""extreme pressure and blackmail"" and said it would respond with ""strong counter-measures"". President Trump believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out. He is especially irked by the hefty deficits in US trade with China and Mexico, but has indicated that he will not let any country ""take advantage of us on trade any more"". Allow Twitter content?

The US trade deficit has increased in recent years, running at about $50bn (Â£38bn) a month. However, this could be the result of a stronger economy, with US consumers buying more goods from overseas. The new tariffs are meant to correct this imbalance. There were confrontational scenes and words after the recent G7 summit in Quebec, at which the leaders of other major world economies challenged Mr Trump's tariffs and trade policies. A war of words erupted between the US and its G7 allies after the summit The majority of US goods targeted by the EU, such as tobacco, Harley Davidson motorcycles, cranberries and peanut butter, will now carry a tariff of 25%. However, the EU has introduced a 50% duty on goods such as footwear, some types of clothing, and washing machines. Many of the products the EU has in its sights are specifically chosen to have maximum political effect. Bourbon whiskey is produced in Kentucky, the state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Orange juice is a key export for Florida, a swing state in the US elections. Meanwhile, economists have warned the US tariffs could lead to higher metal costs, disrupt supply chains and even get passed on to US households. It's difficult to tell. US trade officials have said they deliberately targeted a list of imports that will not raise prices for consumers. But retailers and producers do not agree. Rick Helfenbein, president and chief executive officer of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, says the average family of four in the US will pay at least an extra $500 a year to buy consumer products affected by the tariffs. In some cases, the tariffs may simply compel firms to seek supplies from other countries rather than pay the extra cost. If, for instance, Florida orange juice goes up in price in Europe because of the EU counter-tariffs, then firms can always import Brazilian orange juice instead. For the US, that would be an unintended consequence of the tit-for-tat spat. But it's a good example of how trade wars can take unexpected turns.

Â£2.4m spent on Commons gagging clauses,"The House of Commons spent Â£2.4m on ""gagging clauses"" for former staff since 2013, BBC Newsnight has learned. Fifty-three departing members of the House of Commons Service signed contracts compelling them not to reveal information about the Commons. So-called ""non-disclosure agreements"" (NDAs) can be used to silence victims of bullying or harassment. A House spokesman said the clauses were used ""to resolve employment disputes under certain circumstances"". Newsnight uncovered the information via a Freedom of Information Act request, which was made as part of its investigation into bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - the apolitical employees who run the Commons and its committees. These people are usually referred to in Westminster as ""clerks"". Newsnight has previously reported thatAngus Sinclair, formerly the Speaker's secretary, was paid Â£86,000 - more than a year of pay - as part of a settlement that entailed him signing anon-disclosure agreement. He felt he was being paid off to stay quiet about being bullied by the Speaker of the House of Commons (an allegation that the Speaker denies). The answer to the request reveals that Â£2.4m was spent on 53 settlements including gagging clauses with departing staff members since 2013. (The Press Association has, by the same means, got the same information which they are publishing independently.) The average settlement cost Â£45,418. Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government, said: ""The public sector should not be allowed to waste taxpayers' money on NDAs"". She said it was ""impossible to justify as [value for money]"". These figures are a slight underestimate. There may also be some other cases in 2012 and 2018, but the numbers involved are small enough that they fear publishing them would allow people to figure out information about identifiable individuals. The House of Commons reply to Newsnight clarifies that the NDAs were ""settlement agreements (formerly known as compromise agreements) which include a confidentiality clause"". It is unclear how many of these contracts were signed, as Mr Sinclair believes was the case for him, in order to prevent information about bullying or harassment leaking out. Newsnight has established, however, that confidentiality clauses were not standard in House of Commons exit deals: the annual report for the financial year 2016-17 shows 43 people left the House on ""exit packages"", but only 23 were given NDAs in all of 2016 and 2017.  We also know that people, known toNewsnight, who had made complaints about sexual harassment or bullying at the House were asked to sign NDAs when they left with an exit deal. Some other NDAs, however, were really a means of getting rid of a staff member more easily. Getting them to sign a non-disclosure agreement could be used as a justification for a bigger pay-off. Gagging clauses are sometimes suggested by unions to get more money out of employers for a departing member of staff. So while some of these NDAs may have been intended to keep the culture under wraps, it is not clear how many that applies to. The House of Commons, however, is now likely to face questions about its use of NDAs. The House of Commons does not have trade secrets, for example, that might justify the use of gagging clauses. Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities committee, which is researching the use of NDAs, said: ""There needs to be more transparency on why payments such as this are being made in the first place.""

Poor white communities 'lack aspiration and drive',"Ms Spielman was speaking to an education festival at Wellington school in Berkshire White working-class communities can lack the ""aspiration and drive"" of many migrant groups, England's chief schools inspector has told a conference. Amanda Spielman said a long-overdue debate was under way about why white working-class pupils fall behind. ""We are having to grapple with the unhappy fact that many... working-class communities have felt the full brunt of economic dislocation,"" she said. Her comments follow criticism that Ofsted is unfair on poor white schools. Last week headscomplained that Ofsted inspections do not take enough account for the circumstances of a school.,external Separately, the secondary heads union ASCL hashit out at school performance tables for unfairly stigmatising schools in white working-class areas. In a speech to the Festival of Education at Wellington College in Berkshire, Ms Spielman said: ""We are having to grapple with the unhappy fact that many local working class communities have felt the full brunt of economic dislocation in recent years, and, perhaps as a result, can lack the aspiration and drive seen in many migrant communities."" She said Department for Education analysis showed schools in some areas of England faced real challenges, with both their pupil intake and their capacity to teach effectively. ""Schools in these areas struggle with teacher recruitment; there are fewer local academy sponsors; and there is less access to leadership support through national leaders of education and through teaching schools,"" she said. ""We can't pretend that Ofsted judgements are not lower in certain areas, many of them with a high proportion of white working-class children."" Ofsted chief inspector backs ban on phones in schools Ofsted admits some 'outstanding schools aren't that good' But she said it was Ofsted's job to ""report without fear or favour"" on school performance and that schools had to be graded on overall standards rather than effort. ""That is explicitly not the same as saying that teachers in these areas are putting in any less effort or that the leadership is worse. ""There is no doubt that these schools have a harder job to do than others. ""And we should be just as interested in why some schools in more affluent areas aren't doing better. ""I have nothing but admiration for the teachers who make it their mission to tackle disadvantage. But the overall effectiveness of a school is not an effort grade."" Ms Spielman said this did not amount to the inspectorate being biased against certain schools. ""What our inspection outcomes do is to act as a call for action in these areas - a call for the right kind of support and intervention."" She told the festival the debate was not limited to England and the rest of the UK and its coastal towns. ""It has also echoed throughout continental Europe and across the Atlantic."" Earlier, Ms Spielman's predecessor, Sir Michael Wilshaw suggested that London schools performed well because many immigrant families are passionate about learning. ""The reason why London schools are doing so well, apart from good head teachers and teachers, is that a lot of the immigrant families care about education, they value education, they support their children,"" he said. ""I'm working in parts of England with white British populations where parents don't care. Or a lot of them don't care. ""And the head teachers tell me that less than 50% turn up to parents' evening. Now that's outrageous.""

Mystery ape found in ancient tomb,"Many gibbons are threatened with extinction An ape that is new to science has been discovered buried in an ancient tomb in China. The gibbon has already become extinct, suggesting humans wiped out primate populations long before the modern age. Living primates are in peril, with many on the brink of extinction. The new gibbon, namedJunzi imperialis, may be the first to vanish as a direct result of human actions, according to scientists led by the Zoological Society of London. ""All of the world's apes - chimpanzees, gorillas, orang-utans and gibbons - are threatened with extinction today due to human activities, but no ape species were thought to have become extinct as a result of hunting or habitat loss,"" said lead researcher Dr Samuel Turvey. ""However, the discovery of the recently extinctJunzichanges this, and highlights the vulnerability of gibbons in particular."" The partial skull of the gibbon was found in a burial chamber dating from about 2,300 years ago in Shaanxi Province, central China, alongside the bones of other animals, including lynx, leopards and a black bear. The tomb, and perhaps the ape, may have belonged to Lady Xia, the grandmother of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, who ordered the building of the Great Wall of China and the Terracotta Warriors. Gibbons were seen as having noble characteristics in Chinese culture and were kept as luxury pets. The skull of the extinct gibbon High-tech computer modelling shows the ape is a new species and genus of gibbon, which probably survived until a few hundred years ago. It is almost certain that the gibbon's demise is evidence of intense human pressures on the environment during this period of history, said co-researcher Prof Helen Chatterjee of University College London. ""Our historical data shows that these factors caused a southward shift of gibbons towards their present day distribution which is restricted to the very far south of China - and in the case ofJunzi, its eventual extinction,"" she said. Female Hainan gibbon with baby Gibbons, which are the smallest apes, are found in the tropical rainforests of Asia. They are known for their haunting songs and their ability to swing through the tree tops on long arms. Most species of gibbon are under threat from the destruction of forests, hunting and illegal trade. Two species of gibbon have recently disappeared in China and all surviving Chinese species are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. One Chinese gibbon, the Hainan gibbon, is now probably the world's rarest mammal with only 26 individuals left. The study is published in the journal,Science,external.

Hammond: Treasury not the 'enemy of Brexit',"The Treasury is not ""the enemy of Brexit"", Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has insisted. In a speech in the City of London, Mr Hammond said the UK needed to protect patterns of trade with the EU that had been ""built over decades"". The chancellor also used his Mansion House speech to confirm taxes will have to go up to boost spending on the NHS. But he said the increase would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels post-Brexit. In the past the chancellor has come under fire from supporters of Brexit. Earlier this month Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson called the Treasury ""the heart of Remain"", in comments to a private dinner. However, addressing a City audience on Thursday, Mr Hammond said the ""immediate key"" to the UK and London's economic success was ""ensuring we get a good Brexit deal"". UK borrowing falls more than expected UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PM He said the goal was a partnership that ""recognises that our European neighbours are our most important trading partners, and that Dover to Calais is the busiest trading corridor in Europe"". As the UK leaves the EU, he said the new relationship should ""maintain low friction borders and open markets"". He went on: ""That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, 'the enemy of Brexit'; rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU, but working and trading closely with it."" Mr Hammond also said the Â£20bn five-year NHS funding package announced by the prime minister this week would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels. However, he also said the government would stick to its fiscal rules and ""continue to reduce debt"". As a result taxpayers will have to ""contribute a bit more"", he added. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a boost in NHS spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by Â£20bn by 2023. The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about Â£4bn - although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent. Mr Hammond said the NHS was the government's ""number one priority for the forthcoming spending review"". ""So, as the Prime Minister said, taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more, in a fair and balanced way, to support the NHS that we all use.""

Spanish court releases 'wolf pack',"Women protesting in Pamplona after Thursday's ruling wore red gloves in opposition to sexual abuse A Spanish court has ordered the provisional release of five men convicted of sexually assaulting a young woman during the famous San Fermin bull-running festival. All five were sentenced to nine years for sexual abuse but acquitted of rape, a decision that sparked protests. The 18-year-old victim's ordeal caused an outcry and the sentencing of the men in April led to angry protests. New demonstrations by women's groups are under way in some Spanish cities. The men belonged to a WhatsApp group calledLa manada(the wolf pack) when the incident took place during the festival in Pamplona in July 2016. Following their conviction, defence lawyers launched an appeal and requested that the five be provisionally released pending the outcome. Magistrates in the same Navarra court that sentenced the men in April voted two to one on Thursday in favour of releasing the men on â¬6,000 (Â£5,200) bail. 'Wolf pack' gang rape trial angers Spain The court decided that the five were not a flight risk and were unlikely to reoffend, El Pais newspaper reports. The men must also report to a court three times a week and surrender their passports. They must not communicate with the victim and are banned from travelling to Madrid, where she is from. Later on Thursday, the hashtag #LaManada was trending on Twitter in Spain with street protests in several cities including Pamplona itself and Barcelona. Allow Twitter content?

Videos of the late-night encounter between the men, who are in their late 20s and originally from Seville, and the woman show how the five wandered the streets among other drunken revellers before two of them led her into a basement. According to a police report, the men surrounded the woman in a small alcove, removed her clothes and had unprotected sex. Some of them filmed the sexual act on their phones. One of the men posted messages in a WhatsApp group celebrating what they had done and promising to share the recording. According to the police report, the victim maintained a ""passive or neutral"" attitude throughout the scene, keeping her eyes closed at all times. Her phone was then stolen. The case triggered protests after the sentencing and again on Thursday She told the trial that she was still having psychological treatment to deal with trauma. Under Spanish law, the charge of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. The conviction and sentence were widely criticised across Spain by women's groups and politicians. Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a called on officials to analyse the verdict so that similar cases could be avoided.

Cambridge students back academic in race row,"Priyamvada Gopal said she would no longer supervise students at the university in protest at her treatment Cambridge University students have rallied behind an academic who said racism at one college is ""widespread"". Priyamvada Gopal claimed porters at King's College frequently ""hassled"" non-white staff and students at the gates, amounting to ""racial profiling"". Since posting about the issue, current and former students have said they had similar experiences. A university spokeswoman said it ""abhors racism"" but its investigation found no wrongdoing by staff. The lecturer hit the headlines earlier this week when she said porters at King's had repeatedly refused to use her academic title of ""Dr"" and had spoken to her in a harsh and sarcastic tone. She described the incident as a ""small issue"" but said it was ""symptomatic of a wider problem"" at the university. ""They will let white people walk through unimpeded but demand ID cards from people who are not white,"" she said. ""We had two students who came crying late to class because they were hassled at the gates of King's and I've never had a white student who's had this problem."" ""Do I have 100% proof that it is racism? No. But one can only look at the fact people of colour are carded frequently or asked more questions frequently."" The academic, who specialises in post-colonial literature,announced in a Twitter post,externalthat she would be be refusing to supervise any students at the college in protest. Allow Twitter content?

Among the many messages of support for her on Twitter, one former King's student said: ""The porters liked to throw their weight around when they suspected someone shouldn't be allowed through the gates, but inevitably that suspicion didn't fall equally."" Another said: ""If King's College is to be a 'dynamic & diverse community' it must take Dr Gopal's concerns seriously."" Several posts were from people from ethnic minorities who said they had experienced similar treatment: ""I was constantly stopped by Cambridge porters to show my ID, to explain where I was going."" The role of university porters includes controlling entry to buildings and often maintenance and other administrative tasks. A spokeswoman for the University of Cambridge said: ""King's prides itself on being an inclusive and tolerant place, where students and staff of all backgrounds can feel secure, so we will always act swiftly and proportionately to remedy any wrongdoing. ""The college abhors racism or discrimination of any kind and would seek to stamp it out wherever it might be found. ""However, having conducted a thorough investigation of the events of Monday, we have found no wrongdoing on the part of our staff. ""Approximately 700,000 people pass through King's every year, and we receive fewer than three complaints annually.

Man won't be charged over 1994 murder,"Rikki Neave, six, was found strangled and naked in woodland in Peterborough in 1994 A man arrested on suspicion of murdering a six-year-old boy almost 24 years ago will not face charges, prosecutors have said. Rikki Neave's naked body was found strangled in woodland near his Peterborough home in 1994. James Watson, then 36, wasarrested in April 2016 and later released. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was ""insufficient evidence to charge a man in relation to the death"", though it refused to name him. Schoolboy Rikki was last seen leaving his Welland estate home on the morning of 28 November 1994. His body was found the next day in a wooded area about a five minute walk away. The investigation into Rikki's death was reopened in 2015 following a ""detailed review"" of the cold case probe. Mr Watson was arrested in April 2016, and left the UK for Portugal while on bail in July of the same year. He was re-arrested a month later and brought back to the UK. The BBC understands Mr Watson was the only person arrested as part of the renewed investigation into the case. Although he was released from bail in October 2017, Cambridgeshire Police said he remained part of the investigation and the force was awaiting a CPS decision on the case. Police said they remained committed to finding the killer of the schoolboy On Thursday the CPS said it had ""reviewed a file of evidence"" and added: ""We have decided that the evidence is insufficient for a realistic prospect of conviction and therefore for charge."" Assistant Chief Constable Paul Fullwood, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ""Although at this stage we have no further active lines of enquiry we remain committed to finding [Rikki's] killer."" Rikki's mother, Ruth was cleared of his murder at a trial in 1996, though she received a seven-year sentence after pleading guilty to child neglect. In a statement, Ms Neave's partner Gary Rogers said: ""Both Roo and I are very greatful for all the hard work the police have put in and they have left no stone unturned. We know they have worked very hard and we thank them all.""

'Moral panic' over gaming disorder listing,"The decision to class gaming addiction as a mental health disorder was ""premature"" and based on a ""moral panic"", experts have said. The World Health Organization included ""gaming disorder""in the latest version of its disease classification manual.,external But biological psychology lecturer Dr Peter Etchells said the move risked ""pathologising"" a behaviour that was harmless for most people. The WHO said it had reviewed available evidence before including it. It added that the views reflected a ""consensus of experts from different disciplines and geographical regions"" and defined addiction as a pattern of persistent gaming behaviour so severe it ""takes precedence over other life interests"". Gaming becomes the latest addiction How much screen time is 'too much'? Speaking at the Science Media Centre in London, experts said that while the decision was well intentioned, there was a lack of good quality scientific evidence about how to properly diagnose video game addiction. Dr Etchells, who lectures at Bath Spa University, said: ""It sets us on a potentially slippery slope. ""We're essentially pathologising a hobby, so what's next? There are studies on tanning addiction, dance addiction, exercise addiction, but nobody is having a conversation about including them in ICD 11... ""I don't think policy should be informed by moral panics, which is what it feels like is happening at the moment."" Dr Etchells said estimates of those who are addicted range from fewer than 0.5% to nearly 50% of players, which meant there was a danger of failing to identify who actually had a problem and who just enjoyed playing games. ""What we're doing then is over-diagnosing, we're sort of pathologising a behaviour that for many people is not harmful in any way."" The experts were also sceptical that screen time overall - which also includes the use of things like smartphones and tablets - was harmful for children and adolescents, as some studies have suggested. Such concerns have prompted the Commons Science and Technology Committeeto hold an inquiry into the issue. Dr Etchells and Andy Przybylski, associate professor and director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said such papers usually only showed weak associations between screen use and health. Prof Przybylski said in such studies usually about 99% of a child's wellbeing could be attributed to factors unrelated to screen time. He said it also might be the case that lots of screen time was linked to other problems going on at home. ""New, good studies that add to what we understand about the effects of screen time over time on young people, they're really few and far between,"" Prof Przybylski added. Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said children and adults should keep screens out of their bedroom at night Dr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said there was evidence of a link between excess screen time and reduced sleep and obesity. But he said the RCPH was unlikely to support the idea of restricting screen use in its upcoming guidance on the issue. The American Academy of Paediatrics proposes a limit of one to two hours per day for young children. Dr Davie said: ""We don't think that approach is evidence-based. What we're interested in really is the content and context of screen time."" Dr Davie added that for now his advice was for people to keep smartphones and other screens out of theirs and their children's bedrooms at night. Dr Etchells added: ""The best evidence that we currently have really suggests some screen time, some video game playing, is better than none at all, particularly for child wellbeing."" The WHO said classing gaming addiction as a mental health disorder ""will result in the increased attention of health professionals to the risks of development of this disorder and, accordingly, to relevant prevention and treatment measures"".

Watchdog expected to find Vote Leave broke rules,"An investigation into whether the official Leave campaign in the EU Referendum broke electoral rules is scheduled to be published within weeks. The draft Electoral Commission's report concludes that Vote Leave and another smaller campaign group did break the rules, the BBC understands, and is expected to recommend at least one fine. The latest investigation comes after allegations were made by the whistleblowers Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni that the official Brexit campaign broke the law by colluding with a smaller group, BeLeave. It is understood that the commission did consider this new evidence, but it is not thought that the new information was decisive in proving a breach of the law. Third Vote Leave whistleblower revealed Watchdog reopens Vote Leave probe This is the first full formal investigation into Vote Leave, although the Electoral Commission had twice examined the campaign's behaviour. One source said that the draft report was ""bizarre"" and had ""gone way off track"" by focusing on the original information that has already been pored over, rather than additional evidence. It's suggested that the commission did not interview, nor request interviews, with the senior members of the Vote Leave Campaign team. Lawyers for those criticised in the report are understood to be challenging the draft findings, and publication could therefore be subject to delay. It is not clear if the commission plans only to recommend civil sanctions like fines, or also suggest referring the matter to the police or Crown Prosecution Service. Suggestions that the official Leave campaign, which featured senior Cabinet ministers, broke the law, would be highly controversial. Vote Leave and BeLeave have both always denied the allegations. An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: ""In accordance with its Enforcement Policy, the Electoral Commission has written to Vote Leave, Mr Darren Grimes and Veterans for Britain to advise each campaigner of the outcome of the investigation announced on 20 November 2017. ""The campaigners have 28 days to make representations before final decisions are taken. ""The commission will announce the outcome of the investigation and publish an investigation report once this final decision has been taken."" Lawyer Tamsin Allen, who acts for Mr Sanni, Mr Wylie and a third whistleblower, said ""The legal opinion and evidence submitted to the EC demonstrated the grounds for suspecting that Vote Leave and BeLeave conducted an unlawful spending scheme. ""If the Electoral Commission has indeed found those in the scheme guilty of  electoral offences, this is vindication for the whistleblowers, but a serious blow for the public and for the integrity of the referendum vote.""

Melania wears 'I don't really care' coat,"This video can not be played Lauren Wright, politics and public affairs expert, on the significance of Melania Trump's ""I don't care"" jacket First Lady Melania Trump has been criticised for her choice of jacket worn on a trip to a migrant child detention centre in Texas. Mrs Trump was spotted in the coat, which featured graffiti writing on the back with the words ""I really don't care do u?"", as she boarded a plane. Her spokeswoman said ""there was no hidden message"" in the former fashion model's sartorial choice. The $39 (Â£29) jacket from Zara caused an uproar on social media. US President Donald Trump later tweeted his wife's coat ""refers to the Fake News Media"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs Trump was not seen wearing the coat when she first arrived in Texas, but had it on again when she returned to Washington DC. Katty Kay, BBC World News presenter, Washington Melania Trump's empathetic visit to the Mexican border risks being overshadowed by the unempathetic message on the back of her coat. It stretches credulity that the first lady would make the effort to fly down to Texas, visit children, talk to staff and engage in this heartbreaking story only to deliberately  undermine it with a callous choice of clothing. It's not clear how this was allowed to slip through the careful White House protocols but it's a mistake on the part of her staff. I give her the benefit of the doubt on compassion - but if she chose to wear this without thinking, it was pretty tone deaf. This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""I want to help reunite children with their families"" Mrs Trump made the previously unannounced visit to a child migrant detention centre on Thursday, saying she wanted to help reunite migrant children who were separated from their families. Her tour of the federally-funded New Hope Children's Shelter in McAllen, Texas, housing dozens of Central American children came as her husband's administration sought to quell the firestorm over migrant separations. Confusion over fate of US migrant children All the context you need on migrant children story The majority of the 55 children housed at the facility crossed the border unaccompanied, but some were separated from their parents as part of the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy towards illegal immigration. Mrs Trump had changed out of the Zara coat by the time that she arrived in Texas Programme director Rogelio De La Cerda Jr told Mrs Trump that the majority of the children had arrived from Guatemala, and are normally  ""very distraught"" when they first arrive. Mrs Trump mingled with children during their lessons, asking them how long they had been in the facility and how often they are able to speak to their parents. ""Be kind and nice to others, OK?,"" she said, with her words at times being translated into Spanish. ""Good luck,"" she told another group of children. Twitter users were quick to criticise what they saw as the first lady's jacket faux pas and what some called the not-so-hidden message. Allow Twitter content?

"Man won't be charged over 1994 murderProsecutors say there is ""insufficient evidence"" to charge a man over the death of Rikki Neave, six.Cambridgeshire","Rikki Neave, six, was found strangled and naked in woodland in Peterborough in 1994 A man arrested on suspicion of murdering a six-year-old boy almost 24 years ago will not face charges, prosecutors have said. Rikki Neave's naked body was found strangled in woodland near his Peterborough home in 1994. James Watson, then 36, wasarrested in April 2016 and later released. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was ""insufficient evidence to charge a man in relation to the death"", though it refused to name him. Schoolboy Rikki was last seen leaving his Welland estate home on the morning of 28 November 1994. His body was found the next day in a wooded area about a five minute walk away. The investigation into Rikki's death was reopened in 2015 following a ""detailed review"" of the cold case probe. Mr Watson was arrested in April 2016, and left the UK for Portugal while on bail in July of the same year. He was re-arrested a month later and brought back to the UK. The BBC understands Mr Watson was the only person arrested as part of the renewed investigation into the case. Although he was released from bail in October 2017, Cambridgeshire Police said he remained part of the investigation and the force was awaiting a CPS decision on the case. Police said they remained committed to finding the killer of the schoolboy On Thursday the CPS said it had ""reviewed a file of evidence"" and added: ""We have decided that the evidence is insufficient for a realistic prospect of conviction and therefore for charge."" Assistant Chief Constable Paul Fullwood, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ""Although at this stage we have no further active lines of enquiry we remain committed to finding [Rikki's] killer."" Rikki's mother, Ruth was cleared of his murder at a trial in 1996, though she received a seven-year sentence after pleading guilty to child neglect. In a statement, Ms Neave's partner Gary Rogers said: ""Both Roo and I are very greatful for all the hard work the police have put in and they have left no stone unturned. We know they have worked very hard and we thank them all.""

Reporter sexually harassed at World Cup,"""This one went too far,"" Gonzalez Theran said about the on-air groping incident A female reporter groped live on air at the World Cup has spoken out about harassment by sports fans. Colombian correspondent Julieth Gonzalez Theran was working for DW Espanol in Moscow when a man grabbed her breast and kissed her cheek. She continued her report without interruption but has since addressed the incident online. ""We do not deserve this treatment,"" Gonzalez Theran said. ""We are equally valuable and professional."" She told her employer, Deutsche Welle, she had been on the scene for two hours preparing for the broadcast. ""When we went live, this fan took advantage of the situation,"" she said. ""But afterwards, when I checked to see if he was still there, he was gone."" The incident happened last week in the city of Saransk ahead of the Russia-Saudi Arabia game. DW posted the footage on social media, calling it an ""attack"" and ""blatant harassment"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many online commentators, however, downplayed the incident. One labelled the criticism as ""feminist hysteria"", and others suggested the kiss should be seen as a ""welcome"" or a ""compliment"". Gonzalez Theran continued to speak out about her treatment on Twitter, retweeting messages of support from her colleagues. ""This is not funny,"" DW presenter Cristina Cubas tweeted. ""It's not a kiss. It's a non-consenting attack."" On Wednesday, almost a week after the incident happened,DW published an article about the controversy,external, in which Germany's first female national league referee branded the behaviour ""unacceptable"". ""For me it is an isolated incident,"" Gonzalez Theran said. ""There are always fans that compliment you and behave respectfully. This one went too far."" Harassment of female reporters is not uncommon in sports reporting. In March, a group of 52Brazilian reporters launched a campaign showcasing incidents of being kissed and gropedby fans and athletes, which they called #DeixaElaTrabalhar - or ""Let her work"". This video can not be played Sports journalist Bibiana Bolson: 'They try to kiss us and to hug and to touch us' Last year, tennis playerMaxime Hamou was banned from the French Openafter forcibly kissing a female reporter during a live TV interview. ""If I hadn't been live on air, I would have punched him,"" the reporter, Maly Thomas, later said. Other women working at the World Cup have also been facing criticism or abuse off-camera- and particularly online. German football commentator Claudia Neumann has received extensive criticism on social media for her work, which her employer and colleagues have dismissed as sexist. In the UK, the BBC's Vicki Sparks faced similar online abuse when shemade history as the first female World Cup commentator on British televisionon Wednesday - but was widely well-received.

Mum's cupboard death 'devastated family',"Mary Isherwood's son Craig and her ex-husband Clive said they are still shocked at how the former policewoman died The family of a woman who died after getting trapped in an airing cupboard have said sitting through her inquest brought back painful memories. Elizabeth Isherwood, 60, was found dead at Plas Talgarth Country Club near Pennal, Gwynedd, a week after arriving. The ex-policewoman's naked body was found when workers noticed a hole in a plasterboard wall she had tried to break through. Acoroner recorded a conclusion of misadventureat a hearing this week. Mrs Isherwood's son Craig believes his mother got stuck when taking a wrong turn after using the en-suite bathroom at night. He said: ""She hadn't even unpacked as when they found her body a week later her clothes and case were still in the room untouched. ""We are all absolutely devastated to find out what happened. Mum was so sporty, fit, healthy, and loved playing golf. ""If anyone could have got out of that cupboard it would have been Mum. ""The inquest has brought it all back to us. It's been a tough nine months and losing her has left a huge hole in our lives."" On 23 September 2017, Mrs Isherwood went alone to the holiday complex in which she had a timeshare with ex-husband Clive. The couple, who met while in the police force, split almost 30 years ago but remained on good terms. Mr Isherwood said the couple had recently sold the time share but his ex-wife had been given vouchers for ""a final stay"". ""She would've usually gone with friends but nobody could make it during that week so she went alone,"" he said. ""We think she arrived there early on the Saturday, had gone for a swim and then gone back to the room after she'd checked in."" Mrs Isherwood quit the police force and moved to London where she began working for the Post Office Investigation Service. Her family believe she woke in the middle of the night to use the en-suite bathroom. It is thought Mrs Isherwood, of Wolverhampton, mistook the door to an airing cupboard for a bedroom door and entered without realising. When the door closed behind her, it is thought she tried to leave the cupboard but the handle fell off, trapping her inside. Ms Isherwood and her family had visited the resort for a number of years After breaking a pipe she was sprayed with water - leaving her drenched before hypothermia set in. The inquest was told that banging was heard at the complex, but other guests thought it was maintenance work. She was later found by workers who noticed a hole in the plasterboard leading to the bedroom where she had tried to break through the wall.

Sick MP's anger after 'undignified' vote,"There have been calls for a reform of ""archaic"" Commons rules after a sick Labour MP had to enter the lobbies in a wheelchair to cast her vote. Naz Shah said she felt she had been stripped of her dignity after being told she would have to vote in person during Wednesday's Brexit bill debate. Labour has accused the Tories of suspending a convention sparing unwell MPs from having to enter the chamber. But the government blamed Labour for her ordeal. Proxy voting by MPs 'good for democracy' May vows 'smooth' Brexit as bill passes Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said she was ""particularly sorry"" that Ms Shah, the MP for Bradford West, had been ""forced to come and vote"". ""But the fact that she had to come all the way from Bradford when she was clearly so unwell is clearly a matter for the honourable lady's party."" She said the government had only been told of Ms Shah's situation just after midday on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The government won the vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill by 319 to 303. Traditionally, unwell MPs are able to be ""nodded through"" by whips if they make it onto the Parliamentary estate, without having to leave their vehicle and enter the House of Commons, and it is rare for this convention to be cast aside. Labour's shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said she had heard Tory whips confirming it would not apply in Wednesday's vote. ""All the trust and conventions appear to have broken down that enable us to carry out our work here,"" she said. Ms Shah's office said she had been in hospital in Bradford since last Friday with ""excruciating"" nerve pain resulting from a hit-and-run collision and went ""absolutely against doctor's advice"" and had to sign a form to be allowed to leave. She is now back in the city's royal infirmary after a round trip of over eight hours. Shetold The Guardian,externalshe had been told by her party's whips to travel to Westminster but assured she would be able to stay in the car - however she said the Conservatives insisted she had to vote in person by walking through the voting lobbies in the Commons.

It felt personally very undignified and very invasive. It was embarrassing. I thought I'd just be able to stay in the back of the car, where I'd made a bed for myself, and be counted there, but the Tories wouldn't have it. ""By making me go in to vote like that, they stripped me of my dignity."" Meanwhile the Lib Dems' deputy leader voted while nine months pregnant. ""This is no way to run a Parliament in a modern democracy,"" Jo Swinson tweeted afterwards. ""Deciding matters of state, or which parts of the country will have their voices heard, should not be determined by which MPs can be discharged from hospital or happen to be in childbirth. We need proxy voting."" MPs are currently considering whether members who are new parents should be able to vote by proxy. A debate on the issue is to be held on 5 July.

Poor white communities 'lack drive',"Ms Spielman was speaking to an education festival at Wellington school in Berkshire White working-class communities can lack the ""aspiration and drive"" of many migrant groups, England's chief schools inspector has told a conference. Amanda Spielman said a long-overdue debate was under way about why white working-class pupils fall behind. ""We are having to grapple with the unhappy fact that many... working-class communities have felt the full brunt of economic dislocation,"" she said. Her comments follow criticism that Ofsted is unfair on poor white schools. Last week headscomplained that Ofsted inspections do not take enough account for the circumstances of a school.,external Separately, the secondary heads union ASCL hashit out at school performance tables for unfairly stigmatising schools in white working-class areas. In a speech to the Festival of Education at Wellington College in Berkshire, Ms Spielman said: ""We are having to grapple with the unhappy fact that many local working class communities have felt the full brunt of economic dislocation in recent years, and, perhaps as a result, can lack the aspiration and drive seen in many migrant communities."" She said Department for Education analysis showed schools in some areas of England faced real challenges, with both their pupil intake and their capacity to teach effectively. ""Schools in these areas struggle with teacher recruitment; there are fewer local academy sponsors; and there is less access to leadership support through national leaders of education and through teaching schools,"" she said. ""We can't pretend that Ofsted judgements are not lower in certain areas, many of them with a high proportion of white working-class children."" Ofsted chief inspector backs ban on phones in schools Ofsted admits some 'outstanding schools aren't that good' But she said it was Ofsted's job to ""report without fear or favour"" on school performance and that schools had to be graded on overall standards rather than effort. ""That is explicitly not the same as saying that teachers in these areas are putting in any less effort or that the leadership is worse. ""There is no doubt that these schools have a harder job to do than others. ""And we should be just as interested in why some schools in more affluent areas aren't doing better. ""I have nothing but admiration for the teachers who make it their mission to tackle disadvantage. But the overall effectiveness of a school is not an effort grade."" Ms Spielman said this did not amount to the inspectorate being biased against certain schools. ""What our inspection outcomes do is to act as a call for action in these areas - a call for the right kind of support and intervention."" She told the festival the debate was not limited to England and the rest of the UK and its coastal towns. ""It has also echoed throughout continental Europe and across the Atlantic."" Earlier, Ms Spielman's predecessor, Sir Michael Wilshaw suggested that London schools performed well because many immigrant families are passionate about learning. ""The reason why London schools are doing so well, apart from good head teachers and teachers, is that a lot of the immigrant families care about education, they value education, they support their children,"" he said. ""I'm working in parts of England with white British populations where parents don't care. Or a lot of them don't care. ""And the head teachers tell me that less than 50% turn up to parents' evening. Now that's outrageous.""

Killer 'used spyhole to watch conman',"John ""Goldfinger"" Palmer was jailed in 2001 for a Â£20m timeshare fraud A notorious conman shot dead in his garden may have been watched by his killer through a fence spyhole before his death, police have said. John ""Goldfinger"" Palmer, 65, once described as Britain's richest criminal, was shot dead in the garden of his Essex home on 24 June 2015. Photographs of the hole in the fence around his home been released. A reward to help catch the killer has beendoubledto Â£100,000 by his family nearly three years after his death. Palmer - whose nickname derives from his connection to the 1983 Â£25m Brink's-Mat gold bullion robbery - was jailed in 2001 for a Â£20m timeshare fraud. Detectives believe Palmer's killer may have used this hole in the fence to spy on his movements in the days before his death Detectives believe the killer climbed the fence and shot Palmer three times while he was standing, and again when he was on the ground Palmer was shot six times by a killer who entered the garden over the fence at his home in South Weald, near Brentwood. Essex Police said the killing had""all the hallmarks"" of a professional hit. Detectives believe the hole in the garden fence suggests the killer may have been watching Palmer in the days before his death. Police found five of the bullets used to kill Palmer. A ballistics expert said the killer used a .32 calibre silenced revolver His partner Christina Ketley said: ""It haunts us every day to think that whoever was responsible was clearly watching John, stalking him like an animal before brutally and callously ending his life."" Detectives have recovered five of the six bullets used to kill him. Roger Critchell, director of operations at the charity Crimestoppers, said: ""We understand that people are not always willing to go to the police so we would urge them to contact Crimestoppers with 100% anonymity."" Palmer's partner Christina Ketley said he was shot in cold blood while pottering around the garden Bullion from the Brink's-Mat robbery was melted down in a shed in the grounds of Palmer's country house at Lansdown, near Bath. However, he denied knowing the gold was stolen and was acquitted in 1987. The former scrap metal dealer from Olton, near Birmingham, started his criminal career young - selling paraffin off the back of a lorry after leaving school at 15, unable to read or write. 'Goldfinger' police chief 'concerned' Who was John 'Goldfinger' Palmer? Goldfinger police 'ignored wound doubts' His criminal activities netted him an estimated fortune of Â£300m, but justice eventually caught up with him when he was jailed in 2001 for a massive timeshare fraud in Tenerife. At the time of his death he was due to stand trial in Spain on charges of fraud, firearm possession and money laundering. It was later revealed he had been under police surveillance since 2007. Then, in September 2016, the BBC discoveredan operation codenamed Alpine had been gathering intelligence on himfrom RAF Spadeadam in Cumbria since 1999.

New force to take on hospital deaths probe,"Inquests into the deaths of 10 patients, six of whom are pictured, were held in 2009 Hampshire police are to hand over the investigation into deaths at Gosport War Memorial Hospital to another force, their top officer has said. An inquiry,externalfound more than 450 patients died after doctors gave them ""dangerous"" amounts of painkillers. The report said the quality of three police investigations into 92 of the deaths had been ""consistently poor"". The chief constable apologised for the force's ""part in the distress caused to families for so many years"". Gran 'was treated brutally' at hospital 'Gosport will be remembered for this' Jane Barton, the doctor who shortened lives The Gosport Independent Panel's report found whistleblowers and families were ignored as they attempted to raise concerns about the administration of medication on the wards, which wasoverseen by Dr Jane Barton. Hampshire Constabulary previously conducted three separate inquiries, but no prosecutions were brought. Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said: ""Having taken time to carefully consider the matter, I have made the decision that Hampshire Constabulary must take a step back. ""I certainly would never want to absolve my force of its responsibilities, but we cannot hide from the fact that the legacy of what has happened has caused considerable damage to confidence in the agencies involved, including my own. ""The force has always acknowledged that the first two police investigations were not of a high quality. ""The report makes clear a view from the panel that the third did not look widely enough. We accept the panel's findings and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise for our part in the distress caused to families for so many years."" Dr Jane Barton was found guilty of serious professional misconduct in 2010 but no prosecutions were brought Ms Pinkney said she had instructed the force to prepare to hand the case over to a different lead force and would communicate any progress with families first. Relatives are callingfor an inquiry into actionsat the hospital. Dr Barton was found guilty of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999.

Mum's cupboard death 'devastated family'The family of a woman who died after getting trapped in an airing cupboard speak of their pain.Wales,"Mary Isherwood's son Craig and her ex-husband Clive said they are still shocked at how the former policewoman died The family of a woman who died after getting trapped in an airing cupboard have said sitting through her inquest brought back painful memories. Elizabeth Isherwood, 60, was found dead at Plas Talgarth Country Club near Pennal, Gwynedd, a week after arriving. The ex-policewoman's naked body was found when workers noticed a hole in a plasterboard wall she had tried to break through. Acoroner recorded a conclusion of misadventureat a hearing this week. Mrs Isherwood's son Craig believes his mother got stuck when taking a wrong turn after using the en-suite bathroom at night. He said: ""She hadn't even unpacked as when they found her body a week later her clothes and case were still in the room untouched. ""We are all absolutely devastated to find out what happened. Mum was so sporty, fit, healthy, and loved playing golf. ""If anyone could have got out of that cupboard it would have been Mum. ""The inquest has brought it all back to us. It's been a tough nine months and losing her has left a huge hole in our lives."" On 23 September 2017, Mrs Isherwood went alone to the holiday complex in which she had a timeshare with ex-husband Clive. The couple, who met while in the police force, split almost 30 years ago but remained on good terms. Mr Isherwood said the couple had recently sold the time share but his ex-wife had been given vouchers for ""a final stay"". ""She would've usually gone with friends but nobody could make it during that week so she went alone,"" he said. ""We think she arrived there early on the Saturday, had gone for a swim and then gone back to the room after she'd checked in."" Mrs Isherwood quit the police force and moved to London where she began working for the Post Office Investigation Service. Her family believe she woke in the middle of the night to use the en-suite bathroom. It is thought Mrs Isherwood, of Wolverhampton, mistook the door to an airing cupboard for a bedroom door and entered without realising. When the door closed behind her, it is thought she tried to leave the cupboard but the handle fell off, trapping her inside. Ms Isherwood and her family had visited the resort for a number of years After breaking a pipe she was sprayed with water - leaving her drenched before hypothermia set in. The inquest was told that banging was heard at the complex, but other guests thought it was maintenance work. She was later found by workers who noticed a hole in the plasterboard leading to the bedroom where she had tried to break through the wall.

August interest rate rise moves step closer,"The Bank of England has held interest rates but signalled an August rate rise is more likely than previously thought. In a decisive move, Andrew Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, joined two other Monetary Policy Committee members in voting to raise rates to 0.75%. The nine-member MPC was split 6-3, with Bank governor Mark Carney leading the group who voted to hold rates at 0.5%. The last time three people ""dissented"" from the overall view, in June 2017, rates rose the following November. But economists believe that if the economy does show signs of picking up, an August rise is in play. Government borrowing figures published on Thursday boosted hopes among some economists that the economy may be gaining momentum. The pound jumped by about a cent against the dollar following the Bank's decision, climbing back above the $1.32 level, as the possibility of an August rate rise appeared to increase. UK borrowing falls more than expected What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? Hammond: Taxes will rise to pay for NHS The MPC said,externalthat the poor economic growth figures of the first three months of a year was likely to prove ""temporary"" and that the speed of growth would pick up. As economic momentum improves, fears over rising inflation grow and pressure increases for interest rates to rise. The level of interest rates is the Bank's main tool for controlling any increase in prices. ""A key assumption in the MPC's May projections was that the dip in output growth in the first quarter would prove temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter,"" the committee said. ""This judgement appears broadly on track. ""A number of indicators of household spending and sentiment have bounced back strongly from what appeared to be erratic weakness in Q1 [January to March], in part related to the adverse weather. ""Employment growth has remained solid."" The MPC said prospects for global growth also remained strong, despite some weakness across Europe. It is the first time Mr Haldane has ""dissented"" from the majority view on the MPC since he joined the Bank in 2014 and is significant given his role as the leading economic expert at the institution. Before today's decision the markets were split 50/50 on whether there would be a rate rise at the MPC's next meeting in August. After the news that Mr Haldane has joined those pressing for a rise - MPC members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders - it is likely the market expectation for a rate rise will strengthen.

Minister resigns over Heathrow expansion,"Junior trade minister Greg Hands has resigned from the government to oppose expansion of Heathrow Airport. The vote on whether to build a third runway at the airport west of London is due to be held on Monday. Mr Hands, who represents the Chelsea and Fulham constituency in London, said he had pledged to oppose the new runway at the 2017 election. It had been thought that ministers with constituencies directly affected could have been allowed to miss the vote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The highest profile opponent of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who once pledged to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it happening. But Mr Johnson is scheduled to be out of the UK on Monday so will not be attending the vote in the House of Commons. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson suggested on Twitter that Mr Hands' resignation should prompt the prime minister to allow her MPs a free vote: ""It's not too late for her to change whipping arrangements. This would also allow Boris Johnson to re-enter the country."" Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the foreign secretary should quit too: Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Theresa May defended the foreign secretary's absence from a vote seen by some as crucial to the UK's post-Brexit international trade campaign, known as Global Britain. She said: ""The government is absolutely committed to increasing airport capacity at Heathrow. This is important, it is part of our future as Global Britain, and the ambitions we have as a trading nation for the future. ""The foreign secretary early next week will be what I would describe as the living embodiment of Global Britain. ""He will be out there actually showing the UK's continued presence around the world, and the work that the UK continues to do around the world, with our diplomacy working on so many of the issues and challenges that we face across the world today."" Labour is also divided on the controversial issue, with members of the party's leadership, such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell, opposed to it, but high profile trade union backers in favour. The party's MPs are being allowed to vote however they want to on the issue. The SNP are in favour of Heathrow expansion, with the Lib Dems opposed and with the government deciding to whip (order) Conservative MPs to vote in favour, it is widely expected that the expansion plan will get Commons backing. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Hands, who has held various ministerial roles and was chief secretary to the Treasury under David Cameron, had ""served the government with great ability and distinction over several years, and we thank him for all of his work"". Mr Hands will be replaced as a minister in the Department for International Trade by George Hollingbery, MP for Meon Valley. Meanwhile Mr Hands has tweeted that he cannot answer media calls about his resignation - because he is visiting a Romanian monastery: Allow Twitter content?

The debate on expanding Heathrow has been going on for nearly 20 years. The last Labour government backed the idea, and won a vote on it in 2009, but that plan was scrapped - and the idea of expansion put on hold for five years - by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition formed after the 2010 election. But the idea of expansion was resurrected and has been subsequently backed by the Conservatives. Ministers approved a draft national airports policy statement in October but Parliament has  to give its approval for detailed planning to begin. Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day. It will result in huge disruption to residents of nearby villages, such as Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson, with hundreds of homes likely to be knocked down. Robert Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, told the BBC the government was ""failing people and failing the environment as well"". Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who backs expanding Gatwick instead, suggested the idea of Heathrow as a national hub airport was outdated and the focus should be on improving regional capacity. And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who resigned his Richmond Park seat in 2016 over the issue and subsequently lost a by-election, said for many people ""this doesn't just look like a blank cheque being given by this government to a foreign-owned multinational, it looks like a whole book of cheques signed by our constituents"". This video can not be played Chair of Airports Commission, Sir Howard Davies told Today that Heathrow Airportâs expansion will succeed Heathrow's owners, which include Spanish infrastructure firm Ferrovial, say the airport is virtually full and a new runway would increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. The expansion is estimated to create about 60,000 new jobs and generate about Â£70bn in total economic benefits by the 2050s. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said it will provide a ""vital legacy"" for the British economy. Residents whose houses are knocked down will get compensation worth 125% of their value - as well as legal fees and stamp duty costs paid for - while Â£700m would be available to fund noise insulation measures for those who decide to stay. Mr Grayling has said a ban on night flights was an ""absolute requirement"" and non-negotiable while he said landing charges paid by airlines must stay at current levels. ""This runway cannot be built if it does not meet air quality rules,"" he added. Sir Howard Davies, whose 2015 review recommended a new runway as long as environmental and community impacts were addressed, said ""significant"" concessions had been made on reducing early morning flights and minimising the impact on residents on the proposed flight path.

Woman traces 'silly' 1989 cancer nurse,"Liz Brown's nurse Debbie Bye (right), has been found after an appeal on social media A woman has tracked down the nurse who did ""silly things"" to make her cancer treatment as a teenager ""less painful"", after an appeal on social media. Liz Brown spent four months in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, in 1989 with a spinal tumour. Her nurse, Debbie Bye, ""realised I was struggling"" andgave her ""silly jobs"" which helped her cope, Ms Brown said. On Wednesday night an ""overwhelmed"" Mrs Bye got in touch and the pair, who were ""both in tears"", plan to meet up soon. Mrs Bye, 50, said that she ""felt really emotional"" after finding out about the appeal, after many of her friends sent a BBC article asking her, ""Is this you?"" Mrs Bye, who now lives in Derbyshire, said she had ""often wondered what happened to Lizzy"" More than2,000 people had also retweeted Ms Brown's appeal,externalto trace Mrs Bye and thank the nurse for what she had done. Thirty years ago Mrs Bye had nursed the 14-year-old teen through aggressive osteoblastoma. Realising she found being on a children's ward difficult, she would give the teenager jobs like delivering post to the adult patients and ""silly things like that to make it less painful than it could be"", Ms Brown said.

Mrs Bye was 21 in the photo of the pair and said that she kept a scrapbook of old pictures of her with patients, but had lost the one of her and Ms Brown. ""I enjoyed my job and did my job to the best I could, but didn't feel like I had made that much impact on someone that 30 years later they could remember my name - it's a bit overwhelming,"" she added. ""I just tried to make it home from home. We did bobbing apples and went on day trips. We even had nights where we took the kids to nurse's flats and just had pizza and watched videos."" Liz Brown had to learn to walk again after her cancer diagnosis Ms Brown, who is now 43, has three children and lives in East Riding, said she was too was ""overwhelmed"" after their brief conversation on Facebook at about 22:00 BST on Wednesday. The pair have only written to each other so far, but ""we were both in floods of tears"". Liz Brown was not expected to live more than five years ""I didn't realise how important this was to me until now,"" she added. ""Debbie inspired me to go on to work with children as a sensory support assistant, and I think everything I have done is down to the way she realised that spirited, rebellious teenager was a real person, no matter what was wrong with her.""

The war in the desert," It is just before 15:00 on Saturday in Timbuktu and the intense desert heat has reached its peak. Five years ago, Islamist occupiers were driven out of the historical town - but violent extremists have never been far away. A few people are browsing through the silver jewellery and leatherwork at a small Tuareg curio market by the security checkpoint at the airport entrance. It’s on the outskirts of town and both French troops and UN peacekeepers have set up what they call a “super-camp” there. At this sleepy time of day, people are working inside their air-conditioned containers and all that can be heard is the low hum of generators. Then, blaring sirens. Everyone - whether inside the base or shopping at the market - knows immediately they have less than 30 seconds to reach a bunker. The early warning sirens mean a mortar or rocket attack is incoming. One of the shop owners, Amadou (not his real name) knows what to do - he rushes everyone at the market, including four American soldiers, into a small bunker nearby. Twenty six people are crammed into the small space protected by sandbags - five of them young children. Then comes the terrifying whistle and crash of mortars. About a dozen cut through the hazy, sand-soaked sky, exploding in and around the super-camp next to the terminal. Amadou can see the American soldiers are keen to get to their car and back inside the camp, but he tells them to wait for an all-clear. That saves their lives. Troops at the first checkpoint are on high alert because of the mortar attack. But two Malian military vehicles race up, apparently desperate to get inside. Their vehicles aren’t armoured and they are out in the open. Neither stop to be searched as they swing around the sand-filled bollards at the gate and accelerate through the checkpoint. From his hiding place in the bunker, Amadou hears the car  and then the scream of “Allahu Akbar [God is greatest]”, just before a huge explosion a few metres away. The first suicide bomber has detonated his explosives-laden vehicle at the first checkpoint, clearing the way for a second bomber to speed through. The blast rumbles through the camp and the atmosphere inside the bunker changes dramatically. The children start crying as gunfire erupts around them. But the Islamist fighters don’t know they are there. Amadou can see people are about to flee the bunker in fear, but the US troops tell everyone to stay down and stay quiet. That saves their lives. Further up the road, the second bomber accelerates towards French soldiers guarding their section of the camp and explodes right in front of them. With the outer defences breached, jihadist foot soldiers in Malian military uniforms rush in - at least three of them wearing suicide vests - and so begins an intense battle. The airport terminal building is almost destroyed. For three hours, the attackers are repelled. For three hours, 26 people hide in a bunker - terrified they will be found and killed. The four American soldiers are armed only with pistols. They radio for help but it is only after 18:00, as the Sun is setting, that the gunfire finally stops and a rescue party reaches them. As everyone in the bunker is rushed inside the super-camp, Amadou sees the dead body of an attacker lying close to what is left of his store. Timbuktu airport terminal after the attack But then comes a third car bomb - again at the main gate - perhaps to help the surviving attackers retreat. A fourth unexploded car bomb is found later. The attack is finally over. One UN peacekeeper, from Burkino Faso, was killed and seven others were seriously injured. Seven French soldiers and two civilians were also badly hurt. On the militant side, French forces said 15 had died. The al-Qaeda-backed group JNIM (Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin) claimed responsibility for the most sophisticated attack so far on a military base in Mali.

On the militant side, French forces said 15 had died.The al-Qaeda-backed group JNIM (Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin) claimed responsibility for the most sophisticated attack so far on a military base in Mali. Timbuktu was once at the heart of the Mali Empire. The king is said to have been the richest man ever to have lived - a 14th Century multi-billionaire. When Mansa Musa I went on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, he brought tens of thousands of courtiers with him, and lavished so many gifts of gold along the way that the price of the precious metal crashed in Cairo. Mali was an empire built on gold but it also grew rich on trade - in metals, salt and slaves. Traffickers have been making fortunes for centuries moving commodities across the Sahara. For 250 years, the Mali Empire grew into a centre of learning for science, literature, religion and art. Scholars from all over the Arab world travelled to the towns that cling to the River Niger as it arcs through the desert - to Timbuktu, Djenne and Gao, where mud mosques were built, and beautiful Islamic scripts were painstakingly written and illustrated. Djenne’s grand mosque is the largest mud-brick building in the world. Until recently Mali’s rich history attracted hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. But all that changed in 2012, when the extremists moved in. Mali’s road to chaos led straight from Libya. In 2011, the country collapsed as Arab spring protests led to civil war, Western intervention and the death of Col Muammar Gaddafi. Armed Tuareg mercenaries who had been fighting for Gaddafi headed back home to Mali with renewed purpose, and with weapons. October 2011: Tuareg rebel fighters in northern Mali For decades, separatists had been demanding independence for northern Mali. In 2012, Tuareg rebels fighting in a convenient partnership with al-Qaeda-backed Islamists drove the army out and declared an independent state of “Azawad”. The name of their new state is thought to be an Arabic corruption of the Berber word “azawagh”, meaning “dry river basin”. As the rebellion spread across northern Mali, disgruntled, underpaid troops staged a military coup in the capital throwing the country into chaos. The lack of leadership or military response meant the northern uprising was able to spread out of control. The religious extremists imposed strict sharia law. In Timbuktu and beyond, they smashed shrines built for Sufi mystics, burned manuscripts and destroyed ancient artefacts. The priceless texts would have all been lost had it not been for the old guardian families who protected what they could. Tuaregs and Islamists disagreed over the way their new state of Azawad should be run and began to fight each other. The government asked for foreign military help and the former colonial power France answered the call. French troops arrived in January 2013 and were joined by African forces. Within a month, they had driven the violent extremists out into the desert and retaken the River Niger towns. French troops arrive in Mali The Islamists were down, but not out. Neighbouring countries and the United Nations came in to support a peace deal between the government and rebellious Tuareg armed groups. That deal still holds and their guns are broadly silent but good governance has failed to return. And a far more lethal Islamist threat has returned from the desert. The extremist groups have gradually been strengthening and uniting and as the dangers have increased, UN troops have taken fewer risks - spending longer in their bases, leaving the desert ungoverned and vulnerable. Many foreign flags fly over the UN super-camp in the northern Malian town of Gao. Cambodian troops roll out their bomb-defusing robot, Chinese peacekeepers run the hospital and patrol inside the base, while a carved Pharaonic column overlooks the compound of the Egyptian convoy protection unit. On the parade ground, the wail of badly tuned bagpipes wafts above the lines of Bangladeshi soldiers, practising for their departure parade just weeks away. Different countries accept different levels of risk. Many are simply going through the motions - counting down the days, trying to stay alive, and having little real impact in a place where it’s nearly impossible to keep the peace. Heavily armed Senegalese police in big UN armoured vehicles trundle out of the base and stop at the local police station to escort the commander on his beat through a Gao town bathed in darkness. UN peacekeepers escort police by night Their presence is a target. It’s a lot of risk and effort for just a few minutes out meeting people huddled around TV screens watching live European football. Gao is increasingly becoming a central hub for people trafficking. The Islamist threat is growing and the dangers are increasing. “All the citizens are scared about the terrorists,” says one man sitting by his motorbike. “Sometimes they steal the vehicles and kill people so this is not good for us - that is why we are scared.” A coalition of al-Qaeda groups is vying for influence with the Islamic State group across the vast ungoverned region known as the Sahel, which stretches for thousands of kilometres on the southern edge of the Sahara. Germany is one of the largest Western contributors to the UN mission. Its helicopters and drones support the supply convoys, which now take weeks rather than days to negotiate their way past roadside bombs in hostile territory. “That is the main problem we have to cope with and we have to face that violence. We have to protect ourselves, we have to protect the mandate, we have to protect the human system and we have to protect civilians,” says the UN force commander, Maj Gen Jean-Paul Deconinck, a Belgian. “I need better equipped and better trained contingents. I need more vehicles… to protect my people against the IEDs [improvised explosive devices] and mines and so on and I need to upgrade the training level of my contingents.” Over the past five years, a memorial wall for fallen peacekeepers has continued to fill up with names. Two more walls are being built. Hundreds more peacekeepers have been severely injured. The $1bn-a-year (£750m) UN mission to Mali is being carried out in the middle of a raging insurgency. Some believe it’s doing little but creating a target for the jihadists to attack. While the UN is focused on peacekeeping, France and America are leading counter-terrorism operations intent on search and destroy. Foreign forces are fast militarising the Sahara desert. On a dusty scrap of desert in northern Niger, the runway at Airbase 201 is gradually taking shape. A squadron of rollers driven by American troops is readying the long strip of land for a thick layer of asphalt. First planned as a drone base, it’s going to be far more than that - costing $110m, it’s long enough to land some of America’s biggest military cargo planes and will be home to 800 service personnel. The US says it’s just temporary and it belongs to Niger. But  Airbase 201 is unmistakably American and undoubtedly being built to last. It’s concrete evidence of how America’s military footprint is spreading across the Sahara. Just beyond the perimeter fence is Agadez – a former tourist town, which over the past five years has been transformed into the most important hub of the trans-Saharan migrant trade. Economic migrants have always moved through here, ready to head north across the desert. But in the chaos of Libya’s collapse in 2011, this trail became a highway. Criminal gangs moved in and the desert tour guides became human traffickers, carrying lorry-loads of migrants north to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This thriving industry provides both cash and cover for the radical, violent, extremist groups assembling across the Sahara. The Nigerien town of Agadez But with corrupt officials taking their cut, there’s little incentive to shut down the trafficking and isolate the Islamists. “Yes, of course I’m frustrated,” says the head of Nigerien special operations, Col Maj Moussa Salaou Barmou. “The violent extremist organisations are involved in these illegal migrations. They are making a lot of money out of it.” Col Maj Barmou is working with the US military, which is piling billions of dollars into the Sahel to counter the gathering Islamist threat in the desert. There are now at least 7,000 troops and 34 individual US bases or staging posts across Africa - and probably many more secret facilities. But few people in the US, or in Niger, knew much about the American operations in Africa until four of their soldiers were killed in an ambush at a village called Tongo Tongo last October. What appears to have been a poorly planned and under-supported mission to target an Islamist leader sparked controversy in the US. October 2017: the funeral of Sgt La David Johnson, one of three US soldiers killed in an ambush in Niger Ambushed as they left the village, the convoy of American and Nigerien troops were outgunned and outnumbered, with no armoured cars for protection. Footage from the soldiers’ helmet cameras was released by their attackers as propaganda - showing the moment they were killed. Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) claimed responsibility - America’s first introduction to IS in this part of Africa. The families of the US soldiers were vocal in their criticism of a mission they say was botched, claiming the military had failed their sons. A US Department of Defense investigation broadly agreed, saying there were “individual, organisational and institutional failures and deficiencies”, but it found that no single failing had led to the loss of life. As a result, very public questions have been asked about why 800 US servicemen and women are in a country few Americans could point to on a map. The head of Special Operations Command Africa, Maj Gen Mark Hicks, says the Sahel is vitally important because of the growing strength of the al-Qaeda- and IS-affiliated groups. “If we don’t take this opportunity to deal with it now, where it’s at a level that’s affordable and sustainable both in blood and treasure, then it may cost much, much more to deal with it at a later time,” he says. The US recently led the annual Operation Flintlock training exercise, bringing together 12 African and eight Western nations. 2017: Chadian soldiers take part in an Operation Flintlock exercise For African countries, it was a chance to learn how Western armies worked, and for the visitors it was an opportunity to find “partners” who could help fight foreign terror for them. The US Special Operations soldiers are training regional forces - sharing their skills with  poorly trained and equipped African troops. “To work by, with and through our African partners and our Western partners as an international coalition of the willing” -  that’s the military jargon Maj Gen Hicks repeats. It has echoes of Iraq and Afghanistan. As rich nations baulk at losing men in a distant desert, these African troops are the boots that will ultimately be on the ground fighting a war on terror for them. In neighbouring Mali, France has a hands-on strategy through its long-running Operation Barkhane. A barkhane is a crescent-shaped dune carved by the wind. With 4,500 soldiers based across the Sahel, they are the ones tackling the Islamist threat head on. For five years they have been carrying out modern counter-terrorism warfare - drone strikes from the air and Special Forces raids on the ground, targeting the leaders and the bomb-makers of the Islamist groups. “If we were not here, the terrorist groups would thrive in Mali, which would only heighten the global threat, both in the Sahara and in Europe, where we are the most concerned,” says Col Olivier Vidal. “Our action is effective - it's long term - and it will continue… until the Malian armed forces and the Malian institutions can pick up the fight by themselves, once we have caused the necessary damage to the armed groups.” France has encouraged five Sahel countries to contribute troops to the 5,000-strong G5 Sahel Joint Force, which will counter terrorism, drug smuggling and human trafficking across the Sahara. And then there’s the UN’s force, which has a mandate to build and keep the peace. In Mali, they have almost 14,000 peacekeepers from nearly 60 different countries. They are now being directly targeted by militants using rockets, roadside bombs or in complex attacks such as the one in Timbuktu. Blue helmets no longer give the protection - or the sense of neutrality - they used to. Given the proximity of UN bases to the counter-terrorism units, their heavily armed appearance and a mandate to open fire, the lines are blurring. That’s why Mali is now the most dangerous UN peacekeeping mission in the world. The “who’s who” map of most wanted men, and their groups across the Sahel, is a bewildering family tree of alliances and allegiances, old photographs, and long French or English acronyms. Extremist groups have grown and divided, splintered and reformed, as those backed by al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group battle for power and influence. Boko Haram, and its offshoot, the Islamic State in West Africa Province, have displaced and terrorised hundreds of thousands of people in north-eastern Nigeria and the bordering countries of Niger, Chad and Cameroon. Splits in the leadership and a concerted effort by the Nigerian army has eaten into their influence, but the kidnap of schoolchildren and the use of young suicide bombers continues. But it’s further west - mainly in Mali and the border regions of Burkina Faso and Niger - where attacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Currently, the most powerful group is known as JNIM, which was formed in March 2017 when four al-Qaeda-backed factions merged, overcoming years of splits and divisions over strategy and ideology: - al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) - al-Mourabitoun -        Ansar Dine -        Macina Liberation Front The coalition’s leaders include former Tuareg rebel leader Iyad Ag Ghaly and veteran jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar - whose death has been reported on a number of occasions JNIM's leaders include the former Tuareg rebel, Iyad Ag Ghaly (left), and jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar (right) JNIM carried out the recent attack on the military base at Timbuktu airport and regularly targets UN and other military convoys with bombs or ambushes. Its militants have also bombed popular hotels and restaurants in regional capitals in West Africa and attacked civilians in remote villages. United, the four groups are a much more effective force, each with their own area of influence, sharing intelligence and bomb-making technology. But there are even more groups to add to this complex picture. Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group are unlikely to merge because of ideological differences but there are signs they could collaborate in some fashion here. With the collapse of the IS “caliphate”  in Iraq and Syria, there is a fear some fighters may move through chaotic Libya and on to the Sahel, bringing more sophisticated tactics and bomb technology. “If just 30 or 40 fighters make it from Syria, it could be a game changer,” says an intelligence operative who doesn’t want to be named. “The worst case scenario for us is these violent extremist organisations being able to link up,” says Col Maj Barmou. “You have seen how they have overtaken most of Mali back in 2012, so if nothing is done they would keep on expanding and actually join forces across the continent.” In some respects it is already too late for Mali. The country is at the heart of the Islamist threat and attacks have spread from the sparsely populated northern desert into the central and southern parts of the country. The lack of a government presence is key but a failing economy is allowing the influence of Islamist groups to spread among the young as life grows harder. You can see the problems in the historical Malian town of Mopti. There, the River Niger is particularly low for this time of year. The boats that were once packed with tourists are tied up on a beach strewn with plastic rubbish and waste. Drought is just another blow to the central part of this country that once welcomed tens of thousands of visitors every year wanting to explore its rich past. The UN says five million people across the Sahel are in need of food aid. More than 1.5 million children are at risk of malnutrition. Climate change is bringing more extreme weather. There are now few fish and no tourists - the violent extremist groups are close by. Attacks are increasing and young people are being radicalised. “The government has abandoned this corner of the country. In the last five years, the state has not been present here,” says Djougal Goro, leader of a youth group in Mopti. “Whoever knows Mopti, knows that Mopti only lives off tourism. The unemployment rate is very, very high here. “If you’ve nothing else to do but hang around, you will eventually be swayed by negative influences and you will be forced to be radicalised. You will be forced to go to their side. That’s what causes the insecurity here,” he says. Islamists offer young men hard cash to fight. With no courts to settle land disputes and complex historical, ethnic-based disagreements, their harsh form of justice is becoming the law. It’s a short, but dangerous drive from the small UN base in Mopti to Kontza - a village about 100km (60 miles) along the River Niger. Most is tarred road but the last few kilometres is dirt track and UN convoys have been attacked here before. The vehicles are armoured, the troops heavily armed and an advance party of Senegalese soldiers has been sent ahead a day earlier to secure the route. Everyone is wearing flak jackets. The troops are on high alert and the UN civilians who have come to meet community leaders have an armed escort through the mud-walled corridors between the family compounds that make up the village. In one dark room, the men sit cross-legged on the floor as the UN visitors ask about security, development, stabilisation, and women’s rights. It’s an awkward conversation. The message is that security isn’t good but there’s no further explanation. “We don’t know who is who,” says Gabriel Branglidor, chief of civil affairs for the UN’s mission in Mali. He believes the elders are not being completely open in their answers, perhaps because they are fearful of jihadists or their sympathisers. “We can understand - sometimes you have the perpetrators among those people so they were not allowed to express themselves very freely,” Mr Branglidor says. The jihadists may well be in the area - not just watching this UN visit from afar, but perhaps among the crowds, watching and listening.  The lack of any government presence and only infrequent visits by UN peacekeepers have allowed Islamist groups to wield great influence. “It is quite obvious that insecurity is in the area. There are some forces here that would prefer Koranic school over secular teaching,” Mr Branglidor says. The schools here always taught a range of subjects but with growing Islamist influence, the education has been limited to the learning by rote of scripture. From the gates of the beautiful old Sufi mosque, it’s a short drive to the other side of the village. Kontza is split along ethnic lines between the Peul and the Dogon. Relations are so bad they have now become completely separate villages. They are both Muslim but there are big ethnic issues here, which sometimes go back centuries and often involve land disputes between farmers who plant crops and nomadic pastoralists driving their cattle to pasture. Climate change is driving the Sahara south and reducing the fertile land, while population growth is increasing the competition for dwindling resources. The Swedish UN force commander for Sector West, Brig Gen Stefan Andersson, is also on the trip - assessing how the civilians work and what he can do to help. “With the lack of Malian defence and security forces - you have no law and order,” he says. A lack of governance is allowing extremist groups to fill the vacuum. “They can provide something and they will punish people if they steal motorcycles or cattle. So in many cases the villagers are welcoming them,” Brig Gen Andersson says. He says the jihadists talk to both sides. “They are standing in the middle and also provide some kind of security,” he adds. Towering over a second meeting is a new white and green mosque, which smells of fresh paint. The UN says Qatari money paid for the building - like Saudi Arabia, here and in other parts of Africa they have a programme that provides new mosques and preachers to teach a very conservative form of Islam. The children here on this side of the village don’t play football any more. Radios have fallen silent and schools that teach subjects other than religion have closed - the teachers have been intimidated. It’s happening on a vast scale across the Sahel - from here in Mali to Agadez in Niger. Moderate forms of Islam are giving way to far more conservative Salafist and Wahhabist ways. Koranic schools are growing stronger, students getting younger, and the teaching is becoming more conservative. And Africa’s population is growing fast - in Mali and Niger it doubles every 20 years - creating a huge youth bulge. The lack of education, work and opportunities makes this a prime recruiting ground, creating a new generation of Islamist foot soldiers. European countries afraid of increasing numbers of migrants, and the Islamists they worry could be hiding among them, are investing heavily in the Sahel to counter the threat. France has committed thousands of soldiers to Mali and it pushed for the regional G5 force to be formed. That’s still a work in progress. Three British Chinook helicopters will soon be supporting the French counter-terrorism operation. Despite a fluid and increasingly dangerous mission, Mali would undoubtedly be worse off if the UN pulled out more than 14,000 people. And America’s presence in Africa is growing, although its drone strikes and special forces missions are governed by secrecy. “Right now these threats in Africa are clear, immediate threats to our African partners. But they’re also threats to Western presence in Africa and they aspire to be threats to the West directly,” says Maj Gen Hicks. He worries Islamic State fighters fleeing Syria and Iraq will come to the Sahel and “that could be devastating to the security situation across North Africa”. It’s an obvious place to come, where weak governance, corruption, ethnic division, drought, poverty, unemployment, population growth and climate change all combine to give Islamists a unique opportunity. It’s the new, desert front line in the global war on terror.

Prison officer killing: Trial collapses,"Damien McLaughlin pictured leaving court on Thursday after he was found not guilty The trial over the death of David Black has collapsed. On Thursday Mr Justice Colton directed not guilty verdicts on all charges in Damien McLaughlin's trial. Mr McLaughlin, 41, from Kilmascally Road in Dungannon, was charged with aiding and abetting the murder of 52-year old Mr Black. The prison officer was shot and killed on the M1as he drove to work in November 2012. David Black was shot dead as he drove to work at Maghaberry prison in November 2012 On Tuesday the judge ruled that the evidence presented could not be relied on, and on Thursday the prosecution told the court it would not be offering any other evidence. Mr Justice Colton then said he was compelled to direct not guilty verdicts on all the charges against Mr McLaughlin, who also denied IRA membership. In a statement, Mr McLaughlin's solicitor Peter Corrigan said: ""Mr McLaughlin has always vehemently denied the charges. ""The evidence obtained by the Garda was significantly and fundamentally flawed from the outset, and should never have been relied upon, nor should Mr McLaughlin have been charged with these offences"". Mr McLaughlin had always denied the charges Mr Black's widow and son, along with other relatives, left the court without commenting. The prosecution's case against Mr McLaughlin, from Kilmascally Road near Ardboe, rested ""solely"" on the evidence of County Leitrim man Stephen Brady, interviewed by specialist Irish police officers from Dublin in the wake of the ""horrific shooting"". During the interviews, which the judge previously described as ""oppressive, aggressive, hectoring and bullying"", Mr Brady allegedly identified Mr McLaughlin as the man who moved a Toyota Camry car, which it is claimed was later used by the gunmen to carry out their ambush. On Tuesday, Mr Justice Colton said that having read and viewed the video-taped interviews, including evidence of the three police officers who conducted them, he ""could not believe that it was contemplated that the interviews with Brady would be relied upon in any criminal prosecution"".

Students back Cambridge doc in race row,"Priyamvada Gopal said she would no longer supervise students at the university in protest at her treatment Cambridge University students have rallied behind an academic who said racism at one college is ""widespread"". Priyamvada Gopal claimed porters at King's College frequently ""hassled"" non-white staff and students at the gates, amounting to ""racial profiling"". Since posting about the issue, current and former students have said they had similar experiences. A university spokeswoman said it ""abhors racism"" but its investigation found no wrongdoing by staff. The lecturer hit the headlines earlier this week when she said porters at King's had repeatedly refused to use her academic title of ""Dr"" and had spoken to her in a harsh and sarcastic tone. She described the incident as a ""small issue"" but said it was ""symptomatic of a wider problem"" at the university. ""They will let white people walk through unimpeded but demand ID cards from people who are not white,"" she said. ""We had two students who came crying late to class because they were hassled at the gates of King's and I've never had a white student who's had this problem."" ""Do I have 100% proof that it is racism? No. But one can only look at the fact people of colour are carded frequently or asked more questions frequently."" The academic, who specialises in post-colonial literature,announced in a Twitter post,externalthat she would be be refusing to supervise any students at the college in protest. Allow Twitter content?

Among the many messages of support for her on Twitter, one former King's student said: ""The porters liked to throw their weight around when they suspected someone shouldn't be allowed through the gates, but inevitably that suspicion didn't fall equally."" Another said: ""If King's College is to be a 'dynamic & diverse community' it must take Dr Gopal's concerns seriously."" Several posts were from people from ethnic minorities who said they had experienced similar treatment: ""I was constantly stopped by Cambridge porters to show my ID, to explain where I was going."" The role of university porters includes controlling entry to buildings and often maintenance and other administrative tasks. A spokeswoman for the University of Cambridge said: ""King's prides itself on being an inclusive and tolerant place, where students and staff of all backgrounds can feel secure, so we will always act swiftly and proportionately to remedy any wrongdoing. ""The college abhors racism or discrimination of any kind and would seek to stamp it out wherever it might be found. ""However, having conducted a thorough investigation of the events of Monday, we have found no wrongdoing on the part of our staff. ""Approximately 700,000 people pass through King's every year, and we receive fewer than three complaints annually. ""We have reviewed all complaints over the past three years and confirm that, where we have found our staff to be at fault, we have taken action.""

Brutal murder by patient was 'avoidable',"Jeffrey Barry stabbed Kamil Ahmad more than 25 times The murder of a man by a violent schizophrenia patient ""could have been avoided"" had a medical tribunal been given complete information on his past, a report has concluded. Jeffrey Barry stabbed neighbour Kamil Ahmad at their supported flats in Bristol in July 2016, hours after his release from a secure mental hospital. Barry was detained after hearing voices and threatening to murder Mr Ahmad. The report said the decision to release him had ""tragic consequences"". The legal team representing Mr Ahmad's family said the report ""lays bare the crisis within the NHS and the social care system"". In a statement, Kamaran Ahmad Ali said it confirmed the family's ""worst fears"" that his brother's life ""could have been saved"". Areview by the Bristol Safeguarding Adults Board,external(BSAB) found information sharing between Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership (AWP) and the psychiatric hospital where Barry was an inpatient had ""failed due to the absence of key personnel due to annual leave"". It said systems ""should have been robust enough"" to have contingency plans for when ""a key professional is absent from work"". The report also found that racism rather than Barry's complex mental health conditions was at the root of his victimisation of Mr Ahmad. ""He was a person with racist views who was mentally ill rather than a mentally ill person whose racism was a manifestation of their illness,"" it said. ""These views crystallised into a personal hatred [of Mr Ahmad] that was based on his race and legal status."" Kamil Ahmad was not aware Jeffrey Barry had returned to their supported flats Barry is now serving at least 23 years at Broadmoor secure hospital after beingfound guilty of murdering Mr Ahmadin a ""savage and sustained"" attack, in which he sliced off the Kurdish refugee's penis. The judge described the failures leading to his release as being ""nothing short of calamitous"". Because of bed shortages, Barry was moved from the Callington Road NHS psychiatric hospital to the privately-run Cygnet Health Care Hospital in Kewstoke, north Somerset. He did not want to stay and asked for his case to be reviewed but his NHS care team were only given 24 hours' notice to compile their notes for the independent mental health review tribunal. But the safeguarding report found the decision to discharge him had been ""based on incomplete information"" and had ""foreshortened his compulsory treatment"". This video can not be played Jeffrey Barry admits killing neighbour to a 999 call operator. It said the tribunal had not followed the ""recommendations of the professionals involved"" or appreciated the ""inherent risk"" of his return to the supported flats. The report also detailed a lack of face-to-face planning for Barry's release. Each of the agencies ""recognised"" this problem but the meetings ""did not take place"". During this time, Barry's care coordinator ""effectively lost management oversight"" of his case and when he transferred to the privately-run Kewstoke hospital, the assumption was made that he would transfer back to an AWP facility before his release was considered. The report found this assumption was partially down to overwork and ""other conflicting workload responsibilities"". But a lack of ""professional curiosity"" from workers at Kewstoke, who faxed and emailed details of Barry's case to the care coordinator and did not get a response, also contributed to his early release. BBC West home affairs correspondent Charlotte Callen Today's report highlights the failures to assess the risk Barry posed in the days and weeks leading up to Kamil Ahmad's death. Barry's medical notes - that he gave us permission to view - show his extensive psychiatric history was not provided to an independent tribunal who agreed he should be released from hospital. According to Jeffrey Barry's legal team it is not just Kamil Ahmad who's been failed. They told me they question whether the decision to release him was made as a result of costs and lack of bed space as opposed to clinical and mental health considerations. The report today concludes Kamil's death could have been avoided if Jeffrey Barry had received better care. That will be of little comfort to either Kamil's family or the families of at least 15 other people killed by patients under the care of AWP since 2007. The housing organisation looking after Barry, the Milestone Trust, also viewed his release as a ""fait accompli"". This led to there being a failure of any ""effective discharge process"" meaning Barry was allowed to leave hospital after 23 days with ""no meaningful handover"" between the hospital and other agencies. Police found notes in Barry's flat Chair of BSAB Louise Lawton said the report had ""identified opportunities"" which could have been taken to separate Mr Ahmad and Barry. ""Of particular consequence is the process by which [Barry] was discharged from a secure hospital on the day of Kamil's murder, how agencies worked together to coordinate care and assess risk, and opportunities to terminate [Barry's] tenancy at the housing provision,"" she said. ""Whilst nothing can make up for the loss that Kamil's family have suffered, I hope that the review's recommendations will help to safeguard other adults at risk of harm in the future."" Tony Murphy, who is representing Mr Ahmad's family, said Barry had told a ""myriad of public authorities"" involved in his care that he wanted to kill Kamil. ""Yet, despite having weeks to do so, not one of those authorities made any plan to protect Kamil's life,"" he said. Mr Ahmad's brother, Mr Ali, called on the agencies involved to ""sit down"" with his family, apologise and answer their questions. ""This report confirms our worst fears, that Kamil's life could have been saved if just one of the organisations involved had protected him from the racism that ended his life,"" he said. ""The space this leaves in our lives can never be filled, yet not one of the organisations involved has offered us an apology."" 'Litany of blunders' led to savage murder Man jailed for refugee neighbour's murder Rebecca Eastley, from AWP, said it accepted the findings of the report ""in its entirety"". ""This was a tragic and brutal death and we are deeply sorry,"" she said. ""We are committed to doing all we can to prevent such an incident happening in the future."" Cygnet Health Care said the only aspect of its services that had needed addressing was its ""discharge procedures"". It said a ""more cohesive approach"" had been introduced to access and understand ""pre-admission information on all its patients"". Following the report's publication, BSAB recommended: There are clear standards and protocols for discharge planning meetings Ensuring case managers are told about patients' progress in hospital and are aware of when they are about to be discharged Safeguarding inquiries should not be closed down before there has been a risk analysis and key professionals have been consulted Revision of AWP's bed availability policy to avoid mentally ill people in crisis remaining in the community where they are a risk to themselves and others Ensuring Cygnet Health Care discharge procedures offer a safe handover of responsibility between the hospital and community services All staff at AWP should be trained on when to use the police 101 (non-emergency service) and when a 999 call is appropriate 'Litany of blunders' led to savage murder Man jailed for refugee neighbour's murder Man guilty of 'savage' stab murder Man 'fatally stabbed neighbour 25 times' SANE Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust Cygnet Health Care Great British Pub Awards runner-up donates prize money to local charity New Met Office weather warning as big freeze looms after snow, sleet and rain Flu pressures build on both of Bristol's two hospitals âHotter than a Turbo Island bonfireâ Sound engineer crafts device to play records through digital set up X-Press makes a Mark on local charity Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Who should we let in after Brexit?,"Amidst all the talk about Brexit - about borders and about trade - ministers have said almost nothing about how immigration will be controlled after the UK leaves the EU. They have not yet come up with the answer to a fundamental question - who should we let in? The promise to take back control of our borders was the headline of the leave campaign. Yet almost two years on, there has been little public debate about how that will be done, or what our immigration system should look like once free movement of EU citizens in and out of Britain has ended. Brexit: Theresa May to fight EU transition residency plan Brexit: The rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in the EU A quick guide: What is the Brexit transition phase? The Home Office originally promised to publish its plans for a new immigration policy before Christmas. Then it said the spring. Now ministers say it'll be in the autumn. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes told me: ""There isn't any dithering. What I'm committed to doing is making evidence-based policy. And so we will bring an immigration policy forward when we're ready."" Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes denies the government is ""dithering"" over its immigration policy They were, she said, waiting for the expert advice from the Migration Advisory Committee, an independent public body which advises the government on migration issues. Why the delay? Very likely it's because they're caught in the middle, between the demands of British business and the expectations of many of the voters who backed Brexit. Pressure is now mounting on Theresa May from a growing number of businesses who fear that they will not be able to find the workers they need after we leave the EU. First, the figures:Net migration overall - the difference between the number of people coming to the UK and leaving - is 244,000 a year, more than double the government's target. But net migration from the EU fell sharply to 90,000 - the lowest for 5 years. And from food manufacturers to delivery firms to fast food restaurants, I've been hearing the fears of Britain's bosses about what happens if they can't get the workers they need. That's the question worrying Leigh Pomlett, president of the Freight Transport Association. More than one in seven of the HGV drivers based in Britain - that's 40,000 drivers - are EU nationals. Speaking to me at his company CEVA's Tamworth warehouse, he told me he is beginning to see people going back home, as the wages people can send back become worth less due to the fall in the pound, and because more jobs are now available in Europe. Leigh Pomlett warns that many businesses could be seriously affected by a shortage of drivers ""Polish people are wanted back in Poland more than ever. They're also wanted in Germany, more than ever. So there is a global labour market which is more mobile than it ever was. Will they move? Yes they will."" He says the industry could do with another 50,000 drivers, but he can't see where they are going to come from. And what's bad for his business could be bad for yours, as he warns that the days of free next-day delivery could come to an end. That's what Patrick Hook wants to know. His family farming business PD Hook hatches eggs on an industrial scale - more than nine million per week. EU workers represent 33% of all people employed in the food manufacturing sector. Patrick is worried. Some of the people he employs from the EU have already headed home. Others are thinking about it. Egg producer Patrick Hook says the labour crisis is the biggest threat facing his industry ""The labour crisis - and not having those skilled permanent people available to us from the European Union - is a bigger threat to us as a business and our industry  than avian influenza, that is a fact."" Order a coffee, a sandwich or a salad in a fast food restaurant, and you're very likely to have it served up by a European - one of half a million EU nationals working in shops, hotels, restaurants and fast food outlets. John Vincent believes increased automation will fill the jobs left vacant by the lack of EU workers More than half the staff at Leon - an upmarket fast food chain - are from the EU. John Vincent, Leon's chief executive and co-founder, warns that if the industry can't recruit enough staff, then restaurant chains will become increasingly automated, with machines preparing dishes, and companies using apps and vending machines to sell and deliver them to customers. ""There's a danger if we can't recruit people - and we've already seen it in America - that people will be replaced by robots, and that's not something we want to see. ""So, that's not 'Mad Max fantasy world', it's already happening."" Jacob Rees Mogg, the leading Brexiteer backbencher, accepts that jobs of the future may be taken by robots instead of Brits. ""I think that if you look at check-outs in supermarkets, that is an efficiency for the supermarket. It reduces the cost, and it may be quicker for the consumer as well.  I don't think we should be frightened of mechanisation. Those jobs will go to robots whether we have immigration or not."" Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg argues we should stop giving preferential treatment to EU nationals He is urging ministers not to give in to the pressure. ""Of course business wants to carry on what it's been doing, because it's easy, but the responsibility of government is to look after the consumer and the citizen."" The voters of Mansfield in Nottinghamshire are watching to see if the Tories deliver on their promise to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands. This ex-mining town and traditional Labour constituencyelected a Tory MP for the first time in its history last year. More than 70% of people here voted to leave the EU. Immigration, I was told, was a factor. It was certainly an issue for local resident Jeffrey Smith: ""I'll walk down every morning to this coffee bar, and - not being racist - I can probably meet or pass 15 people, and sometimes you don't hear an English voice. and then you think 'what on earth's wrong with Mansfield?' ""There's too many people from other countries living here and living off us."" Mansfield voters elected Conservative Ben Bradley in 2017, after being represented by Labour for almost a century Richard Vickerstaff runs a local shop called the Vinyl Lounge. He didn't vote for Brexit, but says he knows why people are worried about immigration. ""I think Mansfield probably historically isn't used to a lot of immigration, you know, on that side. So to have quite a heavy influx of people suddenly coming quite quickly within two or three years, people notice that, and certain people obviously feel uncomfortable about it."" Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes told me the government was sticking to its long-term target of bringing net immigration down. ""The last two sets of statistics that we've seen have seen the direction of travel downwards, which is what we're aiming towards. But none of us have ever said that this going to be either easy or quick."" But the Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott told me that the government's target was ""completely bogus"". She says, ""it's just a way of the Tories talking an anti-immigrant narrative"". When asked twice whether immigration could go up under Labour, she did not rule it out. Diane Abbott says the government's immigration target is ""completely bogus"" ""We can't say what is going to happen to levels of migration, because migration flows are subject to all sorts of international pressures. With increased emphasis on training and skills, the need for people's specific skills from overseas may well decline."" It all adds up to a pretty painful position for Theresa May - caught between those competing pressures. As well as a debate about what level immigration should be, there's the question of how the new system of rules are designed. It is thought the Cabinet has had only one high-level discussion about immigration recently, and it is said to have argued about whether preference should in future be given to workers from the EU - Poles, Spanish and French - or whether there should be a level playing field for immigrants wherever they come from. Brexiteers like Jacob Rees Mogg back the latter approach. ""I can see no reason to give preference to people from the EU after we've left.  Why should we discriminate against our Commonwealth friends, against our American friends, the very large Indian population in this country? Surely we should prioritise members of their family against people from the EU with whom we have no connection?"" But this is one more subject that looks set to get included in those endless complex Brexit negotiations. The more trade we want, the more open our borders may have to be. One well-placed source told me that the first thing countries want to export is their people. That, incidentally, applies to India or China as well. so any new post-Brexit trade deal with them may involve hard bargaining about liberalising the immigration rules for their people who want to come here. SNP First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland needs more immigrants, not fewer Some argue that different parts of the country need a different approach. SNP First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland needs more immigrants, not a target to have fewer: ""It's damaging and counter-productive. It runs counter to the needs of the Scottish economy. ""Our pensioner population over the next 25 years is projected to increase by 25%, and yet our working-age population - those who are in employment and contributing the taxes to support everything else that we hold dear - is only going to increase by 1%. So that tells a story that we need to be able to attract talent from elsewhere."" The truth is the debate on immigration has scarcely begun. Most voters want to see what they call control. They want to see the numbers cut. They like the idea of people being able to come here to do vital jobs and of blocking those with no or few skills. That, though, doesn't go very far to answer the question ""who should we let in?""

More EU nationals leaving,"The number of EU citizens leaving the UK is at its highest level for a decade with 130,000 emigrating in the year to September,figures show.,external But far more EU nationals (220,000) moved to the UK in the same period, the Office for National Statistics found. It means net EU migration - the difference between arrivals and departures - was 90,000, the lowest for five years. The ONS said Brexit could be a factor in people's decisions to move. Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said migration was complicated and could be influenced by lots of different reasons. The figures also show that more British people are emigrating than are returning to live in the UK. Of those EU nationals arriving in the UK, fewer were coming for ""work-related reasons"", in particular to ""look for work"". By contrast, immigration from countries outside the European Union is going up which means the UK population is continuing to grow at a similar level to early 2014. Some 285,000 non-EU citizens arrived in the UK in the 12-month period to September, and 80,000 departed. This gives a net increase of 205,000, the highest for six years. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said this was largely driven by more people coming to study in the UK and an uncharacteristic dip in the previous year's figures that may have been corrected. He also speculated whether firms were starting to struggle to recruit or retain people from the EU, forcing them to look outside the EU. Overall, net migration is estimated to have fallen by 29,000 to 244,000 in the same period. This includes 73,000 British people coming back to the UK and 125,000 Britons leaving. The overall net migration figure is still well short of the government's target to reduce net migration to below 100,000, a pledge made in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos. By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw What explanation could there be for the decline in EU migration other than Brexit?  In the two years before the June 2016 referendum, the number of EU nationals arriving in Britain was stable at about 240,000 to 280,000. But every quarter since then has recorded falls, from 284,000 to 220,000. At the same time, the number of EU leavers, which hadn't risen higher than 100,000 since 2010, began to rise, from 95,000 to 130,000. Whether it's a feeling that EU citizens aren't wanted in the UK, uncertainty about their future or the growing relative strength of other EU economies, there has been a notable shift away from Britain's shores. Nevertheless, overall net migration remains at historically high levels, well above the government's controversial target, with a rise in migration from outside Europe. Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said the latest figures demonstrated that the UK was still attracting the ""brightest and best people"" to come to work and study and described the increase in the number of overseas students as a ""huge positive"". ""We are a country that is open for business,"" she added. ""We want to have great relations with our European neighbours going forward but at the same time we need to have a sustainable migration system,"" she said. Asked whether falling numbers would adversely affect some sectors, in particular the NHS, Ms Nokes said the independent migration advisory committee was due to report its findings on EU patterns to the government in September so decisions could be made based on evidence.

""This deficit hurts us all and highlights the immigration mess the government has created,"" she said. The ONS figures also show that in 2017, the UK granted asylum, alternative forms of protection or resettlement to almost 15,000 people, 40% of whom were under 18. Separate figures from the Home Office showedmore than 10,500 people have been granted refuge in the UK after fleeing the conflict in Syria, under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement scheme. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is in Lebanon near the Syrian border, said the government was considering extending its commitment to rehome 20,000 people by 2020. This video can not be played ""The UK has given us everything... but we miss our country"" Other figures from the Home Office,externalshow there were 141,302 applications made for British citizenship in 2017, an increase of 8% on the previous year. This was 39% lower than the peak of 232,262 in 2013. There is evidence that more EU citizens, who have settled in the UK, are applying for citizenship, with applications more than doubling from 15,460 in 2016 to 38,528 in 2017.

"Brutal murder by patient was 'avoidable'Jeffrey Barry, a violent schizophrenia patient, killed his neighbour hours after being freed.Bristol","Jeffrey Barry stabbed Kamil Ahmad more than 25 times The murder of a man by a violent schizophrenia patient ""could have been avoided"" had a medical tribunal been given complete information on his past, a report has concluded. Jeffrey Barry stabbed neighbour Kamil Ahmad at their supported flats in Bristol in July 2016, hours after his release from a secure mental hospital. Barry was detained after hearing voices and threatening to murder Mr Ahmad. The report said the decision to release him had ""tragic consequences"". The legal team representing Mr Ahmad's family said the report ""lays bare the crisis within the NHS and the social care system"". In a statement, Kamaran Ahmad Ali said it confirmed the family's ""worst fears"" that his brother's life ""could have been saved"". Areview by the Bristol Safeguarding Adults Board,external(BSAB) found information sharing between Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership (AWP) and the psychiatric hospital where Barry was an inpatient had ""failed due to the absence of key personnel due to annual leave"". It said systems ""should have been robust enough"" to have contingency plans for when ""a key professional is absent from work"". The report also found that racism rather than Barry's complex mental health conditions was at the root of his victimisation of Mr Ahmad. ""He was a person with racist views who was mentally ill rather than a mentally ill person whose racism was a manifestation of their illness,"" it said. ""These views crystallised into a personal hatred [of Mr Ahmad] that was based on his race and legal status."" Kamil Ahmad was not aware Jeffrey Barry had returned to their supported flats Barry is now serving at least 23 years at Broadmoor secure hospital after beingfound guilty of murdering Mr Ahmadin a ""savage and sustained"" attack, in which he sliced off the Kurdish refugee's penis. The judge described the failures leading to his release as being ""nothing short of calamitous"". Because of bed shortages, Barry was moved from the Callington Road NHS psychiatric hospital to the privately-run Cygnet Health Care Hospital in Kewstoke, north Somerset. He did not want to stay and asked for his case to be reviewed but his NHS care team were only given 24 hours' notice to compile their notes for the independent mental health review tribunal. But the safeguarding report found the decision to discharge him had been ""based on incomplete information"" and had ""foreshortened his compulsory treatment"". This video can not be played Jeffrey Barry admits killing neighbour to a 999 call operator. It said the tribunal had not followed the ""recommendations of the professionals involved"" or appreciated the ""inherent risk"" of his return to the supported flats. The report also detailed a lack of face-to-face planning for Barry's release. Each of the agencies ""recognised"" this problem but the meetings ""did not take place"". During this time, Barry's care coordinator ""effectively lost management oversight"" of his case and when he transferred to the privately-run Kewstoke hospital, the assumption was made that he would transfer back to an AWP facility before his release was considered. The report found this assumption was partially down to overwork and ""other conflicting workload responsibilities"". But a lack of ""professional curiosity"" from workers at Kewstoke, who faxed and emailed details of Barry's case to the care coordinator and did not get a response, also contributed to his early release. BBC West home affairs correspondent Charlotte Callen Today's report highlights the failures to assess the risk Barry posed in the days and weeks leading up to Kamil Ahmad's death. Barry's medical notes - that he gave us permission to view - show his extensive psychiatric history was not provided to an independent tribunal who agreed he should be released from hospital. According to Jeffrey Barry's legal team it is not just Kamil Ahmad who's been failed. They told me they question whether the decision to release him was made as a result of costs and lack of bed space as opposed to clinical and mental health considerations. The report today concludes Kamil's death could have been avoided if Jeffrey Barry had received better care. That will be of little comfort to either Kamil's family or the families of at least 15 other people killed by patients under the care of AWP since 2007. The housing organisation looking after Barry, the Milestone Trust, also viewed his release as a ""fait accompli"". This led to there being a failure of any ""effective discharge process"" meaning Barry was allowed to leave hospital after 23 days with ""no meaningful handover"" between the hospital and other agencies. Police found notes in Barry's flat Chair of BSAB Louise Lawton said the report had ""identified opportunities"" which could have been taken to separate Mr Ahmad and Barry. ""Of particular consequence is the process by which [Barry] was discharged from a secure hospital on the day of Kamil's murder, how agencies worked together to coordinate care and assess risk, and opportunities to terminate [Barry's] tenancy at the housing provision,"" she said. ""Whilst nothing can make up for the loss that Kamil's family have suffered, I hope that the review's recommendations will help to safeguard other adults at risk of harm in the future."" Tony Murphy, who is representing Mr Ahmad's family, said Barry had told a ""myriad of public authorities"" involved in his care that he wanted to kill Kamil. ""Yet, despite having weeks to do so, not one of those authorities made any plan to protect Kamil's life,"" he said. Mr Ahmad's brother, Mr Ali, called on the agencies involved to ""sit down"" with his family, apologise and answer their questions. ""This report confirms our worst fears, that Kamil's life could have been saved if just one of the organisations involved had protected him from the racism that ended his life,"" he said. ""The space this leaves in our lives can never be filled, yet not one of the organisations involved has offered us an apology."" 'Litany of blunders' led to savage murder Man jailed for refugee neighbour's murder Rebecca Eastley, from AWP, said it accepted the findings of the report ""in its entirety"". ""This was a tragic and brutal death and we are deeply sorry,"" she said. ""We are committed to doing all we can to prevent such an incident happening in the future."" Cygnet Health Care said the only aspect of its services that had needed addressing was its ""discharge procedures"". It said a ""more cohesive approach"" had been introduced to access and understand ""pre-admission information on all its patients"". Following the report's publication, BSAB recommended: There are clear standards and protocols for discharge planning meetings Ensuring case managers are told about patients' progress in hospital and are aware of when they are about to be discharged Safeguarding inquiries should not be closed down before there has been a risk analysis and key professionals have been consulted Revision of AWP's bed availability policy to avoid mentally ill people in crisis remaining in the community where they are a risk to themselves and others Ensuring Cygnet Health Care discharge procedures offer a safe handover of responsibility between the hospital and community services All staff at AWP should be trained on when to use the police 101 (non-emergency service) and when a 999 call is appropriate 'Litany of blunders' led to savage murder Man jailed for refugee neighbour's murder Man guilty of 'savage' stab murder Man 'fatally stabbed neighbour 25 times' SANE Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust Cygnet Health Care Great British Pub Awards runner-up donates prize money to local charity New Met Office weather warning as big freeze looms after snow, sleet and rain Flu pressures build on both of Bristol's two hospitals âHotter than a Turbo Island bonfireâ Sound engineer crafts device to play records through digital set up X-Press makes a Mark on local charity Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

New Zealand prime minister has baby girl,"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted a picture on Instagram of her with her new baby New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has given birth to her first child, a girl weighing 3.31kg (7.3lb). This makes her only the second elected leader in modern history to give birth while in office. Ms Ardern was admitted to a hospital in the city of Auckland early on Thursday morning, four days after her due date. The 37-year-old has passed on her duties to Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters while she takes six weeks of maternity leave. However, she said she would be consulted on significant issues and would continue to read cabinet papers during her time away. The baby was born at 16:45 (04:45 GMT). Ms Ardern later broke news of the birth on social media, saying she felt very lucky and thanking staff at the hospital. This video can not be played Becoming a mum Jacinda Arden spoke about juggling motherhood and leadership In a statement, she also said: ""I'm sure we're going through all of the emotions new parents go through, but at the same time feeling so grateful for all the kindness and best wishes from so many people. Thank you."" Ardern and Bhutto: Two different pregnancies in power Mums on how to survive a short maternity leave Ardern: 'Stardust' ousts experience in New Zealand Congratulations from fellow politicians started pouring in from around the region, including from former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark.

Ms Ardern, who was elected in October, announced in January that she and her partner Clarke Gayford were expecting a baby. ""I am not the first woman to multitask,"" she had said earlier this year in an interview with Radio New Zealand. ""I am not the first woman to work and have a baby; there are many women who have done this before."" She is the youngest prime minister the country has had since 1856. In 1990, the late Benazir Bhutto gave birth to a daughter while serving as Pakistan's prime minister, a first for an elected world leader. Incidentally, Ms Ardern's baby was born on what would have been Ms Bhutto's birthday. M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad When Ms Bhutto gave birth to a baby girl in January 1990, a military-funded right-wing alliance was tightening its siege of her government. So she never publicly declared her pregnancy and did not proceed with maternity leave. In fact, she had a quick Caesarian section performed by her gynaecologist and returned to work soon afterwards. Months later, her government was sacked by a president who then had discretionary powers to send an elected government home. Her other two children were born in similar conditions - in secrecy and through Caesarian section - establishing her as a woman who could handle maternity while simultaneously fighting a fierce battle for democracy.

May vows 'smooth' Brexit as bill passes,"This video can not be played Liam Fox tells Laura Kuenssberg rebels have not changed Brexit stance Theresa May has welcomed the passing of the Brexit bill through Parliament as ""a crucial step"" in delivering a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"". Peers accepted the amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sent to them from the House of Commons, meaning the bill now goes for Royal Assent, becoming law. The vote passed 319 to 303 after would-be Tory rebel MPs were given assurances they would have a meaningful say. The PM said more detail on the UK-EU's future relationship will be given soon. Mrs May said: ""Today's votes show people in the UK, and to the EU, that the elected representatives in this country are getting on with the job, and delivering on the will of the British people."" ""Over the next few weeks we will publish more details of our proposed future relationship with the EU in a White Paper, and will bring the Trade and Customs Bills back to the House of Commons. ""But today has been an important step in delivering the Brexit people voted for, a Brexit that gives Britain a brighter future, a Britain in control of its money, laws, and borders."" Who really backed down over Brexit vote? Can Theresa May 'take back control'? Brexit: All you need to know The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 and negotiations have been taking place over the terms of its departure. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky News Mrs May would now attend a summit of EU leaders next week ""with full strength, with the ability to say the legislation to leave the EU, under EU law and UK law, is now fully in place"". Before the Commons vote, Dominic Grieve, leader of the would-be rebels - who wanted to ensure MPs had the power to stop the UK leaving without a deal - said the ""sovereignty of Parliament"" had been acknowledged. Both sides have claimed victory with Stephen Hammond, a pro-EU MP who eventually sided with the government, suggesting ministers had agreed to give Parliament a ""real say"" on top of other concessions. International trade secretary Liam Fox said nothing had really changed and the option of a no-deal Brexit had been left firmly on the table. He said the government had ""to be able to hold out in our negotiations the prospect of no deal"" otherwise the EU would get the upper hand. On Wednesday evening, following the Commons vote, Leader of the Lords Baroness Evans of Bowes Park said the EU (Withdrawal) Bill had been ""debated at length"" and was very different as a result of amendments tabled by the Lords. Peers approved the government's proposal without a vote. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch. It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to. And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM. The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts. Read more from Laura This video can not be played MPs vote by 319 to 303 to reject amendment to the Brexit bill The government has been at odds with the Lords in the long-running row over what happens if the UK cannot reach a deal with the EU, or if MPs reject whatever deal the government agrees with the EU. The Commons vote had been expected to be tight and the government eventually prevailed by a majority of 16. Six Tory MPs - Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen, Antoinette Sandbach and Phillip Lee - rebelled while four Labour MPs backed the government and six other Labour MPs abstained, as did Kelvin Hopkins, who sits as an independent after having the whip withdrawn. One Labour MP, Naz Shah, voted in a wheelchair after being released from hospital amid Labour claims that normal arrangements sparing unwell MPs from having to enter the chamber had been abandoned. Please upgrade your browser The debate centred on what happens in three Brexit scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal If Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached If 21 January passes with no deal being struck. Under these circumstances, the government has said, a minister will make a statement in Parliament, setting out the proposed next steps. MPs will then vote on this statement. The government says this vote should be ""on neutral terms"", with MPs simply noting what has been said. But an amendment backed by the Lords on Monday went further, saying MPs should have to ""approve"" the minister's statement. The Department for Exiting the European Union has now conceded that it will be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide the matter at the time. Speaking in the Commons, Dominic Grieve said the issue of the meaningful vote was about giving ""assurances to the House and many, many people in the country who are worried about this process and how it will end"". The government statement that Mr Grieve has accepted Mr Grieve said he had insisted on a key paragraph in the government statement accepting ""it is open to MPs to table motions and debate matters of concern and that, as is the convention, parliamentary time will be provided for this"". Another potential rebel Nicky Morgan said she did not wish to see Mrs May ""destabilised or undermined"" ahead of the EU summit but warned of further battles to come over the UK's trade and customs arrangements with the EU.

'Simple' test for EU citizens in Brexit UK,"EU citizens will have to answer three ""simple"" questions online if they want to continue living in the UK after Brexit, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the government's ""default"" position would be to grant, not refuse, settled status. People will be asked to prove their ID, whether they have criminal convictions and whether they live in the UK. Their answers will be checked against government databases and a decision given ""very quickly"", said Mr Javid. The scheme,externalwill operate online and via a smartphone app, Mr Javid said, and would be ""as simple as people can reasonably expect"", with most decisions turned around within two weeks or sooner. What now for EU citizens in the UK? Brexit: All you need to know May to fight post-Brexit residency move Speaking to a House of Lords committee, Mr Javid said there would have to be ""a very good reason"" why an application would be refused. The Home Office said the criminal record checks would be about ""serious and persistent criminality, not parking fines"". The Â£170m scheme will be compulsory for all EU citizens living in the UK - the government expects a total of 3.5 million applications. EU citizens and family members who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for ""settled status"", meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely. Those who have arrived by December 31, 2020, but do not have five years' residence, can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status. The scheme also includes citizens of Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Applications will cost Â£65 for adults and Â£32.50 for children and be free for EU nationals who already have residency or indefinite leave to remain. Applicants will be asked to provide their biographical information, declare whether they have any criminal records, and upload a facial photograph. The process requires verification of the applicant's identity and nationality using a passport, ID card or other valid document, which can be done using a smartphone app or through secure post. The government hopes to start trials within a few weeks, with people allowed to start registering in the autumn. Mr Javid told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee he wanted it to be fully operational by the ""start of next year"", adding that he wanted to avoid a ""surge"" of applicants when the UK leaves the EU in March. The scheme would run for at least two years after Brexit day, probably to around June 2021, said the home secretary. Applicants without smartphones or computers will be able to fill in their application online at libraries and special contact centres Those without access to computers, or who are unable to use them, will be given assistance and may be visited at home by immigration officials Help with translation will also be offered People from the Republic of Ireland will not need to apply for settled status but can do so if they wish to Those with pre-settled status will be able to obtain settled status without additional charge People who use Apple devices may have to send their passports in to verify their ID The hope is that most applicants will not have to provide supporting documents because their answers will be checked against HM Revenue and Customs and other government databases. Applicants with Android phones will be able to download an app which can read the chip in their passport to verify their identity - and they will be able to take a ""selfie"" that can be checked against Home Office records, said Mr Javid. But he said there was an ""an issue at the moment"" with Apple device users, who will not be able to make use of this app, and instead will have to send in their passport to prove their identity. The home secretary said he had raised the issue with Apple on a recent visit to Silicon Valley and the company was ""looking at it actively"". Analysis by BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw What the Home Office is embarking on is a hugely complex project within a tight timescale. When challenged about the potential for it go wrong, officials point to the Passport Office as an example of a service successfully processing millions of cases every year. But unlike the biometric passport system, the EU registration scheme is being built from scratch. For hundreds of thousands of EU nationals, who have a straightforward and legitimate employment history in Britain and are comfortable using digital technology, their applications may well be resolved ""within days"", the time officials rather ambitiously claim cases will take. But for claimants hoping to bring in relatives, people unfamiliar with computers and those with a more sketchy background in Britain, perhaps involving some cash-in-hand work, the process may be a hurdle they'll struggle with - or avoid altogether.

Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said ""far more"" answers were needed from the government ""about what happens to those who aren't registered by June 2021 through no fault of their own, such as children"". ""At the moment it appears that if children aren't registered within the next three years then they will lose their legal rights even though they may have been here all their lives."" SNP home affairs spokeswoman Jo Cherry, speaking in the Commons, said: ""There are potentially significant numbers of people who could fall through the cracks here. ""If just 5% of the estimated three million EU citizens living in the UK don't register by the deadline there would be a population of nearly 200,000 left without status."" Former Labour minister Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, asked ministers if the scheme would still stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""We have confidence that there will be a deal."" Sajid Javid: Lessons have been learned from Windrush scandal Sajid Javid promised there would be no repeat of the Windrush scandal - which saw people who had lived in the UK for decades threatened with deportation because they did not have the right paperwork - for EU migrants, adding ""lessons had been learned"". The new ""settled status"" scheme would establish the right of EU migrants to remain in the UK, unlike in the case of Windrush families where there was only an assumption they had a right to stay, without any documentary proof, he told the committee. The home secretary accused EU nations, such as France and Spain, of failing to match the UK's progress on plans for expats after Brexit. There are about 900,000 UK citizens in the EU, according to ONS figures. Both sides of the Brexit negotiations have resolved to secure the status of expats by the time the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. But any deal they reach will have to be ratified by the European Parliament and agreed to by member states. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then the status of British citizens living in the EU member states is less certain. The UK would expect member states to allow Britons living in the EU the same rights as it plans to grant EU citizens in the UK but it would be down to individual countries to decide what to do.

Mayor backs legal challenge,"The Mayor of London announced he would join a legal action against Heathrow expansion if Parliament approves current plans The Mayor of London will join a legal challenge against Heathrow's third runway if it is approved by Parliament. Four councils and Greenpeace announcedthey would seek a judicial review if MPs gave the go-ahead to the plans on 25 June. ""I will do what I can to stop these poor plans,"" said Sadiq Khan, during Mayor's Question Time. Pro-expansion group Back Heathrow said local residents supported the plans and were aware of issues surrounding them. Parmjit Dhanda, Back Heathrow's executive director, said: ""Residents are set to benefit with 77,000 new local jobs, and they have consistently showed in independent polls that they support expansion. ""As people who live close to the airport they are aware of air quality issues, and aware of how new aircraft are getting cleaner and quieter all of the time."" The plans that will see a school and a local trading estate demolished, as well as homes in Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson. Earlier this monthcabinet ministers approved plans for Heathrow expansionbefore a Parliamentary vote. The Mayor vowed to ensure MPs were briefed ""to inform Monday's debate and vote"". He made the announcement as trade ministerGreg Hands resigned his cabinet positionin protest against the expansion. Hillingdon, Richmond, Wandsworth, and Windsor and Maidenhead Councils have committed to challenging the decision if approved. Under Mr Kahn, Transport for London has spent Â£320,000 providing technical support to the four councils. Heathrow wants to open a third runway by the middle of the next decade Mr Khan ran for Mayor of London on a manifesto supporting expanding Gatwick Airport instead of Heathrow. He said: ""While I believe in a better Heathrow, I do not believe a bigger Heathrow is the right answer for London and I remain committed to opposing such a short-sighted decision. ""This will be a critical moment, and for the sake of Londoners affected by poor air quality, disruption from noise and the costs needed to improve transport connections I will do what I can to stop these poor plans.""

Chequered history of expansion,"London Airport at Heathrow began commercial operations in 1946 ""It's like deja vu, all over again,"" baseball coach Yogi Berra once famously said. And you'd be forgiven for thinking the same about UK airport expansion. We always seem to have been here before. Ever since Gatwick and Heathrow airports opened for business in the Thirties and Forties, arguments have raged over how best to cater for Britain's burgeoning demand for air travel. The debates seem endless and progress has been bedevilled by politics. Recent history is littered with inquiries, commissions, consultations, studies and reports resulting in very little, but costing taxpayers millions. Here's a reminder of UK aviation's chequered history. In 1965, London Airport (later named Heathrow) looked a lot different than it does today Lord Justice Roskill's Commission recommended Cublington, Buckinghamshire, as the location for a third London Airport The Wilson government sets up the Roskill Commission to look into the pros, cons and costs of a third London airport. Two years and many hundreds of pages later, the Commission recommends Cublington in rural Buckinghamshire as the best location for a new airport. The burghers of Bucks are not best pleased: beacons burn on hilltops and church bells peal across the county in protest. Ironically, Roskill dismisses Stansted as a location. In 1969, BOAC boss Keith Granville holds up a model of the new Boeing 747. But where are the new runways? The recommendation is roundly dismissed by the new Heath government, which instead plumps for another Roskill option, Maplin Sands, Foulness - mudflats in the Thames Estuary near Southend-on-Sea, Essex. The idea was to build on the reclaimed land, but it was the most expensive of Roskill's four recommendations. The Maplin Sands idea slides into the sea. The previous year's embargo by Arab oil producers - known as the 1973 oil crisis - sends shockwaves through the global economy and fuel costs rocketing. The need to reduce costs becomes a priority. Good news for wading birds; bad news for ousted prime minister Ted Heath. Meanwhile, France opens its shiny new Charles-de-Gaulle four-runway airport near Paris. Sacre bleu. In 1978, the Callaghan government admitted that Heathrow's capacity was ""restricted"" The Callaghan government's aviation white paper identifies Heathrow capacity as ""restricted"",  and the following year the incoming Thatcher government decides against building a new international airport, despite acknowledging that ""Heathrow capacity is virtually exhaustedâ¦"" Instead, it envisages developing regional airports and expanding Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted ""as the traffic develops"". Heathrow Terminal 4 opens in 1986. The government commissions a new study into airports called the Runway Capacity in the South East Study. Three long years later it concludes that expanding Heathrow ""would afford the greatest benefits"" and British Airways backs the idea of an extra runway. No extra runway materialises. Secretary of State for Transport Brian Mawhinney rejects proposed new runways for Gatwick and Heathrow but says the government will explore how to squeeze more capacity out of the existing runways. Tony Blair enters Downing Street in 1997: time for a new aviation policy New Blair government, new aviation policy. A Transport White Paper says the government will ""prepare a UK airports policy looking some 30 years ahead"". This inevitably entails another time-consuming inquiry - the South East of England Regional Air Services Study - exploring how increasing demand for air travel will affect airport capacity. The Department for Transport begins a three-year consultation on The Future of Aviation. This results in the government's Future of Air Transport White Paper which recommends a third runway at Heathrow - sound familiar? - greater use of Heathrow's existing two runways and possibly an extra three runways at Stansted. Oh, and the previous Tory government's aspiration to expand regional airports. As the UK chases its tail, Amsterdam's Schiphol airport opens its fifth runway. As Heathrow Terminal 5 opens in 2008, it seems we're better at building terminals than new runways ""Heathrow expansion plans unveiled"",externalthe BBC reports on 22 November 2007. Guess what? They include a third runway and a sixth terminal at Heathrow. With Terminal 5 due to open the following year, it seems we're better at building terminals than runways. Announcing the consultation, the government says any expansion would have to conform to noise and pollution limits - the perennial sticks with which to beat the developers. A new airport in the Thames Estuary has often featured in expansion proposals Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposes a new airport far out in the Thames Estuary at Shivering Sands, subsequently nicknamed Boris Island. Will it fare any better than the other Estuary proposals, normally rejected on cost and environmental grounds? Gordon Brown's Labour government backs a third runway at Heathrow, but this is opposed by the Conservatives, despite the fact that the first Thatcher government originally supported the idea. Politics intervenes once again as the new Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition government puts Gordon Brown out to grass. It immediately rules out new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted. Back to square one. David Cameron (left) and Nick Clegg form a coalition government in 2010 - aviation policy changes again What happens when there's a new government? A new consultation, this time called a ""scoping document"" on how to develop a ""sustainable framework for UK aviation"". Meanwhile, Heathrow is full to bursting, operating at 99.2% capacity. Frankfurt airport opens its fourth runway. The government launches yet another consultation on the ""draft aviation policy framework"", and sets up the Airports Commission chaired by economist Sir Howard Davies. The Commission is tasked with assessing what extra capacity UK airports will need and inevitably publishes consultation documents. It's like Groundhog Day. In 2013, Heathrow Airport proposed a four-runway solution to its capacity problems The Airports Commission shortlists three options to increase capacity, and we're back to the Gatwick and Heathrow new or extended runways idea. The next year, the Boris Island idea is sunk. Sir Howard publishes his final recommendations. Will the new Conservative government finally grasp the nettle and make a decision or, as history suggests, kick the can further down the road? As Yogi Berra had it: ""The future ain't what it used to be.""

In pics: Heathrow airport,"Following a three-year review, the Airports Commission has backed a third Heathrow runway, saying it will add Â£147bn in economic growth and 70,000 jobs by 2050. Here we share some images of the airport, whose expansion began after World War Two. An airfield was established on the site we now know as Heathrow Airport in 1929, but it was not until well into World War Two that development to increase its capability to handle larger transport aircraft began. By the end of the conflict, the government continued to develop the site for civil aviation. This picture of a wet runway was taken a week before it became Britain's main aerial gateway to the United States in 1946. The arrival and departure lounges at London Airport, (later to be renamed Heathrow) were brown, ex-military marquees, though the telephone and postbox mean it couldn't be mistaken for anywhere else except the UK. Lord Winster, Minister of Civil Aviation, was on hand in 1946 to mark the airport's handover from military to civil control. This was marked by the flight of the Lancastrian airliner Starlight (in background) to South America. Aboard that flight was British South American Airways hostess Mary Guthrie, who returned with a pair of pineapples. In the foreground is a York aircraft bound for South Africa, and behind it American airliners being refuelled for their return journey to the United States. The caption for this 1946 picture states that this scene depicts one of the world's busiest airports, something that is as true today as it was then. Last year was the airport's busiest, with planes carrying 73.4 million passengers. A year on from the end of WW2, London Airport traffic clerk Doreen Haines walked French children along the runway to catch their plane home. The jet age was just beginning when this de Havilland Comet 34-seater made the round trip to north Africa in 6 hours and 37 minutes in 1949. This image showed how the airport would look upon completion of the second stage of development in 1951. By the 1950s the airport was far removed from its days as a wartime airfield, with modern baggage sorting areas... And buffets, this one being in the Europa Building that was later renamed Terminal 2. Dignitaries and film stars were often pictured at the airport. Here Britain's Prime Minister Harold Macmillan greets US President Dwight Eisenhower in 1959. And The Beatles drew a large crowd on their return from Sweden in 1964. Singer Tom Jones was hemmed in by fans in 1970. French actress Brigitte Bardot made a more dignified entrance as she flew into London to attend the premiere of her latest film Shalako. Heathrow Terminal 1 was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in April 1969, at the time the largest airport terminal in Europe Like all major airports the smooth flow of passengers to and from the site is essential. This aerial photograph shows the car park and bus station in the 1970s. Here some of the 4,000 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) maintenance staff at Heathrow met to vote on strike action in 1971. BOAC aircraft stand alongside the terminal in 1972. Two years later the company was dissolved along with British European Airways (BEA) and the resulting merger formed British Airways. The airport was home to British Airways' Concorde, used here as a backdrop for a publicity photograph by the Avis car rental company who were showing off their fleet of new Rover cars. A car bomb alert in 1974 saw members of staff and police rushing to and from the scene. It was that year that the government introduced the Policing of Airports Act, and the deployment of the Army to the airport during a large anti-terrorist alert. Following its maiden flight in 1969, it was not until 1975 that the first public passenger flight of Concorde took place. Bad weather, industrial action or technical fault - whatever the reason, delayed departures lead to crowded departure lounges. Here passengers are seen in Terminal 3 during delays caused by industrial action taken by Canadian air traffic controllers. Terminal 4 was opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales on 1 April 1986. This aerial photograph from 2001 shows the two runways that operate on the site. Armoured personnel carriers were back at Heathrow in February 2003 after the UK was put on heightened alert after intelligence sources suggested that a terrorist attack could be more likely. In 2003 people gathered to record the last flight of Concorde. Another terminal was added, Terminal 5, in 2008 at a cost of more than Â£4bn. The government has said that it will give its official response to the commission in the autumn and it is estimated that, if given the go-ahead, any new runway would take more than a decade to build.

New Zealand's leader has baby girl,"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted a picture on Instagram of her with her new baby New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has given birth to her first child, a girl weighing 3.31kg (7.3lb). This makes her only the second elected leader in modern history to give birth while in office. Ms Ardern was admitted to a hospital in the city of Auckland early on Thursday morning, four days after her due date. The 37-year-old has passed on her duties to Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters while she takes six weeks of maternity leave. However, she said she would be consulted on significant issues and would continue to read cabinet papers during her time away. The baby was born at 16:45 (04:45 GMT). Ms Ardern later broke news of the birth on social media, saying she felt very lucky and thanking staff at the hospital.

Ms Ardern, who was elected in October, announced in January that she and her partner Clarke Gayford were expecting a baby. ""I am not the first woman to multitask,"" she had said earlier this year in an interview with Radio New Zealand. ""I am not the first woman to work and have a baby; there are many women who have done this before."" She is the youngest prime minister the country has had since 1856. In 1990, the late Benazir Bhutto gave birth to a daughter while serving as Pakistan's prime minister, a first for an elected world leader. Incidentally, Ms Ardern's baby was born on what would have been Ms Bhutto's birthday. M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad When Ms Bhutto gave birth to a baby girl in January 1990, a military-funded right-wing alliance was tightening its siege of her government. So she never publicly declared her pregnancy and did not proceed with maternity leave. In fact, she had a quick Caesarian section performed by her gynaecologist and returned to work soon afterwards. Months later, her government was sacked by a president who then had discretionary powers to send an elected government home. Her other two children were born in similar conditions - in secrecy and through Caesarian section - establishing her as a woman who could handle maternity while simultaneously fighting a fierce battle for democracy.

Mum's cupboard death 'left hole in lives',"Mary Isherwood's son Craig and her ex-husband Clive said they are still shocked at how the former policewoman died The family of a woman who died after getting trapped in an airing cupboard have said sitting through her inquest brought back painful memories. Elizabeth Isherwood, 60, was found dead at Plas Talgarth Country Club near Pennal, Gwynedd, a week after arriving. The ex-policewoman's naked body was found when workers noticed a hole in a plasterboard wall she had tried to break through. Acoroner recorded a conclusion of misadventureat a hearing this week. Mrs Isherwood's son Craig believes his mother got stuck when taking a wrong turn after using the en-suite bathroom at night. He said: ""She hadn't even unpacked as when they found her body a week later her clothes and case were still in the room untouched. ""We are all absolutely devastated to find out what happened. Mum was so sporty, fit, healthy, and loved playing golf. ""If anyone could have got out of that cupboard it would have been Mum. ""The inquest has brought it all back to us. It's been a tough nine months and losing her has left a huge hole in our lives."" On 23 September 2017, Mrs Isherwood went alone to the holiday complex in which she had a timeshare with ex-husband Clive. The couple, who met while in the police force, split almost 30 years ago but remained on good terms. Mr Isherwood said the couple had recently sold the time share but his ex-wife had been given vouchers for ""a final stay"". ""She would've usually gone with friends but nobody could make it during that week so she went alone,"" he said. ""We think she arrived there early on the Saturday, had gone for a swim and then gone back to the room after she'd checked in."" Mrs Isherwood quit the police force and moved to London where she began working for the Post Office Investigation Service. Her family believe she woke in the middle of the night to use the en-suite bathroom. It is thought Mrs Isherwood, of Wolverhampton, mistook the door to an airing cupboard for a bedroom door and entered without realising. When the door closed behind her, it is thought she tried to leave the cupboard but the handle fell off, trapping her inside. Ms Isherwood and her family had visited the resort for a number of years After breaking a pipe she was sprayed with water - leaving her drenched before hypothermia set in. The inquest was told that banging was heard at the complex, but other guests thought it was maintenance work. She was later found by workers who noticed a hole in the plasterboard leading to the bedroom where she had tried to break through the wall.

Too many firsts 'bad for universities',"Universities risk losing their credibility due to ""rocketing"" grade inflation, a think tank has said. According to Reform, the proportion of firsts awarded almost doubled between 1997-2009 and rose by 26% since 2010. Their report calls for national tests to set degree grade benchmarks meaning only the top 10% of students could be awarded firsts. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said universities needed to act to protect the value of degrees. Under Reform's proposals, universities would lose their ability to decide what their students should be awarded. University leaders have argued a standardised approach would threaten their independence. The centre-right think-tank Reform argues that more and more students are being awarded top grades. Its report says: Last year more than 40% of students at the University of Surrey graduated with a first class degree. Since 1995 the proportion of 2:1 degrees rose from 40% to 49% 75% of students achieve one of the top two classifications, compared with 47% in the mid-1990s In more than 50 universities the proportion of first class degrees has doubled since 2010 Universities currently make their own decisions about grades and the report suggested pressure placed on academics by senior managers could partly explain why more top degrees are being awarded. The report also said ""degree algorithms"" which translate the student's marks into their final grade classification were to blame. Under Reform's proposals final-year students would sit new, national assessments set by a ""designated assessment body"". The results from the assessments would determine how many students should be awarded a particular grade. The top 10% of students would receive a first, the next 40% a 2:1, and the 40% after that a 2:2. The bottom 10% would get a third. Report author Tom Richmond and former adviser to education secretary Michael Gove, said: ""Rocketing degree grade inflation is in no one's interest. ""Universities may think easier degrees are a way to attract students, but eventually they will lose currency and students will go elsewhere, even overseas. ""Restoring the currency of degrees would also mean better value for money for the Â£18 billion that universities receive each year in tuition fees,"" he added. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""Students across the country work hard for their results and they deserve  grading system that recognises their hard work. ""That is why this government has put an end to grade inflation in GCSEs and A-levels, and why it is time for universities to do the same.""

"'Simple' test for EU citizens in Brexit UKEU citizens will have to answer three questions to stay in the UK after Brexit, says Sajid Javid.","EU citizens will have to answer three ""simple"" questions online if they want to continue living in the UK after Brexit, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the government's ""default"" position would be to grant, not refuse, settled status. People will be asked to prove their ID, whether they have criminal convictions and whether they live in the UK. Their answers will be checked against government databases and a decision given ""very quickly"", said Mr Javid. The scheme,externalwill operate online and via a smartphone app, Mr Javid said, and would be ""as simple as people can reasonably expect"", with most decisions turned around within two weeks or sooner. What now for EU citizens in the UK? Brexit: All you need to know May to fight post-Brexit residency move Speaking to a House of Lords committee, Mr Javid said there would have to be ""a very good reason"" why an application would be refused. The Home Office said the criminal record checks would be about ""serious and persistent criminality, not parking fines"". The Â£170m scheme will be compulsory for all EU citizens living in the UK - the government expects a total of 3.5 million applications. EU citizens and family members who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for ""settled status"", meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely. Those who have arrived by December 31, 2020, but do not have five years' residence, can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status. The scheme also includes citizens of Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Applications will cost Â£65 for adults and Â£32.50 for children and be free for EU nationals who already have residency or indefinite leave to remain. Applicants will be asked to provide their biographical information, declare whether they have any criminal records, and upload a facial photograph. The process requires verification of the applicant's identity and nationality using a passport, ID card or other valid document, which can be done using a smartphone app or through secure post. The government hopes to start trials within a few weeks, with people allowed to start registering in the autumn. Mr Javid told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee he wanted it to be fully operational by the ""start of next year"", adding that he wanted to avoid a ""surge"" of applicants when the UK leaves the EU in March. The scheme would run for at least two years after Brexit day, probably to around June 2021, said the home secretary. Applicants without smartphones or computers will be able to fill in their application online at libraries and special contact centres Those without access to computers, or who are unable to use them, will be given assistance and may be visited at home by immigration officials Help with translation will also be offered People from the Republic of Ireland will not need to apply for settled status but can do so if they wish to Those with pre-settled status will be able to obtain settled status without additional charge People who use Apple devices may have to send their passports in to verify their ID The hope is that most applicants will not have to provide supporting documents because their answers will be checked against HM Revenue and Customs and other government databases. Applicants with Android phones will be able to download an app which can read the chip in their passport to verify their identity - and they will be able to take a ""selfie"" that can be checked against Home Office records, said Mr Javid. But he said there was an ""an issue at the moment"" with Apple device users, who will not be able to make use of this app, and instead will have to send in their passport to prove their identity. The home secretary said he had raised the issue with Apple on a recent visit to Silicon Valley and the company was ""looking at it actively"". Analysis by BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw What the Home Office is embarking on is a hugely complex project within a tight timescale. When challenged about the potential for it go wrong, officials point to the Passport Office as an example of a service successfully processing millions of cases every year. But unlike the biometric passport system, the EU registration scheme is being built from scratch. For hundreds of thousands of EU nationals, who have a straightforward and legitimate employment history in Britain and are comfortable using digital technology, their applications may well be resolved ""within days"", the time officials rather ambitiously claim cases will take. But for claimants hoping to bring in relatives, people unfamiliar with computers and those with a more sketchy background in Britain, perhaps involving some cash-in-hand work, the process may be a hurdle they'll struggle with - or avoid altogether.

""At the moment it appears that if children aren't registered within the next three years then they will lose their legal rights even though they may have been here all their lives."" SNP home affairs spokeswoman Jo Cherry, speaking in the Commons, said: ""There are potentially significant numbers of people who could fall through the cracks here. ""If just 5% of the estimated three million EU citizens living in the UK don't register by the deadline there would be a population of nearly 200,000 left without status."" Former Labour minister Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, asked ministers if the scheme would still stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""We have confidence that there will be a deal."" Sajid Javid: Lessons have been learned from Windrush scandal Sajid Javid promised there would be no repeat of the Windrush scandal - which saw people who had lived in the UK for decades threatened with deportation because they did not have the right paperwork - for EU migrants, adding ""lessons had been learned"". The new ""settled status"" scheme would establish the right of EU migrants to remain in the UK, unlike in the case of Windrush families where there was only an assumption they had a right to stay, without any documentary proof, he told the committee. The home secretary accused EU nations, such as France and Spain, of failing to match the UK's progress on plans for expats after Brexit. There are about 900,000 UK citizens in the EU, according to ONS figures. Both sides of the Brexit negotiations have resolved to secure the status of expats by the time the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. But any deal they reach will have to be ratified by the European Parliament and agreed to by member states. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then the status of British citizens living in the EU member states is less certain. The UK would expect member states to allow Britons living in the EU the same rights as it plans to grant EU citizens in the UK but it would be down to individual countries to decide what to do.

The new ""settled status"" scheme would establish the right of EU migrants to remain in the UK, unlike in the case of Windrush families where there was only an assumption they had a right to stay, without any documentary proof, he told the committee. The home secretary accused EU nations, such as France and Spain, of failing to match the UK's progress on plans for expats after Brexit. There are about 900,000 UK citizens in the EU, according to ONS figures. Both sides of the Brexit negotiations have resolved to secure the status of expats by the time the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. But any deal they reach will have to be ratified by the European Parliament and agreed to by member states. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then the status of British citizens living in the EU member states is less certain. The UK would expect member states to allow Britons living in the EU the same rights as it plans to grant EU citizens in the UK but it would be down to individual countries to decide what to do.

Angry commuters 'kick down gates',"Police were spotted at Bedford railway station and were brought in to give passengers ""reassurance"" Angry commuters have been ""kicking at gates"" at a station after signalling problems caused delays to an already troubled line. Disruption on East Midlands and Thameslink trains during rush-hour was due to a six-mile signalling failure at Luton. The delays in and out of London come after four weeks of disruptioncaused by a new timetable. Network Rail has apologised to passengers who experienced delays. Thameslink said its trains returned to normal at about 15:55 BST. Extra patrols were also brought in by British Transport Police (BTP) for ""passenger reassurance"", they said. At St Albans City station, witnesses reported an ""absolute fiasco"", with ""platforms crammed"", ""barriers closed"" and ""angry passengers kicking down gates"". Allow Twitter content?

Dr Peter Saunders said that a gate on platform four had been damaged by ""people forcing themselves through"". ""All gates [were] then locked and people diverted to [the] platform one entrance,"" he said. ""One guy tried to climb over then started kicking [the] gate as [a] staff member yelled at him."" Commuters reported hundreds of angry passengers outside the barriers at St Albans City station due to cancelled trains and crammed platforms Another commuter, Natalie, said: ""Absolute chaos at St Albans and no communication. ""[Thameslink Rail] how do you continuously get away with it? Absolute shambles of an organisation."" Thameslink said that ""for passenger safety we closed the gates for short periods to manage the numbers of people on the platform"" and ""passenger announcements explained this"". It has also denied its staff were ""abusive"" or ""yelling"", and said they gave passengers information as soon as it was available. ""A few passengers briefly tried to push gates but stopped when our staff explained the situation,"" said a spokesman. ""Network Rail have now fixed the signalling fault."" Commuters at Harpenden station witnessed a train arrive and pull up, but without the doors opening. Emily Ketchin said there could have been a ""very serious accident as people stepped towards the train"" and Charlotte Haklett said ""the staff have no idea what's going on. Packed platform, utterly dangerous"". Commuters at Harpenden railway station there were crowded scenes as there were no ""trains for hours"" Emily Perry, who was travelling from Bedford into London, said: ""It is utterly ridiculous with all the train delays that Thameslink are satisfied with cramming more people in and putting their safety at risk that we are paying the privilege for! ""This has to stop and common sense has to be given."" Two-year-old emails 'predicted rail chaos' New boss for troubled GTR rail firm Rail firm boss delayed by own trains Vicky Chadwick, a commuter from Bedford, described the current situation as ""absolutely disgraceful"". ""This situation is impacting lives. Our time with our families is being impacted and I'm seriously considering whether I can continue working in London,"" she said. Passengers said trains were ""crammed"" from Bedford into London Gates were closed at St Albans City station for ""passenger safety"" Commuter Neal Cannell said: ""If it wasn't for the systemic daily disruption caused by the new timetable I could cope with unplanned issues such as those today. ""But when the service is already a shambles every day, additional delays are adding insult to injury.""

Saransk - the city that never expected to host,"Saransk, 430 miles east of Moscow, is one of the 11 World Cup host cities 2018 Fifa World Cup on the BBC Host:RussiaDates:14 June - 15 July Live:Coverage across BBC TV, BBC Radio and BBC Sport website with further coverage on Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. I was only in town half an hour before I saw him - a man taking his overweight cat for a walk, down the road and under a bridge on a makeshift lead. Nobody could really tell me what Saransk, the capital of Mordovia and about 430 miles east of Moscow, would be like, but this was an interesting start. Welcome to the city nobody expected to host the World Cup. Speaking to Russians in Moscow, the reaction was always the same: a scrunched nose, two raised eyebrows, and a sympathetic tone. ""Ah, so you're going to Saranskâ¦"" But this week, this city of around 300,000 people has, in the words of one of the so many brilliant local volunteers, ""gone from its usual grey dullness to one big party full of life"". Thirty thousand Peruvians will do that for you. Let's start at the beginning. It was a nightmare to get to the hotel on Saturday morning. For some reason, the local government thought it was a good idea to totally shut off the main roads on matchday as the hours ticked down until Peru played Denmark. The fans from Peru who got off my plane carrying inflatable llamas and wearing giant plastic ears were a column of noise as they walked straight through this one-baggage-belt airport in no time at all. There was a bus waiting, but things would soon slow down. By way of explanation, there was a shrug from a policeman whose oversized hat slipped as he gestured down the road. I was meant to understand that actually this is all quite normal. The next day, afterDenmark beat Peru 1-0,the roads were reopened. Metal-box buses clanked and chugged along as a souped-up hatchback with one lime-green tyre rim raced past, blaring techno music as it went. Maybe the closures did make sense. A statue of Lenin stands by the entrance to Pushkin Park - named after Russia's greatest writer I walked down Communist Street, down Lenin Avenue, crossed Proletarian Road and through the Fifa Fan Fest on Soviet Square. Not far from there, Lyubov, Sasha and Tatyana were sitting on a bench in Pushkin Park watching a new world walking by. There were Colombia shirts, Denmark, a few Japanese. Many Peruvians had stayed and were dancing to music they asked a kebab hut to play through its loudspeakers. ""How can you not enjoy it? It's one big party,"" Sasha said. ""I'm really happy that our town was chosen and we've seen all this. And it's brought improvements - the city has changed a lot in the past five years I would say, it's cleaner now and they've made it more attractive."" Delivered with two big thumbs up. You can see the investment in the new stadium, the new university building facade, the new shopping centre across from that. But you don't have to walk far away from the centre to reach Saransk's more ramshackle outskirts. Traditional wooden houses near Saransk city centre. Some of these have been demolished to make way for World Cup infrastructure. Traditional wooden houses generally inhabited by elderly men and women remain where, in other parts of the city - like in the new hotel complex by the stadium, they have been destroyed to make way for the new. At one end of the street is the four-star hotel where the Colombia team stayed. Five young boys are hanging around, debating how long they might have to wait there to get a glimpse. One of the many security guards eventually saunters past in the heat and says without stopping: ""You can't sit on this wall."" Artur, 15, is possibly the most excited in this group. He says: ""Even people in Russia haven't heard of Saransk. You tell people and they say: 'Where?' ""It's brilliant that all this is happening - so cool."" Anton, Danil, Artur and Faridyn were all optimistic about Saransk's future prospects Maybe that is why the city is so keen to impress. Every fan I spoke to here had the same story: welcoming, beautiful weather, great atmosphere. Yes, the prices have been hiked up, but veterans of past tournaments had seen all that before. I spoke to Viktor, one of five men working in a team of gardeners, a coin collector with hands like bark. ""It's a small place, Saransk. Everyone was surprised when they said the World Cup would be coming,"" he said. ""Now people will know we are here."" I didn't ask Viktor about politics, about who he voted for - but in March's presidential elections Vladimir Putin attracted more than 85% of the votes here, compared to 76% nationally. Later, Oleg grabbed me in the street and was almost breathless in his excitement when I told him I was from England. The night before Colombia played Japan, we walked to Millennium Square together, where women in local Mordovian dress were singing traditional, pleasingly atonal, folk songs. Some in the crowd danced with Colombians - that was the real centre of attention. On a warm evening, with swifts flying overhead and shashlik smoke drifting across the square, a Colombian television presenter addressed her audience back home - a glimpse of this unknown place sent out across the world. On the way back home later that night, I passed a Colombian fan who had brought his white husky with him, all the way from Medellin. ""Yeah, you have to say they have done a really good job and it's great to be here,"" he said. ""First time in Russia, lovely people. Very curious about us."" Speaking of the curious, down a side street soon after that I saw yet another overweight cat, this time carried in a woman's arms. Just what is it about this place? But for all the sense of happiness the World Cup has brought to Saransk there is also the question - a now familiar World Cup question - of legacy. What will happen to all of this once the party ends? The stadium is brand new, opened this year. Next season it will welcome Mordovia Saransk, a team who two years ago were in the third tier and last year struggled to pay their players. The capacity will be reduced from 45,000 down to about 30,000. Saransk will host two more World Cup games - Iran v Portugal on 25 June and Panama v Tunisia three days later Saransk's old stadium, over the river and down the road, was this week being used as a practice venue for the presentation ceremonies that take place before the games here. What will happen to that? What about the entirely new district built up around the stadium. It used to be a boggy wasteland. What will it be next? Will people move here? Time will tell. Mordovia president Vladimir Volkov said on Friday before I got here: ""We will do all we can to ensure that the World Cup legacy will continue to serve the people."" Artur and his friends are only thinking about the future positively. How will you feel in a few weeks' time I ask, once Cristiano Ronaldo has been and gone? ""We'll still be in high spirits,"" says Faridyn, the eldest of the group at 16, almost 17. ""We're happy now, and we'll still be happy. Now people will know more about Saransk and this is really good."" A curious place then, happy on the surface as it lives through maybe the biggest week in its history.

UK borrowing falls more than expected,"Public sector borrowing fell to Â£5bn in May, down Â£2bn from a year earlier, official figures show. The fall was bigger than expected and brings borrowing for the financial year to date to Â£11.8bn, Â£4.1bn less than in the same period in 2017. At the same time, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revised down its figure for government borrowing in 2017-18 to Â£39.5bn. The total was the lowest annual level of borrowing in 11 years. The figures come as Chancellor Philip Hammond prepares to reaffirm his promise to reduce public debt, despite Prime Minister Theresa May's promise of increased spending on the NHS. In a speech later on Thursday,Mr Hammond will say that taxes must rise, although increases will be implemented in a ""fair and balanced way"". August interest rate rise moves step closer Public sector net debt, excluding public sector banks, was Â£1,781.4bn at the end of last month, equivalent to 85% of GDP, the ONS said. That is Â£44.7bn higher than a year earlier, but 0.4 percentage points lower as a percentage of GDP. As the chancellor grapples with how to raise Â£20bn of extra spending on the NHS in England by 2023, today's public finance figures do provide some help. Borrowing is lower than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March, giving Philip Hammond a little more ""wriggle room"" whilst still hitting his target of reducing the deficit - the amount of money the government spends above the amount it gains in revenues from taxes and investment. The chancellor knows that as the public finances begin to look healthier, pressure will grow to open the borrowing taps - thereby enabling more spending on not just health, but the police and defence, for example. But that misunderstands Mr Hammond's economic DNA. At Â£1.8tn, or 85% of the value of the total UK economy, the chancellor believes Britain's debts are still too high. Yes, they might be falling as a proportion of the overall economy, but they are still double the levels before the financial crisis. Levels so high that Britain remains exposed to risks in the event of another significant economic downturn, Mr Hammond believes. If that were to happen - and the first few months of the year have been economically weaker than many expected - then the better state of the public finances announced today could soon sour. ""May's public finances figures not only confirmed that the new fiscal year got off to a good start, but revealed that borrowing in 2017-18 was also a little lower than previously thought,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics. ""It's early days yet, but if this is sustained, borrowing would undershoot the [Office for Budget Responsibility's] 2018-19 forecast by Â£9bn or so over the year as a whole. ""What's more, if the economy holds up as we expect, borrowing is likely to undershoot the OBR's forecast by a more significant margin in subsequent years. ""This would allow the chancellor to deliver the recently promised increase in health spending over the next five years while still meeting his fiscal target."" In a statement, the OBR said: ""Spending data can be volatile from month to month and prone to revision, so it is still too early in the financial year to draw meaningful conclusions about the public finances for the year as a whole.""

US migrant battle moves to Congress,"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""You're going to have a lot of very happy people"" A Republican effort to pass an immigration law is in disarray amid a political battle over migrant children separated from their parents. A compromise bill drafted by moderate and conservative Republicans lacks any votes from Democratic lawmakers and even some Republicans. A vote on the bill, which would fund a border wall while reducing legal migration, has been delayed to Friday. The House rejected a more hardline conservative measure on Thursday. Republicans joined Democrats to vote by 193-231 to scupper the more hawkish bill. President Donald Trump earlier in the day blamed Democrats for the ongoing impasse. This video can not be played US youth shelter worker quit after being ordered to separate siblings At a White House cabinet meeting, he pledged to sign an immigration reform bill if Congress can pass it. ""The lawmakers have to sit down and they have to do something because our country cannot continue to run like this,"" Mr Trump said. The congressional deadlock comes a day after the Republican president moved to roll back his policy of migrant family separations amid outcry over the ""zero tolerance"" policy. He issued an executive order calling for the children to be kept with their parents, who are being detained on charges of crossing the border illegally. But the fate of hundreds of children already separated by the policy is unclear.

It was dead earlier this month, after an insurgent effort to force a vote on a bipartisan bill in the House failed. It was dead this week, despite outcry over the border crisis caused by the Trump administration's family separation policy. It was dead on Thursday, as a hardline bill went down to defeat in the House. Its prospects don't look any better for Friday, when the Republican leadership's ""compromise"" proposal probably will meet the same fate. At some point, this Congress has to chisel the headstone and throw flowers on immigration reform's grave. There simply isn't the will - or the willingness to compromise - required to pass legislation before the end of the year. Donald Trump blames Senate rules that he says give the minority Democrats too much power. Democrats blame the president's fixation on a border wall and sweeping changes to legal immigration programmes. Moderate Republicans blame far-right conservatives, and vice versa. Congress has been struggling with immigration reform for decades. With mid-term elections looming, politicians will take the issue to the campaign trail - but it's a struggle with no end in sight. The House bill still under consideration is a compromise between conservatives and moderate Republicans. It includes funding for a border wall, along with a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children.

Jeremy Hunt said it was still too difficult for whistleblowers to raise concerns about mistakes being made.

An inquiry,externalhas found more than 450 patients died after doctors gave them ""dangerous"" amounts of painkillers.

""We make it much too hard for doctors and nurses to do that - they are worried that there will be litigation, they will go up in front of the GMC or NMC, the reputation of their unit - in some places they are worried they might get fired, so we do have to tackle that blame culture and turn that into a learning culture.""

"Reporter sexually harassed at World CupAfter being groped on air by a football fan, a Colombian reporter speaks out about being harassed.Europe","""This one went too far,"" Gonzalez Theran said about the on-air groping incident A female reporter groped live on air at the World Cup has spoken out about harassment by sports fans. Colombian correspondent Julieth Gonzalez Theran was working for DW Espanol in Moscow when a man grabbed her breast and kissed her cheek. She continued her report without interruption but has since addressed the incident online. ""We do not deserve this treatment,"" Gonzalez Theran said. ""We are equally valuable and professional."" She told her employer, Deutsche Welle, she had been on the scene for two hours preparing for the broadcast. ""When we went live, this fan took advantage of the situation,"" she said. ""But afterwards, when I checked to see if he was still there, he was gone."" The incident happened last week in the city of Saransk ahead of the Russia-Saudi Arabia game. DW posted the footage on social media, calling it an ""attack"" and ""blatant harassment"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many online commentators, however, downplayed the incident. One labelled the criticism as ""feminist hysteria"", and others suggested the kiss should be seen as a ""welcome"" or a ""compliment"". Gonzalez Theran continued to speak out about her treatment on Twitter, retweeting messages of support from her colleagues. ""This is not funny,"" DW presenter Cristina Cubas tweeted. ""It's not a kiss. It's a non-consenting attack."" On Wednesday, almost a week after the incident happened,DW published an article about the controversy,external, in which Germany's first female national league referee branded the behaviour ""unacceptable"". ""For me it is an isolated incident,"" Gonzalez Theran said. ""There are always fans that compliment you and behave respectfully. This one went too far."" Harassment of female reporters is not uncommon in sports reporting. In March, a group of 52Brazilian reporters launched a campaign showcasing incidents of being kissed and gropedby fans and athletes, which they called #DeixaElaTrabalhar - or ""Let her work"". This video can not be played Sports journalist Bibiana Bolson: 'They try to kiss us and to hug and to touch us' Last year, tennis playerMaxime Hamou was banned from the French Openafter forcibly kissing a female reporter during a live TV interview. ""If I hadn't been live on air, I would have punched him,"" the reporter, Maly Thomas, later said. Other women working at the World Cup have also been facing criticism or abuse off-camera- and particularly online. German football commentator Claudia Neumann has received extensive criticism on social media for her work, which her employer and colleagues have dismissed as sexist. In the UK, the BBC's Vicki Sparks faced similar online abuse when shemade history as the first female World Cup commentator on British televisionon Wednesday - but was widely well-received.

Angry commuters 'kick gates' after delays,"Police were spotted at Bedford railway station and were brought in to give passengers ""reassurance"" Angry commuters have been ""kicking at gates"" at a station after signalling problems caused delays to an already troubled line. Disruption on East Midlands and Thameslink trains during rush-hour was due to a six-mile signalling failure at Luton. The delays in and out of London come after four weeks of disruptioncaused by a new timetable. Network Rail has apologised to passengers who experienced delays. Thameslink said its trains returned to normal at about 15:55 BST. Extra patrols were also brought in by British Transport Police (BTP) for ""passenger reassurance"", they said. At St Albans City station, witnesses reported an ""absolute fiasco"", with ""platforms crammed"", ""barriers closed"" and ""angry passengers kicking down gates"". Allow Twitter content?

Dr Peter Saunders said that a gate on platform four had been damaged by ""people forcing themselves through"". ""All gates [were] then locked and people diverted to [the] platform one entrance,"" he said. ""One guy tried to climb over then started kicking [the] gate as [a] staff member yelled at him.""

Thameslink said that ""for passenger safety we closed the gates for short periods to manage the numbers of people on the platform"" and ""passenger announcements explained this"". It has also denied its staff were ""abusive"" or ""yelling"", and said they gave passengers information as soon as it was available. ""A few passengers briefly tried to push gates but stopped when our staff explained the situation,"" said a spokesman. ""Network Rail have now fixed the signalling fault.""

Hands resigns as minister over Heathrow,"Junior trade minister Greg Hands has resigned from the government to oppose expansion of Heathrow Airport. The vote on whether to build a third runway at the airport west of London is due to be held on Monday. Mr Hands, who represents the Chelsea and Fulham constituency in London, said he had pledged to oppose the new runway at the 2017 election. It had been thought that ministers with constituencies directly affected could have been allowed to miss the vote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The highest profile opponent of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who once pledged to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it happening. But Mr Johnson is scheduled to be out of the UK on Monday so will not be attending the vote in the House of Commons. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson suggested on Twitter that Mr Hands' resignation should prompt the prime minister to allow her MPs a free vote: ""It's not too late for her to change whipping arrangements. This would also allow Boris Johnson to re-enter the country."" Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the foreign secretary should quit too: Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Theresa May defended the foreign secretary's absence from a vote seen by some as crucial to the UK's post-Brexit international trade campaign, known as Global Britain. She said: ""The government is absolutely committed to increasing airport capacity at Heathrow. This is important, it is part of our future as Global Britain, and the ambitions we have as a trading nation for the future. ""The foreign secretary early next week will be what I would describe as the living embodiment of Global Britain. ""He will be out there actually showing the UK's continued presence around the world, and the work that the UK continues to do around the world, with our diplomacy working on so many of the issues and challenges that we face across the world today."" Labour is also divided on the controversial issue, with members of the party's leadership, such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell, opposed to it, but high profile trade union backers in favour. The party's MPs are being allowed to vote however they want to on the issue. The SNP are in favour of Heathrow expansion, with the Lib Dems opposed and with the government deciding to whip (order) Conservative MPs to vote in favour, it is widely expected that the expansion plan will get Commons backing. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Hands, who has held various ministerial roles and was chief secretary to the Treasury under David Cameron, had ""served the government with great ability and distinction over several years, and we thank him for all of his work"". Mr Hands will be replaced as a minister in the Department for International Trade by George Hollingbery, MP for Meon Valley. Meanwhile Mr Hands has tweeted that he cannot answer media calls about his resignation - because he is visiting a Romanian monastery: Allow Twitter content?

The debate on expanding Heathrow has been going on for nearly 20 years. The last Labour government backed the idea, and won a vote on it in 2009, but that plan was scrapped - and the idea of expansion put on hold for five years - by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition formed after the 2010 election. But the idea of expansion was resurrected and has been subsequently backed by the Conservatives. Ministers approved a draft national airports policy statement in October but Parliament has  to give its approval for detailed planning to begin. Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day. It will result in huge disruption to residents of nearby villages, such as Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson, with hundreds of homes likely to be knocked down. Robert Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, told the BBC the government was ""failing people and failing the environment as well"". Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who backs expanding Gatwick instead, suggested the idea of Heathrow as a national hub airport was outdated and the focus should be on improving regional capacity. And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who resigned his Richmond Park seat in 2016 over the issue and subsequently lost a by-election, said for many people ""this doesn't just look like a blank cheque being given by this government to a foreign-owned multinational, it looks like a whole book of cheques signed by our constituents"". This video can not be played Chair of Airports Commission, Sir Howard Davies told Today that Heathrow Airportâs expansion will succeed Heathrow's owners, which include Spanish infrastructure firm Ferrovial, say the airport is virtually full and a new runway would increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. The expansion is estimated to create about 60,000 new jobs and generate about Â£70bn in total economic benefits by the 2050s. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said it will provide a ""vital legacy"" for the British economy. Residents whose houses are knocked down will get compensation worth 125% of their value - as well as legal fees and stamp duty costs paid for - while Â£700m would be available to fund noise insulation measures for those who decide to stay. Mr Grayling has said a ban on night flights was an ""absolute requirement"" and non-negotiable while he said landing charges paid by airlines must stay at current levels. ""This runway cannot be built if it does not meet air quality rules,"" he added. Sir Howard Davies, whose 2015 review recommended a new runway as long as environmental and community impacts were addressed, said ""significant"" concessions had been made on reducing early morning flights and minimising the impact on residents on the proposed flight path.

"Woman traces 'silly' 1989 cancer nurseLiz Brown finds nurse Debbie, who helped to make the 14-year-old girl's cancer ""less painful"".Cambridgeshire","Liz Brown's nurse Debbie Bye (right), has been found after an appeal on social media A woman has tracked down the nurse who did ""silly things"" to make her cancer treatment as a teenager ""less painful"", after an appeal on social media. Liz Brown spent four months in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, in 1989 with a spinal tumour. Her nurse, Debbie Bye, ""realised I was struggling"" andgave her ""silly jobs"" which helped her cope, Ms Brown said. On Wednesday night an ""overwhelmed"" Mrs Bye got in touch and the pair, who were ""both in tears"", plan to meet up soon. Mrs Bye, 50, said that she ""felt really emotional"" after finding out about the appeal, after many of her friends sent a BBC article asking her, ""Is this you?"" Mrs Bye, who now lives in Derbyshire, said she had ""often wondered what happened to Lizzy"" More than2,000 people had also retweeted Ms Brown's appeal,externalto trace Mrs Bye and thank the nurse for what she had done. Thirty years ago Mrs Bye had nursed the 14-year-old teen through aggressive osteoblastoma. Realising she found being on a children's ward difficult, she would give the teenager jobs like delivering post to the adult patients and ""silly things like that to make it less painful than it could be"", Ms Brown said.

Mrs Bye was 21 in the photo of the pair and said that she kept a scrapbook of old pictures of her with patients, but had lost the one of her and Ms Brown. ""I enjoyed my job and did my job to the best I could, but didn't feel like I had made that much impact on someone that 30 years later they could remember my name - it's a bit overwhelming,"" she added. ""I just tried to make it home from home. We did bobbing apples and went on day trips. We even had nights where we took the kids to nurse's flats and just had pizza and watched videos.""

Liz Brown was not expected to live more than five years ""I didn't realise how important this was to me until now,"" she added.

"Ofsted chief backs school phones banAmanda Spielman also says she supports punishments such as lines, litter-picking and detention.","The chief inspector of Ofsted is backing head teachers who ban mobile phones to prevent bad behaviour. In a speech, Amanda Spielman is expected to blame technology for making ""low-level disruption"" more common and endorse tough behaviour policies. ""The place of mobile phones in the classroom seems to me dubious at best,"" she will say. Her speech comes afterCulture Secretary Matt Hancock also called on head teachers to ban phones. Ms Spielman is due to tell the audience at the Festival of Education at Wellington College that it was ""entirely appropriate"" for schools to use sanctions such as writing lines, detention or ""community service"" punishments such as picking up litter. Should phones be allowed in schools? 'Don't be afraid to take phones off teens' French MPs back school phone ban She will say: ""I fundamentally disagree with those who say that taking a tough stance on behaviour is unfair to children. ""Quite the opposite, there is nothing kind about letting a few pupils spoil school for everyone else."" Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman says the educational role of mobile phones is ""dubious"" Her speech says that the educational benefits of mobile phones are unproven, but they do distract pupils in class and make teachers' jobs harder. ""There's no doubt that technology has made the challenge of low-level disruption even worse, which is why I also support recent calls to back heads who have decided that the way to improve behaviour is to ban mobile phones in their schools,"" Ms Spielman will say. ""I'm not the target audience, but nevertheless I am yet to be convinced of the educational benefits of all-day access to Snapchat and the like."" This video can not be played James Reevell looks at the tricks technology companies use to keep you hooked on your phone Ms Spielman will say that she wants Ofsted to respond to the importance that parents attach to behaviour by giving it a prominent place in inspection reports. ""I want to see behaviour get the attention it deserves in our inspections, probably through a separate behaviour and attitudes judgement,"" she will say. Low-level disruption which gets in the way of pupils' learning will be taken as seriously as incidents such as bullying, she will pledge. The chief inspector's speech also says that Ofsted will examine whether schools are trying to conceal badly behaved students during inspections to get a better grade. ""I want to address once and for all, the constant rumours we hear about badly behaved children being hidden from inspectors, perhaps on conveniently timed school trips,"" she will say. Ofsted's research and analysis teams are devising a way to assess how often such incidents happen and how inspectors can respond. According to the Department for Education, 95% of schools now control the use of mobile phones in some way. Some schools insist that they are kept switched off and out of sight during the whole school day, others restrict their use to break time and some allow them to be used in lessons for specific educational activities. A Snapchat spokesman said parents and teachers should have regular conversations about the appropriate use of technology, including the company's app. He said: ""We don't recommend that young people use it all day while at school.""

Thousands mark summer solstice,"This video can not be played A police drone was used to film the summer solstice crowd at Stonehenge Thousands of people gathered at Stonehenge for the summer solstice, as the sun rose amid clear skies. About 9,500 people were at the Neolithic monument to greet the start of the longest day of the year, according to Wiltshire Police. The sun appeared behind the Heel Stone at 04:52 BST to cheering and applause from the crowd. The summer solstice is one of the rare occasions that English Heritage opens up the stones for public access. As with last year's event, Wiltshire Police confirmed it had stepped up security with armed police on patrol. Thousands turned up to watch the sunrise Many of those who attended wore colourful outfits Although thousands attended the solstice, the force said 3,500 fewer people came to watch the sunrise compared with 2017. Supt Dave Minty, Wiltshire Police's overnight commander, said behaviour at the stones was ""brilliant"", with no arrests made. ""The sunrise was amazing, and we don't see many of those,"" he added. ""People seem to have adapted really well to the heightened level of security and they've been really patient with it."" This video can not be played Mouth and foot artist Tom Yendell captures the sunrise at Stonehenge. English Heritage's director of Stonehenge, Kate Davies, said the solstice was one of the ""highlights of the year"". ""It's a great opportunity for friends and families to come together and mark the longest day of the year, as people have done for thousands of years,"" she said. ""There was a lovely, friendly atmosphere throughout, the sun shone, and dawn was met with loud cheers."" Some people practised yoga exercises at the circle On the summer solstice, the sun rises behind the Heel Stone, the ancient entrance to the stone circle, and sunlight is channelled into the centre of the monument. It is believed that solstices have been celebrated at Stonehenge for thousands of years. The site holds special significance for members of the Druid and Pagan community, who perform rituals and celebrations at the summer and winter solstices. Hundreds of people also enjoyed the solstice at the nearby Avebury stone circle, where Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard described it as a ""lovely family event"" with a ""positive spirit"".

BBC to stream Wimbledon tennis in 4K HDR,"Garbine Muguruza will defend her Wimbledon ladies' singles title at this year's event The Wimbledon Championships tennis tournament is to be streamed in 4K resolution and high dynamic range colour (HDR) to UK viewers by the BBC. It will follow a current trial in which World Cup football matches are being shown via iPlayer using the next-generation TV technologies. However, this time the BBC also plans to make select matches available in 4K - but not HDR - to Sky Q customers. One expert said the tech offered huge benefits but had not been glitch-free. ""The World Cup streams have suffered a few technical teething problems - stuttering and buffering with some devices,"" said John Archer, a TV reviewer for Forbes and Techradar. ""[There have also been] a few issues with adapting effectively to broadband speeds that are close to the BBC's 40Mbps and 20Mbps streaming quality 'tiers'. ""When the streams have worked well, though, the results have been spectacular."" The reaction on social media has also been largely positive, although some have reported problems.

""The trial has given us valuable feedback allowing us to improve our systems,"" said a BBC spokesman. Once again, the BBC intends to offer the trial on a ""first-come first-served"" basis, saying it will be limited to ""tens of thousands of people"" to help deal with the extra bandwidth required. Few, if any, people have found themselves blocked, however, from accessing the ultra-high definition World Cup games. A list of compatible TVs and set-top boxesis being maintained online. Although it is not mentioned yet, support for the PlayStation Pro was recently added, although it only screens the World Cup games in 4K and not HDR. The Sky Q coverage will be limited to the men's and ladies' singles semi-final and final matches and will be delivered via satellite rather than the internet. Users will be given the option to access the Ultra HD feed via a pop-up message. World Cup matches are already being screened in 4K HDR quality The term 4K refers to the fact that an image contains four times as many pixels as a 1080p high definition picture. This can reveal details that would otherwise be difficult to pick out. During Wimbledon, this could potentially make it easier to see whether close-call shots are in or out and help viewers recognise famous faces in the crowd. HDR takes advantage of the fact modern TVs can go brighter and/or darker than they used to, providing a greater dynamic range. It can help reveal detail in the shadows and prevent highlights from ""blowing out"". In addition, HDR adopts a ""wider colour space"", meaning millions more colours can be displayed if the screen used is classed as ""10-bit"" or above. At Wimbledon, late-day games - when shadows can creep across courts creating exposure problems if other parts are still bathed in sunlight - in particular should benefit from HDR's better handling of contrast. HDR should improve footage at times when there are both bright highlights and shadows on screen simultaneously For movies and drama-based TV shows, many experts have judged HDR to offer the greater benefit over 4K. But Mr Archer said he had found the opposite to be true during the World Cup tests, at least on larger screens. ""Detail and sharpness have been hugely superior to the HD broadcast streams, making the action feel more immediate and much less tiring to watch,"" he said. ""Being able to see more of the pitch via the 4K camera is also a great feature for serious football fans. ""The use of HDR has been quite subtle by comparison, but has still undoubtedly enhanced the sense of 'being there' that's so important when you're watching sport.""

""We make it much too hard for doctors and nurses to do that - they are worried that there will be litigation, they will go up in front of the GMC or NMC, the reputation of their unit - in some places they are worried they might get fired, so we do have to tackle that blame culture and turn that into a learning culture.""

MSF aid workers 'used local prostitutes',"This video can not be played Whistleblowers tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the behaviour was widespread Aid workers at charity Medecins Sans Frontieres used local prostitutes while working in Africa, whistleblowers have told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. Female former employees said the behaviour was widespread. One said a senior colleague said it was possible to barter medication in exchange for sex. The charity said it does not tolerate ""abuse, harassment or exploitation"". The use of prostitutes is banned by MSF under its strict code of conduct. The women spoke anonymously for fear of being blacklisted by foreign aid agencies, among which there can be a large crossover of staff. The charity employs thousands of health professionals and logistical staff, most hired locally The allegations were made against logistical staff, and not doctors or nurses, at MSF - one of the world's biggest foreign aid agencies, also known as Doctors Without Borders. One former employee, who worked out of the charity's London office, said she had seen a senior member of staff bring girls back to MSF accommodation while posted in Kenya.

""My colleague, who was staying in the same residence for a long time, felt that this was a regular occurrence,"" she said.

""I felt that, with some of the older guys, there was definitely an abuse of power. They'd been there for a long time and took advantage of their exalted status as a Western aid worker,"" she said. ""There's definitely a feeling that certain predatory men were seen as too big to fail. ""You would often see men who were older, middle-aged, partying with much younger local girls. It was sexualised."" Another female employee, who worked with HIV patients in central Africa, claimed the use of local sex workers was ""widespread"". ""There was an older colleague who actually moved a woman into the compound [where MSF staff were staying],"" she said. ""It was pretty obvious she was a prostitute but he called her his girlfriend and she would spend night after night with him. ""This kind of thing was so blatant. So blatant and widespread. ""I saw one of my colleagues, he was a much younger guy, go into the toilet with a local prostitute. ""I knew her to talk to as she also worked in one of the bars. She told me afterwards that they'd had sex and he'd paid her."" The whistleblower said she also felt sexually harassed by some of the men she worked with. ""[One colleague] really made my life miserable,"" she said. ""He really tortured me and brought prostitutes back in front of me. ""The worst bit came when I left for a few weeks and came back to my room and found used condoms that he told people he's deliberately left behind. I felt sick."" The woman said she had reported his behaviour to her boss in the field and had been offered mediation, but had also been told she would be fired if she did not sort things out with her colleague. The charity said it was ""sorry for any instances where people have been subjected to harassment, abuse or otherwise mistreated and/or felt that it was not adequately dealt with"". Vickie Hawkins, executive director of MSF UK, added: ""While we have reporting mechanisms in place where complaints can be made, we know we need to do more to ensure that they are known, trusted and used by the people who need them."" A third whistleblower, who the Victoria Derbyshire programme met at a location in Europe, said a senior colleague had claimed that it was possible to barter medication for sex. ""He said, 'Oh, it's so easy to barter medication with these easy girls in Liberia',"" the woman claimed. ""He was suggesting lots of the young girls who had lost their parents to the Ebola crisis would do anything sexual in exchange for medication."" She said he had bragged about it ""quite a lot"", in front of three or four people who had been working in Liberia themselves and to her directly. It has not been possible for the BBC to verify this allegation. MSF said it needed more information before it could investigate. The charity established treatment centres in Liberia following the Ebola crisis The whistleblower claimed on other occasions MSF workers had sexually harassed partners at other non-governmental organisations (NGOs). She said in one instance during a video call they ""kept telling [one woman] how sexy she was... asking her where her husband was"". ""She was really embarrassed and tried to move on to the topic at hand, but they persisted with this for about 15 minutes,"" she said. ""I think it's endemic and part of the institution,"" she said, of sexual harassment. ""There are some that just accept it. Then there's another area [of people] who report it, but nothing gets done."" The Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to eight women in total who used to work at MSF in various European offices and field offices in Africa. The charity's culture was described as ""toxic"". One woman, who worked in the Amsterdam office, said when she had been on a mission in Asia a boss had commented on the size of her breasts. She claimed she had raised this with a manager but nothing had been done so she had left. In February, following allegations that staff at the charity Oxfam hired prostitutes while working overseas, MSF admitted it had sacked 19 staff for sexual harassment in the past year. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has seen an internal report that showed the organisation had been investigating allegations of sexual discrimination and harassment by staff in 2016. The report said a third of female employees it had spoken to had been touched inappropriately at work. Ms Hawkins called the findings ""concerning"" and said MSF UK took reports ""of abuse and harassment seriously, and we know we still have work to do"". She added: ""We have conducted a thorough review of our files and undertaken informal enquiries, but are unable to find any record or evidence of the claims that have been put to us regarding the London office.""

Hammond: Taxes will rise to pay for NHSThe chancellor admits for first time taxes will increase to pay for PM's Â£20bn health spending promise.BusinessComments,"The chancellor is to admit for the first time that taxes will have to rise to cover the costs of increased spending on the NHS. In a speech on Thursday, Philip Hammond will say that any increases will be done in a ""fair and balanced way"". He will also make it clear the government will stick to its promise to reduce the nation's debts. That means there will be little room for extra borrowing to pay for the PM's promised spending boost. ""We are getting debt down, while investing in Britain's infrastructure, supporting our vital public services, and helping hard working families across the United Kingdom,"" the chancellor will say at the Mansion House in the City. ""And this week, the prime minister announced a five year NHS funding package that will boost spending on health by over Â£20bn a year in real terms in England alone. ""So, as the prime minister said, across the nation taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use. ""We also confirmed we would stick to our fiscal rule and continue to reduce debt."" The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PM Brexit could cost Â£1k per household The admission that tax rises are ahead puts at risk a Conservative manifesto pledge in 2017 that the party had a ""firm intention to reduce taxes"". In the words from the speech released overnight by the Treasury there was no mention of the ""Brexit dividend"" which the prime minister claimed at the weekend could be used to pay for part of the extra spending on the NHS. Economists have dismissed the idea that there is a ""dividend"" from leaving the European Union (EU), arguing that the costs to the economy outweigh any reduction in payments to the EU. Mr Hammond's speech will make it clear the Treasury is still committed to reducing the deficit - the amount of money the government spends above the amount it gains in revenues from taxes and investment - to 2% of the value of the economy (gross domestic product) by 2021. The Treasury has also promised as part of its ""fiscal rules"" that the country's overall debts - the total amount it has borrowed - will be falling as a proportion of the overall economy by the same time. My sources tell me that reducing the nation's debts - which has yet to happen - is seen in Conservative circles as the ""big dividing line"" with Labour which the party must stick to. That means increased taxes will be needed to cover the costs of the NHS pledge. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has just responded to Mr Hammond's comments: ""Just 12 months ago Theresa May claimed the only way voters can be sure their taxes won't rise was to vote Conservative, but it seems Philip Hammond didn't get the message. ""It is scandalous that the chancellor is still planning to go ahead with billions of pounds in tax giveaways to big business and a wealthy few over this parliament, but now suggests he will raise taxes on low and middle earners at the same time to pay for the Tory made crisis in our health and social care system. ""In contrast, Labour set out a fully costed plan to fund our NHS and public services by ending the Tory tax giveaways to big business, and with a modest tax rise on the top 5% of earners.""

BBC to stream Wimbledon tennis in 4K HDRThe World Cup 4K HDR trial is being extended to Wimbledon - Sky Q viewers will also benefit.Technology,"Garbine Muguruza will defend her Wimbledon ladies' singles title at this year's event The Wimbledon Championships tennis tournament is to be streamed in 4K resolution and high dynamic range colour (HDR) to UK viewers by the BBC. It will follow a current trial in which World Cup football matches are being shown via iPlayer using the next-generation TV technologies. However, this time the BBC also plans to make select matches available in 4K - but not HDR - to Sky Q customers. One expert said the tech offered huge benefits but had not been glitch-free. ""The World Cup streams have suffered a few technical teething problems - stuttering and buffering with some devices,"" said John Archer, a TV reviewer for Forbes and Techradar. ""[There have also been] a few issues with adapting effectively to broadband speeds that are close to the BBC's 40Mbps and 20Mbps streaming quality 'tiers'. ""When the streams have worked well, though, the results have been spectacular."" The reaction on social media has also been largely positive, although some have reported problems.

""The trial has given us valuable feedback allowing us to improve our systems,"" said a BBC spokesman. Once again, the BBC intends to offer the trial on a ""first-come first-served"" basis, saying it will be limited to ""tens of thousands of people"" to help deal with the extra bandwidth required. Few, if any, people have found themselves blocked, however, from accessing the ultra-high definition World Cup games. A list of compatible TVs and set-top boxesis being maintained online. Although it is not mentioned yet, support for the PlayStation Pro was recently added, although it only screens the World Cup games in 4K and not HDR. The Sky Q coverage will be limited to the men's and ladies' singles semi-final and final matches and will be delivered via satellite rather than the internet. Users will be given the option to access the Ultra HD feed via a pop-up message. World Cup matches are already being screened in 4K HDR quality The term 4K refers to the fact that an image contains four times as many pixels as a 1080p high definition picture. This can reveal details that would otherwise be difficult to pick out. During Wimbledon, this could potentially make it easier to see whether close-call shots are in or out and help viewers recognise famous faces in the crowd. HDR takes advantage of the fact modern TVs can go brighter and/or darker than they used to, providing a greater dynamic range. It can help reveal detail in the shadows and prevent highlights from ""blowing out"". In addition, HDR adopts a ""wider colour space"", meaning millions more colours can be displayed if the screen used is classed as ""10-bit"" or above. At Wimbledon, late-day games - when shadows can creep across courts creating exposure problems if other parts are still bathed in sunlight - in particular should benefit from HDR's better handling of contrast. HDR should improve footage at times when there are both bright highlights and shadows on screen simultaneously For movies and drama-based TV shows, many experts have judged HDR to offer the greater benefit over 4K. But Mr Archer said he had found the opposite to be true during the World Cup tests, at least on larger screens. ""Detail and sharpness have been hugely superior to the HD broadcast streams, making the action feel more immediate and much less tiring to watch,"" he said. ""Being able to see more of the pitch via the 4K camera is also a great feature for serious football fans. ""The use of HDR has been quite subtle by comparison, but has still undoubtedly enhanced the sense of 'being there' that's so important when you're watching sport.""

"Janet Jackson 'found joy in motherhood'The star reveals an ""intense"" battle with depression and says her one-year-old son changed her life.Entertainment & Arts","Jackson is one of the most successful artists in US chart history Janet Jackson has opened up about her struggle to find happiness, saying she ""fell easily into despair"" but found contentment after becoming a mother.

""Depression is a tenacious and scary condition,"" she wrote. ""Thankfully, I found my way way through it."" The 52-year-old thanked God and her infant son for helping her find peace. ""The height of happiness is holding my baby son in my arms and hearing him coo, or when I look into his smiling eyes and watch him respond to my tenderness,"" she wrote of one-year-old Eissa Al Mana. ""When I kiss him. When I sing him softly to sleep. During those sacred times, happiness is everywhere."" ""Happiness is in gratitude to God.

Thousands attend Stonehenge solstice,"This video can not be played A police drone was used to film the summer solstice crowd at Stonehenge Thousands of people gathered at Stonehenge for the summer solstice, as the sun rose amid clear skies. About 9,500 people were at the Neolithic monument to greet the start of the longest day of the year, according to Wiltshire Police. The sun appeared behind the Heel Stone at 04:52 BST to cheering and applause from the crowd. The summer solstice is one of the rare occasions that English Heritage opens up the stones for public access. As with last year's event, Wiltshire Police confirmed it had stepped up security with armed police on patrol. Thousands turned up to watch the sunrise Many of those who attended wore colourful outfits Although thousands attended the solstice, the force said 3,500 fewer people came to watch the sunrise compared with 2017. Supt Dave Minty, Wiltshire Police's overnight commander, said behaviour at the stones was ""brilliant"", with no arrests made. ""The sunrise was amazing, and we don't see many of those,"" he added. ""People seem to have adapted really well to the heightened level of security and they've been really patient with it."" This video can not be played Mouth and foot artist Tom Yendell captures the sunrise at Stonehenge. English Heritage's director of Stonehenge, Kate Davies, said the solstice was one of the ""highlights of the year"". ""It's a great opportunity for friends and families to come together and mark the longest day of the year, as people have done for thousands of years,"" she said. ""There was a lovely, friendly atmosphere throughout, the sun shone, and dawn was met with loud cheers."" Some people practised yoga exercises at the circle On the summer solstice, the sun rises behind the Heel Stone, the ancient entrance to the stone circle, and sunlight is channelled into the centre of the monument. It is believed that solstices have been celebrated at Stonehenge for thousands of years. The site holds special significance for members of the Druid and Pagan community, who perform rituals and celebrations at the summer and winter solstices. Hundreds of people also enjoyed the solstice at the nearby Avebury stone circle, where Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard described it as a ""lovely family event"" with a ""positive spirit"".

Cancer cases in elderly 'to surge',"The number of elderly people in the UK diagnosed each year with cancer is set to rise by 80% in less than 20 years, a report predicts. Cancer Research UK estimates that by 2035 about 234,000 over-75s will get cancer each year - up from 130,000 now. The charity also said the elderly were more likely to have multiple health conditions, leading to later diagnoses. It called on the health service to prepare now for the rise in older patients with ""complex needs"". The government said cancer was a ""priority"" and the prime minister had just announced increased funding for the NHS. Cancer rises due to ageing population Rise in cancers 'caused by weight' Each year, some 360,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the UK. About 36% of diagnoses are in people aged 75 or over but Cancer Research UK's new report estimates that this will increase to 46% by 2035,largely as a result of the UK's ageing population,external. The risk of developing cancer increases as we get older because the cells in our body often become damaged as we age. While cancer survival rates had doubled over the past 40 years, they were lowest among the elderly, the charity said. It said older people were less likely to receive curative treatment for their cancer, such as chemotherapy or surgery, something it said highlighted the need for them to receive better support. Older people with cancer are also more likely to have complex medical and social needs, which can make it harder for them to receive the best treatments. Rose Gray, Cancer Research UK's policy manager, said: ""If we do nothing, the disparity in care between older and younger cancer patients will only grow. ""It's vital to address this if we want to realise our ambition of ensuring world-class treatment for everyone in the UK who is affected by cancer. ""It's also highly likely that this group will be the hardest hit by wider pressures facing the NHS, including severe workforce shortages."" Cancer Minister Steve Brine said: ""Cancer is a priority for this Government and survival rates are at a record high with around 7,000 people alive today who would not have been had mortality rates stayed the same as in 2010."" He pointed to Theresa May's announcement earlier this week of increased funding for the NHS by Â£20.5bn per year over the next five years, and a 10-year long-term plan for the NHS which will prioritise transforming cancer care. One in two people in the UK born after 1960 will be diagnosed with some form of cancer during their lifetime A person's risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK About four in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK Source:Cancer Research UK,external Earlier this week,the government announced a spending boost for NHS England, increasing its budget by Â£20bn by 2023. Prime Minister Theresa May said this would be paid for with tax rises, as well as economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"". Ms Gray said this investment was welcome but ""falls short of what is likely to be needed to truly transform the way that patients are cared for"". Cancer Research UK called on the health service to prepare now for more older cancer patients.

Janet Jackson 'found joy in motherhood',"Jackson is one of the most successful artists in US chart history Janet Jackson has opened up about her struggle to find happiness, saying she ""fell easily into despair"" but found contentment after becoming a mother. In a candid letter forEssence magazine,external, the pop star said she had suffered low self-esteem and ""intense"" depression throughout her life. ""Depression is a tenacious and scary condition,"" she wrote. ""Thankfully, I found my way way through it."" The 52-year-old thanked God and her infant son for helping her find peace. ""The height of happiness is holding my baby son in my arms and hearing him coo, or when I look into his smiling eyes and watch him respond to my tenderness,"" she wrote of one-year-old Eissa Al Mana. ""When I kiss him. When I sing him softly to sleep. During those sacred times, happiness is everywhere."" ""Happiness is in gratitude to God. Happiness is saying, 'Thank you, God, for my life, my energy and my capacity to grow in love.' "" Jackson is one of the most successful singers in US chart history, with 27 top 10 singles and 10 number ones - including hits like Nasty, That's The Way Love Goes and Again. She first spoke about her struggles with depression on the 1997 album The Velvet Rope, which was written in the midst of an emotional breakdown. ""[I] couldn't get up at times,"" she told Newsweek upon the record's release. ""There were times when I felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls were kind of closing in on me."" Janet Jackson rails against abuse Raised on Janet: How the star changed one fan's life Janet Jackson: The stories behind the songs In her 2011 self-help book,True You,external, the star said her lack of self-esteem stemmed from childhood - when she worked on the TV sitcom Good Times, aged 10. ""Before production began, I was told two things,"" she wrote. ""I was fat and needed to slim down, and because I was beginning to develop, I needed to bind my breasts. ""In both cases the message was devastating - my body was wrong."" The singer recently became the first black woman to win Billboard's Icon Award Writing in Essence, Jackson says: ""I wasn't happy with the way I looked"" as a child, and as a teen ""was happiest when I was pleasing others and not myself"". ""I could analyse the source of my depression forever,"" she continued. ""Low self-esteem might be rooted in childhood feelings of inferiority. It could relate to failing to meet impossibly high standards. And of course there are always the societal issues of racism and sexism."" The star did not touch upon her ongoing custody battle with her ex, Wissam Al Mana - but said she had previously seen ""failed relationships as my fault"". Jackson went on to praise the #MeToo movement saying: ""We are living at a time in history when women all over the world are refusing to be controlled, manipulated, exploited or abused,"" she declares.

Police urged to act over hospital scandal,"This video can not be played Gosport hospital deaths: Timeline shows investigation The ""blame culture"" in the NHS has to change to avoid more scandals like the Gosport War Memorial Hospital deaths, the Health Secretary has said. Jeremy Hunt said it was still too difficult for whistleblowers to raise concerns about mistakes being made. He was responding to claims similar situations to Gosport were ""likely"" to be replicated elsewhere in the NHS. An inquiry,externalhas found more than 450 patients died after doctors gave them ""dangerous"" amounts of painkillers. Prof Sir Brian Jarman, an expert on hospital mortality at the Dr Foster Unit at Imperial College London, told the Today programme the Gosport situation may be repeated because information on death rates was not properly assessed by health officials. He said ""there really is a desire not to know,"" about mortality rates at the Department of Health, adding that NHS whistleblowers were still being ""fired, gagged and blacklisted"". 'Gosport will be remembered for this' Jane Barton, the doctor who shortened lives Mr Hunt acknowledged a ""blame culture"" existed ""in a lot of the NHS"". He said: ""If you are a doctor or a nurse and you see something going wrong - even if you are perhaps responsible for a mistake yourself - the most important thing, the thing that families want if they are bereaved or if they have a tragedy, is to know that the NHS isn't going to make that mistake again."" ""We make it much too hard for doctors and nurses to do that - they are worried that there will be litigation, they will go up in front of the GMC or NMC, the reputation of their unit - in some places they are worried they might get fired, so we do have to tackle that blame culture and turn that into a learning culture."" He was ""confident"" that procedures and checks were now in place to ensure similar problems - linked to high mortality rates - were identified quickly. This video can not be played Gosport hospital: Families 'grossly let down' by authorities The Gosport Independent Panel's report found whistleblowers and families were ignored as they attempted to raise concerns about the administration of medication on the wards, which wasoverseen by Dr Jane Barton. It also said, taking into account missing records,a further 200 patients may have suffered a similar fate,externalbetween 1989 and 2000. Nursing staff first raised concerns nearly 30 years ago but their fears were ""silenced"" by management, it revealed. The authors determined there was a ""disregard for human life"" of a large number of patients. Bishop Jones led the panel and announced its findings outside Portsmouth Cathedral People in Gosporthave been left shocked by the report's findings. ""I've actually got an appointment at the hospital later and since hearing about the report it's definitely given me some concerns,"" said Debbie Clark. ""It's just disgusting, absolutely horrifying that something like that could have happened to so many people. ""I think everyone will feel worried if the worst were to happen and people won't want to go there. I definitely think it's playing to people's fears but the relatives who have kept fighting are amazing."" Families of those who died at Gosport Memorial Hospital gathered at Portsmouth Cathedral on Wednesday to hear the findings of the inquiry Relatives are callingfor a criminal inquiry into the actionsat the hospital. Pressure is also growing on police to take action quickly over the deaths of hundreds of patients. Hampshire Constabulary previously conducted three separate inquiries, but no prosecutions were ever brought. The scandals that haunt the NHS NHS 'closed ranks' over hospital deaths Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said the panel had sight of information ""not previously seen"" by the force. In a statement she said: ""It is important that a process is put in place to ensure that all of the relevant agencies come together, to enable decisions about next steps to be made in a way that is well considered and transparent to all of the families."" Dr Barton, was found guilty of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999. She was not struck off the medical register but chose to retire after the findings.

Travel and ticket warning for Sheeran gigs,"Ed Sheeran has kicked off his run of four performances at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. The Shape of You singer is performing for about 60,000 fans each night in the city. He took to the stage on Thursday after fans experienced traffic problems getting into Cardiff on the M4. At one time, congestion reached from Cardiff back to the Second Severn Crossing toll booths, a distance of about 30 miles (48 km). Sheeran said after playing in the city on a previous occasion, he decided ""I have to play at that stadium"". Travel time into the city was double the normal amount, partly because of a serious accident on the eastbound carriageway between Cardiff and Newport at about 16:30 BST. The westbound carriageway was closed for half an hour to allow the air ambulance to land. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As well as no services to London Paddington after the Sheeran gig because of aplanned Severn Tunnel closure, there will be just one service to Cardiff from London an hour before the concert. Services from London will not call at Bristol and Cardiff trains coming from England's south coast will terminate at Bristol Parkway where a rail replacement bus service will take passengers to Newport for onward trains to Cardiff. After the concert, trains to Newport and west Wales will run as normal while rail replacement buses will run directly from Cardiff Central to Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads. And Arriva Trains Wales has also warned passengers attending Sunday's event there will be no trains to towns like Barry, Caerphilly, Pontypridd, Ebbw Vale, Treherbert and Carmarthen after the concert. While there will be extra services to Swansea and Newport after the gig, Arriva says it has no extra capacity or resources to add more trains on the Valley lines on Sunday night. ""Running additional services late on Sunday would mean having to cancel Monday morning commuter services,"" said Bethan Jelfs of Arriva. Transport expert Prof Stuart Cole said while he ""sympathises"" with Arriva, adding extra capacity on Sunday ""is not easy but it is possible"" and there was a year to plan for it. He added: ""If Cardiff wants to be a big event city which can regularly attract acts like Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Beyonce etc, they need to be able to get people in and out of the city efficiently on public transport. ""The problem on Sunday will be rolling stock and drivers will be out of place for the following morning rush hour, but with a little extra planning Arriva could have come up with a solution."" It is not the first time there has been travel problems for an event in Cardiff.

Security to the concert,externalis tight - only small bags are allowed in the stadium while laptops, selfie sticks and umbrellas are banned. Cardiff buses are being diverted,externalout of city centre bus stops while Arriva has warned passengers train services in the Cardiff area will be busy all day and ""extra capacity will be added where possible"".

This makes her only the second elected leader in modern history to give birth while in office. Ms Ardern was admitted to a hospital in the city of Auckland early on Thursday morning, four days after her due date. The 37-year-old has passed on her duties to Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters while she takes six weeks of maternity leave. However, she said she would be consulted on significant issues and would continue to read cabinet papers during her time away. The baby was born at 16:45 (04:45 GMT). Ms Ardern later broke news of the birth on social media, saying she felt very lucky and thanking staff at the hospital. This video can not be played Becoming a mum Jacinda Arden spoke about juggling motherhood and leadership In a statement, she also said: ""I'm sure we're going through all of the emotions new parents go through, but at the same time feeling so grateful for all the kindness and best wishes from so many people. Thank you.""

Ms Ardern, who was elected in October, announced in January that she and her partner Clarke Gayford were expecting a baby. ""I am not the first woman to multitask,"" she had said earlier this year in an interview with Radio New Zealand. ""I am not the first woman to work and have a baby; there are many women who have done this before."" She is the youngest prime minister the country has had since 1856. In 1990, the late Benazir Bhutto gave birth to a daughter while serving as Pakistan's prime minister, a first for an elected world leader. Incidentally, Ms Ardern's baby was born on what would have been Ms Bhutto's birthday. M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad When Ms Bhutto gave birth to a baby girl in January 1990, a military-funded right-wing alliance was tightening its siege of her government. So she never publicly declared her pregnancy and did not proceed with maternity leave. In fact, she had a quick Caesarian section performed by her gynaecologist and returned to work soon afterwards. Months later, her government was sacked by a president who then had discretionary powers to send an elected government home. Her other two children were born in similar conditions - in secrecy and through Caesarian section - establishing her as a woman who could handle maternity while simultaneously fighting a fierce battle for democracy.

MSF aid workers 'used local prostitutes'Female former employees tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the behaviour was widespread.Africa,"This video can not be played Whistleblowers tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the behaviour was widespread Aid workers at charity Medecins Sans Frontieres used local prostitutes while working in Africa, whistleblowers have told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. Female former employees said the behaviour was widespread. One said a senior colleague said it was possible to barter medication in exchange for sex. The charity said it does not tolerate ""abuse, harassment or exploitation"". The use of prostitutes is banned by MSF under its strict code of conduct. The women spoke anonymously for fear of being blacklisted by foreign aid agencies, among which there can be a large crossover of staff. The charity employs thousands of health professionals and logistical staff, most hired locally The allegations were made against logistical staff, and not doctors or nurses, at MSF - one of the world's biggest foreign aid agencies, also known as Doctors Without Borders. One former employee, who worked out of the charity's London office, said she had seen a senior member of staff bring girls back to MSF accommodation while posted in Kenya. ""The girls were very young and rumoured to be prostitutes,"" she said, adding that it was ""implicit"" that they were there for sex. ""My colleague, who was staying in the same residence for a long time, felt that this was a regular occurrence,"" she said.

""I felt that, with some of the older guys, there was definitely an abuse of power. They'd been there for a long time and took advantage of their exalted status as a Western aid worker,"" she said. ""There's definitely a feeling that certain predatory men were seen as too big to fail. ""You would often see men who were older, middle-aged, partying with much younger local girls. It was sexualised."" Another female employee, who worked with HIV patients in central Africa, claimed the use of local sex workers was ""widespread"". ""There was an older colleague who actually moved a woman into the compound [where MSF staff were staying],"" she said. ""It was pretty obvious she was a prostitute but he called her his girlfriend and she would spend night after night with him. ""This kind of thing was so blatant. So blatant and widespread. ""I saw one of my colleagues, he was a much younger guy, go into the toilet with a local prostitute. ""I knew her to talk to as she also worked in one of the bars. She told me afterwards that they'd had sex and he'd paid her."" The whistleblower said she also felt sexually harassed by some of the men she worked with. ""[One colleague] really made my life miserable,"" she said. ""He really tortured me and brought prostitutes back in front of me. ""The worst bit came when I left for a few weeks and came back to my room and found used condoms that he told people he's deliberately left behind. I felt sick."" The woman said she had reported his behaviour to her boss in the field and had been offered mediation, but had also been told she would be fired if she did not sort things out with her colleague. The charity said it was ""sorry for any instances where people have been subjected to harassment, abuse or otherwise mistreated and/or felt that it was not adequately dealt with"". Vickie Hawkins, executive director of MSF UK, added: ""While we have reporting mechanisms in place where complaints can be made, we know we need to do more to ensure that they are known, trusted and used by the people who need them."" A third whistleblower, who the Victoria Derbyshire programme met at a location in Europe, said a senior colleague had claimed that it was possible to barter medication for sex. ""He said, 'Oh, it's so easy to barter medication with these easy girls in Liberia',"" the woman claimed. ""He was suggesting lots of the young girls who had lost their parents to the Ebola crisis would do anything sexual in exchange for medication."" She said he had bragged about it ""quite a lot"", in front of three or four people who had been working in Liberia themselves and to her directly. It has not been possible for the BBC to verify this allegation. MSF said it needed more information before it could investigate. The charity established treatment centres in Liberia following the Ebola crisis The whistleblower claimed on other occasions MSF workers had sexually harassed partners at other non-governmental organisations (NGOs). She said in one instance during a video call they ""kept telling [one woman] how sexy she was... asking her where her husband was"". ""She was really embarrassed and tried to move on to the topic at hand, but they persisted with this for about 15 minutes,"" she said. ""I think it's endemic and part of the institution,"" she said, of sexual harassment. ""There are some that just accept it. Then there's another area [of people] who report it, but nothing gets done."" The Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to eight women in total who used to work at MSF in various European offices and field offices in Africa. The charity's culture was described as ""toxic"". One woman, who worked in the Amsterdam office, said when she had been on a mission in Asia a boss had commented on the size of her breasts. She claimed she had raised this with a manager but nothing had been done so she had left. In February, following allegations that staff at the charity Oxfam hired prostitutes while working overseas, MSF admitted it had sacked 19 staff for sexual harassment in the past year. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has seen an internal report that showed the organisation had been investigating allegations of sexual discrimination and harassment by staff in 2016. The report said a third of female employees it had spoken to had been touched inappropriately at work. Ms Hawkins called the findings ""concerning"" and said MSF UK took reports ""of abuse and harassment seriously, and we know we still have work to do"". She added: ""We have conducted a thorough review of our files and undertaken informal enquiries, but are unable to find any record or evidence of the claims that have been put to us regarding the London office.""

The Indian who cycled to Russia to meet Messi,"Clifin Francis was sitting at home in southern India when a friend asked if he was going to the World Cup. ""Of course,"" he replied. ""I might even travel to Russia to watch the extravaganza."" That was in August - but he had no idea how he would afford the air tickets from Kerala where he lives. Mr Francis is a freelance maths teacher and earns $40 (Â£30) a day. ""I realised I wouldn't have enough money to travel to Russia and stay for a month. Then I asked myself - what could be the cheapest way of travelling? Bicycle was the answer."" Friends didn't believe him, but by then he'd made up his mind. On 23 February, he started on an epic journey that took him by air to Dubai, and then ferry to Iran. From there the Russian capital is still more than 4,200km (2,600 miles) away by bike. The prize at the end - a chance to see his hero, Argentina's Lionel Messi, arguably the best footballer in the world. ""I love cycling and I am crazy about football. I simply combined two of my passions,"" Mr Francis told the BBC. He had planned to travel via Pakistan but had to drop the idea because of tense relations with India. ""The change in plan cost me a lot. I could not take my bike to Dubai and had to buy a new one there which cost $700. It wasn't the best one for long-distance travels but that's all I could afford,"" he said. But he forgot this temporary setback as soon as he entered the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas on 11 March. ""It's the most beautiful country in the world and the people are so welcoming. I spent 45 days in the country, but stayed in a hotel only for two days,"" he said. Mr Francis had only $10 a day to spend but says everywhere he went in Iran, people invited him to stay in their houses and offered him food. ""My perception about Iran has changed. I realised that you shouldn't form an opinion about a country based on its geopolitics,"" he said. He vividly remembers the dramatic landscapes. ""Cycling became less painful because of the beautiful Iranian countryside. I would definitely go back. More on the World Cup from the BBC: South Korea coach made players swap shirts to confuse opposition Japan fans impress by cleaning up stadium The throw-in everyone is talking about How World Cup stars are preventing 'boredom'? All BBC World Cup quizzes in one place ""They made me promise that I would cheer for the Iranian team in Russia. They also love Bollywood and that helped me break the ice with people in many places,"" he said. ""It's so true that football and films unite the world."" Next stop was Azerbaijan, where the border police had trouble verifying his travel documents - because he'd ""lost a lot of weight from constant cycling"". ""I didn't look like my picture in the passport. The police took more than eight hours to verify my details, but they were nice to me."" Mr Francis couldn't afford hotels in Azerbaijan and mostly pitched his tent in parks. ""People were nice here as well but they took time to open up to a stranger. I found some Indians living in the capital Baku and stayed with them for a while."" When Mr Francis reached Georgia, however, he was turned back and had to change plan again, about halfway to Moscow. ""I had all the documents but still don't know why I was refused entry. That left me in a precarious situation because I had a single-entry visa for Azerbaijan,"" he said. Mr Francis was stuck in ""no man's land"" between Georgia and Azerbaijan for a day. He was eventually given an urgent visa by Azerbaijan to re-enter. ""I then had to find another route to get into Russia. Somebody told me that Azerbaijan shared a land border with the Dagestan region of Russia,"" he said. ""I went there without realising that it was not considered safe.  But I had no option of turning back and I entered Dagestan on 5 June."" Language was a big problem because people hardly spoke English in Dagestan, he added. ""People were so surprised to see an Indian on a bicycle entering their area. Again, I used the universal language of football and films to make people open up to me."" Mr Francis has now made it as far as Tambov, a city about 460km south of Moscow by road. He needs to be in the capital by 26 June for the France v Denmark match. ""It's the only game I managed to get tickets for."" Lionel Messi may be gifted - but he'll want to forget the penalty he missed against Iceland ""But I support Argentina and Lionel Messi is my favourite - I worship him. It's my dream to meet him and ask him to sign my bicycle."" Clifin Francis hopes his journey will inspire people about football and fitness. ""I want to see India play in the World Cup some day. And that will only happen when more children take up football in India. I am optimistic about our chances in the next 20 years,"" he said. ""I am also hoping that people will take up cycling after reading my story. ""Cycling takes you back to the primitive necessities of life. What you need at the end of the day is a shower, nice place to pitch your tent and good food and you are happy. ""I would be happy if my journey ends up inspiring even one child to play football in India.""

US envoy Haley berates rights groups,"US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley said rights groups tried to ""thwart reform"" of the UNHRC US envoy Nikki Haley has attacked rights groups for trying to ""thwart reform"" of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). In a letter, Ms Haley said groups worked ""opposite the United States"" and were partially to blame for the US withdrawal from the body. The country withdrew from the UNHRC on Tuesday after accusing it of bias. Her letter was sent to the International Humanist and Ethical Union, which represents 162 groups.

This video can not be played Haley: Council has been a protector of human rights abusers The US pulled out of the UN's cultural organisation Unesco in 2017, again for perceived bias against Israel. The decision to leave the body follows years of US criticism.

But human rights groups voiced fresh complaints about the body in 2013, afterChina, Russia, Saudia Arabia, Algeria and Vietnam were elected members. This followedIsrael's unprecedented boycott of one of the council's reviews, alleging unfair criticism from the body. Last year,Nikki Haley told the council it was ""hard to accept"" that resolutions had been passed against Israel yet none had been considered for Venezuela, where dozens of protesters had been killed during political turmoil. Israel is the only country that is subject to a permanent standing agenda item, meaning its treatment of the Palestinians is regularly scrutinised by the UNHRC.

Upskirting law going back before MPs,"Legislation that will see the worst offenders of upskirting placed on the Sex Offenders' Register has been introduced by the government. The PM said she was proud the bill will make it a criminal offence punishable by up to two years in prison. The legislation for England and Wales concerns incidents where a photo is secretly taken under a victim's skirt. Tory Sir Christopher Chope previously objected to a private member's bill being used to create a new offence. The MP for Christchurch said he supported a law change but had stopped the bill from progressing last Fridaybecause he disapproved of how the legislation was being brought inwithout a debate. Theresa May said upskirting was a ""hideous invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed"". Justice minister Lucy Frazer said: ""We will ensure this bill becomes law as soon as possible to protect more victims and properly punish offenders."" 'Pants protest' against Commons row MP May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block Upskirting ban 'also protects men in kilts' Upskirting has been covered by legislation in Scotland since 2010. In England and Wales, prosecutors can currently use offences of outraging public decency, harassment or voyeurism to tackle upskirting - but not all cases can be covered by those charges. Ministers had backed the creation of an upskirting offence through legislation in the private members bill by Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse. Her bill was expected to sail through the Commons on Friday, but parliamentary rules mean it only required one MP to shout ""object"" to block its progress. This video can not be played Hear MPs shout ""shame"" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill Sir Christopher's intervention was met with shouts of ""shame"" from other MPs and the prime minister and other Conservatives criticised his actions. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Theresa May said she supported introducing a law via a bill and told MPs the worst offenders would be placed on the Sex Offenders' Register. Gina Martin, an upskirting victim whose petition to criminalise the actsparked a campaign and political backing, has also welcomed the government's adoption of the bill. This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting What is the current law? There is no law specifically naming and banning upskirting in England and Wales, victims and police are currently only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism Upskirting has been an offence in Scotland since 2010 when it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism What are the limitations of the current situation in England and Wales? Voyeurism only applies to filming actions taking place in private Outraging public decency usually requires someone to have witnessed the action but upskirting is often unobserved Unlike other sexual offences, people don't have automatic right to anonymity What does the new law propose? As well as carrying a maximum two-year sentence, it would also allow, in the most serious cases, those convicted to be placed on the sex offenders register 'Pants protest' against Commons row MP 'Upskirting' row MP says he supports ban May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Algeria goes offline for school exams,"Education Minister Nouria Benghabrit said the country could not ""passively"" accept any leaks Algeria has turned off its internet nationwide during high school exams in a bid to tackle cheating. Internet service, both mobile and fixed line, will go off for an hour after the start of each high school diploma exam to stop any leaks. Blackouts will continue throughout the exam season, from 20-25 June. The move follows widespread cheating in 2016, with questions leaked online before and during tests. As a result, the authorities asked internet service providers to stop social media access last year, but the voluntary measures were not enough. Education Minister Nouria Benghabrit told Algerian newspaper Annahar that Facebook would be blocked across the country throughout the entire period. Ms Benghabrit said while they are ""not comfortable"" with the decision, ""we should not passively stand in front of such a possible leak"". Additionally, all electronic devices with internet access - for both students and school staff - have been banned from the country's 2,000 exam halls, with metal detectors set up at their entrances. Ms Benghrabit also said surveillance cameras and mobile phone jammers had been installed at exam printing presses. Just over 700,000 students will sit the high school certificate examinations over the next week, with results expected from 22 July.

Five things we learnt from Instagram boss,"Instagram founder Kevin Systrom says it's ""on the top of our minds"" to ensure the platform improves the impact it has on people's mental health. In an exclusive interview with Newsbeat to promote its new feature IGTV, he says: ""We want to make sure we're a positive force in the world"". It has been suggestedInstagram is the worst social media platform in relation to young people's mental health. It's just announced a new feature which encourages users to spend longer on it. IGTV lets users create content that's up to an hour long. This video can not be played Instagram released this video to promote IGTV Here's what we learned while speaking to Instagram's founder. Kevin revealed to Radio 1 Newsbeat the company now has a billion users. ""I still today think our proudest accomplishment is building a thriving community of a billion, which is just wild beyond our wildest beliefs,"" he said. The platform started off as a photo sharing app, evolving into minute-long videos and then the creation of Instagram Stories. Instagram's main feed used to be in chronological order but that changed a few years ago, resulting in push back from users. ""Data shows very clearly that people enjoy Instagram more when they don't miss posts from their friends,"" Kevin said. ""The reason why we went to a ranked feed was because we realise people were actually missing a tonne of the posts from the people you care most about - we reordered the feed to show the stuff that you missed."" He acknowledged the criticism but says it won't change back anytime soon. YouTube has been criticised for content allowed on to its platform in the past, most recently from Logan Paul Going forward with IGTV, not all clips uploaded will be watched by someone at Instagram, meaning it relies on people reporting content. Like all content on Instagram, IGTV will follow itsrules and regulations,external- which include a ban on violent, nude, discriminatory or hateful content. Earlier this year YouTubehad to apologisefor not reacting quickly enough when one of its stars, Logan Paul, uploaded a vlog showing the body of a man who had killed himself in a forest in Japan. ""We have large teams working on this,"" Kevin says. ""We're keeping a keen eye on it because we want to make sure Instagram is a safe, welcoming and kind platform for all."" In recent months there have been questions about theimpact social media hason its users - from how much time is spent on it to the wayit can make us feel about ourselves. Kevin says: ""We need to be responsible both as individuals and as a company about how much time we spend on social media. ""Recently we confirmed a leak, which we never do, of a feature we're working on which allows you to know how long you're spending on Instagram and manage that time. ""Both of those things are deeply important to us and will be no different to IGTV."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Travel and ticket warning for Sheeran gigsEd Sheeran fans advised to plan ahead for Cardiff gigs amid travel fears and heightened ticket scrutiny.,"Ed Sheeran has kicked off his run of four performances at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. The Shape of You singer is performing for about 60,000 fans each night in the city. He took to the stage on Thursday after fans experienced traffic problems getting into Cardiff on the M4. At one time, congestion reached from Cardiff back to the Second Severn Crossing toll booths, a distance of about 30 miles (48 km). Sheeran said after playing in the city on a previous occasion, he decided ""I have to play at that stadium"". Travel time into the city was double the normal amount, partly because of a serious accident on the eastbound carriageway between Cardiff and Newport at about 16:30 BST. The westbound carriageway was closed for half an hour to allow the air ambulance to land. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Music lovers who had bought from the site - often at vastly inflated prices - will be given help in claiming refunds at the box office and will be offered the chance of buying genuine tickets. Sheeran imposed strict conditions on fans attending his 18-date UK stadium tour, which ends with four sell-out nights in Cardiff, including: Names printed on tickets, with ID required at the door A maximum of four tickets per customer Tickets listed for resale to be cancelled Any tickets bought by a ""business or trader""  to be cancelled Stuart Galbraith, chief executive of Kilimanjaro Live, one of the promoters of Sheeran's tour, said up to 10,000 tickets had so far been cancelled across the 18 dates. He negotiated with ticket resellers Get Me In, Seatwave and StubHub to make sure they would not list tickets for the tour but Viagogo did not follow suit. This is expected to be Ed Sheeran's setlist for his Principality Stadium concerts Sheeran has partnered withTwickets,external- a site which allows fans to swap tickets at face value or less, in order to protect fans from the ""unethical practices"" of touts. Up to 60,000 fans are expected each night and they have been advised to plan ahead for their journey to Cardiff as last trains to destinations such as London, Birmingham, Portsmouth and Aberdare could leave before the concert is due to finish at 22:30.

As well as no services to London Paddington after the Sheeran gig because of aplanned Severn Tunnel closure, there will be just one service to Cardiff from London an hour before the concert. Services from London will not call at Bristol and Cardiff trains coming from England's south coast will terminate at Bristol Parkway where a rail replacement bus service will take passengers to Newport for onward trains to Cardiff. After the concert, trains to Newport and west Wales will run as normal while rail replacement buses will run directly from Cardiff Central to Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads. And Arriva Trains Wales has also warned passengers attending Sunday's event there will be no trains to towns like Barry, Caerphilly, Pontypridd, Ebbw Vale, Treherbert and Carmarthen after the concert. While there will be extra services to Swansea and Newport after the gig, Arriva says it has no extra capacity or resources to add more trains on the Valley lines on Sunday night. ""Running additional services late on Sunday would mean having to cancel Monday morning commuter services,"" said Bethan Jelfs of Arriva. Transport expert Prof Stuart Cole said while he ""sympathises"" with Arriva, adding extra capacity on Sunday ""is not easy but it is possible"" and there was a year to plan for it. He added: ""If Cardiff wants to be a big event city which can regularly attract acts like Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Beyonce etc, they need to be able to get people in and out of the city efficiently on public transport. ""The problem on Sunday will be rolling stock and drivers will be out of place for the following morning rush hour, but with a little extra planning Arriva could have come up with a solution."" It is not the first time there has been travel problems for an event in Cardiff. Rugby World Cuporganisers held an inquiryinto chaos after a game between Ireland and Canada in 2015 asGreat Western Railway underestimated passenger numbers. Boxing fans attending Anthony Joshua's most recent fight at the Principality Stadium were also affected as the last trains out of Cardiff left before the fight finished. Some road closures began at 07:00,external, while the Principality Stadium gates opened at 17:00 androads in the centre closed at 17:30,external. Security to the concert,externalis tight - only small bags are allowed in the stadium while laptops, selfie sticks and umbrellas are banned. Cardiff buses are being diverted,externalout of city centre bus stops while Arriva has warned passengers train services in the Cardiff area will be busy all day and ""extra capacity will be added where possible"".

"Cancer cases in elderly 'to surge'By 2035 about 234,000 over-75s will get cancer each year - up from 130,000 now, a report estimates.Health","The number of elderly people in the UK diagnosed each year with cancer is set to rise by 80% in less than 20 years, a report predicts. Cancer Research UK estimates that by 2035 about 234,000 over-75s will get cancer each year - up from 130,000 now. The charity also said the elderly were more likely to have multiple health conditions, leading to later diagnoses. It called on the health service to prepare now for the rise in older patients with ""complex needs"". The government said cancer was a ""priority"" and the prime minister had just announced increased funding for the NHS. Cancer rises due to ageing population Rise in cancers 'caused by weight' Each year, some 360,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the UK. About 36% of diagnoses are in people aged 75 or over but Cancer Research UK's new report estimates that this will increase to 46% by 2035,largely as a result of the UK's ageing population,external. The risk of developing cancer increases as we get older because the cells in our body often become damaged as we age. While cancer survival rates had doubled over the past 40 years, they were lowest among the elderly, the charity said. It said older people were less likely to receive curative treatment for their cancer, such as chemotherapy or surgery, something it said highlighted the need for them to receive better support. Older people with cancer are also more likely to have complex medical and social needs, which can make it harder for them to receive the best treatments. Rose Gray, Cancer Research UK's policy manager, said: ""If we do nothing, the disparity in care between older and younger cancer patients will only grow. ""It's vital to address this if we want to realise our ambition of ensuring world-class treatment for everyone in the UK who is affected by cancer. ""It's also highly likely that this group will be the hardest hit by wider pressures facing the NHS, including severe workforce shortages."" Cancer Minister Steve Brine said: ""Cancer is a priority for this Government and survival rates are at a record high with around 7,000 people alive today who would not have been had mortality rates stayed the same as in 2010."" He pointed to Theresa May's announcement earlier this week of increased funding for the NHS by Â£20.5bn per year over the next five years, and a 10-year long-term plan for the NHS which will prioritise transforming cancer care. One in two people in the UK born after 1960 will be diagnosed with some form of cancer during their lifetime A person's risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK About four in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK Source:Cancer Research UK,external Earlier this week,the government announced a spending boost for NHS England, increasing its budget by Â£20bn by 2023. Prime Minister Theresa May said this would be paid for with tax rises, as well as economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"". Ms Gray said this investment was welcome but ""falls short of what is likely to be needed to truly transform the way that patients are cared for"". Cancer Research UK called on the health service to prepare now for more older cancer patients. This should include making sure staff had enough time to care for patients and providing them with better evidence of how medication affected older patients, the charity said.

Student admits killing sister in crashMeliha Kaya smashed into a tree after hitting a BMW as she drove her sister home from a pub.,"Meliha Kaya was speeding in a 30mph zone when she crashed her Mini A student has admitted killing her 16-year-old sister in a car crash in east London. Meliha Kaya, 22, smashed into a tree while speeding as she drove her sister Elif and a friend back from a pub in Wanstead on 13 February 2016. At the Old Bailey Kaya, of Woodford, east London, admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving. A judge told her she could be spared jail due to the ""devastating"" impact of the crash on her family. Jordash Graham, 24, from Leytonstone, who was speeding in a Ford Focus behind Kaya, admitted dangerous driving at the court on Wednesday. All the occupants of Kaya's Mini were badly injured when the car crashed into a BMW in Chigwell Road, went over a low wall and hit a tree. Front seat passenger Elif, who was the only person wearing a seat belt, was pronounced dead at the scene. Before criminology student Kaya admitted the charge, Judge Wendy Joseph QC told her she would consider suspending her jail sentence if she pleaded guilty. ""There is no sentence I can impose which could begin to put it right. There is nothing she can do to ever put it right,"" the judge said. Judge Joseph added that the impact on the family ""must be devastating and never ending"". Kaya and Graham will be sentenced on Friday.
