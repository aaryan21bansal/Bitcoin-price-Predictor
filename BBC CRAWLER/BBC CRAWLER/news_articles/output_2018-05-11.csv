Loyalist 'supergrass' released from prison,"Gary Haggarty, 45, was sentenced for more than 200 offences, including five murders Loyalist supergrass Gary Haggarty has been released from prison and put into a witness protection programme in a secret location outside Northern Ireland. The former UVF leader was sentenced to six and half years just over three months ago after admitting over 500 offences, including five murders. When he was sentenced in January the judge said he would normally have been sent to prison for 35 years. But his term was reduced. He had agreed to give evidence against others he said were involved in his crimes. Haggarty also worked as a paid police informer during the period when most of his crimes were committed. Gary Haggarty: Full list of charges Informer shot Catholic to hide double life Legal challenge over supergrass handlers He is the most senior loyalist paramilitary ever to agree to become a supergrass. He will now been given a new identity and put into a witness protection scheme under the supervision of the security service MI5. The self confessed mass killer has agreed to return to Northern Ireland at a future date to be the star prosecution witness in the trial of a man accused of murdering two Catholics. Workmen Gary Convie and Eamon Fox were shot dead as they ate lunch in a car parked near a building site in Belfast city centre in May 1994. Eamon Fox and Gary Convie were shot dead while eating their lunch at a building site in 1994 He was released this afternoon after his lawyers threatened to take the prison service to court for not acting on a decision by the Sentence Review Commissioners on Wednesday. The lawyers wrote to the Sentence Review Commissioners shortly after Haggarty was sentenced in January and said he should be released immediately due to time already served. Taking into account the time spent on remand he has spent just over four years in jail. The Commissioners issued a determination on Wednesday saying the application had been granted and that he could be released, after the Northern Ireland Office indicated it had no objections. They said the prison service had the final say on when the release would happen. A spokesperson for the PSNI said his release was a matter for the Sentence Review Commissioners and not the police. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) murdered more than 500 people. The loyalist paramilitary group's campaign also claimed the lives of 33 people in bomb attacks in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974. Haggarty was a former commander of an Ulster Volunteer Force unit in the Mount Vernon area of north Belfast The organisation's name dates back to the Protestant force formed to oppose Home Rule in 1912. The name was revived in 1966 as loyalists came together to oppose liberal unionism and what it saw as a rise in Irish nationalism, centred on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. The UVF's political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), played a prominent role in the peace process and supported the 1998 Belfast Agreement. Solicitors Madden and Finucane wrote to the prison service this morning and said they believed Gary Haggarty was being ""unlawfully detained"". They said the High Court in Belfast had been asked to convene an emergency sitting if Haggarty was not released today. A short time later they were informed that Haggarty would be released. It is understood he was taken out of Maghaberry by members of the Witness Protection Programme and flown out of Northern Ireland on a private plane. The Public Prosecution Service is appealing the sentence given to Haggarty, arguing that it was unduly lenient. But even if the appeal succeeds it would not have any impact on the time he would spend in prison as the most serious crimes, the 5 murders, were committed before the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The agreement means the maximum term for a terrorist offence committed before April 1998 is two years in prison. Lawyers representing relatives of some of Haggarty's victims are also taking legal action against a decision by the PPS not to prosecute two Special Branch officers he claims were complicit in many of his crimes. Haggarty admitted murdering: Catholic Sean McParland, who was shot while babysitting in Belfast in 1994 John Harbinson, a Protestant, who was handcuffed and beaten to death by a UVF gang on the Mount Vernon estate in north Belfast in May 1997 Catholic workmen Eamon Fox, 44, a father of six, and Gary Convie, 24, a father of one, shot dead as they had lunch together in a car in Belfast's North Queen Street in May 1994 Sean McDermott, a 37-year-old Catholic found shot dead in his car near Antrim in August 1994 He also admitted five attempted murders, including against police officers, 23 counts of conspiracy to murder and directing terrorism. The judge also took into consideration a further 301 lesser offences in his judgement. Who is Gary Haggarty?

Nasa will send helicopter to Mars,"This video can not be played Nasa is sending the helicopter to Mars for a mission in 2020 Nasa is sending a helicopter to Mars, in the first test of a heavier-than-air aircraft on another planet. The Mars Helicopter will be bundled with the US space agency's Mars rover when it launches in 2020. Its design team spent more than four years shrinking a working helicopter to ""the size of a softball"" and cutting its weight to 1.8kg (4lbs). It is specifically designed to fly in the atmosphere of Mars, which is 100 times thinner than Earth's. Nasa describes the helicopter as a ""heavier-than-air"" aircraft because the other type - sometimes called an aerostat - are balloons and blimps. Soviet scientists dropped two balloons into the atmosphere of Venus in the 1980s. No aircraft has ever taken off from the surface of another planet. The helicopter's two blades will spin at close to 3,000 revolutions a minute, which Nasa says is about 10 times faster than a standard helicopter on Earth. ""The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling,"" said Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine. ""The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery, and exploration missions to Mars."" While the tiny craft is being called a helicopter rather than a drone, there will be no pilot. Nasa provided this computer-generated image of the helicopter's design It will be flying almost 55 million km (34 million miles) from Earth, too far away to send a remote control signal. ""Earth will be several light minutes away, so there is no way to joystick this mission in real time,"" said Mimi Aung, the project manager at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Instead, the helicopter will ""fly the mission on its own"". First person on Mars 'should be a woman' Europe's Mars rover takes shape Agencies aim to bring back rocks from Mars The JPL team made the minuscule helicopter as strong as possible to give it the best chance of surviving. ""The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet,"" Ms Aung said. ""When our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it's already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up."" That is part of the reason why Nasa is calling the Mars helicopter a ""high risk"" project. ""If it does not work, the Mars 2020 mission will not be impacted. If it does work, helicopters may have a real future as low-flying scouts and aerial vehicles to access locations not reachable by ground travel,"" Nasa said in a statement. Existing Mars vehicles have been wheeled devices, which have to navigate around many obstacles in their path and have been confined to fairly large open spaces on the surface of Mars. One such vehicle, the Spirit rover, got stuck in a patch of sand in 2009, where it eventually ran out of power and shut down. The Mars 2020 rover - accompanied by its helicopter companion - is due to launch in July of that year and arrive on the red planet in February 2021.

"Boy, 13, found 'clinging to cliff face'","This video can not be played The boy was winched to safety A 13-year-old boy was left clinging to a cliff face by his fingernails after he started to climb it but got stuck. Coastguard teams and a search and rescue helicopter winched the child to safety from the 330ft (100m) cliff face in Langdon, Kent, on Friday. Dover coastguard said the teenager started climbing from a terrace cut into the middle of the cliff. He was 175ft (53m) from the bottom when he found himself unable to move up or down. HM Coastguard helicopter captain James Lorraine said the rescue was particularly difficult because of the boy's ""extremely perilous position"" on the cliff near Dover. He said the child had been stuck for about 30 minutes when he was found, and rescuers knew he could not hold on much longer. After they were unable to reach him because of the dense shrubbery, the helicopter took over ""with only minutes to spare"", he said. ""Thankfully, the rescue went smoothly and the boy was reunited with his family at the base of the cliff."" The child had scrapes and bruises, but area commander Matt Pavitt said it was a miracle he escaped without injury. ""He was very, very lucky,"" he said. ""The boy had been clinging on by his fingernails to stop himself from falling from the sheer rock face for just over 30 minutes and if he had let go this would have been a very different outcome.""

Immigration policy criticised by UN official,"This video can not be played Brexit fosters 'growing intolerance', says UN The UK's ethnic minorities have been ""disproportionately"" affected by the government's austerity and immigration policies, a UN inspector has said. Tendayi Achiume, the Special Rapporteur on Racism, criticised the ""hostile environment"" brought in by Theresa May when she was home secretary to clamp down on illegal immigrants. The rapporteur also expressed concern at the effect of the Brexit debate. But she said UK racial equality laws had shown achievements in key areas. The government said it was determined to tackle ""ethnic disparities"". Ms Achiume's comments are contained in anend of mission statement,externalfollowing her two week fact-finding mission to the UK. But former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith criticised the visit. ""These visits are completely pointless,"" he told the Times. ""They are politically motivated, they are inspired by the extreme left, and the idea is to kick the UK."" Who are the Windrush generation and why are they facing problems? Home Office review into Windrush failings Racial injustice must be tackled, PM says Stop-and-search ethnic disparity 'troubling' Ms Achiume is due to publish a full report in June 2019. The first day of her visit coincided withAmber Rudd's resignation as home secretaryfollowing the Windrush scandal. Ms Achiume said the Windrush Generation faced ""gross human rights violations and indignities"" as a result of government policies. Born in Zambia and raised in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana She took up the role of special rapporteur at the UN in November 2017. She reports on racism, xenophobia and intolerance after undertaking fact-finding country visits She is a law professor at theUniversity of California, Los Angeles,external She has represented refugees and migrants at Lawyers for Human Rights in Johannesburg She recommended the government repeal the sections of the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Act which require landlords and employers to check a person's right to be in the UK. It was ""no surprise that a policy that ostensibly seeks to target only irregular immigrants is destroying the lives and livelihoods of racial and ethnic minority communities more broadly"", she said. Ms Achiume said that while the UK embraced a ""substantive vision of racial equality, and explicitly prohibited both direct and indirect forms of racial discrimination"" there was ""much to do especially in the arena of addressing structural forms of racial discrimination and inequality"". Ms Achiume also raised concerns over the government's anti-terrorism Prevent programme, and hate crimes following the Brexit vote. She said: ""The discourses on racial equality before, during and after the 2016 referendum, as well as the policies and practices upon which the Brexit debate has conferred legitimacy, raise serious issues at the core of my mandate."" The prime minister's racial disparity audit won praise Speaking at a news conference to mark the end of her trip, Ms Achiume also said she was ""shocked"" to find young black men were ""over-represented"" in police stop-and-searches, and in the prison system. She added: ""Unsurprisingly, austerity has had especially pronounced inter-sectional consequences, making women of colour the worst affected."" However, the prime minister'sRacial Disparity Auditwas described by Ms Achiume as a ""remarkable step in transforming racial equality into reality"" that is ""worthy of emulation by governments all over the world"". A website set up by the government highlights the disparities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and courts between ethnicities and Mrs May has promised to confront the ""uncomfortable truths"" exposed by it. A government spokeswoman said: ""We note that the special rapporteur commended UK legislation and policy to tackle direct and indirect racial discrimination... ""We have made great progress, but the prime minister is clear that if there is no rational explanation for ethnic disparities, then we - as a society - must take action to change them. That is precisely what we will do."" The government added it was wrong to term Home Office immigration policy as a ""hostile environment"". But she said in light of the concerns raised by the Windrush scandal, rules were being reviewed to ensure that people lawfully in the UK are not disadvantaged by measures in place to tackle illegal migration.

Body confirmed as missing singer,"A body found at a marina on the banks of the Firth of Forth has been confirmed as missing Frightened Rabbit singer Scott Hutchison. The discovery was made at Port Edgar, between the Forth Road Bridge and Queensferry Crossing, at about 20:30 on Thursday. Mr Hutchison, 36, went missing in the early hours of Wednesday morning. His family said there had been recent concerns about his mental health, and they were ""devastated"" by his death. Mr Hutchison had spoken openly about his battle with depression over the years, with elder brother Neil saying he had done so ""in an attempt to help other people with similar conditions"". In a statement released on Friday, the family said Mr Hutchison ""wore his heart on his sleeve, and that was evident in the lyrics of his music and the content of many of his social media posts. ""He was passionate, articulate and charismatic, as well as being one of the funniest and kindest people we knew. Friends and family would all agree that he had a brilliant sense of humour and was a great person to be around."" 'His music meant so much to people' Profile: Frightened Rabbit Scott Hutchison at The Quay Sessions with new band Mastersystem The statement added that relatives had ""remained positive and hopeful that he would walk back through the door, having taken some time away to compose himself"". And it described Mr Hutchison as a ""wonderful son, brother, uncle and friend"" who always had time for those he cared for. Scott Hutchison formed Frightened Rabbit alongside his brother Grant, the band's drummer ""Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you"", it added. ""Scott battled bravely with his own issues for many years and we are immensely proud of him for being so open with his struggles. ""His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues."" If you or someone you know has been affected by mental health problems,these organisations may be able to help. His Frightened Rabbit bandmates released a statement saying: ""There are no words to describe the overwhelming sadness and pain that comes with the death of our beloved Scott, but to know he is no longer suffering brings us some comfort. ""Reading messages of support and hope from those he has helped through his art has helped immensely and we encourage you all to continue doing this. ""He will be missed by all of us and his absence will always be felt but he leaves a legacy of hope, kindness and colour that will forever be remembered and shared."" Scott Hutchison was last seen after visiting the Dakota Hotel in South Queensferry The singer and guitarist had last been seen on CCTV footage leaving the Dakota Hotel in nearby South Queensferry at 01:00 on Wednesday. Two hours earlier, he had tweeted: ""Be so good to everyone you love. It's not a given. I'm so annoyed that it's not. I didn't live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones."" Shortly afterwards, he added: ""I'm away now. Thanks."" Frightened Rabbit were formed by Mr Hutchison and brother Grant on drums. The band released their debut album Sing the Greys in 2006, and went on to release four more albums. The brothers also released a critically-acclaimed album last month as part of Mastersystem - a supergroup that also included Justin Lockey from the band Editors. The singer has spoken openly of his battle with depression News of Mr Hutchison's death sparked tributes from fans and musicians. Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody paid tribute on Instagram to ""one of Scotland's most extraordinary song writers"". He said Mr Hutchison ""wrote with such profound insight into loss and longing and listening to his words always made me feel this heady mix of wonder, elation and pain. ""That pain that also makes you feel someone understands what you're going through and you don't feel so alone"". Frightened Rabbit, pictured here at Glastonbury in 2013, released five albums Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos tweeted: ""Awful news about Scott Hutchison. A terrible loss."" Stuart Murdoch, from Belle and Sebastian, wrote: ""Tragic news about Scott Hutchison. The whole music community in Scotland was praying for a different outcome."" DJ Edith Bowman said: ""Can't really believe I'm reading this. Saddest awakening ever. Love and best wishes to all the Hutchison and Frabbit family."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also tweeted: ""Heartbreaking news. My thoughts are with Scott's family, friends and fans. A remarkable and much loved talent."" The musician is originally from Selkirk but had been living in Glasgow. Frightened Rabbit were formed with Scott Hutchison on vocals and guitar and his brother Grant on drums, with the band's most recent line-up also featuring Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. They released the first of their five albums, Sing the Greys, in 2006, with Scott also releasing a solo album called Owl John. Scott and Grant had recently formed a new band called Mastersystem, joining forces with Justin Lockey from Editors and his brother James, a film maker. Their debut album, Dance Music, was released last month. Scott had also hinted at a sixth Frightened Rabbit album being released before the end of the year, saying they had five or six songs that were coming together.

Is Iran's Supreme Leader trolling Trump?,"Three days ago, ties between the US and Iran took a significant turn for the worse. Donald Trump pulled the US out of a multi-country deal that suspended sanctions on Iran while limiting its nuclear activities. After saying the deal was ""defective at its core"", he placed more sanctions on Iran. Iran responded with frustration, but it now appears to be engaging in a more off-the-cuff manner. On Friday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was pictured in a post on his Instagram feed at the Tehran Book Fair. Allow Instagram content?

Nothing unusual there, but in one image he was seen reading a Persian-language edition of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury, which claims that life in the White House is chaotic. The US president described the book as ""fiction""and Mr Wolff as a ""fraud"". When the book was released in January, it was described as a ""bombshell"" by commentators as it raised doubts over Mr Trump's mental health. It claimed that Mr Trump pursued friends' wives and that his daughter Ivanka would mock his hairstyle behind his back.

Boss sentenced over death yacht safety,"(L-R) Crew members James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin all died A company boss who failed to safely operate a yacht on which four sailors were killed has been given a suspended prison sentence. The crew of the Cheeki Rafiki died after the 40ft vessel lost its keel and capsized in the Atlantic in May 2014. Douglas Innes, 43, and his business Stormforce Coaching Limited werefound guilty of failing to operate the yacht in a safe manner. He was given a 15-month jail term, suspended for two years. At Winchester Crown Court, Stormforce Coaching Limited - which has since been put into liquidation - was fined Â£50,000. Innes, of Southampton, had previously beencleared of four counts of manslaughter by gross negligencefollowing a retrial. The four men on board - skipper Andrew Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, James Male, 22, from Romsey in Hampshire, Steve Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Paul Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset - were travelling back to the UK when the vessel lost its keel. The crew's bodies were never found. Douglas Innes, who ran Stormforce Coaching, was given a suspended sentence Sentencing Innes, Mr Justice Nigel Teare told him that ""cost-cutting"" had led his actions. He added: ""The failure to have the yacht surveyed was a serious act of negligence."" ""This was a small yacht about to cross the Atlantic alone having not been independently examined for over three years. Those circumstances give rise to a risk of death."" Mr Justice Teare called on the maritime regulatory authorities to tighten the rules governing the inspection of yachts. He said that Innes was unaware of a fault with a bolt and that a survey of the vessel, which went missing more than 700 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia, may not have identified the problem. Katy Ware, a director of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), said she had ""personally pledged to the families"" that rules would change as a result of this case. She added: ""There are a number of grey areas. It's really important that we make it clear to industry how they operate those vessels and make sure they are safe for everyone travelling on board."" The Cheeki Rafiki had been on its way to Southampton from Antigua Sailing Week The court had earlier been told that an email had been sent by the crew warning Mr Innes their yacht - named after a character in the Lion King - was taking on water in bad weather. He replied advising the sailors to make sure the life raft was ready and later phoned the UK Coastguard. The US Coastguard wascriticised for calling off its search for the stricken vessel after two days,but it was restarted following intervention by the British government. The yacht was eventually found on 17 May 2014 with the life raft but with no sign of the four men. Reading an impact statement in court, Adele Miller fought back tears as she described her boyfriend James Male as ""wise beyond his years"". ""My life and my future has crumbled before me,"" she said. ""Without him my life is less than incomplete."" The overturned hull of the Cheeki Rafiki after it was discovered by a US Navy warship A statement from Cressida Goslin, the widow of Paul Goslin, was read in court in which she said she had been left ""lost, isolated and alone"" by the tragedy. ""This accident and the loss of four loved and cherished men could so easily have been avoided,"" it said. His daughter Claire Goslin said a ""massive part of her died"" with her father. ""Despite being a strong character, losing dad in this way has crushed me and I have to live the rest of my life with an emptiness that I can never fill,"" she said. Mr Warren's partner Gloria Hamlet said in a statement: ""Life as I knew it when I was happy and fulfilled no longer exists and never will again, my life will always be overshadowed by a deep sorrow from the loss of Steve."" In mitigation, defence counsel told the court that Innes's life had been ""shattered"" following the loss of his ""friends and colleagues"". ""He genuinely and profoundly understands the pain [the families] have suffered.""

Social media Romeo finally wins free flight,"C.J. Poirer (left) is on his way to visit Becca Warren (right) after a beleaguered Twitter campaign A cash-poor young man has proven that perseverance and thousands of retweets are all it takes to conquer love. Michigan native CJ Poirier wanted to visit his Canadian girlfriend in Newfoundland but lacked the funds. When the 19-year-old failed to score a free flight by getting 530,000 retweets, he asked for celebrities to donate their retweets to his cause. His campaigning finally paid off, and he will be on board a flight to visit his girlfriend next Monday. It was a love story made for the social media age. Mr Poirer met his girlfriend Becca Warren about a year ago online, where the two quickly bonded over video games and cartoons. But after six months of texting, they want to meet face to face. A plane ticket from Michigan to Newfoundland would cost about $800, a steep price tag for a barista, Mr Poirer says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rapper Xxxtentacion is currently facing charges in Florida - which include aggravated battery of a pregnant woman. He denies the allegations. Both artists' music will be removed from all Spotify-owned and operated playlists and recommendations. R Kelly responded to 50 Cent's post saying: ""Thanks for the support fam! No weapon formed."" The singer makes a reference to a quote from the Bible that reads: ""No weapon formed against you shall prosper."" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek Users of Spotify will still be able to find the R&B singer's music, but the streaming service will no longer actively promote it. His music will be removed from all Spotify-owned and operated playlists and recommendations. R Kelly was recently at the centre of the #MuteRKelly campaign which calls for the singer to be boycotted after years of allegations.

MPs back paid leave for bereaved parents,"This video can not be played Dealing with a parent's worst nightmare A bill to ensure bereaved parents have the legal right to paid time off has moved a step closer to becoming law. The Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill would mean parents who lose a child would be entitled to at least two weeks' paid leave. MP Kevin Hollinrake, who tabled the bill, said he hoped employers would always offer more than two weeks. A number of MPs who had lost children spoke about their experiences during the four hour debate. Should you work while you are grieving? How long should bereavement leave last? Should everyone get paid bereavement leave? Grieving parents currently have no automatic right to time off work, although employers are expected to grant ""reasonable"" leave in emergencies. From 2020, it is hoped parents who lose a child will be able to request paid absence in England, Wales and Scotland - the matter is devolved in Northern Ireland. The SNP's Patricia Gibson, whose baby was stillborn at full term, said two weeks was ""not very long, but given that currently there is no entitlement at all - it offers a start"". ""To have to face the death of your son or daughter with no entitlement to paid leave under the law is a terrible injustice that generations of people before us have suffered,"" she told MPs. ""Many of us today in the chamber have had the tragic and life changing experience of having had to bury our own child."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach, whose newborn son died in 2009, described the importance of time off in dealing with the ""devastation and loss"". She said: ""We really are making history today. ""I hope those parents that face this in the future, they will feel there's that little bit of grace, that little bit of space for them to be able to deal with what is just an utter tragedy."" The government is backing Mr Hollinrake's private member's bill, which was brought forward in consultation with his fellow Conservative MP Will Quince, whose son was stillborn at full term in October 2014. Antoinette Sandbach was among MPs who related their own experiences The bill, which passed its third reading and will now go to the Lords, would grant parents the right to two weeks' leave, paid at 90% of average weekly earnings or the statutory flat rate - which was Â£140.98 in 2016-17. The government isstill consulting,externalon who should be entitled to the leave and how and when it should be taken. Small firms would be able to reclaim the full cost from the government, with larger firms recouping about 90%. Mr Hollinrake said the two weeks' leave set out in the bill was ""clearly a minimum"" and said that evidence heard by MPs suggested that ""most employers are very generous and very sympathetic in these situations"". Several MPs raised the issue of the age of the child - the bill covers the deaths of children aged under 18. Patricia Gibson argued that drawing the ""random and artificial"" line was ""not appropriate"" in the context of losing a child. Allow Twitter content?

MPs were told the number of people affected could increase five-fold if the age cut-off was not in the bill, meaning it might not make it into law, with Mr Quince saying he did not want to risk losing government support for it. Labour's shadow business minister Bill Esterson said there should be some flexibility about when the two weeks' paid leave could be taken as ""grief does not come and go in a neat two-week period"". He said it was not practical to extend it indefinitely but suggested allowing leave to be taken at any stage over 12 months. Business Minister Richard Harrington said the government had tried to ""get the balance right"" between those affected and the ""unavoidable"" financial cost to employers. He told MPs the bill would be a ""powerful driver"" of cultural change in businesses and although no employer could give people enough time off to deal with all their grief - but the bill was about setting a minimal entitlement.

School bans pencil cases to stop 'stigma',"Pauline Johnstone has banned pencil cases at St Wilfrid's Primary School in Blyth A school has banned pencil cases in a bid to stop pupils from poor families being stigmatised. St Wilfrid's Primary School in Blyth, Northumberland, said it had taken steps to get rid of any ""designer goods"". Head teacher Pauline Johnstone said pencil cases have been banned ""so there's no comparison on the tables and children are learning"". St Wilfrid's was among more than 100 schools in a project to stop poorer pupils being stigmatised. After working with charity Children North East, the school has begun providing stationery and has cut down on the number of dress-up and fundraising days. ""There was a culture within the school, within pupils, that noticed those children who were never in on PE days for example,"" Ms Johnstone said. ""Part of our uniform policy is a standard backpack so we don't have any designer goods."" She said some parents complained about having to buy certain bags but enough time was left before the rule was fully enforced. St Wilfrid's Primary School in Blyth took part in the Poverty Proofing the School Day project The Poverty Proofing the School Day project, led by Children North East, encouraged teachers to look at ways in which some pupils might be unwittingly excluded. Schools said it has led to higher attendance and better results. The charity also said ""dress-up"" days or conversations about ""what we did at the weekend"" can also penalise those from low-income backgrounds. It said schools also found more discreet ways of distributing free school uniforms as parents and children were reluctant to approach them directly.

""The government is constantly saying that the way out of poverty is educational achievement and by that they mean doing well in school exams and ideally going on to further education,"" he added.

"Boy, 13, found 'clinging to cliff face'A teenager tries to scale a sheer cliff but gets stuck and ends up clinging on by his fingernails.15m16 minutes agoKent","This video can not be played The boy was winched to safety A 13-year-old boy was left clinging to a cliff face by his fingernails after he started to climb it but got stuck. Coastguard teams and a search and rescue helicopter winched the child to safety from the 330ft (100m) cliff face in Langdon, Kent, on Friday. Dover coastguard said the teenager started climbing from a terrace cut into the middle of the cliff. He was 175ft (53m) from the bottom when he found himself unable to move up or down. HM Coastguard helicopter captain James Lorraine said the rescue was particularly difficult because of the boy's ""extremely perilous position"" on the cliff near Dover. He said the child had been stuck for about 30 minutes when he was found, and rescuers knew he could not hold on much longer. After they were unable to reach him because of the dense shrubbery, the helicopter took over ""with only minutes to spare"", he said. ""Thankfully, the rescue went smoothly and the boy was reunited with his family at the base of the cliff."" The child had scrapes and bruises, but area commander Matt Pavitt said it was a miracle he escaped without injury. ""He was very, very lucky,"" he said. ""The boy had been clinging on by his fingernails to stop himself from falling from the sheer rock face for just over 30 minutes and if he had let go this would have been a very different outcome.""

"Iran condemns Israeli 'aggression'In its first comments since Thursday's strikes, Iran backs Syria's ""right to defend itself"".4h4 hours agoMiddle East","The Israel Defense Forces released video of an air strike on a Syrian missile launcher Iran has backed Syria's ""right to defend itself"" after Israel launched strikes on what it said was Iranian military infrastructure inside Syria. In the first comments by Iran since Thursday's wave of strikes, the foreign ministry condemned the ""blatant violation of Syria's sovereignty"". The strikes were the heaviest carried out by Israel on Syria in decades. They came after 20 rockets were fired at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights. Israel said Iranian fighters had carried out that attack. Iran has neither directly confirmed or denied this but has said that Israel's attacks on Syria were founded ""on self-proclaimed, baseless pretexts"". Iran has deployed hundreds of troops in Syria, ostensibly as military advisers to the Syrian military. Thousands of militiamen armed, trained and financed by Iran have also been battling rebel forces alongside Syrian soldiers. On Thursday, in response to the Golan Heights attack, Israel said its fighter jets had struck almost all of Iran's military infrastructure inside Syria - some 70 targets - in its biggest assault since Syria's civil war started in 2011. Iran and Israel are enemies but have never fought a direct war. Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted on Iranian state TV as saying: ""Iran strongly condemns... [Israel's] attacks on Syria. The international community's silence encourages Israel's aggression. Syria has every right to defend itself."" This video can not be played Syrian state TV footage shows Israeli missiles over Damascus on Thursday Mr Qasemi said Israel ""cannot stand peace and stability in the region and sees its own safety in making the region all the more unstable"". He said Israel's ""baseless pretexts amount to a blatant violation of Syria's sovereignty and goes against all international conventions"". He did not refer to Iran's military presence inside Syria. Mr Qasemi said the attacks were an attempt by international supporters of rebel groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to shore them up after their ""many failures"" and to try to ""tip the scales in their favour"". The Syrian government, backed by Iran and Russia, has made significant gains over the rebel groups in the past year. Israel v Iran in 300 words Are Israel and Iran heading for a war? Iran and Israel: Your questions answered A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Iran had ""crossed a red line"" and Israel's action ""was a consequence"" of that. He said: ""We will not allow Iran to entrench itself in Syria. I delivered a clear message to the Assad regime - our action is directed against Iranian targets in Syria. However, if the Syrian military acts against us, we will act against it."" The Golan Heights, which Israel has annexed He added: ""Whoever hurts us, we will hurt them sevenfold, and whoever is preparing to hurt us, we will act to hit them first."" Visiting the Golan Heights on Friday, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman urged Mr Assad to ""throw the Iranians out"", saying ""they are only hurting you"". Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, called for a UN condemnation of Iran's ""acts of aggression"" and for the Security Council to ""demand that Iran remove its military presence from Syria"". The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that early on Thursday morning 20 rockets had been launched at its forward posts in the Golan Heights by the Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 50km (30 miles) from the capital Damascus. Israel occupied most of the area in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. The IDF said four rockets were intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome aerial defence system, while 16 fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage were reported. The IDF has published satellite images of sites that it struck,externalinside Syria in response. They include what it said were: Installations at Tel Gharba, Tel Kleb, Nabi Yusha and Tel Maqdad A Quds Force compound in al-Kiswah, south of Damascus An ""Iranian Logistics Compound"", 10km north-west of the capital (pictured below) Why is there a war in Syria? The Golan Heights explained US President Donald Trump's abandonment on Tuesday of a landmark international deal to curb Iran's nuclear programme - an agreement fiercely opposed by Mr Netanyahu - has certainly raised tensions. But Israel had already become increasingly worried about Iran's military support of Syria. Mr Netanyahu said the Revolutionary Guards had moved advanced weapons to Syria, including surface-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft batteries that would threaten Israeli fighter jets. Israel's military had been anticipating an attack by Iranian forces after reportedly carrying out a number of strikes on their facilities in Syria in recent months. They includedone on an airbase in April that killed seven Iranian troops. The Iran nuclear deal explained in five key points The deal lifted sanctions on Iran from 2015, allowing some big names - Boeing, Airbus, Total and Peugeot - to start doing business again. The re-imposition of sanctions has thrown all that into doubt. US firms have six months to stop trading with Iran. European companies, for instance Airbus, are affected too as they buy parts from the US. Europe's billion-dollar deals at stake in Iran row The sanctions issue has added to tensions between the US and its European allies over the nuclear deal.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says European companies should not have to pay for the US decision. The economy of Iran, a big exporter of oil and gas, is likely to be adversely affected. Are Israel and Iran heading for a war?

The film, directed by Ron Howard after theoriginal directors left mid-production, sees Solo beginning his pilot training and seeking a spaceship of his own. Writer and producer Adam Goldberg says it ""delivers in every way"". ""Funny, suspenseful, emotional, a truly epic origin story,"" he raves. ""If this film doesn't make your heart happy, then just give up on watching movies."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 over Brexit spending","Liz Bilney (left) has been referred to the police Campaign group Leave.EU has been fined Â£70,000 for breaches of election law in the 2016 EU referendum. The Electoral Commission said the group - which was separate from the official pro-Brexit group Vote Leave - failed to report ""at least"" Â£77,380 it spent. It has also referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police following its investigation into what it calls ""serious offences"". Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks called it a ""politically motivated attack"". Responding to theElectoral Commission's findings,external, he said: ""What a shambles, we will see them in court."" All you need to know about Brexit Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon EU referendum: The result in maps The investigation also looked into whether Leave.EU had received any services from Cambridge Analytica which should have been declared on its spending return but found no evidence that the group received donations or paid for services from the political consultancy. Leave.EU's relationship with the controversial firm ""did not develop beyond initial scoping work"", according to the Commission. The UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the European Union in a referendum in June 2016. All groups had to ensure they met campaign spending rules and filed accurate returns under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. This video can not be played Leave.EU has been fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law during referendum Founded by UKIP donor and businessman Arron Banks and backed by UKIP's Nigel Farage Self-styled ""bad boys of Brexit"" - the title of Banks's book on the campaign Lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official ""out"" campaign during the EU Referendum Relations between Vote Leave and Leave.EU soured during the campaign - Leave.EU argued it had a wider reach outside the ""Westminster bubble"" and focused its message more on immigration The Electoral Commission said Leave.EU had exceeded the spending limit for ""non-party registered campaigners"" by at least 10% by failing to include at least Â£77,380 in its spending return - the fee paid to campaign organiser Better for the Country Ltd - and added the overspend ""may well have been considerably higher than that"". Its spending return also did not include services Leave.EU had received from a US campaign strategy firm, Goddard Gunster, and the group ""inaccurately reported"" three loans totalling Â£6m from Mr Banks - including who had provided them - and did not provide invoices or receipts for 97 separate payments, totalling Â£80,224. The Commission has referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police, saying it had reasonable grounds to suspect she had committed criminal offences over campaign spending. Bob Posner, the Commission's director of political finance and regulation, said spending rules were in place to ensure public confidence in democracy and it was ""disappointing that Leave.EU, a key player in the EU referendum, was unable to abide by these rules"". ""These are serious offences. The level of fine we have imposed has been constrained by the cap on the Commission's fines,"" he added. But Mr Banks told the BBC's Daily Politics that Leave.EU had responded to the Commission with a 20-page report from an independent accountant which, he said, the watchdog had ""ignored completely"". He described the disputed amount as ""an internal management charge which our lawyers have told us wasn't reportable"" and claimed the Commission was staffed by pro-Remainers and the ruling was politically motivated. ""Effectively what they have done is, they started off their investigation with a remit of investigating Cambridge Analytica and dark Russian money - they have found no evidence of any of those things and they have fined us on a technical accounting issue which is heavily in dispute."" Mr Banks said they intended to challenge the finding in court. Electoral Commission chief executive Claire Bassett denied claims of bias made by Mr Banks. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The decisions were made by directors of the Electoral Commission, they were made based on robust evidence we had gathered, and indeed you can see that in the 30-page report that we published."" Leave.EU is not the only group to fall foul of spending rules in the EU Referendum campaign. TheLib Dems were fined Â£18,000and the official Remain campaign was fined Â£1,250 by the Commission last year. The official Vote Leave group - that was backed by cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove - isstill under investigation. Thepro-EU European Movement UK and UKIP have also been finedover their referendum spending. The maximum fine is Â£20,000 per offence - Leave.EU was fined for four separate offences.

Tories taught to be 'real' on Instagram,"This video can not be played Reporter Elizabeth Glinka tries out the advice from a Tory training presentation about social media Conservative MPs have been encouraged to show they are ""real people"" by being ""playful"" on Instagram, according to a document leaked to the BBC. Earlier this year, party chairman Brandon Lewis arranged sessions teaching MPs how to set up an account and project their personality on the video and picture sharing app, followingcriticism of the Conservatives' social media strategy. MPs from all parties have tried to use Instagram to show a more relaxed, human side. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Ten things we learned from following MPs on Instagram Who spent what on Facebook during 2017 election campaign? How the internet helped Labour at the general election The first slide of the Conservative presentation suggests that sophisticated use of Instagram could be a way to win over younger voters, who are the biggest users of the site. The party wants to reach younger voters through Instagram The guide for Conservative MPs begins with the very basics. The advice begins at the very beginning... Later slides encourage ""human shots"" and ""action shots"", and MPs are also advised to give concise biographies with a link to their website. Posting on Instagram might seem easy if you do it every day. But if you're not used to it, there's a lot to figure out. This slide uses a Boris Johnson selfie as a case study to show the meaning of various icons. Instagram can be confusing if you're not used to it Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was early to embrace Instagram. Animals are very popular on the app, and his timeline has featured dogs, owls and goats. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The Conservative presentation picks up on a post by Culture Secretary Matthew Hancock, in which he uses a screenshot of a letter from a 28-year-old man praising government efforts to crack down on online ticket touts, as a good example of ""storytelling,"" as opposed to bombarding people with statistics. Stories are seen as important as well as facts and figures Other slides encourage posts about historical events, like celebrating Churchill to coincide with the release of the film ""Darkest Hour"".

The Conservative presentation also advises MPs on how to make more creative posts, including a ""boomerang"". This is described as a ""playful option. Records a motion then plays back on itself - like a boomerang!"" Conservative MPs were shown some of the more fiddly ways to edit an image, such as adding blocks of text with coloured background while using the ""story"" function (a picture which deletes after 24 hours). The presentation also included advice on how to make posts look colourful Tory MPs were encouraged to poll their followers for ""interesting insights"". MPs were encouraged to use stickers and emojis Sir Peter Bottomley has been a Conservative MP since 1975 and is an unlikely social media star - he has a Twitter account but has never tweeted. However, on Instagram he seems to be something of a trailblazer, with his posts highlighted not once but twice in the Tory presentation. A picture of him signing a book to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day is highlighted as an example of promoting a serious cause by using a relevant hashtag, #HMD18. The presentation also gave special mention to a picture of Bottomley out campaigning with Margaret Thatcher which used the hashtag #TBT, or ""throwback Thursday"". Use of #TBT, or ""throwback Thursday"", is also encouraged Sajid Javid recently became home secretary. Before January, when this presentation was given to Conservative MPs, his feed was heavy on generic party graphics. Since then though, his posts have been become more light-hearted - though this sort of playfulness may be harder in his new job. Allow Instagram content?

Social media fans will know that timing is everything - and not every app follows the same pattern. Political Twitter tends to be busy in the daytime during the working week, and far quieter at the weekend. People tend to check Instagram in their leisure time, so Tory MPs have been advised to post in the evenings. Timing is everything, the document says But social media connoisseurs will know that evening posts carry risks, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. Fewer people tend to be online at those times because many are out enjoying themselves. Also, those who stay in may be wary of interacting with other people's posts, for fear of giving away the fact that they are sat at home checking Instagram.

'Chaos' as part of M1 closes for weekend,"The M1 is being closed so a bridge can be put in place for the new Kegworth bypass in Leicestershire Drivers including football fans and people catching flights have been warned to expect disruption while part of the M1 is closed over the weekend. Junctions 23A to 24, near East Midlands Airport, will shut from 22:00 BST on Friday to 15:00 on Sunday. Fulham FC fans had asked for the closure to be put back an hour because of their match against Derby County. But Segro, which is putting a bridge in place for a new bypass, said it had advised of the closures since March. Highways England authorised the motorway closure but is not involved in the construction of the Kegworth bypass. Former MP Tom Greatrex, who is chairman of the Fulham Supporters Trust, expects to be stuck in congested traffic for several hours after leaving the Pride Park stadium in Derby on Friday night. He asked Highways England if they could close the road an hour later. ""It's not Highways England's fault as the game has been scheduled at short notice on a Friday night, but I thought it might make a bit of sense to avoid a whole load of chaos by starting an hour later,"" he said. ""The closure is going to start at 10 o'clock and at about quarter to ten, roughly, there will be about 30,000 other people coming out of the Derby ground. ""I would expect a chunk of those would normally be heading towards the M1 by car."" People will be able to drive along the A453 instead while the M1 is closed Segro said in a statement: ""This project has taken months of intricate work with numerous organisations and we began advising of the closures in March to help people plan their diversions. ""Given the high level of planning and coordination involved in this project, we regret that we can't change the timings this close to start of the operation. ""We apologise for any inconvenience caused.""

Britons 'kidnapped' in DR CongoA female wildlife ranger is said to have been killed in the incident in the Virunga National Park.1h40 minutes agoUK,"The national park is known for its mountain gorillas Two British tourists are among three people to have been kidnapped in a national park in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The director of the Virunga National Park - known for its endangered mountain gorillas - said their vehicle was ambushed by gunmen who killed a park ranger and also seized the driver. The incident took place just north of the city of Goma, North Kivu province. The Foreign Office said it was supporting the families. It also said it was in close contact with the DRC authorities. Local media reports say the ranger shot dead was a female guard, while the UK citizens were taken along with their Congolese driver. Park director Emmanuel de Merode told the AFP news agency: ""I confirm that our vehicle was attacked. Three people were kidnapped, including two tourists."" The BBC's Louise Dewast, reporting from the country's capital Kinshasa, said the situation was ""very serious"". She said there were armed groups operating in the park and there had been kidnappings before, with half of these involving a ransom. The kidnapping took place in a military area and the national army was ""most likely"" responding to the situation, our correspondent added. The national park, which runs along the border with Uganda and Rwanda, covers 3,000 sq miles (7,800 sq km). It is a Unesco world heritage site and is home to critically-endangered mountain gorillas as well as lions, elephants and hippos. In April, Mr de Merode,told the BBC World Servicethat recent attacks were part of ""a bigger picture which involves the trafficking of natural resources"". He said the park was protected by around 800 rangers but there were also estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 militia in and around the park. There have been a number of killings and kidnappings in recent years. Five rangers and a driver were killed in the park on 9 April. A week earlier, a park ranger died in an attack by armed men as he guarded the construction site of a hydroelectric plant. BBC Africa editor Will Ross said poachers were active in the park, which was also under threat due to the illegal felling of trees to make charcoal and plans for oil exploration. Wildlife authorities have tried to protect it but 170 rangers have been killed over the last 20 years, he added. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to Goma and has urged Britons not to go beyond the city.

"Massive wave 'sets hemisphere record'The 23.8m (78ft) swell is the largest ever recorded below the equator, New Zealand scientists say.9h9 hours agoAsia","The wave was measured by a buoy at Campbell Island in the Southern Ocean Scientists in New Zealand have documented what they believe is the largest wave ever recorded in the southern hemisphere. The 23.8m (78ft) wave was measured by a buoy on New Zealand's Campbell Island in the Southern Ocean on Tuesday, the country's weather authority said. It eclipses a 22.03m wave that was identified south of the Australian state of Tasmania in 2012. Larger waves have been recorded in the northern hemisphere. The Meteorological Service of New Zealand (MetService) installed its solar-powered buoy in March. The area is known for big storm activity, but waves had been previously difficult to measure. The ""eight-storey high"" wave was generated by a deep low pressure system and 65-knot winds, said MetService senior oceanographer Dr Tom Durrant. ""This is a very exciting event and to our knowledge it is the largest wave ever recorded in the southern hemisphere,"" he told the BBC. The buoy operates for 20 minutes every three hours. Dr Durrant said it was possible that even bigger waves were generated by the storm but not recorded. The World Meteorological Organization does not hold official records on individual wave heights. Instead, it records an average of successive swells - a measure known as the ""significant wave height"". During the storm recorded by New Zealand, the significant wave height was 14.9m. That is a record for the Southern Ocean but below a19m mark measured by a buoy in the North Atlantic,externalin 2016, Dr Durrant said. He said storms moved across the Southern Ocean largely unhindered due to a lack of land. ""[It is] the engine room for generating swell waves that then propagate throughout the planet,"" he said. ""Indeed surfers in California can expect energy from this storm to arrive at their shores in about a week's time.""

Grammar and faith schools to expand,"Grammar schools in England are being given the chance to create thousands of new places in a trimmed-down selective school expansion programme. The expanded wholly selective schools will have to set out plans to admit disadvantaged pupils, perhaps by lowering the entrance requirements. It comes after Theresa May's scheme for a new wave of grammars was abandoned due to lack of Parliamentary support. Plans for new faith schools have also been announced. But instead of making it easier for religious groups to open free schools, ministers will invite councils to open faith schools jointly with religious groups, as they have done in the past. As with other faith schools in the state sector, they will be allowed to recruit 100% of pupils from particular faith groups. Grammar schools: What are they? Grammar schools are controversial as they select all their pupils on the basis of ability tests, known as the 11-plus, which children take at the age of 10 or 11. Opponents say they ""cream off"" the smartest pupils from neighbouring schools. Mr Hinds said the plans, which invite grammar schools to bid for cash from a Â£50m expansion fund, would ""give parents greater choice"". The funding was originally part of a bigger package of proposals to bring back selective education, but it comes at a time when schools across England are struggling with their budgets. Teachers' union leaders have criticised the move as a misuse of school spending. Kevin Courtney, leader of the National Education Union, said: ""The grammar school corpse has climbed out of its coffin once again despite evidence of the damage that selective education causes."" The trimmed-down expansion plans will allow grammars to grow bigger or to develop spin-off sites along the lines of theSevenoaks ""annexe"" built by Weald of Kent Grammar School in Tonbridge last year. This school is 10 miles from its main site, and has room for 450 pupils. Schools have been warning about budget shortages The National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of School and College Leaders said it was wrong to fund grammar schools when school budgets were tight. But the Grammar School Heads' Association welcomed the move. It has been working with the Department for Education on the expansion idea and has agreed the way forward. Chief executive Jim Skinner said: ""We are very pleased that, like other good and outstanding schools, selective schools now have access to a fund to allow them to expand their premises. ""This is particularly important at a time when there are increasing numbers of pupils reaching secondary age and such a high demand for selective school places."" Last week, in an address to head teachers, Mr Hindsacknowledged the funding pressure on schools, but did not offer any short-term prospect of extra funds. The Conservatives also promised during the election campaign to remove the cap on faith-based free schools, which stops them allocating more than 50% of their places on grounds of religion - which would have brought them in line with other faith schools in the state sector. But the government has ditched this promise - and instead says it will provide funds for local authorities to create a new generation of ""voluntary-aided"" faith schools. These will be able to be fully selective on grounds of religion - and the funding for their creation will be taken from the pot of money set for the creation of new free schools. The Local Government Association welcomed the government's decision to work with councils to open new schools. But it said the focus should not be exclusively on selective, faith-based and free schools and that the best way to meet the demand for school places was to let councils open more schools themselves. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: ""The continued obsession with grammar schools will do nothing for the vast majority of children, and it is absurd for ministers to push ahead with plans to expand them when the evidence is clear that they do nothing to improve social mobility."" But Katie Ivens, from the Campaign for Real Education, said middle-class children dominated grammar schools because there were not enough places available. ""If you spread grammar school places throughout the country and make them available to lots of disadvantaged children then you would give these disadvantaged children the same opportunity to get an academic education."" Ellie Mulcahy, senior research associate at education and youth think and action tank LKMco, said: ""Even if these grammar schools open up their entry to allow a proportion of disadvantaged pupils to come in, that will be only for those who do well in the test, whether they've been coached or not. ""We really need to be thinking about the majority of pupils that wouldn't be able to get into these schools and the fact that they, just as much as their peers who have attained more highly on that particular test, deserve to have a really high-quality education."" Archbishop Malcolm MacMahon, speaking on behalf of the Catholic education sector, said the government had ""broken a promise"" over changes to free school admissions - but Humanists UK described the retention of their 50% cap as a ""victory for integration"". The Church of England welcomed the opportunity to open new schools - and said dropping the plans to change the rules over free schools would not ""impact on that commitment"". Launching the plans, Mr Hinds said: ""Children only get one chance at an education and they deserve the best, wherever they live and whatever their background. ""By creating new schools where they are needed most and helping all great schools to grow, we can give parents greater choice in looking at schools that are right for their family - and give children of all backgrounds access to a world-class education.""

'Chaos' as part of M1 closes for weekendDrivers including football fans and people catching flights are being warned to expect disruption.2h2 hours agoLeicester,"The M1 is being closed so a bridge can be put in place for the new Kegworth bypass in Leicestershire Drivers including football fans and people catching flights have been warned to expect disruption while part of the M1 is closed over the weekend. Junctions 23A to 24, near East Midlands Airport, will shut from 22:00 BST on Friday to 15:00 on Sunday. Fulham FC fans had asked for the closure to be put back an hour because of their match against Derby County. But Segro, which is putting a bridge in place for a new bypass, said it had advised of the closures since March. Highways England authorised the motorway closure but is not involved in the construction of the Kegworth bypass. Former MP Tom Greatrex, who is chairman of the Fulham Supporters Trust, expects to be stuck in congested traffic for several hours after leaving the Pride Park stadium in Derby on Friday night. He asked Highways England if they could close the road an hour later. ""It's not Highways England's fault as the game has been scheduled at short notice on a Friday night, but I thought it might make a bit of sense to avoid a whole load of chaos by starting an hour later,"" he said. ""The closure is going to start at 10 o'clock and at about quarter to ten, roughly, there will be about 30,000 other people coming out of the Derby ground. ""I would expect a chunk of those would normally be heading towards the M1 by car."" People will be able to drive along the A453 instead while the M1 is closed Segro said in a statement: ""This project has taken months of intricate work with numerous organisations and we began advising of the closures in March to help people plan their diversions.

May splits cabinet to seek Brexit solutionThe PM sets up two working parties in a bid to hammer out differences over customs plans.2h2 hours agoUK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Theresa May has divided her top team of ministers into two working groups to hammer out their differences on Brexit. The cabinet is split over how to manage customs arrangements with the EU. Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson are against Mrs May's preferred option of a ""customs partnership"", which is backed by Remain-voting ministers. Mr Johnson's preferred model relies on technology to minimise customs checks. The EU has expressed doubts about whether either option would work. The prime minister has said further work is needed to come up with a solution that will deliver on her promise of frictionless trade without the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Kuenssberg: Is there another Brexit way for May? Reality Check: The government's customs options UK-EU customs partnership 'still on table' Why is the customs union so important? She is under pressure to find a solution to present to the EU at the next round of Brexit talks, with just five months left to get an agreement on post-Brexit trade, so it can be ratified before Britain leaves in March next year. Mr Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond - who are thought to have been at loggerheads over the customs issue - will not play a role in either of the two working groups. Brexiteer and Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Remainer and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley will sit in different groups One group - Brexiteers Michael Gove and Liam Fox and Remain-backing Cabinet Office minister David Lidington - will consider a ""customs partnership"" whereby the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU - but without the need for new border checks. Downing Street said this group would be discussing how to make trade deals with non-EU countries - something Brexiteers say would be impossible under this option. The other group - Remain-backing Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Remain-voting Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley - will look at ""maximum facilitation"" - a solution based on using technology to minimise the need for customs checks after Brexit. The members of this group will be looking at how to avoid the return of a hard Irish border. The work was being carried out ""as a priority,"" the prime minister's official spokesman said. The next meeting of the cabinet's Brexit sub-committee is on Tuesday. All EU members are part of the customs union which means there are no tariffs on goods transported between member states. Labour is in favour of setting up a new customs union with the EU after Brexit, something it says is backed by the trade unions and industry body the CBI. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. The customs partnership is thought to be the prime minister's preferred option butForeign Secretary Boris Johnson has described it as ""crazy""and said it would create ""a whole new web of bureaucracy"". Please upgrade your browser The maximum facilitation proposal - also known as ""max-fac"" - would employ new technologies and trusted trader schemes to remove the need for physical customs checks. Trusted trader schemes would enable companies to pay duties every few months rather than every time they crossed the border. Considering this option will be Remainers Business Secretary Greg Clark and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and the pro-Leave Brexit Secretary David Davis. The customs union ensures EU member states all apply the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals. The UK government has said it wants to leave the EU customs union in order to strike its own trade deals with other countries. Ministers are under pressure to have made progress on the issue before next month's EU summit.

Grenfell inquiry 'whitewash' upsets families,"The Grenfell Tower fire inquiry could become a whitewash unless there is a diverse panel to oversee proceedings, survivors and bereaved families say. They say chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick should sit with people from a range of backgrounds who understand the issues facing those affected by the blaze, in which 71 people died on 14 June. They have started a petition calling for Theresa May to intervene. The government said the process of considering the panel was ongoing. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Inside the 21st floor of the Grenfell Tower fire Backlash over Tories' Grenfell leaflet Sir Martin's appointment as the inquiry chairman has already been criticised by residents, who say he is an establishment figure. Victims groups were further angered when the retired Court of Appeal judge said he would not appoint a member of the Grenfell community to the panel, arguing it would ""risk undermining impartiality"". Adel Chaoui, who lost four relatives in the fire, said their complaint was ""not about ethnicity"". ""It's nothing to do with whether you're black, white, Arab, whatever - it is to do with experiences,"" he said. ""(Sir Martin) is very, very good at what he does, but he does not necessarily understand us. ""At the same time, we are up against these industry bodies that are spending millions of pounds on legal resources that we are never going to get anywhere near."" Sir Martin has been criticised by some families as an establishment figure Mr Chaoui said he and others would likely not attend the inquiry unless the format was changed. He added: ""I'm really hoping the Prime Minister sees all we're asking for is a fair crack at justice."" Thepetition,externalorganisers say about 50 victims are backing the call for Downing Street to add people to the panel who have the ""breadth and experience"" of the ""big social issues"" that led to the tragedy. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle Hesham Rahman died in the fire, said: ""We don't want to whitewash this inquiry, we don't want to feel like we're not being listened to, or belittled, or ignored just like the residents were before and after the [fire at the] tower."" Hesham Rahman's body was recovered from the 23rd floor of the tower block Sir Martin has appointed three assessors to the inquiry, which will open its first procedural hearing on 11 December. One of the assessors is from a black and ethnic minority background. But Sandra Ruiz, who lost her niece in the tower blaze, has said the assessors have ""no decision-making capacity"". ""I think it's just a nod to what we've been asking but I don't think there's enough of a response there,"" she added. Karim Mussilhy and Sandra Ruiz are calling on Theresa May to use special powers to appoint more diverse panel members to the Grenfell Tower inquiry A government spokesman said: ""The prime minister has given a commitment to consider the inquiry panel after the chair determined what further expertise he required, and this process is ongoing. ""We would like to assure all those affected by the tragedy that legal representatives of core participants will receive all relevant evidence, be able to offer opening and closing statements at hearings, and will be able to suggest lines of questioning for witnesses.""

U-turn over Grenfell fire inquiry panel,"This video can not be played Karim Mussilhy from the Grenfell United group welcomed the news The government has agreed that two experts will sit with the judge investigating the Grenfell Tower fire, following pressure from campaigners. They had called for a diverse panel to oversee proceedings, saying the inquiry risked being a ""whitewash"". Theresa May, who had earlier rejected calls for a panel, said the hearings would now have the ""breadth of skills and diversity of expertise"". The blaze in west London on 14 June last year killed 71 people. The first phase of Judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick'sinquiry,externalwill start taking evidence on 21 May. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Inside the 21st floor of the Grenfell Tower fire 'Three Billboards' stunt for Grenfell Tower Up to now he had been helped by a legal team, civil servants and three assessors in reviewing and identifying documents and relevant material. The hearings will examine the outbreak of the blaze and hear from firefighters, survivors and expert witnesses. The new panel will join the second phase of the inquiry, which is not expected to begin until after December. It will look at areas including the modifications made to Grenfell Tower before the fire, and the relationship between the different organisations responsible for safety, including Kensington and Chelsea Council. Survivors' groups had been urging the prime minister to bring in a panel to help oversee the hearings. More than 156,000 people signed a petition calling for individuals from a range of backgrounds to sit alongside Sir Martin. The fire on 14 June last year killed 71 people The Grenfell United group, which represents survivors and the bereaved, said the change in the government's stance had come about after lots of hard work. It said it would mean the inquiry could ""get to the truth of why our community was not listened to when we raised concerns"". Adel Chaoui, the Grenfell United spokesman who lost four relatives, said survivors were ""relieved"" by the announcement. ""This panel means that the inquiry will have the expertise it needs to get to the truth of why our community was not listened to when we raised concerns, why such a dangerous refurbishment could be allowed to go ahead and all the issues that led up to that awful night,"" he added. Karim Mussilhy, who lost an uncle, said: ""We're disappointed that we've had to go through all of this to get the prime minister to listen. But she has listened and we thank her for taking our consideration seriously."" Mrs May had previously rejected calls for additional panel members, although she said this could be reviewed. Mrs May said she wanted the panel to be ""relevant to the broad range of issues to be considered in phase two, and to best serve the increasing scale and complexity of the work going forwards"". In aletter to Sir Martin,,externalshe said: ""I hope this decision will provide reassurance to victims and the survivors of the fire, the local community, and members of Grenfell United, who have been clear... that you are the right person to lead this inquiry but who also believe that, in phase two, it would be beneficial to have additional panel members"". This video can not be played Grenfell victims Marco and Gloria as fairy tale heroes Mrs May said she would write to Sir Martin again ""once suitable panel members have been identified"". The announcement came the day a group of people affected by the fire in North Kensington were invited to speak to Mrs May at Downing Street. Among them was artist Damel Carayol, who lost his niece in the fire. He presented Mrs May with a print of his painting entitled Grenfell Tower: Eyesore!! Final Straw. Damel Carayol presented Theresa May with a print of his painting inspired by the tragedy Downing Street said the print would be displayed in No 10. MPs will also hold a debate about the Grenfell fire in the Commons on Monday. The Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, said Parliament would debate the appointments and the inquiry and she planned to seek clarification on the way it would operate.

'New' grammar school opens,"This video can not be played The new annex to the Weald of Kent Grammar School England's first ""new"" grammar school in five decades has opened. Tonbridge's Weald of Kent Grammar School has built a Â£19m ""annexe"" in Sevenoaks, 10 miles from its main site, with room for 450 pupils. Head teacher Maureen Johnson said only 1-2% of pupils are from disadvantaged backgrounds but is working to encourage ""interest from those groups"". Anti-grammar school campaigners Kent Education Network (KEN) described the venture as ""wrong"". The new annex to the Weald of Kent Grammar School The school, which has been funded by Kent County Council, is for girls only up until a co-educational sixth form. It will have an intake of 114 girls in year 7 at the new annexe and is expected to reach capacity with the addition of each new year group. As part of the agreement, both sites have to operate as one school and pupils in the annexe will visit the Tonbridge site at least once every two weeks. This video can not be played Parents' thoughts on England's first 'new' grammar school in 50 years Roger Gough, Conservative councillor for Sevenoaks and head of education at the county council, said: ""Grammar provision has been available to Sevenoaks children, but they've had to travel out of the town and district to go there, so I don't believe this will make a difference to other schools or children in the area. ""This shows it can be done and when it comes to boys' provision in Sevenoaks, an annex may be an option as well. But across the county as a whole I don't think it's going to be something you'll see sprouting up in lots of places."" There are 163 grammar schools across England of which 32 - nearly 20% - are in Kent In 1965, the education department told local authorities to convert to a comprehensive system It was not compulsory and some authorities retained grammar systems, including Kent Labour put a ban on new grammars in 1998, labelling them ""divisive"" and unfair In October 2015 the Conservative governmentbacked Kent's plan for ""genuine expansion"", despite opposition Anti-grammar campaigners Comprehensive Future initially challenged the plan and said it was taking advice on a judicial review, but dropped the case saying it it had not been given enough details to argue its case in court In 2016 Theresa May set out proposals for school reform, including anew generation of grammar schoolsby 2020 In May 2017, a report by Education Datalab suggested ""heavily"" selective Kent grammar schools""understate the true academic abilities""of poorer children in their entrance tests Following the snap election in June, plans to expand the number of grammars wereleft out of the Queen's Speech in June Grammar schools: What are they? The persistent appeal of grammar schools Joanne Bartley, chair of KEN said: ""Theresa May had hoped to reverse the law banning new grammars but failed because the change would never have passed in the new Parliament after the election in June. Meanwhile, Kent County Council has ignored the spirit of the law and has effectively built a new grammar school in Sevenoaks. ""The existence of this new grammar annexe teaches children that it's OK to bend the rules if you want something badly enough and need to get around an inconvenient law."" With Sevenoaks the only major Kent town previously without a grammar school, chairman of governors David Bower said:  ""It's an important day for west Kent rather than grammar schools. ""We know it's important to recognise that a lot of our girls come from privileged backgrounds and were coached. We're looking very carefully at our admissions code, which has already changed to allocate places for pupil premium [additional funding for schools to raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils] and other disadvantage indicators, and overcome the stigma from some families that grammar schools are not for them.""

Are parents driving grammar expansion?,"Ruth Cornish wants an academically selective education for Henry and Florence Like many mothers, Ruth Cornish started thinking about choosing secondary schools when her children were eight or nine years old. She wanted an academically selective school for Henry and Florence. The family live in Gloucestershire, a county with some of the oldest grammar schools in England. ""I do think it's harder for children to get good results, to get to university, get a good job.  So anything we can do to help them seems to me a no-brainer."" She's delighted that since 2010, every grammar school in Gloucestershire has added extra places, even though there hasn't been an increase in 11-year-olds. ""I think it's a consumer society - parental demand is there and children want to go."" There had been growing pressure for more places, with fears that competition was becoming fierce, with children travelling from outside the county to get in after passing the grammar school entrance test. Ruth told me: ""You research your chances and realise you're competing with Swindon, Wiltshire and Bristol."" Gloucestershire isn't the only place in England where grammars - academically selective schools that offer places based on an exam taken in the last year of primary school - are expanding. Our analysis shows how much grammar schools have grown across England since 2010, often not in areas where there was an immediate need for more secondary places overall. Ruth Cornish believes parents want grammars The number of pupils aged 11-15 in England's grammar schools has gone from 110,600 in 2009-10 to 118,200 in 2016-17. That's a 7% growth at a time when the number of 11 to 15-year-olds in the areas with grammar schools has fallen by 2.5%. It adds up to the equivalent of about 11 new average-sized grammar schools. As more children go through the schools, with new pupils taking up those places every year, it means that by 2020-21 the equivalent of 21 new grammar schools would have been created in a decade. All this is at a time when the government has dropped plans to create completely new grammar schools because the plans were too controversial. For a full list scroll to the bottom of the page. The expansion is driven partly by demand from parents like Ruth, and partly by pressure on school budgets. Grammar schools tend to get less funding per pupil because many are in areas where schools have historically received less. They also admit very few pupils from poorer backgrounds, who bring top-up funding in the form of the pupil premium. Many grammar schools we approached were hesitant about talking publicly about the financial pressures. Alcester Grammar School in Warwickshire has been expanding its intake over the last few years from 450 to 750 students. Its Principal, Clive Sentance, says it is mainly about ""achieving major economies of scale"". He says the school has taken action to respond to financial challenges from increasing class sizes to asking for voluntary donations but believes that without expanding pupil numbers, those steps ""would not have been sufficient"". Grammar schools are state secondary schools that select their pupils by means of an exam taken by children at age 11, sometimes known as the 11-plus. There are 163 grammar schools in England, out of some 3,000 state secondaries, and a further 67 grammar schools in Northern Ireland. There are no state grammars in Wales or Scotland. There are concerns that grammar school expansion could reach a tipping point in terms of its impact. Jon Andrews from the Education Policy Institute says negative effects on results increase at the point when 70% of children already doing well can get a grammar school place. ""Our research shows that as you increase the number of grammar school places in an area, the penalties on those who miss out on getting into grammar school increase."" Poorer children are least likely to get a grammar school place and most likely to suffer this negative effect. This doesn't mean that schools that don't select on ability don't have ambition. Stratford upon Avon School has been improving its results and encouraging pupils to go into its sixth form thinking ambitiously about university. Head teacher Neil Wallace knows he has to compete to attract families to the school. He is also competing for funding, as with each pupil that enrols comes at least Â£4,000 a year. Neil Wallace is head at Stratford upon Avon School ""The biggest source of income any school has is intake. Adding an additional class of 30 would bring in roundly Â£120,000 to a school budget in each year."" Both grammar schools nearby have expanded significantly. ""That's a tension regardless of what the school is. It may be selective or not selective, it could be a free school that opens and upsets a local equilibrium."" Warwickshire has seen the number of 11-year-olds go up 7% since 2010, but one nearby grammar school increased its intake by 66%. Data analysis by Wesley Stephenson, Ransome Mpini and Robert Cuffe. Design by Sumi Senthinathan and Sandra Rodriguez Chillida. Methodology: The analysis uses data from theschools census,externalpublished on the Department for Education website. It looks at the change in the number of pupils aged 11-15 in nearly all grammar schools in England between 2009-10 academic year and the 2016-17 academic year. A comparison is made between this and the change in the total number of pupils aged 11-15 in the local authority areas in which each grammar is located. * Data excludes three grammar schools that changed the age of intake during the period. Poole Grammar School Parkstone Grammar School Cranbrook School, Kent ** Boston High School and Boston Grammar School were undergoing a merger in 2010 which was later abandoned. This has some effect on some but not all of the growth at these schools. *** Chatham and Clarendon Grammar School was created in 2013 from the merger of two grammar schools. Change is calculated using the combined data for the two schools in 2009-10. What now for grammar schools? 'New' grammar school opens to pupils Grammar schools: What are they?

'Grammar school changed my life',"Pupils at Harold Hill in 1963: The grammar school was abolished a decade later When Norma Jennings talks about grammar schools, she does not talk about statistics or education policy, she talks about her memories of teachers and how her schooldays still make such a strong impression decades later. The debate about creating new grammar schools in England has heard many attacks on the negative impact of selection. But to understand the durable appeal of grammars, there's a need to consider a different type of evidence, the personal experiences of former pupils, who can feel that their memories have been shouted down in all the political exchanges. Norma Jennings has helped to write the history of her old school - Harold Hill Grammar School in Essex - which was abolished as a grammar school in 1973. And her memories encapsulate how the grammars have retained such a hold on the post-War imagination. She sent a copy of the book to Prime Minister Theresa May with a letter about what she thought had been lost when most of the grammar system was scrapped. School berets are ceremonially dismantled at the end of the school year in 1964 Harold Hill Grammar School was built in the mid-1950s to serve new overspill estates built in Essex to accommodate thousands of east London families needing homes after the Second World War. It was a piece of deliberate social planning, designed to take the brightest children and create a new generation of professionals. Mrs Jennings, who left the school in 1963, says it's easy to forget how radical and ""revolutionary"" all this seemed. Working-class children were being given the chance to have an education that would never have been within the reach of their parents. For these children, the first generation of the post-War welfare state, this was a system of free milk and opportunity, and Harold Hill was part of a wave of hundreds of new secondary schools built for an expanding, ambitious population. Norma Jennings taking part in a school play in the early 1960s Mrs Jennings's memories also refer to another touchstone of grammar schools - the strong impression made by teachers. At a recent reunion, she said, there were stories of pupils who had kept in touch with their former teachers all their lives. For schoolgirls in the 1950s, unlikely to come across many women in professions, female teachers were inspiring role models for staying in education and having a career. Mrs Jennings talks of the ""intellectual life of the school"", separate from academic achievement, with teachers setting up all kind of clubs and societies, and leaving pupils with a ""stamp of curiosity"". Facing the future with confidence: Pupils at Harold Hill in the early 1960s It was also a time of assumed values, when the head teacher could unselfconsciously write about staff being able to ""distinguish what is first-rate from what is not"". Much of the symbolism and the cut-and-paste Latin might have been borrowed from public schools. But what made grammar schools so distinctive was that the pupils were not from the playing fields of Eton but the overspill estates of Essex. And these schools, with a strong sense of their own identity, often left an intense impression on those who spent time there. Harold Hill was very much a ""product of its time"", says Mrs Jennings. And it's hard to know how much the school could be separated from the era. Boys and girls had separate playgrounds at the school This was a time of boys being known only by their surnames, teachers wearing gowns, there were hymns and prize-givings, boys and girls were segregated into separate playgrounds and miscreants faced the cane. It was also a type of education available only to the minority who passed the 11-plus. But as a child Mrs Jennings was not aware of such debates, and she says there was no sense of social separation. You can only remember the schooldays you had - and not what it meant for those who missed out. Harold Hill's history also touches on another long shadow over the grammar debate. How grammar schools were closed has left an often unhappy legacy, with a sense of schools being dismantled without sufficient care for what was being lost. Theresa May was part of the generation at school when grammars became comprehensives Mrs Jennings says it would have been better if there had been a way to adapt the selection system, rather than shutting down the grammar schools. She says the mergers with secondary moderns were often rushed and disruptive, with buildings scattered across different sites. Mrs Jennings went on to train as a teacher and spent a happy career in comprehensives, but she still describes the way grammars were abolished as a ""disaster"". Many former grammar teachers struggled in their new environments. And there was a whole demographic of pupils at school who faced this upheaval in the 1970s - with a long wake of turbulence, as former grammars readjusted to their new identity. Mrs May is one of the most high profile of this generation, starting at a grammar that became a comprehensive. And who knows how much this has been a shaping experience? Harold Hill's merger with a secondary modern was not to be long-lasting. The comprehensive that emerged has also disappeared, and the site has now been redeveloped for housing. Nothing exists of it apart from the memories of former pupils. Harold Hill was part of a huge wave of post-War school building Another former pupil of Harold Hill, Colin Sparrow, says his grammar school days were a ""melting pot"" of different social classes and he had a very positive experience. But he says if the grammar system had survived, the school would have been ""a very different animal"" from the one he attended in the 1960s. In terms of whether they were elitist, he quotes Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee, speaking in 1945: ""I am myself in favour of an educational system which will break down class barriers, and will preserve the unity of the nation, but I am also in favour of variety and entirely opposed to the abolition of old traditions and the levelling down of everything to dull uniformity."" Reconciling those ambitions still seems to be as elusive. Remembering Harold Hill Grammar School by Don Martin and Norma Jennings, Lavenham Press, Suffolk.

May splits cabinet to seek Brexit solution,"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Theresa May has divided her top team of ministers into two working groups to hammer out their differences on Brexit. The cabinet is split over how to manage customs arrangements with the EU. Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson are against Mrs May's preferred option of a ""customs partnership"", which is backed by Remain-voting ministers. Mr Johnson's preferred model relies on technology to minimise customs checks. The EU has expressed doubts about whether either option would work. The prime minister has said further work is needed to come up with a solution that will deliver on her promise of frictionless trade without the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Kuenssberg: Is there another Brexit way for May? Reality Check: The government's customs options UK-EU customs partnership 'still on table' Why is the customs union so important? She is under pressure to find a solution to present to the EU at the next round of Brexit talks, with just five months left to get an agreement on post-Brexit trade, so it can be ratified before Britain leaves in March next year. Mr Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond - who are thought to have been at loggerheads over the customs issue - will not play a role in either of the two working groups. Brexiteer and Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Remainer and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley will sit in different groups One group - Brexiteers Michael Gove and Liam Fox and Remain-backing Cabinet Office minister David Lidington - will consider a ""customs partnership"" whereby the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU - but without the need for new border checks. Downing Street said this group would be discussing how to make trade deals with non-EU countries - something Brexiteers say would be impossible under this option. The other group - Remain-backing Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Remain-voting Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley - will look at ""maximum facilitation"" - a solution based on using technology to minimise the need for customs checks after Brexit. The members of this group will be looking at how to avoid the return of a hard Irish border. The work was being carried out ""as a priority,"" the prime minister's official spokesman said. The next meeting of the cabinet's Brexit sub-committee is on Tuesday. All EU members are part of the customs union which means there are no tariffs on goods transported between member states. Labour is in favour of setting up a new customs union with the EU after Brexit, something it says is backed by the trade unions and industry body the CBI. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. The customs partnership is thought to be the prime minister's preferred option butForeign Secretary Boris Johnson has described it as ""crazy""and said it would create ""a whole new web of bureaucracy"". Please upgrade your browser The maximum facilitation proposal - also known as ""max-fac"" - would employ new technologies and trusted trader schemes to remove the need for physical customs checks. Trusted trader schemes would enable companies to pay duties every few months rather than every time they crossed the border. Considering this option will be Remainers Business Secretary Greg Clark and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and the pro-Leave Brexit Secretary David Davis. The customs union ensures EU member states all apply the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals. The UK government has said it wants to leave the EU customs union in order to strike its own trade deals with other countries. Ministers are under pressure to have made progress on the issue before next month's EU summit.

"Barclays boss fined Â£642,000 by regulators","Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has been fined Â£642,430 by regulators for breaching rules by trying to identify a whistleblower. The Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority said he failed to ""act with due skill, care and diligence"" in his response to an anonymous letter received in June 2016. The FCA and PRA began their probe into Mr Staley's conduct a year ago. Barclays said it would cut his bonus,externalby Â£500,000. Directors delayed deciding how much Mr Staley's bonus would be docked until the investigation was complete and they knew the penalty imposed. Mr Staley said: ""I have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate, and I have apologised for mistakes which I made. ""I accept the conclusions of the board, the FCA, and the PRA, following their respective investigations, and the sanctions which they have each applied."" Mr Staley earned Â£2.35m in 2016 and received a bonus of Â£1.3m. The fine amounts to about a fifth of his total compensation. It would have been more than Â£900,000, but he was given a 30% discount for settling at an early stage. Many will think that Jes Staley has got off lightly. He still has his job and the regulators stopped short of saying that he was unfit to continue in post, which would have surely ended his career at Barclays and possibly in banking altogether. As chief executive of Barclays, Mr Staley should have been setting an example of how to deal with whistleblowing. Instead, when he received anonymous allegations against a senior member of staff, who was also a friend, he set the bank's own internal investigations unit to work to discover the identity of the whistleblower. That matters, because after the credit crunch and bailout of the banking sector, regulators introduced vigorous rules to encourage those with concerns of wrongdoing to come forward. Mr Staley's actions directly undermined that very safety valve. Jes Staley now has the distinction of being the first boss of a major financial institution to have been fined by the regulators and to have kept his job. The issue dates back to June 2016, when members of the Barclays board received anonymous letters raising concerns about a senior employee who had been recruited by the bank earlier that year. The letters, which were treated as whistleblowing, raised concerns of a personal nature about the senior employee, and Mr Staley's knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer. They also raised questions over the appropriateness of the recruitment process followed by Barclays on this occasion. Mr Staley asked the bank's security chief, Troels Oerting, to attempt to identify the authors of the letters, which the chief executive thought were an unfair personal attack on the senior employee. Mr Oerting, who formerly worked for Europol, contacted US federal law enforcement agencies to help track down the letter's origin, which had a US postmark. Regulators will keep an eye in future on how Barclays oversees whistleblowing. They have told the bank to report to it every year to explain how it handles any issues. This includes making senior managers give personal assurances that whistleblowing protocols are being followed properly. Mark Steward, from the FCA, said: ""Given the crucial role of the chief executive, the standard of due skill, care and diligence is more demanding than for other employees. ""Mr Staley breached the standard of care required and expected of a chief executive in a way that risked undermining confidence in Barclays' whistleblowing procedures."" Barclays, though, noted in its statement that there were no findings by the FCA or PRA that Mr Staley acted with a lack of integrity nor any findings that he lacks fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role. The chairman, John McFarlane, said Barclays and its investors stood behind Mr Staley: ""The board has reiterated its support for Jes, as have shareholders at last week's annual general meeting.""

Can a landlord kick me out?,"Millions of people pay monthly rent to a landlord for a room or a home, but many will be unclear about their rights as a tenant. BBC News asked Citizens Advice to answer the 20 most commonly asked questions. Your landlord can't evict you during the fixed term of a tenancy unless you breach a term in the tenancy agreement, such as not paying rent or damaging the property, unless there is a break clause in your agreement. If you stay in the home beyond the fixed term and your landlord wants possession without a reason, they must give you at least two months' notice, often called a section 21 notice. There are a number of rules the landlord must follow for the notice to be valid. The landlord must apply to court for possession of the property if you don't leave when the notice expires. You should get advice from an independent adviser, like Citizens Advice, if you receive a notice. In Scotland, residential tenancies are open-ended, so tenants cannot be asked to leave simply because they have come to the end of the tenancy. If the landlord has grounds to evict the tenant, they must give 28 days' notice if the tenant has lived in the property for six months or less, or 84 days notice if the tenant has lived there for more than six months. For specific grounds, such as a criminal conviction, the notice is 28 days irrespective of how long they have been in the property. In Northern Ireland, once the fixed term is up, landlords must give four weeks' written notice, known as a Notice to Quit. Your rent cannot normally be increased unless you agree or the tenancy agreement allows it. A rent review clause in a fixed-term tenancy will not apply after the fixed term ends, if your tenancy becomes ""statutory periodic"". This is when your fixed term ends and your tenancy automatically continues month-by-month or week-by-week - usually based on your rent payment period - until you or your landlord gives notice. Landlords of periodic tenants can use special procedures to raise rents by giving you a formal notice, details of which are set down in law. This can be appealed against in England to the first-tier property tribunal, or to the rent assessment committee in Wales, which will determine a ""market rent"" for the property. In Scotland, landlords can increase rent once a year but must give three months' written notice. Tenants can contact their local authority rent officer if they think the increase is too high For Northern Ireland, once the fixed term is up, there are no limits to rent increases, either by how much or how often a landlord can raise the rent. Tenants' tales - in five charts Number of middle-aged renters doubles First, ensure you are not responsible for the repairs. Tenants are usually expected to do small maintenance jobs such as changing a light bulb or repairing damage they have caused. If the landlord is not doing repairs they are responsible for, speak to them first to make sure they understand your concerns. If this does not help you can make a formal complaint by writing a letter to your landlord, explaining the problem, what you want them to do and including any evidence you have. If this does not solve your problem you can go to your council, which can help with complaints about repairs that cause a risk to health and safety. Your council can look at your home and order the landlord to do the repairs if they think it is harmful to your health or safety. Some landlords may try to evict a tenant who complains about repairs - so-called ""retaliatory eviction"". There is some legal protection for tenants in this position but talk to Citizens Advice if you're worried about this risk. You should not withhold rent because of repair issues because your landlord may then have reason to evict you. Eviction by coercion may be an illegal eviction in Scotland, which is a criminal offence. Scotland has had the Repairing Standard set of rules since September 2017. A tenant can refer the matter to the Housing and Property Chamber First Tier Tribunal for Scotland. In Northern Ireland, there is no legal protection against retaliatory eviction. Your six pros and cons of renting a home 'Nightmare' rental shortage for the disabled Most deposits should be protected in a tenancy deposit scheme and a landlord cannot take money from your deposit without either your agreement or arbitration by the scheme. A landlord who has failed to protect a deposit may have to pay a penalty to the tenant and face restrictions on serving notice. You might not get the full amount of your deposit back if, for example, you owe rent, you have damaged the property or you have lost or broken items on the inventory. Landlords should not take money for reasonable wear and tear, such as a carpet that has gradually worn out over time, or to fix repairs that were their responsibility. If your deposit is in a tenancy deposit scheme, you should get your deposit back within 10 days of agreeing any deductions with your landlord. If you cannot reach agreement, you will need to check how to access arbitration with your scheme. If your deposit has not been protected, seek help from Citizens Advice about recovering your deposit through the court. Your landlord may also have to pay you a penalty for failing to protect your deposit. Scotland has similar deposit protection schemes. In Northern Ireland, your landlord has 30 days to get your deposit back to you after agreeing any deductions. Sex and dating when you live with your parents Reality Check: Are we spending more money on rent? Your landlord has a legal obligation to look after any of your belongings left in a property after you have moved out or been evicted. They must make reasonable efforts to trace you, and serve you with notice - usually 28 days, but three months if you owe them money - stating how you can collect the goods, and that they will be disposed of if they have not been collected by the expiry of the notice. If the goods remain uncollected, the landlord may sell or dispose of them and make a deduction from any proceeds for expenses reasonably incurred in storage or disposal. The balance will belong to the tenant. If you have a joint tenancy with your housemate - each tenant is legally liable for the whole of the rent. This means, for example, that if they don't pay the landlord could pursue you, and any other joint tenants, for the money. If your housemate is a joint tenant and wants to leave during the fixed term, they could find a replacement agreed by you and the landlord. It is a good idea to put the agreement in writing so everyone knows where they stand. Without finding a replacement, your housemate would either have to continue paying rent in order not to breach the tenancy, or come to an agreement for them to pay you to make up the shortfall. In each case, the landlord must agree to the change before you can go ahead as they need to agree to the surrender of the existing joint tenancy and the creation of a new tenancy. If you are having problems you should get advice from an experienced adviser, like Citizens Advice. For tenants in Northern Ireland, check your agreement to see if you are ""jointly and severally liable"". If you are, each tenant is liable for the rent of another who leaves; if not, the landlord would have to pursue the tenant for unpaid rent. If you do not have a spare set of keys then you should check if your landlord or their agent has a spare set of keys you can use to get a new set cut. Your tenancy agreement might also give details about how you can do this and any fees you will be charged for a replacement. If there is no a spare set you can contact a locksmith to get the locks changed but you will have to pay for this and will also be responsible for any damage caused, for example, to the door or doorframe. Check your tenancy agreement to see if you have to tell your landlord if you change the locks. You should try to speak to your housemate first to see if you can find a way forward, but only do this if you feel able to do so. Your landlord may be able to help you by speaking to the housemate but there is no duty for them to do so. Your landlord may be able to take action to evict the housemate if they have breached the tenancy agreement in some way but this can take time.  If you're a joint tenant and your housemate is evicted this would also end your tenancy so it is worth getting advice first. If you are in fear of violence or if you are being racially or sexually harassed you should contact the police. The landlord has a right to reasonable access to carry out repairs for which they are responsible and to inspect the property, but usually they must give 24 hours' notice in writing. In most cases, a landlord does not have the right to demand access without notice, or to enter the property without permission when the tenant is not there. In Northern Ireland, the notice does not need to be in writing. If you have a disability and are having accessibility trouble in your home, you can ask your landlord to either make adaptations or let you make the changes. If your landlord refuses, seek advice from an experienced adviser, like Citizens Advice. This video can not be played One city, seven agents... and nowhere I can live Disabled facility grants from local councils - or the Housing Executive in Northern Ireland - are available to landlords and tenants to cover the costs of adaptations in some circumstances. Not all landlords and letting agents allow housing benefit or housing costs payments through Universal Credit, but you only need to say you receive them if they ask. You might be able to get a landlord or letting agent to accept you by giving extra references or you could also get a guarantor (someone who agrees to pay the rent if you don't). Ask your council if they have a list of landlords and letting agents who will rent to people who are getting Housing Benefit or Universal Credit, although this does not apply in Northern Ireland. Check your tenancy agreement to see if you have agreed to leave the property in a certain condition. In general, you shouldn't be charged for wear and tear, but the landlord might ask you to pay for damage beyond that. If you've paid a deposit, the landlord might ask for that payment to be deducted from the deposit. If you can't agree, you can ask the tenancy deposit scheme that holds your deposit to make a decision. Yes they can, but they must ask for your permission first. If you plan to rent through a letting agent and have bad credit history, tell them before they take any fees as you may not get these back. If the landlord refuses you because he thinks there is a risk of you not paying the rent, you could offer rent in advance if you can afford it, or a guarantor - if one is available - to secure the property. Most lettings agents will charge you to check your references and credit - the amount you can be asked to pay can vary a lot between agents. You might also be asked to pay fees if you renew your tenancy. Ask about your letting agent's fees before taking the property and before you pay any money. Their fees must be displayed on their website and in their offices. They have to give you details of their fees before you agree to rent. It is against the law for your letting agent to charge you for registering with them and giving information or lists of properties available for rent, although this may not apply in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, there is a mandatory register of lettings agents. Apart from rent and the security deposit, letting fees have been banned in Scotland since 2012. You are entitled to ""quiet enjoyment"" of your home, which includes having the occasional overnight visitor. In some cases tenants will be held responsible for the behaviour of their visitors that could lead to renters breaching their tenancy agreement. Any term in a tenancy agreement that says you can't have overnight guests without permission from the landlord or that you have to pay a fee is likely to be ""unfair"" and unenforceable. You should bear in mind the risk of eviction if you are outside a fixed term and you antagonise your landlord. Be clear your guest is a visitor and you're not sub-letting. Most tenancy agreements say that you are not allowed to sub-let all or part of your property without your landlord's agreement. If your guest pays money to stay it's likely to be seen as sub-let. If you think you are being  discriminated against because of your disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation, you may be able to take legal action. You should get advice from an experienced adviser, like Citizens Advice. You should seek help immediately from an independent adviser, like Citizens Advice. An adviser will be able to check whether your landlord has followed the correct procedure to evict you and whether you have rights to be allowed back into your property. They should also be able to help you with finding alternative accommodation. Also, if you are homeless, your local council may have to help find you somewhere to live. Depending on your circumstances, they might also provide you with emergency accommodation. Again, an independent adviser will be able to help you with this application. In Northern Ireland, the Housing Executive may have to help you find somewhere to live. If you need help to pay your rent you may be able to apply for housing benefit or for help with your housing costs from Universal Credit. You may also be entitled to other benefits if you are unemployed or on a low income. If you are struggling with debt, seek help from an independent adviser, like Citizens Advice. Landlords must be registered in Wales. If you feel your landlord has done something wrong, check your landlord is registered as there are financial penalties if they're not. If the landlord holds a licence, it may be revoked for not following the code of conduct. In Scotland, landlords must register with the local council. The local authority must be satisfied that the owner of the property and the agent are fit and proper to let residential property, before registering them. Tenants can search the register and it is an offence for a landlord not to register. This advice applies to assured shorthold tenants, and most private tenancies in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, a new tenancy law was enacted in December 2017, affecting new tenancies from 1 December 2017, and the differences are explained where possible.

Reality Check: How much do we spend on rent?,"In the UK, people are renting for longer periods of time, as buying a property has become more expensive and wages have struggled to keep up. As analysis for the BBC by Hometrack reveals, the average length of residence for private renters in England has increased to 4.3 years. This got Reality Check thinking about how much people are spending on rent. If people are renting for a longer period of time, how much of their pay packet is going on accommodation? While home ownership has declined in recent years, the number of private rented lettings has gone up. Between 2006 and 2016, the number of new private rented lettings increased by 24% to 1.3 million. Since 2008, there have been more new private rented lettings a year than new sales. There were a million residential sales in Great Britain in 2016. However, it's important to remember that the average length that a homeowner will stay in their home is about 20 years on average, so turnover would typically be lower. The number of private rented lettings did fall from 2014 to 2016, as the average length of a tenancy increased, meaning that tenants were staying longer in their rental properties too. Reality Check: How does renting a home in the UK compare? According to data from residential property analysts Hometrack, the average cost of rent per calendar month increased by 19% from 2007 to 2017 for private rents in England and Wales. Over the same period, real average weekly earnings in the UK fell from Â£463 in January 2007 to Â£458 in 2017, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS). London saw the largest rise in the past decade, with a 29% increase in how much the capital's renters are paying each month. In 2017, the average private rent in London stood at Â£1,590 per calendar month. London topped the regional list for median earnings for full-time employees in April 2017, at Â£692 per week. However, in the North East, the amount paid for private rents per month decreased by 3% over the past 10 years, falling to Â£544. Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? 'Nightmare' rental shortage for the disabled Tenants' tales - in five charts Number of middle-aged renters doubles The government's definition of affordable housing says that affordable homes for rent shouldn't cost any more than 80% of the average local market rent. Most definitions of affordability take into account the relationship between the average household income and the average rent in an area. Analysis by Hometrack of data from the ONS looked at the ratio between average annual salaries and house prices. It found that rent as a percentage of annual earnings across England and Wales had decreased from 31.1% in 2007 to 29.4% 10 years on. London was the least affordable region in England and Wales, with city-dwellers spending 41.1% of their annual salaries on rent in 2017. One of the reasons rental affordability in London has become stretched is the fact that more renters are sharing properties. This has pushed up rents ahead of earnings, as landlords charge more to groups of professionals occupying a property, according to Hometrack. The most affordable region was the North East, with the region's renters handing over 23.6% of their annual salaries on rent last year.

'Nightmare' rental shortage for disabled,"This video can not be played One city, seven agents... and nowhere I can live The dire shortage of private rental properties suitable for disabled people has been exposed by a new report. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said 93% of 8.5 million rental properties in the UK were not accessible to the disabled. It called on ministers to take action to improve housing accessibility. The government said it was providing councils with almost Â£1bn over the next two years to adapt properties for disabled people. ""We expect landlords to adapt properties for tenants. We are clear they must not unreasonably withhold consent if they are asked to make changes to homes,"" a Department of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesman said. Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? Tenants' tales - in five charts Number of middle-aged renters doubles The EHRC said its 18-month review found 365,000 disabled people were in homes unsuitable for their needs. ""Accommodation for disabled people in this country is not acceptable,"" said David Isaac, chairman of the commission. ""The lack of accessible housing stops disabled people from being able to live independently."" Neil Heslop, chief executive of the Leonard Cheshire disability charity, said the report was a ""shocking indictment of how disabled people have largely been forgotten in the housing priorities of local and national government"". By BBC news reporter Ellis Palmer It's difficult enough trying to find somewhere to live when you're able-bodied; it can be something of a nightmare when you have a disability. I recently visited seven estate agents in Derby, where I have family, to try to find a property I could move into without having to make any adaptations. Despite looking at hundreds of listings, no accessible properties were available to rent on the private market in the city. Even getting in and out of the estate agents' shops was rather difficult. Five of the seven I visited had significant steps up, meaning I was not able to get in independently. Finding somewhere to live independently as a wheelchair user is extremely difficult. In my case, all I need is a wet room bathroom to be able to shower myself. Many young people, with or without disabilities, face an uncertain economic climate due to short-term contracts, meaning that buying somewhere with a mortgage on the private market just isn't possible. Additionally, for disabled people, only 7% of homes in England offer minimal accessibility features. Theoretically, newer properties are much more likely to be easily accessible, but that doesn't necessarily mean they will be ready for me to move into independently. Many of the flats I've looked around in the past few years don't even have that - many still have baths or showers with steps up. The EHRC report said many local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales have not collected data or planned for the future, even though the number of disabled people is increasing. It found that councils are only requiring about four in ten new homes to be accessible and adaptable, while just 5% required developers to construct wheelchair-accessible housing, which might include step-free bathrooms. Your six pros and cons of renting a home Sex and dating when you live with your parents Reality Check: Are we spending more money on rent? Just seven councils authorities have taken either formal or informal action against a developer who did not deliver the required number of accessible and/or adaptable properties, it found. The Equality Act (2010) says that changes or adjustments should be made to ensure someone with a disability has access to housing and that the individual should not have to pay. But adjustments only have to be made if it is reasonable and there is only a duty to do so if not doing so places the disabled person at a substantial disadvantage.

Iran condemns Israeli 'aggression',"The Israel Defense Forces released video of an air strike on a Syrian missile launcher Iran has backed Syria's ""right to defend itself"" after Israel launched strikes on what it said was Iranian military infrastructure inside Syria. In the first comments by Iran since Thursday's wave of strikes, the foreign ministry condemned the ""blatant violation of Syria's sovereignty"". The strikes were the heaviest carried out by Israel on Syria in decades. They came after 20 rockets were fired at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights. Israel said Iranian fighters had carried out that attack. Iran has neither directly confirmed or denied this but has said that Israel's attacks on Syria were founded ""on self-proclaimed, baseless pretexts"". Iran has deployed hundreds of troops in Syria, ostensibly as military advisers to the Syrian military. Thousands of militiamen armed, trained and financed by Iran have also been battling rebel forces alongside Syrian soldiers. On Thursday, in response to the Golan Heights attack, Israel said its fighter jets had struck almost all of Iran's military infrastructure inside Syria - some 70 targets - in its biggest assault since Syria's civil war started in 2011. Iran and Israel are enemies but have never fought a direct war. Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted on Iranian state TV as saying: ""Iran strongly condemns... [Israel's] attacks on Syria. The international community's silence encourages Israel's aggression. Syria has every right to defend itself."" This video can not be played Syrian state TV footage shows Israeli missiles over Damascus on Thursday Mr Qasemi said Israel ""cannot stand peace and stability in the region and sees its own safety in making the region all the more unstable"". He said Israel's ""baseless pretexts amount to a blatant violation of Syria's sovereignty and goes against all international conventions"". He did not refer to Iran's military presence inside Syria. Mr Qasemi said the attacks were an attempt by international supporters of rebel groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to shore them up after their ""many failures"" and to try to ""tip the scales in their favour"". The Syrian government, backed by Iran and Russia, has made significant gains over the rebel groups in the past year. Israel v Iran in 300 words Are Israel and Iran heading for a war? Iran and Israel: Your questions answered A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Iran had ""crossed a red line"" and Israel's action ""was a consequence"" of that. He said: ""We will not allow Iran to entrench itself in Syria. I delivered a clear message to the Assad regime - our action is directed against Iranian targets in Syria. However, if the Syrian military acts against us, we will act against it."" The Golan Heights, which Israel has annexed He added: ""Whoever hurts us, we will hurt them sevenfold, and whoever is preparing to hurt us, we will act to hit them first."" Visiting the Golan Heights on Friday, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman urged Mr Assad to ""throw the Iranians out"", saying ""they are only hurting you"". Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, called for a UN condemnation of Iran's ""acts of aggression"" and for the Security Council to ""demand that Iran remove its military presence from Syria"". The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that early on Thursday morning 20 rockets had been launched at its forward posts in the Golan Heights by the Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 50km (30 miles) from the capital Damascus. Israel occupied most of the area in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. The IDF said four rockets were intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome aerial defence system, while 16 fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage were reported. The IDF has published satellite images of sites that it struck,externalinside Syria in response. They include what it said were: Installations at Tel Gharba, Tel Kleb, Nabi Yusha and Tel Maqdad A Quds Force compound in al-Kiswah, south of Damascus An ""Iranian Logistics Compound"", 10km north-west of the capital (pictured below) Why is there a war in Syria? The Golan Heights explained US President Donald Trump's abandonment on Tuesday of a landmark international deal to curb Iran's nuclear programme - an agreement fiercely opposed by Mr Netanyahu - has certainly raised tensions. But Israel had already become increasingly worried about Iran's military support of Syria. Mr Netanyahu said the Revolutionary Guards had moved advanced weapons to Syria, including surface-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft batteries that would threaten Israeli fighter jets. Israel's military had been anticipating an attack by Iranian forces after reportedly carrying out a number of strikes on their facilities in Syria in recent months. They includedone on an airbase in April that killed seven Iranian troops. The Iran nuclear deal explained in five key points The deal lifted sanctions on Iran from 2015, allowing some big names - Boeing, Airbus, Total and Peugeot - to start doing business again. The re-imposition of sanctions has thrown all that into doubt. US firms have six months to stop trading with Iran. European companies, for instance Airbus, are affected too as they buy parts from the US. Europe's billion-dollar deals at stake in Iran row The sanctions issue has added to tensions between the US and its European allies over the nuclear deal.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says European companies should not have to pay for the US decision. The economy of Iran, a big exporter of oil and gas, is likely to be adversely affected. Are Israel and Iran heading for a war?

Seven found dead in Western Australia,"Osmington lies near the popular Margaret River tourist area in Western Australia Seven people have been found dead at a rural property in what is reported to be Australia's worst mass shooting since 1996. The bodies of four children and three adults were discovered in the town of Osmington in Western Australia (WA), 280km (170 miles) south of Perth. Three generations of the same family were among the victims, Australia's ABC News reported. Police have not yet confirmed widespread reports of murder-suicide. Officials did, however, say that two firearms were found at the scene and said there was no ongoing threat to public safety. ABC News, quoting a family friend, reported that Katrina Miles and her four children were among the dead. Her parents, Peter and Cynda Miles, were also killed, ABC said. Flowers left at the scene for ""Katrina and family"" Police, however, have yet to formally identify any of the victims or to confirm the incident as a mass shooting. ""It appears that gunshot wounds are there, but I don't want to go further than that,"" said WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson. If confirmed, it would be Australia's worst mass shooting since a massacre in Port Arthur, Tasmania, claimed the lives of 35 people in 1996. The Port Arthur massacre led to comprehensive reform of the nation's gun laws, drastically reducing the number of mass shootings. Would Australia's gun laws help the US? Mr Dawson said the victims were believed to have lived at the property. This video can not be played The bodies of four children and three adults were found ""The loss of any life is tragic, but four children and three adults - this is a significant tragedy,"" he said. Authorities were called to the scene at 05:15 local time (21:15 GMT on Thursday) after receiving a call from a ""male person"", Mr Dawson said. The commissioner did not give details of the call, but said it had been recorded. He said specialist police officers from Perth would oversee a large-scale investigation. There was no search for a suspect, he said. Osmington is a tiny rural community about 20km from Margaret River, a popular tourist and wine-growing area. One neighbour, Felicity Haynes, described the residents of the property as ""lovely people"". ""They were a very socially-aware family - doing their best to create a safe community - and that is why it is so shocking to think that could be destroyed so quickly,""she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp,external. Pamela Townshend, president of the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River, told Fairfax Media,external: ""It's sending shockwaves through the whole community - we're all linked in one way or another, every family."" After the 1996 massacre at Port Arthur in Tasmania, Australia enacted strict gun laws that banned automatic and semi-automatic weapons. It has had one other mass shooting since Port Arthur - the murder-suicide of a family of five in New South Wales in 2014.

Npower to raise energy prices by 5.3%,"Gas and electricity supplier Npower is raising energy bills by an average of Â£64 a year for a million customers. The average 5.3% dual fuel price hike comes into effect on 17 June and follows earlier rises announced last month by its ""Big Six"" rivals. British Gas is increasing prices by 5.5% from 29 May, while Scottish Power is raising prices by 5.5% on 1 June. German-owned Npower blamed increases wholesale energy costs and government policy changes for the rise. Simon Stacey, managing director, domestic markets at Npower, said: ""Announcing this price change today isn't a decision we've taken lightly."" He said the costs energy suppliers are facing - ""particularly wholesale and policy costs which are largely outside our control"" - have been on the rise for some time ""and we need to reflect these in our prices"". The energy giants all partly blame government policy, such as the introduction of smart meters and emissions targets, for higher bills. The 5.3% average price hike is made up of a 4.4% rise in gas prices and a 6.2% increase in electricity. It will see a typical dual fuel gas and electricity annual bill climb to Â£1,230. Mr Stacey pointed out that the price rise would not affect existing customers on a fixed deal, those with a prepayment meter, or customers on the Safeguard tariff. Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, said: ""This is a chunky rise from Npower - all we need now is something from SSE and it's a full house from the Big Six. ""Npower says 60% of its customers won't be affected but that still means 40% - or one million people - will."" Mark Todd, co-founder of switching service Energyhelpline, said: ""The most expensive standard tariff just got more expensive."" Some 4.1 million British Gas customers face a 5.5% hike from 29 May, adding an average of Â£60 to bills. The move was branded as""unjustified"" by the governmentwhen it was announced. Scottish Power is increasing prices by 5.5% - or Â£63 on average - for nearly one million people from 1 June. EDF has a 2.7% - or Â£16 - electricity price rise coming into effect on 7 June for 1.2 million customers. Npower's 5.3% increase - an average of Â£64 - will hit one million people from 17 June.

Moped crime up 30 times in five years,"Many offenders take advantage of people distracted by their mobile phones The number of offences carried out by criminals using mopeds in London has increased by 30 times in five years. Data obtained by the BBC shows a jump from 827 offences in 2012 to more than 23,000 last year. High car insurance premiums and the boom in delivery services such as Deliveroo have increased the number of mopeds, an expert said. Police insisted they had not lost control of moped crime but ""there was more work to do"". During the period covered by the figures, more than 40% of such offences happened in just two boroughs. A Met Police superintendent said the surge in Camden and Islington was ""disappointing"", but new measures were helping to reduce offending. ""Moped-enabled crime"" describes offences carried out by people on mopeds or scooters, including drive-by thefts of pedestrians' phones and bags. Use our tool to see how badly your neighbourhood is affected.  Or select from           Since 2012, by far the most common type of crime has been theft and handling with 30,387 offences - around three quarters of the total:  Det Supt Caroline Haines, who leads the operation tackling moped crime in Camden and Islington, was asked if her team had a handle on the issue. She said: ""Yes we do, absolutely. Yes, there is a significant increase on last year overall, and that is very disappointing. ""Since January we've deployed a number of new tactics that are now starting to see dividends. ""But we're not done yet, and we're not complacent. We do understand there's a lot more work to do."" An increased number of scooters and mopeds on the streets has helped fuel the phenomenon She said hotspots arose around transport hubs, where commuters and tourists alike were often distracted as they checked their mobile phones or looked up directions. A plentiful supply of main roads leading in and out of London also provide easy escape routes for offenders. Smash-and-grab moped gang jailed over Â£1.2m spree Teenager jailed for moped acid attacks Ride-by moped thefts on shoppers rise six-fold Det Supt Haines saidnew tactics to tackle the issueinclude training more officers in pursuing offenders on mopeds, using remote-controlled spikes to puncture the tyres of suspects' bikes, and educating members of the public to be more aware of their surroundings. She also urged moped riders to make their vehicles theft-proof, due to the number of stolen vehicles used to commit crimes. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built using Carto.

Kirat Nandra broke her ribs and her hand when she was hit by a moped as thieves grabbed her bag Kirat Nandra, 51, broke her ribs and hand and got concussion when she was hit and dragged along a pavement by two people on a moped in September 2017. She was mugged on North Road, half a mile from Highgate Hill - the worst street in London for moped crimes. ""I didn't actually know what had happened to me. All I heard was my friend shouting my name, and I was being dragged,"" she said. ""I remember looking up, and realising the handles of my bag had got caught in the zip of my leather jacket. And I'd got tangled. ""It was so quick, so nobody could do anything."" Ms Nandra suffered severe bruising after being attacked by ""thugs"" on North Road Ms Nandra managed to pull herself free just before the moped swerved back on to the road in front of other traffic. Her handbag, two phones, cash and bank cards were all taken. The offenders, who wore dark clothes and had their faces covered, have not been caught because of a lack of evidence. ""I don't want to start pointing fingers or blaming, but something, somewhere, is going horribly wrong,"" Ms Nandra said. Det Supt Haines said she was ""sorry"" to hear Ms Nandra's case was dropped, adding that her team was ""absolutely committed"" to bringing moped criminals to justice. Det Supt Caroline Haines says she has a handle on the issue in Camden and Islington, despite the ""disappointing"" surge last year Remote-controlled spikes are used to puncture the tyres of suspects' vehicles Ms Nandra, who describes herself as a strong and confident person, said she felt ""ruined"" after the attack. ""Psychologically, it's scarred me,"" she said. ""I'll never be the same again."" She had almost two months either off work or working part-time as she struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She still has anxiety attacks, fears going out alone and has moved away from the area. ""I'll be OK, but I'll never be back to what I was before. I'll always have that fear in the back of my head,"" she said. This video can not be played Stories of moped crime from victims and police Dr Simon Harding, a criminology expert from the University of West London, said the surge was partly due to criminal gangs using changes in public behaviour to their advantage. The high cost of car insurance and the proliferation of food or goods delivery services such as Deliveroo meant there were more mopeds on the streets than there used to be, he said. Stealing a moped was simple, as was plucking an expensive device out of a distracted person's hands, he added. Dr Harding said street gangs on estates in north London were partly why this area has been so badly hit. ""We also know both Camden and Islington have a high number of small alleyways and canal paths - those are places that are very easy for people on scooters or bikes to access, but very difficult for the police to follow,"" he said.

Massive wave 'sets hemisphere record',"The wave was measured by a buoy at Campbell Island in the Southern Ocean Scientists in New Zealand have documented what they believe is the largest wave ever recorded in the southern hemisphere. The 23.8m (78ft) wave was measured by a buoy on New Zealand's Campbell Island in the Southern Ocean on Tuesday, the country's weather authority said. It eclipses a 22.03m wave that was identified south of the Australian state of Tasmania in 2012. Larger waves have been recorded in the northern hemisphere. The Meteorological Service of New Zealand (MetService) installed its solar-powered buoy in March. The area is known for big storm activity, but waves had been previously difficult to measure. The ""eight-storey high"" wave was generated by a deep low pressure system and 65-knot winds, said MetService senior oceanographer Dr Tom Durrant. ""This is a very exciting event and to our knowledge it is the largest wave ever recorded in the southern hemisphere,"" he told the BBC. The buoy operates for 20 minutes every three hours. Dr Durrant said it was possible that even bigger waves were generated by the storm but not recorded. The World Meteorological Organization does not hold official records on individual wave heights. Instead, it records an average of successive swells - a measure known as the ""significant wave height"". During the storm recorded by New Zealand, the significant wave height was 14.9m. That is a record for the Southern Ocean but below a19m mark measured by a buoy in the North Atlantic,externalin 2016, Dr Durrant said. He said storms moved across the Southern Ocean largely unhindered due to a lack of land. ""[It is] the engine room for generating swell waves that then propagate throughout the planet,"" he said. ""Indeed surfers in California can expect energy from this storm to arrive at their shores in about a week's time.""

"Barclays boss fined Â£642,000 by regulatorsRegulators fine the boss of Barclays for breaching rules in trying to identify a whistleblower.4m4 minutes agoBusiness","Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has been fined Â£642,430 by regulators for breaching rules by trying to identify a whistleblower. The Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority said he failed to ""act with due skill, care and diligence"" in his response to an anonymous letter received in June 2016. The FCA and PRA began their probe into Mr Staley's conduct a year ago. Barclays said it would cut his bonus,externalby Â£500,000. Directors delayed deciding how much Mr Staley's bonus would be docked until the investigation was complete and they knew the penalty imposed. Mr Staley said: ""I have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate, and I have apologised for mistakes which I made. ""I accept the conclusions of the board, the FCA, and the PRA, following their respective investigations, and the sanctions which they have each applied."" Mr Staley earned Â£2.35m in 2016 and received a bonus of Â£1.3m. The fine amounts to about a fifth of his total compensation. It would have been more than Â£900,000, but he was given a 30% discount for settling at an early stage. Many will think that Jes Staley has got off lightly. He still has his job and the regulators stopped short of saying that he was unfit to continue in post, which would have surely ended his career at Barclays and possibly in banking altogether. As chief executive of Barclays, Mr Staley should have been setting an example of how to deal with whistleblowing. Instead, when he received anonymous allegations against a senior member of staff, who was also a friend, he set the bank's own internal investigations unit to work to discover the identity of the whistleblower. That matters, because after the credit crunch and bailout of the banking sector, regulators introduced vigorous rules to encourage those with concerns of wrongdoing to come forward. Mr Staley's actions directly undermined that very safety valve. Jes Staley now has the distinction of being the first boss of a major financial institution to have been fined by the regulators and to have kept his job. The issue dates back to June 2016, when members of the Barclays board received anonymous letters raising concerns about a senior employee who had been recruited by the bank earlier that year. The letters, which were treated as whistleblowing, raised concerns of a personal nature about the senior employee, and Mr Staley's knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer. They also raised questions over the appropriateness of the recruitment process followed by Barclays on this occasion. Mr Staley asked the bank's security chief, Troels Oerting, to attempt to identify the authors of the letters, which the chief executive thought were an unfair personal attack on the senior employee. Mr Oerting, who formerly worked for Europol, contacted US federal law enforcement agencies to help track down the letter's origin, which had a US postmark. Regulators will keep an eye in future on how Barclays oversees whistleblowing. They have told the bank to report to it every year to explain how it handles any issues. This includes making senior managers give personal assurances that whistleblowing protocols are being followed properly. Mark Steward, from the FCA, said: ""Given the crucial role of the chief executive, the standard of due skill, care and diligence is more demanding than for other employees. ""Mr Staley breached the standard of care required and expected of a chief executive in a way that risked undermining confidence in Barclays' whistleblowing procedures."" Barclays, though, noted in its statement that there were no findings by the FCA or PRA that Mr Staley acted with a lack of integrity nor any findings that he lacks fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role. The chairman, John McFarlane, said Barclays and its investors stood behind Mr Staley: ""The board has reiterated its support for Jes, as have shareholders at last week's annual general meeting.""

Student loans boss hired 'against advice',"The man hired to run the Student Loans Company was appointed against officials' advice and without having his references checked, a report says. Steve Lamey was made chief executive in June 2016 on a year's probation. Within 18 months he was sacked for gross misconduct after whistleblowers made 69 allegations of wrongdoing. A National Audit Office probe into the government's oversight of the firm said despite the reservations, it failed to properly monitor the appointment. It is the first time the details of Mr Lamey's tenure and dismissal have been revealed. The Student Loans Company oversees Â£100bn worth of debt to the public purse, processes 1.8 million applications a year and has more than eight million customers. The appointment panel identified one suitable candidate for the job, Mr Lamey. But once Business, Innovation and Skills (Bis) officials received references from Mr Lamey's former employer - HM Revenue and Customs, which he left in 2012 - they recommended that the recruitment process was re-run. Mr Lamey's most recent employer declined to provide references and references were not sought from his clients, the NAO found. It reported that a special adviser to the then Secretary of State, Jo Johnson, intervened, saying it would be costly to re-run the recruitment process. Mr Lamey went on to be appointed on a probationary period, but only two of four suggested ongoing safeguards devised to monitor the appointment were carried out once he was in post. In November 2016, departmental officials apparently attended a conference where Mr Lamey was openly critical of his own company, but took no action. By the end of March 2017, Mr Lamey received a positive appraisal and he was confirmed in post at the end of May. Almost simultaneously a whistleblower emerged making 12 allegations against Mr Lamey and other members of his team. And within two months another had come forward with 57 other allegations. Ultimately, a disciplinary panel found Mr Lamey had breached four of the seven principles of standards in public lifeincluding integrity, objectivity, accountability and leadership. It found he did not adhere to rules governing the managing of public money, carrying out procurements or follow proper decision-making processes. One key failing the report highlighted was the lack of a finance director on the executive leadership team. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We take any allegations of inappropriate behaviour extremely seriously and are pleased that the NAO found that the department and SLC acted swiftly as soon as whistleblowers raised concerns regarding Mr Lamey's behaviour. ""He was subsequently dismissed after two independent investigations for gross misconduct. ""After assuming oversight of the Student Loans Company in 2016, we reviewed and introduced changes to our oversight measures, including quarterly shareholder meetings to discuss performance and risk management. ""A review of governance is currently under way to see how we can build on those measures to ensure that the SLC is well supported to continue delivering student finance that helps millions of UK students invest in their future."" Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, said: ""This is a story of the failure of two departments to effectively monitor a public body under their watch. ""The concerns raised by officials about Mr Lamey's appointment should have been taken more seriously by BIS.""

France condemns US over Iran sanctionsIt says European firms should not have to pay for the US decision to abandon a key nuclear deal.2h2 hours agoEurope,"Airbus had a deal to sell Iran nearly 100 airliners France has condemned as ""unacceptable"" a US move to re-impose sanctions on companies trading with Iran. The action from Washington followed President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a landmark deal that sought to curb Iran's nuclear programme. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said European companies should not have to pay for the US decision. The US says firms have six months to halt business and cannot enter into new contracts or they will face sanctions. As the fall-out from Mr Trump's decision continues, Iran has called on European plane manufacturer Airbus to say whether it will stick to a deal to sell it nearly 100 airliners. Europe's billion-dollar deals at stake in Iran row The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Winners and losers from US Iran deal exit EU hurt as US flexes sanctions muscles In an interview with Le Parisien,external, Mr Le Drian said: ""We feel that the extraterritoriality of their sanction measures are unacceptable. The Europeans should not have to pay for the withdrawal from an agreement by the United States, to which they had themselves contributed."" Mr Le Drian said the commitment of other partners to the Iran deal should be respected He said the new sanctions regime would also affect the US and that Europeans would ""put in place the necessary measures to protect the interests of our companies and start negotiations with Washington"" on the matter. Iran nuclear deal: Key details The foreign minister said the commitment of other partners to the Iran deal should be respected. He said the effects of the US move were already being felt in rising oil costs and an increase in political uncertainty in the Middle East. Equally forceful was his colleague, Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said Europe had to defend its ""economic sovereignty"". ""Do we want to be vassals deferring with a curtsy and a bow to decisions made by the US so that the US polices the world economy?"" He said France would propose sanctions-blocking measures to the European Commission in the next few days. At the same time, Mr Le Maire said the European Union would hold talks with Washington on obtaining different rules for European companies trading with Iran. France, Britain and Germany have all said they will work with Iran to try to salvage the Iran nuclear agreement. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said he would work with affected companies to try to ""minimise the negative consequences"" of the US move, adding: ""That means, it is concretely about damage limitation."" A number of French firms have have signed billion dollar agreements with Iran since the nuclear accord was signed in 2015. Aside from Airbus, they include French oil giant Total and the car makers Renault and Peugeot. Reuters news agency quotes a senior Iranian official as saying that Iran is talking to Airbus about using a narrow window before sanctions come into effect to continue with the deal. At least three of the 100 planes at issue have already been delivered. Companies would have to wind up investments by November or face US sanctions. The latest example is the military clash between Iran and Israel in Syria.

'Junk food' Tube adverts may be banned,"This video can not be played Adverts for ""unhealthy food and drink"" could be banned on the Tube, Overground, buses and bus shelters Junk food advertising could be banned across the entire Transport for London (TfL) network, City Hall has announced. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, says he wants to tackle the ""ticking time bomb"" of child obesity in the capital. If the proposal is approved, adverts for ""unhealthy food and drink"" will be banned on the London Underground, Overground, buses and bus shelters. The scheme is backed by child health experts but the Advertising Association said it would have ""little impact"". The junk food advertising ban forms part of Mr Khan'sLondon Food Strategy,external, which has been published for consultation. TfL's director of TfL's transport strategy Lilli Matson said it had a ""large advertising estate with a diverse audience"", and is supporting the mayor's attempts to make London healthier. Sadiq Khan has described London's child obesity issue as a ""ticking time bomb"" Mr Khan wants to ""reduce the influence and pressure that can be put on children and families to make unhealthy choices"".

Mayor plans TfL 'junk food' advert ban,"This video can not be played Adverts for ""unhealthy food and drink"" could be banned on the Tube, Overground, buses and bus shelters Junk food advertising could be banned across the entire Transport for London (TfL) network, City Hall has announced. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, says he wants to tackle the ""ticking time bomb"" of child obesity in the capital.

"Student loan rates absurd, say MPs","The measure used to set interest rates on student loans is flawed and unfair, say MPs The inflation measure used to set interest rates on student loans is ""absurd"", says a report from MPs. The government uses RPI - the Retail Prices Index - which the Treasury Select Committee says is ""flawed"" and should be ""abandoned"". The rise in that measure will push interest rates on student loans for tuition fees up to 6.3% in the autumn. The Department for Education defended the continuing use of RPI, saying it provided ""consistency over time"". Nicky Morgan, who chairs the committee, said the use of RPI for loan repayments, which ""normally gives a higher rate of inflation"", appears ""grossly unfair"". The DFE, responding to the MPs' criticism, acknowledged that ""the flaws in the RPI measure of inflation are well understood"", but said that a review of tuition fees and loans was currently under way and the outcome could not be ""pre-judged"". This video can not be played Five things you should know about your student loan debt This review is due to report in early 2019. And until then student loans will continue to be set using RPI. This is despite an official warning about the use of RPI earlier this year from the national statistician, John Pullinger, who said: ""We do not think it is a good measure of inflation and discourage its use."" The Treasury Select Committee says that student loans should be set against the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), which is currently a percentage point lower than RPI. It strongly rejected the government's argument to stick with RPI. ""Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd,""  Mrs Morgan, herself a former education secretary, said. ""It guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed."" The interest rates for loans, which begin to be charged as soon as students start at university, are set at the level of RPI in March, plus 3%. Nicky Morgan says the use of RPI for interest on student loans is ""grossly unfair"" With an RPI measure of 3.3%, it means that for the next academic year interest rates will be up to 6.3%, although students do not have to begin repayments until they have graduated and are earning over Â£25,000 per year. The CPI rate for March was 2.3%. The report from MPs says interest charges are too high and there has been no ""persuasive explanation"" for why student loan interest should be so much higher than market rates, the government's own cost of borrowing or the rate of inflation. The MPs also challenged the application of interest rates while students were still at university, saying the government should reconsider such ""punitive measures"".

France condemns US over Iran sanctionsIt says European firms should not have to pay for the US decision to abandon a key nuclear deal.22m23 minutes agoEurope,"Airbus had a deal to sell Iran nearly 100 airliners France has condemned as ""unacceptable"" a US move to re-impose sanctions on companies trading with Iran. The action from Washington followed President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a landmark deal that sought to curb Iran's nuclear programme. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said European companies should not have to pay for the US decision. The US says firms have six months to halt business and cannot enter into new contracts or they will face sanctions. As the fall-out from Mr Trump's decision continues, Iran has called on European plane manufacturer Airbus to say whether it will stick to a deal to sell it nearly 100 airliners. Europe's billion-dollar deals at stake in Iran row The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Winners and losers from US Iran deal exit EU hurt as US flexes sanctions muscles In an interview with Le Parisien,external, Mr Le Drian said: ""We feel that the extraterritoriality of their sanction measures are unacceptable. The Europeans should not have to pay for the withdrawal from an agreement by the United States, to which they had themselves contributed."" Mr Le Drian said the commitment of other partners to the Iran deal should be respected He said the new sanctions regime would also affect the US and that Europeans would ""put in place the necessary measures to protect the interests of our companies and start negotiations with Washington"" on the matter. Iran nuclear deal: Key details The foreign minister said the commitment of other partners to the Iran deal should be respected. He said the effects of the US move were already being felt in rising oil costs and an increase in political uncertainty in the Middle East. Equally forceful was his colleague, Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said Europe had to defend its ""economic sovereignty"". ""Do we want to be vassals deferring with a curtsy and a bow to decisions made by the US so that the US polices the world economy?"" He said France would propose sanctions-blocking measures to the European Commission in the next few days. At the same time, Mr Le Maire said the European Union would hold talks with Washington on obtaining different rules for European companies trading with Iran. France, Britain and Germany have all said they will work with Iran to try to salvage the Iran nuclear agreement. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said he would work with affected companies to try to ""minimise the negative consequences"" of the US move, adding: ""That means, it is concretely about damage limitation."" A number of French firms have have signed billion dollar agreements with Iran since the nuclear accord was signed in 2015. Aside from Airbus, they include French oil giant Total and the car makers Renault and Peugeot. Reuters news agency quotes a senior Iranian official as saying that Iran is talking to Airbus about using a narrow window before sanctions come into effect to continue with the deal. At least three of the 100 planes at issue have already been delivered. Companies would have to wind up investments by November or face US sanctions.

Body found in search for missing singer,"A body found at a marina on the banks of the Firth of Forth has been confirmed as missing Frightened Rabbit singer Scott Hutchison. The discovery was made at Port Edgar, between the Forth Road Bridge and Queensferry Crossing, at about 20:30 on Thursday. Mr Hutchison, 36, went missing in the early hours of Wednesday morning. His family said there had been recent concerns about his mental health, and they were ""devastated"" by his death. Mr Hutchison had spoken openly about his battle with depression over the years, with elder brother Neil saying he had done so ""in an attempt to help other people with similar conditions"". In a statement released on Friday, the family said Mr Hutchison ""wore his heart on his sleeve, and that was evident in the lyrics of his music and the content of many of his social media posts. ""He was passionate, articulate and charismatic, as well as being one of the funniest and kindest people we knew. Friends and family would all agree that he had a brilliant sense of humour and was a great person to be around."" 'His music meant so much to people' Profile: Frightened Rabbit Scott Hutchison at The Quay Sessions with new band Mastersystem The statement added that relatives had ""remained positive and hopeful that he would walk back through the door, having taken some time away to compose himself"". And it described Mr Hutchison as a ""wonderful son, brother, uncle and friend"" who always had time for those he cared for. Scott Hutchison formed Frightened Rabbit alongside his brother Grant, the band's drummer ""Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you"", it added. ""Scott battled bravely with his own issues for many years and we are immensely proud of him for being so open with his struggles. ""His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues."" If you or someone you know has been affected by mental health problems,these organisations may be able to help. His Frightened Rabbit bandmates released a statement saying: ""There are no words to describe the overwhelming sadness and pain that comes with the death of our beloved Scott, but to know he is no longer suffering brings us some comfort. ""Reading messages of support and hope from those he has helped through his art has helped immensely and we encourage you all to continue doing this. ""He will be missed by all of us and his absence will always be felt but he leaves a legacy of hope, kindness and colour that will forever be remembered and shared."" Scott Hutchison was last seen after visiting the Dakota Hotel in South Queensferry The singer and guitarist had last been seen on CCTV footage leaving the Dakota Hotel in nearby South Queensferry at 01:00 on Wednesday. Two hours earlier, he had tweeted: ""Be so good to everyone you love. It's not a given. I'm so annoyed that it's not. I didn't live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones."" Shortly afterwards, he added: ""I'm away now. Thanks."" Frightened Rabbit were formed by Mr Hutchison and brother Grant on drums. The band released their debut album Sing the Greys in 2006, and went on to release four more albums. The brothers also released a critically-acclaimed album last month as part of Mastersystem - a supergroup that also included Justin Lockey from the band Editors. The singer has spoken openly of his battle with depression News of Mr Hutchison's death sparked tributes from fans and musicians. Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody paid tribute on Instagram to ""one of Scotland's most extraordinary song writers"". He said Mr Hutchison ""wrote with such profound insight into loss and longing and listening to his words always made me feel this heady mix of wonder, elation and pain. ""That pain that also makes you feel someone understands what you're going through and you don't feel so alone"". Frightened Rabbit, pictured here at Glastonbury in 2013, released five albums Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos tweeted: ""Awful news about Scott Hutchison. A terrible loss."" Stuart Murdoch, from Belle and Sebastian, wrote: ""Tragic news about Scott Hutchison. The whole music community in Scotland was praying for a different outcome."" DJ Edith Bowman said: ""Can't really believe I'm reading this. Saddest awakening ever. Love and best wishes to all the Hutchison and Frabbit family."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also tweeted: ""Heartbreaking news. My thoughts are with Scott's family, friends and fans. A remarkable and much loved talent."" The musician is originally from Selkirk but had been living in Glasgow. Frightened Rabbit were formed with Scott Hutchison on vocals and guitar and his brother Grant on drums, with the band's most recent line-up also featuring Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. They released the first of their five albums, Sing the Greys, in 2006, with Scott also releasing a solo album called Owl John. Scott and Grant had recently formed a new band called Mastersystem, joining forces with Justin Lockey from Editors and his brother James, a film maker. Their debut album, Dance Music, was released last month. Scott had also hinted at a sixth Frightened Rabbit album being released before the end of the year, saying they had five or six songs that were coming together.

Pothole 'epidemic' costs Â£1m a month,"Drivers and insurers are losing Â£1m a month repairing damage to vehicles caused by potholes, the AA says. The motorists' organisation says the number of claims for the first four months of 2018 already equal those for the whole of last year. It said there was a pothole ""epidemic"" that was a ""national embarrassment"". The Department for Transport said it was spending Â£23bn on England's roads to improve journeys, which included a pothole action fund. Based on its share of the car insurance market, the AA has extrapolated that there have been 4,200 such claims this year across the UK. Janet Connor, the AA's director of insurance, said spending cuts meant roads were not being properly maintained. ""Local council budgets have been squeezed to the extent that competing priorities mean they don't have the resources to keep their roads up to scratch,"" she said. ""Our nation's highways have become a national embarrassment."" The AA was seeing a growing number of pothole claims described as ""car severely damaged and un-driveable"", she said, which had not happened at all last year. The estimated average repair bill was Â£1,000, but the AA said that underestimated the true extent of the damage. Ms Connor said the Â£1m a month figure was not the whole story: ""In most cases the damage caused by a pothole - a ruined tyre or even two tyres and perhaps a wheel rim - doesn't justify making an insurance claim given that it is likely to lead to the loss of your excess and no-claim bonus. So the claims we are seeing are clearly much worse than that."" Pothole frustration led one Swindon man to start sticking dolls into offending holes in the road In March, the Secretary of State for Transport,Chris Grayling, announced a Â£100m fundfor road repairs, and admitted there had not been enough spent since the 1980s. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said it was providing councils in England with more than Â£6bn to help improve the condition of roads. ""This funding includes a record Â£296m through the Pothole Action Fund - enough to fix around 6 million potholes."" Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said councils needed more central funding to let them carry out the widespread improvement that roads required. A Highways England spokeswoman said it had replaced more than 4,400 miles of road surface in the past three years. The AA carries a check list for motorists on its website advising,externalwhat they should do if their vehicle is damaged by a pothole. Last week it said it had conducted a study and found that nine out of 10 drivers said the condition of UK roads had deteriorated over the past 10 years. Motorists' frustration with potholes have provoked some colourful protests recently. Last month, one motorist gained some publicity for his campaign against potholes that involved sticking dolls into holes in the road.

Police 'in control' as moped crime rises,"Many offenders take advantage of people distracted by their mobile phones The number of offences carried out by criminals using mopeds in London has increased by 30 times in five years. Data obtained by the BBC shows a jump from 827 offences in 2012 to more than 23,000 last year. High car insurance premiums and the boom in delivery services such as Deliveroo have increased the number of mopeds, an expert said. Police insisted they had not lost control of moped crime but ""there was more work to do"". During the period covered by the figures, more than 40% of such offences happened in just two boroughs. A Met Police superintendent said the surge in Camden and Islington was ""disappointing"", but new measures were helping to reduce offending. ""Moped-enabled crime"" describes offences carried out by people on mopeds or scooters, including drive-by thefts of pedestrians' phones and bags. Use our tool to see how badly your neighbourhood is affected.  Or select from           Since 2012, by far the most common type of crime has been theft and handling with 30,387 offences - around three quarters of the total:  Det Supt Caroline Haines, who leads the operation tackling moped crime in Camden and Islington, was asked if her team had a handle on the issue. She said: ""Yes we do, absolutely. Yes, there is a significant increase on last year overall, and that is very disappointing. ""Since January we've deployed a number of new tactics that are now starting to see dividends. ""But we're not done yet, and we're not complacent. We do understand there's a lot more work to do."" An increased number of scooters and mopeds on the streets has helped fuel the phenomenon She said hotspots arose around transport hubs, where commuters and tourists alike were often distracted as they checked their mobile phones or looked up directions. A plentiful supply of main roads leading in and out of London also provide easy escape routes for offenders. Smash-and-grab moped gang jailed over Â£1.2m spree Teenager jailed for moped acid attacks Ride-by moped thefts on shoppers rise six-fold Det Supt Haines saidnew tactics to tackle the issueinclude training more officers in pursuing offenders on mopeds, using remote-controlled spikes to puncture the tyres of suspects' bikes, and educating members of the public to be more aware of their surroundings. She also urged moped riders to make their vehicles theft-proof, due to the number of stolen vehicles used to commit crimes. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built using Carto.

Kirat Nandra broke her ribs and her hand when she was hit by a moped as thieves grabbed her bag Kirat Nandra, 51, broke her ribs and hand and got concussion when she was hit and dragged along a pavement by two people on a moped in September 2017. She was mugged on North Road, half a mile from Highgate Hill - the worst street in London for moped crimes. ""I didn't actually know what had happened to me. All I heard was my friend shouting my name, and I was being dragged,"" she said. ""I remember looking up, and realising the handles of my bag had got caught in the zip of my leather jacket. And I'd got tangled. ""It was so quick, so nobody could do anything."" Ms Nandra suffered severe bruising after being attacked by ""thugs"" on North Road Ms Nandra managed to pull herself free just before the moped swerved back on to the road in front of other traffic. Her handbag, two phones, cash and bank cards were all taken. The offenders, who wore dark clothes and had their faces covered, have not been caught because of a lack of evidence. ""I don't want to start pointing fingers or blaming, but something, somewhere, is going horribly wrong,"" Ms Nandra said. Det Supt Haines said she was ""sorry"" to hear Ms Nandra's case was dropped, adding that her team was ""absolutely committed"" to bringing moped criminals to justice. Det Supt Caroline Haines says she has a handle on the issue in Camden and Islington, despite the ""disappointing"" surge last year Remote-controlled spikes are used to puncture the tyres of suspects' vehicles Ms Nandra, who describes herself as a strong and confident person, said she felt ""ruined"" after the attack. ""Psychologically, it's scarred me,"" she said. ""I'll never be the same again."" She had almost two months either off work or working part-time as she struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She still has anxiety attacks, fears going out alone and has moved away from the area. ""I'll be OK, but I'll never be back to what I was before. I'll always have that fear in the back of my head,"" she said. This video can not be played Stories of moped crime from victims and police Dr Simon Harding, a criminology expert from the University of West London, said the surge was partly due to criminal gangs using changes in public behaviour to their advantage. The high cost of car insurance and the proliferation of food or goods delivery services such as Deliveroo meant there were more mopeds on the streets than there used to be, he said. Stealing a moped was simple, as was plucking an expensive device out of a distracted person's hands, he added. Dr Harding said street gangs on estates in north London were partly why this area has been so badly hit. ""We also know both Camden and Islington have a high number of small alleyways and canal paths - those are places that are very easy for people on scooters or bikes to access, but very difficult for the police to follow,"" he said.

US increases sanctions pressure on Iran,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US was ""intent"" on cutting revenue for Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps The US has imposed sanctions on six people and three companies it says have ties to Iran's elite military force, the Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the penalties targeted those who had funnelled millions of dollars to the group, funding its ""malign activity"". Iran's central bank helped the IRGC to access US dollars via ""a large-scale currency exchange network,"" he said. The Treasury Department said all six individuals were Iranian. US individuals and entities will be barred from doing business with them following the move, which was carried out in conjunction with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

""We are intent on cutting off IRGC revenue streams wherever their source and whatever their destination,"" he added. Iranian Revolutionary Guards at a military parade in Tehran Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Mr Khomeini quickly set up the IRGC to protect the state and defend the principles of his revolution. It has since grown into a major military, political and economic force in the country. With thousands of troops and advanced military equipment, the Guards have been behind many of Iran's key military operations. The latest sanctions specifically target its elite overseas operations arm, the Quds Force.

Body found in search for missing singerPolice say formal identification is yet to take place but the family of Scott Hutchison have been informed.15m16 minutes agoScotland,"A body found at a marina on the banks of the Firth of Forth has been confirmed as missing Frightened Rabbit singer Scott Hutchison. The discovery was made at Port Edgar, between the Forth Road Bridge and Queensferry Crossing, at about 20:30 on Thursday. Mr Hutchison, 36, went missing in the early hours of Wednesday morning. His family said there had been recent concerns about his mental health, and they were ""devastated"" by his death. Mr Hutchison had spoken openly about his battle with depression over the years, with elder brother Neil saying he had done so ""in an attempt to help other people with similar conditions"". In a statement released on Friday, the family said Mr Hutchison ""wore his heart on his sleeve, and that was evident in the lyrics of his music and the content of many of his social media posts. ""He was passionate, articulate and charismatic, as well as being one of the funniest and kindest people we knew. Friends and family would all agree that he had a brilliant sense of humour and was a great person to be around."" 'His music meant so much to people' Profile: Frightened Rabbit Scott Hutchison at The Quay Sessions with new band Mastersystem The statement added that relatives had ""remained positive and hopeful that he would walk back through the door, having taken some time away to compose himself"". And it described Mr Hutchison as a ""wonderful son, brother, uncle and friend"" who always had time for those he cared for. Scott Hutchison formed Frightened Rabbit alongside his brother Grant, the band's drummer ""Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you"", it added. ""Scott battled bravely with his own issues for many years and we are immensely proud of him for being so open with his struggles. ""His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues."" If you or someone you know has been affected by mental health problems,these organisations may be able to help. His Frightened Rabbit bandmates released a statement saying: ""There are no words to describe the overwhelming sadness and pain that comes with the death of our beloved Scott, but to know he is no longer suffering brings us some comfort. ""Reading messages of support and hope from those he has helped through his art has helped immensely and we encourage you all to continue doing this. ""He will be missed by all of us and his absence will always be felt but he leaves a legacy of hope, kindness and colour that will forever be remembered and shared."" Scott Hutchison was last seen after visiting the Dakota Hotel in South Queensferry The singer and guitarist had last been seen on CCTV footage leaving the Dakota Hotel in nearby South Queensferry at 01:00 on Wednesday. Two hours earlier, he had tweeted: ""Be so good to everyone you love. It's not a given. I'm so annoyed that it's not. I didn't live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones."" Shortly afterwards, he added: ""I'm away now. Thanks."" Frightened Rabbit were formed by Mr Hutchison and brother Grant on drums. The band released their debut album Sing the Greys in 2006, and went on to release four more albums. The brothers also released a critically-acclaimed album last month as part of Mastersystem - a supergroup that also included Justin Lockey from the band Editors. The singer has spoken openly of his battle with depression News of Mr Hutchison's death sparked tributes from fans and musicians. Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody paid tribute on Instagram to ""one of Scotland's most extraordinary song writers"". He said Mr Hutchison ""wrote with such profound insight into loss and longing and listening to his words always made me feel this heady mix of wonder, elation and pain. ""That pain that also makes you feel someone understands what you're going through and you don't feel so alone"". Frightened Rabbit, pictured here at Glastonbury in 2013, released five albums Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos tweeted: ""Awful news about Scott Hutchison. A terrible loss."" Stuart Murdoch, from Belle and Sebastian, wrote: ""Tragic news about Scott Hutchison. The whole music community in Scotland was praying for a different outcome."" DJ Edith Bowman said: ""Can't really believe I'm reading this. Saddest awakening ever. Love and best wishes to all the Hutchison and Frabbit family."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also tweeted: ""Heartbreaking news. My thoughts are with Scott's family, friends and fans. A remarkable and much loved talent."" The musician is originally from Selkirk but had been living in Glasgow. Frightened Rabbit were formed with Scott Hutchison on vocals and guitar and his brother Grant on drums, with the band's most recent line-up also featuring Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. They released the first of their five albums, Sing the Greys, in 2006, with Scott also releasing a solo album called Owl John. Scott and Grant had recently formed a new band called Mastersystem, joining forces with Justin Lockey from Editors and his brother James, a film maker. Their debut album, Dance Music, was released last month. Scott had also hinted at a sixth Frightened Rabbit album being released before the end of the year, saying they had five or six songs that were coming together.

"MPs criticise 'unrealistic' MoD plansMinistry of Defence's 10-year spending plan faces a shortfall of between Â£4.9bn and Â£20.8bn, say MPs.5h5 hours agoUK Politics","Ministry of Defence spending plans are simply ""not realistic"" and could be more than Â£20bn over budget, the Commons spending watchdog says. It criticises the department for not being ""open"" about the shortfall and relying on ""optimistic saving targets"". ""The Ministry of Defence simply does not have enough money to buy all the equipment it says it needs,"" MPs say. The MoD said MPs were highlighting an ""unlikely worst-case scenario"" and it was ""on track"" to meet savings targets. MoD 'exposed financially' by carrier and jet programme MoD equipment plans 'need more savings' The department plans to spend almost Â£180bn on new military equipment over the next decade, including new submarines, warships and aircraft. But the Commons public accounts committee has warned of a ""worrying"" funding gap, with forecast costs of at least Â£4.9bn and potentially up to Â£20.8bn, leaving it without sufficient funds to buy all the equipment. Renewing the Trident nuclear weapons system is the biggest financial risk, say MPs The biggest risk to the Â£180bn equipment plan is the rising costs of renewing the Trident nuclear weapons system. The committee was concerned that a need to bring forward some of the cost of building the next generation of nuclear missile submarines would put an extra strain on the budget. The MoD itself was criticised for lacking ""cost control"", a ""vagueness and reluctance to acknowledge its full exposure"", not being open about its financial risks and for putting its faith in a defence review - the Modernising Defence Programme - to ""solve its affordability issues"". ""We are highly sceptical that the Modernising Defence Programme will be able to return the department to a balanced position,"" the report says. There was also some concern that the bulk of planned spending was on large-scale programmes that take years to build - leaving little headroom in the budget for responding to new threats like cyber attacks and artificial intelligence. Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said there was ""no excuse"" for the MoD's ""lack of rigour in its financial affairs"". ""The department must be more rigorous and realistic in its approach to costing its equipment plan. It also needs to be more open with Parliament and the public about its finances, commitments and their costs to taxpayers. The MoD says its plan is to give the armed forces the very best equipment ""We heard a lot in evidence about the Modernising Defence Programme but I am concerned this may end up adding more costs to what is already an overstretched budget,"" the report said. The MoD said it had already made Â£7.9bn of savings out of its Â£16bn target and was working on publishing a ""more accessible account"" of its planned equipment spending up to 2028 by the autumn. A spokesman said: ""We are committed to delivering large, complex and technologically challenging defence programmes as part of our Â£180bn plan to give our military the very best equipment. ""We recognise financial risk comes with that, but the potential affordability gap highlighted by this report reflects an unlikely, worst-case scenario in which all possibilities materialise. ""We are on track to meet our Â£16bn savings target and will also review these recommendations as part of our Modernising Defence Programme, which aims to strengthen our armed forces in the face of intensifying threats.""

"'Build all Navy ships in UK', says Corbyn","Mr Corbyn was speaking at a shipbuilding museum in Govan Jeremy Corbyn has called for navy shipbuilding contracts to stay in the UK in a speech in Glasgow. There has been speculation that a Â£1bn contract for three new Royal Fleet Auxiliary support ships could go to a foreign shipyard. The vessels will provide ammunition, equipment and food to Royal Navy warships. The Labour leader claimed that building them abroad would ""trash"" the UK's shipbuilding tradition. Current UK government policy is for British yards to construct complex warships such as the eight Type 26 frigates which are to be built at BAE Systems' Govan and Scotstoun shipyards on the Clyde over the next 20 years. But non-combat vessels can be built overseas - with a Â£450m deal to build four tankers to fuel navy ships at sea being awarded to Daewoo, a South Korean firm, in 2012. The Ministry of Defence contract for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary solid support ships is expected to go out to international tender later this month - but unions have called for the process to be UK-only. Speaking last month, Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood that it would be a ""blatant betrayal"" if the work did not go to Scottish shipyards as ""during the (independence) referendum, promises were made to those shipyards by the Tories"". She added: ""I argue that that work was promised to the Clyde and should definitely go to the Clyde."" However, it has been reported that the BAE yards on the Clydeare not likely to bid for the contract,externalas they are already at full capacity with the Type 26 work. There have been suggestions that the Port Glasgow and Rosyth yards - owned by Ferguson Marine and Babcock respectively - could form part of any UK-based bid. Royal Fleet Auxiliary support vessels are used to resupply Royal Navy warships around the world On a visit to Govan, Mr Corbyn said building the ships somewhere in the UK could secure more than 6,500 jobs - 1,800 of these in shipyards. He argued that workers in British shipyards ""share a proud tradition - building the best ships in the world"". But he warned: ""The Conservative government is trashing that tradition by offering up the Ministry of Defence's most recent contract for three new Fleet Solid Support Ships to overseas companies to build abroad. ""This decision is wrong. Today we are calling on the government to guarantee that these three new ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary will be built in domestic shipyards. ""Our shipyards used to produce half of all new ships worldwide. Our current market share is now less than half a percent. The Tories seem hell-bent on accelerating and deepening this industrial decline."" The Labour leader also pledged that his party would use public contracts as part of its bigger plans to upgrade the economy, and urged people not to listen to anyone who said the country was no longer capable of building things. His call was welcomed by the GMB union, which has been campaigning to keep the contract for the new military support ships in the UK. Its Scottish secretary, Gary Smith, said: ""What would the RFAs mean for places like Port Glasgow or Roysth? It would means jobs growth, modern apprenticeship opportunities, prosperity and redistribution of wealth into local communities - the prize is massive."" The MoD said that the work on eight new Type 26 anti-submarine ships and five smaller Type 31 frigates mean that the UK ""is witnessing a renaissance in shipbuilding"", including securing ""4,000 jobs and 20 years of work"" on the Clyde. A spokesman added: ""We are launching a competition for three new Fleet Solid Support ships this year and strongly encourage British yards to take part. ""Since 2010 this government has invested more than Â£6bn in shipbuilding in the UK, securing thousands of jobs. In 2018/19 we expect to spend in excess of Â£750m supporting the fleet."" And it has said that UK shipyards are ""strongly encouraged"" to bid for the support ship contract, which is expected to be awarded in 2020. Meanwhile, SNP MSP Bill Kidd said Mr Corbyn had a ""brass neck coming to Glasgow to make more empty statements on shipbuilding"". He added: ""Workers on the Clyde and people across Scotland haven't forgotten Labour's betrayal of the industry in 2014 - making promises they couldn't keep in order to shore up votes in their grubby alliance with the Tories.""

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, says he wants to tackle the ""ticking time bomb"" of child obesity in the capital. If the proposal is approved, adverts for ""unhealthy food and drink"" will be banned on the London Underground, Overground, buses and bus shelters. The scheme is backed by child health experts but the Advertising Association said it would have ""little impact"". The junk food advertising ban forms part of Mr Khan'sLondon Food Strategy,external, which has been published for consultation. TfL's director of TfL's transport strategy Lilli Matson said it had a ""large advertising estate with a diverse audience"", and is supporting the mayor's attempts to make London healthier. Sadiq Khan has described London's child obesity issue as a ""ticking time bomb"" Mr Khan wants to ""reduce the influence and pressure that can be put on children and families to make unhealthy choices"". He said: ""I am determined to do all I can to tackle this issue with the powers I have and help Londoners make healthy food choices for themselves and their families. ""That is why I am proposing to ban adverts for harmful junk food from our entire Tube and bus network."" Mr Khan intends to ban adverts for food and drinks high in fat, salt or sugar. How Amsterdam is reducing child obesity 'Stark' increase in overweight youngsters If the plan goes ahead ""junk food"" adverts will be banned on the Underground, Overground and bus network A spokesman for the mayor's office said if the ban comes in ""everyone will be affected, whether it's the biggest fast food chain or the most niche"", and their products will be assessed against thenutrient profiling model,externaldeveloped by the Food Standards Agency. Companies could, he added, choose to swap their adverts for burgers or fizzy drinks for ""healthier products within their range, such as salads or bottled water"". The burgers may be banned, the fizzy drinks may fizzle out, but have we seen the last of adverts from companies who make their money selling such things to Londoners? The truth is, probably not. It seems the mayor is trying to have his (low-calorie) cake and eat it. Perhaps aware that high sugar, fat and salt ads bring in around Â£13m for TfL he says his new ban will not apply to companies - just to their less healthy products. Advertise with us, he'll say, as long as you're pushing your healthier wares. That could cut the expected losses to TfL, but how does the policy fit into a wider business plan that sees shops at stations selling unhealthy snacks? Or kiosks on the Tube selling chocolates and crisps? ""We can all indulge occasionally,"" the mayor told me. Advertisers will now have to decide how occasionally they wish to indulge when it comes to the big sell on London's Tube and buses. Chef and health campaigner Jamie Oliver - who has said London ""now has the most overweight and obese children of any major global city"" - described the proposal as ""bold"". The Advertising Association says a ban would have ""little impact"" City Hall says the capital has one of the highest child overweight and obesity rates in Europe, with almost 40% of children aged 10 and 11 either overweight or obese. It has identified ""stark differences"" between boroughs, with children from poorer areas ""disproportionately affected"". Young people in Barking and Dagenham are almost twice as likely to be overweight as children from Richmond-upon-Thames, it says. ""We need to ensure those families have access to nutritional and healthy food but aren't disproportionately exposed to adverts for unhealthy foods,"" Mr Khan told BBC Radio London's Vanessa Feltz, adding that there are some parts of London ""where you simply haven't got access to fresh fruit and veg"". Child and teen obesity spreading across the globe Reality Check: Is UK among worst in Western Europe for child obesity? Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said advertising was ""one of the leading contributors for the growth of child obesity"", adding: ""It is therefore vital, especially in cities like London where deprivation is high, that it is tackled."" An Advertising Association spokesperson said the UK already bans advertising of high fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) food or drink products in all media where under 16s make up more than 25% of the audience. He added that for outdoor advertising, such as posters on the Underground, there is a recommendation that no sites can carry HFSS advertising within 100m of any school. ""International experience and independent research has shown an advertising ban would have little impact on the wider societal issues that drive obesity,"" he said. Today's announcement has been welcomed by healthy food charity Sustain and the Obesity Health Alliance Lead, which said it hoped the Government would follow suit by banning junk food ads on TV after 21:00 as part of chapter 2 ofits obesity plan,external. The Department of Health said it has ""not ruled out taking further action"" following itstax on sugary drinks which came into force last month. Soft drink sugar tax starts, but will it work?

"MPs to examine Dangerous Dogs ActA Commons committee is to consider whether the 1991 law is effective, as figures suggest a rise in attacks.","Four breeds are banned in the UK: the pit bull terrier, Japanese tosa, dogo Argentino and fila Brasileiro MPs are to investigate the effectiveness of the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act amid figures suggesting there has been an increase in attacks. Hospital admissions for dog attacks rose by 76% in a decade, according to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. It will examine whether the public is being properly protected and look at animal welfare concerns. The RSPCA says the law is ""ineffective and unjust"" and needs replacing. Breeds banned by the act are the: pit bull terrier Japanese tosa dogo Argentino fila Brasileiro Owners can get a certificate of exemption if a court believes the dog is not dangerous. Dog detained by police for two years Dangerous Dogs Act 'has never worked' Boy, 11, needs surgery after dog attack The 1991 act also makes it an offence for an owner to allow any dog ""to be dangerously out of control"". The legislation was aimed at reducing dog attacks, butfigures from 2015suggested hospital admissions related to them had risen 76% from the same period 10 years previously. And the committee pointed to RSPCA figures suggesting that of the 30 people killed by dogs between 1991 and 2016, 21 had been attacked by dogs that were not banned. The charity has since updated this figure to 37 deaths, of which 28 involved non-banned breeds. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee will investigate: whether the law is preventing dog attacks what lessons can be learned from other countries whether any changes are needed Neil Parish, who chairs the committee, said: ""Four types of dog were banned in the UK in 1991, but since then 70% of dog-related deaths have been caused by those not prohibited by legislation. ""There is evidence to suggest that we should account for the temperament of the dog when assessing its danger to society. ""There is also the view that some banned dog breeds can be suitable pets in certain circumstances. ""Our inquiry will look at whether the government should be taking a more individualised approach to judging the threat posed by dogs, or whether blanket bans remain the most appropriate means of regulation."" Among those who have criticised the legislation are the Kennel Club and Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell called for a review two years ago, arguing the act was ""simply not effective"" and that the problem was not with the dogs but with their owners. The RSPCA has campaigned against ""breed specific"" legislation, arguing that the evidence is not there to suggest the banned breeds are more aggressive. RSPCA dog welfare expert Samantha Gaines said she was pleased MPs had ""listened to the serious concerns of animal welfare organisations"". ""We strongly believe that breed-specific legislation is ineffective at protecting the public and compromises dog welfare,"" she said. ""The fact is that the way a dog looks and his breed is not a predictor of whether he or she is likely to be aggressive."" She said thousands of dogs had been put down or ""kennelled unnecessarily"", while fatal dog attacks had continued. The Dangerous Dogs Act has been amended over time. In 2014, sentencing guidelines in England and Wales were changed to raise the maximum jail sentence for a fatal dog attack from two years to 14. The law was also extended to include attacks on private property. And the police and authorities were given powers to require owners to attend dog training classes or muzzle their dog in public.

Pothole 'epidemic' costs Â£1m a monthThe AA says the number of claims for damage caused by potholes has soared this year.5h5 hours agoBusiness,"Drivers and insurers are losing Â£1m a month repairing damage to vehicles caused by potholes, the AA says. The motorists' organisation says the number of claims for the first four months of 2018 already equal those for the whole of last year. It said there was a pothole ""epidemic"" that was a ""national embarrassment"". The Department for Transport said it was spending Â£23bn on England's roads to improve journeys, which included a pothole action fund. Based on its share of the car insurance market, the AA has extrapolated that there have been 4,200 such claims this year across the UK. Janet Connor, the AA's director of insurance, said spending cuts meant roads were not being properly maintained. ""Local council budgets have been squeezed to the extent that competing priorities mean they don't have the resources to keep their roads up to scratch,"" she said. ""Our nation's highways have become a national embarrassment."" The AA was seeing a growing number of pothole claims described as ""car severely damaged and un-driveable"", she said, which had not happened at all last year. The estimated average repair bill was Â£1,000, but the AA said that underestimated the true extent of the damage. Ms Connor said the Â£1m a month figure was not the whole story: ""In most cases the damage caused by a pothole - a ruined tyre or even two tyres and perhaps a wheel rim - doesn't justify making an insurance claim given that it is likely to lead to the loss of your excess and no-claim bonus. So the claims we are seeing are clearly much worse than that."" Pothole frustration led one Swindon man to start sticking dolls into offending holes in the road In March, the Secretary of State for Transport,Chris Grayling, announced a Â£100m fundfor road repairs, and admitted there had not been enough spent since the 1980s. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said it was providing councils in England with more than Â£6bn to help improve the condition of roads. ""This funding includes a record Â£296m through the Pothole Action Fund - enough to fix around 6 million potholes."" Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said councils needed more central funding to let them carry out the widespread improvement that roads required. A Highways England spokeswoman said it had replaced more than 4,400 miles of road surface in the past three years. The AA carries a check list for motorists on its website advising,externalwhat they should do if their vehicle is damaged by a pothole. Last week it said it had conducted a study and found that nine out of 10 drivers said the condition of UK roads had deteriorated over the past 10 years. Motorists' frustration with potholes have provoked some colourful protests recently. Last month, one motorist gained some publicity for his campaign against potholes that involved sticking dolls into holes in the road.

MPs criticise 'unrealistic' MoD plans,"Ministry of Defence spending plans are simply ""not realistic"" and could be more than Â£20bn over budget, the Commons spending watchdog says. It criticises the department for not being ""open"" about the shortfall and relying on ""optimistic saving targets"". ""The Ministry of Defence simply does not have enough money to buy all the equipment it says it needs,"" MPs say. The MoD said MPs were highlighting an ""unlikely worst-case scenario"" and it was ""on track"" to meet savings targets. MoD 'exposed financially' by carrier and jet programme MoD equipment plans 'need more savings' The department plans to spend almost Â£180bn on new military equipment over the next decade, including new submarines, warships and aircraft. But the Commons public accounts committee has warned of a ""worrying"" funding gap, with forecast costs of at least Â£4.9bn and potentially up to Â£20.8bn, leaving it without sufficient funds to buy all the equipment. Renewing the Trident nuclear weapons system is the biggest financial risk, say MPs The biggest risk to the Â£180bn equipment plan is the rising costs of renewing the Trident nuclear weapons system. The committee was concerned that a need to bring forward some of the cost of building the next generation of nuclear missile submarines would put an extra strain on the budget. The MoD itself was criticised for lacking ""cost control"", a ""vagueness and reluctance to acknowledge its full exposure"", not being open about its financial risks and for putting its faith in a defence review - the Modernising Defence Programme - to ""solve its affordability issues"". ""We are highly sceptical that the Modernising Defence Programme will be able to return the department to a balanced position,"" the report says. There was also some concern that the bulk of planned spending was on large-scale programmes that take years to build - leaving little headroom in the budget for responding to new threats like cyber attacks and artificial intelligence. Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said there was ""no excuse"" for the MoD's ""lack of rigour in its financial affairs"". ""The department must be more rigorous and realistic in its approach to costing its equipment plan. It also needs to be more open with Parliament and the public about its finances, commitments and their costs to taxpayers. The MoD says its plan is to give the armed forces the very best equipment ""We heard a lot in evidence about the Modernising Defence Programme but I am concerned this may end up adding more costs to what is already an overstretched budget,"" the report said. The MoD said it had already made Â£7.9bn of savings out of its Â£16bn target and was working on publishing a ""more accessible account"" of its planned equipment spending up to 2028 by the autumn. A spokesman said: ""We are committed to delivering large, complex and technologically challenging defence programmes as part of our Â£180bn plan to give our military the very best equipment. ""We recognise financial risk comes with that, but the potential affordability gap highlighted by this report reflects an unlikely, worst-case scenario in which all possibilities materialise.

May splits cabinet to find Brexit solution,"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Theresa May has divided her top team of ministers into two working groups to hammer out their differences on Brexit. The cabinet is split over how to manage customs arrangements with the EU. Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson are against Mrs May's preferred option of a ""customs partnership"", which is backed by Remain-voting ministers. Mr Johnson's preferred model relies on technology to minimise customs checks. The EU has expressed doubts about whether either option would work. The prime minister has said further work is needed to come up with a solution that will deliver on her promise of frictionless trade without the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Kuenssberg: Is there another Brexit way for May? Reality Check: The government's customs options UK-EU customs partnership 'still on table' Why is the customs union so important? She is under pressure to find a solution to present to the EU at the next round of Brexit talks, with just five months left to get an agreement on post-Brexit trade, so it can be ratified before Britain leaves in March next year. Mr Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond - who are thought to have been at loggerheads over the customs issue - will not play a role in either of the two working groups. Brexiteer and Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Remainer and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley will sit in different groups One group - Brexiteers Michael Gove and Liam Fox and Remain-backing Cabinet Office minister David Lidington - will consider a ""customs partnership"" whereby the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU - but without the need for new border checks. Downing Street said this group would be discussing how to make trade deals with non-EU countries - something Brexiteers say would be impossible under this option. The other group - Remain-backing Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Remain-voting Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley - will look at ""maximum facilitation"" - a solution based on using technology to minimise the need for customs checks after Brexit. The members of this group will be looking at how to avoid the return of a hard Irish border. The work was being carried out ""as a priority,"" the prime minister's official spokesman said. The next meeting of the cabinet's Brexit sub-committee is on Tuesday. All EU members are part of the customs union which means there are no tariffs on goods transported between member states. Labour is in favour of setting up a new customs union with the EU after Brexit, something it says is backed by the trade unions and industry body the CBI. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. The customs partnership is thought to be the prime minister's preferred option butForeign Secretary Boris Johnson has described it as ""crazy""and said it would create ""a whole new web of bureaucracy"". Please upgrade your browser The maximum facilitation proposal - also known as ""max-fac"" - would employ new technologies and trusted trader schemes to remove the need for physical customs checks. Trusted trader schemes would enable companies to pay duties every few months rather than every time they crossed the border. Considering this option will be Remainers Business Secretary Greg Clark and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and the pro-Leave Brexit Secretary David Davis. The customs union ensures EU member states all apply the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals. The UK government has said it wants to leave the EU customs union in order to strike its own trade deals with other countries. Ministers are under pressure to have made progress on the issue before next month's EU summit.

RSPCA dog welfare expert Samantha Gaines said she was pleased MPs had ""listened to the serious concerns of animal welfare organisations"". ""We strongly believe that breed-specific legislation is ineffective at protecting the public and compromises dog welfare,"" she said. ""The fact is that the way a dog looks and his breed is not a predictor of whether he or she is likely to be aggressive."" She said thousands of dogs had been put down or ""kennelled unnecessarily"", while fatal dog attacks had continued. The Dangerous Dogs Act has been amended over time. In 2014, sentencing guidelines in England and Wales were changed to raise the maximum jail sentence for a fatal dog attack from two years to 14. The law was also extended to include attacks on private property. And the police and authorities were given powers to require owners to attend dog training classes or muzzle their dog in public.

Asked by Vogue magazine whether she had suspicions, fashion designer Georgina Chapman replied: ""Absolutely not."" The interview comes seven months after the first of dozens of women accused him of sexual assault and harassment. Chapman admitted she had been ""so naive"", and was ""so humiliated and so broken"" when the scandal unfolded. Weinstein and Chapman married in 2007 andshe announced that she was leaving himdays after the allegations emerged. Vogue described him as her ""soon-to-be ex-husband"". The movie mogul has denied all allegations of ""non-consensual sex"". The British designer, who founded the Marchesa label, said she didn't go out in public for five months after the story broke. Georgina Chapman: ""I had what I thought was a very happy marriage"" ""I was so humiliated and so broken that I didn't think it was respectful to go out,""she told US Vogue,external. ""I thought, 'who am I to be parading around with all of this going on?'. It's still so very, very raw. I was walking up the stairs the other day and I stopped. It was like all the air had been punched out of my lungs."" The couple have two children, who are aged seven and five. She said: ""There was a part of me that was terribly naive - clearly, so naive. ""I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief. And I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be?""

PM apology over Libyans' 'appalling treatment',"This video can not be played Abdul Hakim Belhaj: ""I hope that it is a new page in history"" The UK government has apologised to a Libyan dissident and his wife after its actions contributed to their detention, transfer to Libya and his torture by Colonel Gaddafi's forces in 2004. Prime Minister Theresa May said Abdul Hakim Belhaj and Fatima Boudchar had suffered ""appalling treatment"". Ms Boudchar, who was pregnant at the time, has accepted Mrs May's apology and will receive a Â£500,000 payout. The couple say an MI6 tip-off helped the US kidnap them in Thailand. Who is Abdel Hakim Belhaj? How was the UK involved and why? Q&A: UK rendition allegations Mr Belhaj was taken to Tripoli and says he was tortured by his Libyan jailers during a six-year spell in prison. Ms Boudchar was also detained but was released shortly before giving birth. Speaking to BBC News, he said the apology should serve as a ""lesson"" to governments not to repeat the couple's rendition. ""I hope that it is a new page in history, that we guarantee and strengthen human rights and this practice is not repeated which violated mine and my wife's rights."" Mr Belhaj added the six years the family waited for this was ""an extension of the suffering for my family"" on top of the years he was held captive. In a letter read out in the Commons, Mrs May said UK actions had contributed to the couple's capture and that the government had ""shared information"" about them with ""international partners"". This video can not be played Fatima Boudchar: ""This is a historic day for us"" The letter said: ""It is clear that you were both subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly, not least to the dignity of Mrs Boudchar, who was pregnant at the time. ""The UK government believes your accounts. Neither of you should have been treated this way. The UK government's actions contributed to your detention, rendition and suffering. The UK government shared information about you with its international partners."" Mrs May said the UK ""should have done more to reduce the risk"" of the pair being mistreated, adding: ""We accept this was a failing on our part. On behalf of Her Majesty's government, I apologise unreservedly."" Ms Boudchar, who travelled to the UK with her son Abderrahim to hear the statement in Parliament, described the day's events as ""historic"" and called on world leaders to show solidarity for those who have suffered injustice ""even if they're of different religion or culture"". By Dominic Casciani The settlement is the first time ministers have apologised for a specific act involving British security agencies. Papers discovered in Tripoli, Libya - during the fall of the dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 -  included evidence of how MI6 and the CIA had groomed Gaddafi and his regime to come in from the cold. The UK's plan was to convince Gaddafi to not only stop threatening the West, but to also provide intelligence on Libyan dissidents and their potential links to al-Qaeda. Details of secret conferences and documents referring to Mr Belhaj have emerged and help illustrate how the rendition case developed. Read more from Dominic Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who read out Mrs May's letter, said Mr Belhaj had not sought and would not receive financial compensation. However, friends of the couple said the UK had agreed to pay Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar's ""substantial"" legal fees. Jack Straw, foreign secretary at the time of the rendition case, issued a statement in which he said he had ""sought to act at all times in a manner which was fully consistent with my legal duties, and with national and international law"". He said it had been part of his role to approve ""a wide range of matters to protect our national security"" including the sharing of information with international partners. This included getting assurances that those concerned were being treated humanely, he said. Abdul Hakim Belhaj led an Islamic group fighting against the Libyan government Mr Belhaj was born in 1966 in the Souq al-Jumaa area of Tripoli and studied at al-Fateh University, where press reports say he earned a civil engineering degree. He became an opponent of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi and commanded the now defunct Libyan Islamic Fighting Group which staged a low-level insurgency war and attempted to assassinate Col Gaddafi three times. He fled the country in 2001 but was three years later abducted in Bangkok - along with his wife, then five-months pregnant - while attempting to fly to London to claim asylum in the UK. Mr Belhaj is now a politician in Libya. The documents trail that nailed UK's role in rendition UK 'settles case' with Libyan ex-dissident Q&A: UK rendition allegations Who is Abdel Hakim Belhaj?

The docs that nailed UK's role,"Abdul Hakim Belhaj spent six years in jail in Libya where, he says, he was tortured The British government has made an unprecedented apology to a former Libyan dissident and his wife who were abducted with crucial assistance from MI6. Abdul Hakim Belhaj said MI6 helped the US seize him in Thailand in 2004 to return him and his Moroccan wife, Fatima Boudchar, to Libya, where he says he was tortured. The government has accepted the couple's account of what happened - and the settlement is the first time ministers have apologised for a specific act involving British security agencies. The legal battle came about because documents discovered in Tripoli, Libya - during the fall of the dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 - revealed how MI6 became involved in the couple's rendition. While the government's apology maintains a denial of legal liability, the settlement leaves questions unanswered about how much others in government were involved in what happened. This is how the affair developed. In the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, the US and its allies were in a race to understand jihadist groups they had previously not done enough to track. British intelligence agencies wanted to know more about Libyan dissidents who had been living under UK protection - mostly families linked to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). Fatima Boudchar, wife of Abdul Hakim Belhadj, and their son, Abderrahim The group had attempted armed overthrows of Gaddafi's regime in the 1990s and its defeated leaders had scattered around the world. The UK's plan was to convince Colonel Gaddafi to not only stop threatening the West, but to also provide intelligence on these LIFG members and their potential links to al-Qaeda. In September 2011, a team from Human Rights Watch raided the abandoned headquarters of Libyan's External Security Organisation (ESO) after the dictator's eventual downfall - and the documents they found made jaws drop. Sir Mark Allen, whose communications reveal the UK's role in handling Mr Belhaj The papers included evidence of how MI6 and the CIA had groomed Gaddafi and his henchmen to come in from the cold - and one senior MI6 officer, Sir Mark Allen, was at the centre of the operation. From 2001 he sought to convince Moussa Koussa - his Libyan counterpart and a man who had been widely accused of torture and other human rights abuses - to work with the West. Mr Koussa wanted two things: international recognition for Libya and respect for Gaddafi - and intelligence leading to the capture of LIFG leaders on the run. The Tripoli documents show the pair met on 20 September 2001 and agreed that each country's counter-terrorism teams should work together against common enemies. MI6 asked if the Libyans would help operations to penetrate jihadist groups. The next document - from the British side - is the first that referred to Mr Belhaj, albeit through one of his aliases and, confusingly, apparently mixing up some of his details with another dissident who was also later abducted. A later secret conference, also including the German and Austrian intelligence services, was detailed in a memo circulated among ESO chiefs. It said that the British and others were ""willing to co-operate"" - but the UK had stressed that any co-operation on tracking down what the Libyans called ""heretics"" would need to be lawful. The MI6 team promised to help the Libyans and began suggesting they had information that could be useful. The breakthrough in relations appears to have come in 2002 when Sir Mark finally convinced Libya to work properly with the UK - leading to the then Foreign Office minister Mike O'Brien visiting the country in August. Later that year, the Libyans came to London and, according to their records, attended a ""banquet dinner"" hosted by MI6 at the Â£500-a-night Goring Hotel. The agency was pressing for more - telling the Libyans they had to move faster and further in co-operating with the West if they were going to get the recognition they sought. All of this diplomacy ultimately led to what became known as the 2004 ""deal in the desert"" - in which Prime Minister Tony Blair sealed what looked like a remarkable turnaround in Colonel Gaddafi's attitude. But it came at a price. And that price was, according to the documents at least, the UK's willingness to provide information on the whereabouts of the regime's enemies. In June 2003, the ESO received a memo from the British setting out the extent of operations to date. Another document contained the first proof that the UK was apparently willing to provide information on what it knew about Mr Belhaj. The British agencies thought he was in China - and initially MI6 didn't confirm that to the Libyans. But in November, a new communication to Tripoli confirmed the British had ""embarked on a project"" relating to the dissident: By the end of 2003, the UK was pretty confident the Libyan's were co-operating and on the road to a comprehensive deal for Libya to give up its chemical weapons. On Christmas Eve of that year, Sir Mark sent a memo to Mr Koussa, thanking him for his efforts: The UK and US were confident they were getting a deal - and it was now time for the UK to settle the intelligence bill. On 1 March, London told Tripoli that Mr Belhaj, travelling under a pseudonym, had been apprehended by the Chinese authorities as he tried to board a flight to London with his wife, Fatima Boudchar, who was four months pregnant. The couple were deported to Malaysia and were being held in detention.  An MI6 cable listed all the false names Mr Belhaj was thought to be using, such as Abdullah Sadeq, to evade capture. Libya fired off a series of urgent requests to Malaysia's government, requesting that it hand over the ""dangerous"" dissident who it considered ""the prince of the LIFG"". The US intervened and told Tripoli it was going to help secure Mr Belhaj and bring him to Libya - providing that it would get a chance to interrogate him once he was behind bars. On 6 March, the plan was in place. Malaysian authorities put Mr Belhaj and Mrs Boudchar on a flight to Bangkok where, instead of being transferred on to a connection for London, the Thai authorities detained them and, according to their lawyers, they were tortured. The following day, a US rendition flight team picked up the pair and flew them to Tripoli. On 18 March, Sir Mark sent this congratulatory message to Mr Koussa - making clear that he believed the capture of Mr Belhaj, referred to here by his nom de guerre Abu 'Abd Allsh, was down to the British alone: Mr Belhaj, one of Gaddafi's greatest enemies, was tortured over six years and given a death sentence, which was never carried out. His wife was released before she gave birth - and the son she was carrying at the time was in the House of Commons to hear the historic apology from the UK. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the settlement with the couple included a Â£500,000 payment to Ms Boudchar. ""It is clear that you were both subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly,"" Theresa May said in a letter to the pair. ""We should have done more to reduce the risk that you would be mistreated,"" she added. ""We accept this was a failing on our part."" Sir Mark Allen has never spoken publicly about the affair. He, along with former foreign secretary Jack Straw, and all the agencies involved, denied individual wrongdoing.

Why grammars refuse to be written off,"Pupils at Harold Hill in 1963: The grammar school was abolished a decade later When Norma Jennings talks about grammar schools, she does not talk about statistics or education policy, she talks about her memories of teachers and how her schooldays still make such a strong impression decades later. The debate about creating new grammar schools in England has heard many attacks on the negative impact of selection. But to understand the durable appeal of grammars, there's a need to consider a different type of evidence, the personal experiences of former pupils, who can feel that their memories have been shouted down in all the political exchanges. Norma Jennings has helped to write the history of her old school - Harold Hill Grammar School in Essex - which was abolished as a grammar school in 1973. And her memories encapsulate how the grammars have retained such a hold on the post-War imagination. She sent a copy of the book to Prime Minister Theresa May with a letter about what she thought had been lost when most of the grammar system was scrapped. School berets are ceremonially dismantled at the end of the school year in 1964 Harold Hill Grammar School was built in the mid-1950s to serve new overspill estates built in Essex to accommodate thousands of east London families needing homes after the Second World War. It was a piece of deliberate social planning, designed to take the brightest children and create a new generation of professionals. Mrs Jennings, who left the school in 1963, says it's easy to forget how radical and ""revolutionary"" all this seemed. Working-class children were being given the chance to have an education that would never have been within the reach of their parents. For these children, the first generation of the post-War welfare state, this was a system of free milk and opportunity, and Harold Hill was part of a wave of hundreds of new secondary schools built for an expanding, ambitious population. Norma Jennings taking part in a school play in the early 1960s Mrs Jennings's memories also refer to another touchstone of grammar schools - the strong impression made by teachers. At a recent reunion, she said, there were stories of pupils who had kept in touch with their former teachers all their lives. For schoolgirls in the 1950s, unlikely to come across many women in professions, female teachers were inspiring role models for staying in education and having a career. Mrs Jennings talks of the ""intellectual life of the school"", separate from academic achievement, with teachers setting up all kind of clubs and societies, and leaving pupils with a ""stamp of curiosity"". Facing the future with confidence: Pupils at Harold Hill in the early 1960s It was also a time of assumed values, when the head teacher could unselfconsciously write about staff being able to ""distinguish what is first-rate from what is not"". Much of the symbolism and the cut-and-paste Latin might have been borrowed from public schools. But what made grammar schools so distinctive was that the pupils were not from the playing fields of Eton but the overspill estates of Essex. And these schools, with a strong sense of their own identity, often left an intense impression on those who spent time there. Harold Hill was very much a ""product of its time"", says Mrs Jennings. And it's hard to know how much the school could be separated from the era. Boys and girls had separate playgrounds at the school This was a time of boys being known only by their surnames, teachers wearing gowns, there were hymns and prize-givings, boys and girls were segregated into separate playgrounds and miscreants faced the cane. It was also a type of education available only to the minority who passed the 11-plus. But as a child Mrs Jennings was not aware of such debates, and she says there was no sense of social separation. You can only remember the schooldays you had - and not what it meant for those who missed out. Harold Hill's history also touches on another long shadow over the grammar debate. How grammar schools were closed has left an often unhappy legacy, with a sense of schools being dismantled without sufficient care for what was being lost. Theresa May was part of the generation at school when grammars became comprehensives Mrs Jennings says it would have been better if there had been a way to adapt the selection system, rather than shutting down the grammar schools. She says the mergers with secondary moderns were often rushed and disruptive, with buildings scattered across different sites. Mrs Jennings went on to train as a teacher and spent a happy career in comprehensives, but she still describes the way grammars were abolished as a ""disaster"". Many former grammar teachers struggled in their new environments. And there was a whole demographic of pupils at school who faced this upheaval in the 1970s - with a long wake of turbulence, as former grammars readjusted to their new identity. Mrs May is one of the most high profile of this generation, starting at a grammar that became a comprehensive. And who knows how much this has been a shaping experience? Harold Hill's merger with a secondary modern was not to be long-lasting. The comprehensive that emerged has also disappeared, and the site has now been redeveloped for housing. Nothing exists of it apart from the memories of former pupils. Harold Hill was part of a huge wave of post-War school building Another former pupil of Harold Hill, Colin Sparrow, says his grammar school days were a ""melting pot"" of different social classes and he had a very positive experience. But he says if the grammar system had survived, the school would have been ""a very different animal"" from the one he attended in the 1960s. In terms of whether they were elitist, he quotes Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee, speaking in 1945: ""I am myself in favour of an educational system which will break down class barriers, and will preserve the unity of the nation, but I am also in favour of variety and entirely opposed to the abolition of old traditions and the levelling down of everything to dull uniformity."" Reconciling those ambitions still seems to be as elusive. Remembering Harold Hill Grammar School by Don Martin and Norma Jennings, Lavenham Press, Suffolk.

Risking their lives for others," East Asian countries rank among some of the most dangerous in the world for human rights activists. We spoke to five courageous women from the region who attract additional harassment by flouting traditional gender roles, and have suffered everything from solitary confinement to psychological torture as a result of their work. Perhaps the most chilling experience is that of Chinese lawyer Wang Yu. It was after 1 o'clock in the morning but Wang Yu couldn't sleep. She was worried. Why hadn't they called? Her husband and 16-year-old son were on the way to a Beijing airport to board a plane to Australia where her son planned to finish his schooling. They should have passed immigration by now. But despite repeated attempts to make contact she couldn't get through. She anxiously messaged friends who tried to reassure her. But it was when the electricity cut out and the wifi failed that she knew something was seriously wrong. Then she heard the sound of men outside her front door. ""Who's there?"" she cried out. It was only a matter of time before they burst in, she thought, but then the noises stopped. Maybe they were just trying to intimidate her, as had happened so many times before. Wang Yu, now 46, was and remains a controversial figure in the eyes of the government. As a human rights lawyer she had represented clients ranging from the high profile campaign group known as the ""feminist five"", members of the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong, and Ilham Tohti, an outspoken scholar of China's Uighur ethnic minority. She hadn't always been a human rights lawyer. She had begun work in commercial law, but an incident at Tianjin Railway Station in 2008 had radically altered her perspective. During that time I started to think about China: the unbridled power of the government."" She had been stopped by a railway guard from seeing her friend off at the platform, accused of not having the right platform ticket for that particular train. She lodged a complaint about his behaviour, but instead of being cleared, a court charged her with intentionally wounding the guard - which she denies - and sentenced her to two and a half years in prison. ""During that time I started to think about China: the unbridled power of the government. Many human rights lawyers helped me fight for my rights. So I decided to use my legal knowledge to help disadvantaged groups,"" she says. The security forces' recent tussles with Wang Yu had been designed simply to intimidate, so perhaps the noises outside her door were purely to alarm her. But an hour later she heard the piercing sound of a power drill. More than a dozen members of Beijing's formidable Public Security Bureau (PSB) burst into her house, handcuffed and hooded her, and hauled her into a waiting van. Hong Kong activists supporting Chinese rights lawyers, July 2017 The lawyer's disappearance and subsequent detention marked the beginning of a widespread crackdown on lawyers and activists in China. It later became known as the ""709"" - a reference to 9 July 2015, the date Wang Yu was taken from her home. Under President Xi Jinping such enforced 'disappearances' have been legalised. Police have the authority to hold individuals under residential surveillance at a specific location for six months. The first week in detention was the worst. Wang Yu had to spend her days sitting handcuffed in a small square her captors had painted in red on the floor. She was slapped by the guards if her limbs moved even fractionally outside her painted prison. ""Yes, I thought they might kill me, and I didn’t know whether I could get out of there alive,"" she says. She remembers the humiliating moment she was told to strip naked by two of the female guards. Even today, Wang Yu can't comprehend such cruelty. ""How could these women treat another woman this way?"" Wang Yu protesting in response to the handling of a rape case, 2013 These techniques were all designed to force her to talk about her work and her clients. Finally, after several days of psychological torture and agonising interrogation, she gave in and began to share details. When six months was up, Wang Yu was formally arrested and charged with ""state subversion"" - a sweeping charge which is often levelled at detained critics of China's one-party rule. A statement from the Ministry of Public Security accused the Beijing-based law firm at which she worked of illegally hiring protesters in order to sway court decisions that they didn't feel were just. Then US Ambassador to the UN raising Wang Yu’s case in 2015 After more than a year in detention, on a hot summer's day in July 2016, Wang Yu appeared by video on various state run media platforms renouncing her legal work and blaming ""foreign forces"" for using her law firm to undermine the Chinese government. Speaking from an outside location and wearing a crisp white t-shirt, her relaxed exterior was hiding the torment she felt inside. ""I was forced to agree to go on TV,"" she says.  ""I felt extremely sad, in fact I think anyone can tell that it's fake…"" The next month she was released on bail. But there was no welcome party. Her family hadn't been told she was being released, and in fact, had suffered their own ordeal. Her son Bao Zhuoxuan had never made it to Australia. He had been forced to move to Inner Mongolia to stay with relatives while he was monitored. And her husband had only recently been released from his own year-long detention - charged with ""inciting state subversion"". I have problems with my heart, and my memory fails me. I still haven't learnt how to heal my trauma."" Wang Yu was now ostensibly free. And yet her nightmare continued. For another year, she and her family were forced to live in a rented house opposite a PSB building in Inner Mongolia with round the clock surveillance. At least 10 members of the PSB took turns monitoring the family on a daily basis. Facial recognition equipment was installed so they could track visitors. At least two PSB officers accompanied Wang Yu on her errands, and her son to school. Three cameras were trained on Bao Zhuoxuan as he studied in class. Over the last five years the Chinese government has sought to tighten its grip on power, escalating the crackdown on dissenting voices, including those of human rights lawyers and activists, analysts say.“If women woke up, they could play a big role in the promotion of human rights. The government does not want this to happen, so they suppress the feminist movement,” says Wang Yu. Wang Yu holds a sign asking for her rights to be honoured, January 2015 And President Xi further strengthened his hold on the state this March when China's legislature scrapped the 10-year limit on the presidency, effectively allowing him to remain in power for life. The world needs to pay attention to what is happening China."" According to William Nee, China analyst at Amnesty International: ""Wang Yu's case epitomises many of the most troubling human rights trends we see in China today: violent abduction by state security agents, the use of incommunicado detention and torture, demonisation in the media, forced TV confessions, and collective punishment of family members."" ""Most alarmingly the government is using an array of new technologies: facial recognition technology,  big data analytics and algorithms, and DNA databases in its pursuit of neutralising human rights defenders. Wang Yu feels she can no longer take on cases ""Chinese companies with close links to the state security apparatus are becoming global leaders in these emerging industries, so the world needs to pay attention to what is happening China, not just for the sake of activists, but to ensure that these technologies and tactics are not deployed in their own countries,"" he says. Wang Yu is now back home in Beijing, but feels life is still far from normal. She suspects that trips outside the house are often secretly tracked. She says she feels too restricted by the authorities to continue working, and as relationships with some friends and family are compromised by her precarious status, she feels lonely and isolated. And her health, both physical and mental, is still affected.""I have problems with my heart, and my memory fails me,"" she says. ""I still haven't learnt how to heal my trauma."" Her hope lies with her son, who this year was finally allowed to pass immigration to leave China and study abroad. ""I hope by the time he is my age China will have become a democratic and free country,"" she says hopefully. Wang Yu's story is shocking, but throughout East Asia there are many stories of women struggling for justice and equality. Read on to find out more. With nothing but a prison uniform and a book on post-modern feminism, Maria Chin Abdullah was thrown into 10 days of solitary confinement. The cell was windowless, and the lights were on all day and all night. Her only respite from the cell was eight-hour interrogations on an almost daily basis. Ms Chin is one ofMalaysia'sbest known pro-democracy campaigners, and until this year chaired Bersih 2.0, an organisation that campaigns for free and fair elections and holds rallies attracting tens of thousands of supporters. She was arrested on 18 November 2016, a day before a large demonstration was due to be held that she helped organise against alleged leadership corruption. ""To this day, I don't know where I was being held because they blindfolded me when they took me anywhere,"" she says in an interview with the BBC. Ms Chin was held under Sosma, an anti-terrorism law that allows for suspects to be held without trial for up to 28 days. With so many young people taking to the streets in Malaysia in recent years, due to the government crackdown on civil liberties and restrictions on freedom of speech, she believes now is the moment for change. What we see today, what we enjoy, are foundations set up by women."" ""Young women should definitely get involved,"" she says. ""What we see today, what we enjoy, are foundations set up by women who fought for our independence and for our equality."" Ms Chin announced earlier this year that she would try and influence political decisions from the other side as an independent candidate under the four-party opposition alliance Pakatan Harpan. On 10 May the opposition scored a historic victory in the general election, with Ms Chin winning her seat to become the Petaling Jaya MP. InVietnam'sclimate of heavy media and online censorship, Huynh Thuc Vy takes great pride in giving a voice to the country's other human rights activists as head of Vietnamese Women for Human Rights. She regularly blogs about rights abuses and the persecution of ethnic minorities, following in the footsteps of her father, Huynh Ngoc Tuan, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1993 for criticising the Vietnamese government for his blogs. If we do not play a role in activism now, we will never be able to demand gender equality later."" Police surveillance, intimidation and interrogation are now so familiar to her that they've almost become a way of life. Her most terrifying ordeal took place in 2012,  in response to her demonstration against Vietnam's territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea. Security officers drove her across the country to her hometown, where they interrogated her for 12 hours before abandoning her at night at a petrol station. Despite the unrelenting scrutiny of the authorities, Huynh Thuc Vy refuses to stay silent. ""Even though the imprisonment of my father and the repeated harassment towards our whole family has made us so tired, we have the chance to have meaningful and altruistic lives, by taking risks, acting on behalf of vulnerable people and facing the authorities,"" she told the BBC recently. ""If we do not play a role in activism now, we will never be able to demand gender equality later."" Describing Vietnam as a country where women have been ""marginalised from politics, economics and the education system for centuries"", she argues that activism is one way women can shape a better future for their country and push for progress. Being vocal about the military's strong-arm tactics and loopholes inThailand'sjudicial system comes with consequences. Anchana Heemina gets frequently harassed online, sometimes even receiving death threats, and she believes her harassers belong to the military and the police. She first became involved with activism while trying to seek legal aid for her brother-in law. He was detained by the security forces in 2008 for his alleged involvement with insurgents in Thailand's Muslim majority southern provinces. It's a challenge for women to find new ways of fighting for our cause that does not have a detrimental effect."" He was eventually acquitted, but together with her sister, Ms Heemina set up Duay Jai Group in 2010, helping those imprisoned for crimes related to the insurgency, as well as their families. Duay Jai and three other NGOs published a damning report containing details of detainees allegedly being mentally and physically tortured at military camps in the south. Army spokesman Pramote Prom-in dismissed the torture allegations as ""imaginary"" and Ms Heemina was charged with criminal defamation. The charges were eventually dropped and an investigation launched to examine the torture allegations. She continues to get harassed for her activism, facing offensive online comments, cartoons and Facebook posts on a regular basis. ""I often get derogatory comments and people asking why I’m not married yet,"" she says. ""The challenge is for women to find new ways of fighting for our cause that does not have a detrimental effect."" The inside of a prison cell is a familiar sight for Phyoe Phyoe Aung. She has been arrested three times and twice handed a prison sentence. Her history of activism means that at 17 she was already in hiding, wanted by the then military government for her involvement in the Saffron Revolution - a protest to express civil and political discontent inMyanmar. The law is not just, it's like an elastic rubber band which can be shrunk or expanded on a whim."" But the sight of scattered corpses following Cyclone Nargis in 2008 was too potent for Ms Phyoe to ignore. She came out of hiding to help bury the unclaimed corpses and was arrested by the authorities, leading to a four-year prison sentence. In 2015, she was detained again, now in her capacity as head of one of Myanmar's largest student unions for protesting against the newly-adopted national education law, which she felt limited free speech in the education system. ""There were numerous ways they suppressed us in prison; restricting the types of books we read or intercepting the mail we sent to our families,"" Ms Phyoe recalls. On 8 April 2016, under the administration of Aung San Suu Kyi, a court dropped charges against her. Now out of prison Ms Phyoe says: ""Some say things are changing in Myanmar, but whether the country is on track for democracy is a contentious issue. ""The law is not just, it's like an elastic rubber band which can be shrunk or expanded on a whim."" At home with a young child she has recently taken a back seat, working for an NGO rather than on the activism frontline. She urges the new generation of students to be responsible citizens. ""Building the country back up starts with educational reform,"" she says. Built with Shorthand"
Your six pros and cons of renting a homeCan a landlord kick me out?VideoVideoSex and dating when you live with parents'Nightmare' rental shortage for disabledReality Check: Are we spending more money on rent?,"Renting a room or a home from a private landlord is a reality for millions of people in the UK - but is it a positive or negative experience? We asked you, via the BBC NewsAffordable Living UK Facebook group,external, alongside survey information from flatshare website Spareroom.com. What emerged was a picture of uncertainty from tenants about their landlords' long-term plans, but also a feeling of freedom should they need to move for a new job or for somewhere better. Here are some of the responses. One of the biggest positives for many tenants was the ability to give relatively short notice, then move to a new home. ""I get to live independently and have the ability to move with more ease,"" says one tenant. At a time when many young people are on short-term contracts or work on a freelance basis, such nimbleness can be vital for employment. ""I am still settling into a career in academia,"" says one post. ""Until I know where I am going to end up, renting is best. It is good to know that when I am moving to a new area, I am not making a massive commitment."" The boiler breaks down or the roof leaks and all that is required is a call to the landlord. Among the many expressing relief is one who says: ""You don't have to think about house insurance and massive maintenance costs, although this does assume the landlords are doing their job."" Another says that, as a tenant, you do not have responsibility for the ""big issues"". Tenants' tales - in five charts Number of middle-aged renters doubles Nearly a third of those asked in a survey of more than 13,000 flat sharers by Spareroom.com said that they chose to live with others as it was more sociable. A number of people say that renting a room is a good way of meeting new people in a new area, or simply to help find their way around. ""It is useful to get to know a new area or country,"" says one. The vast majority (83%) of respondents in the Spareroom survey said that they rented in a house-share for financial reasons. Yet, the costs involved in renting are a regular gripe. ""You're paying someone else's mortgage"" is a common refrain. Rent levels are a worry for many, particularly those in more expensive areas of the country. Reality Check: Are we spending more money on rent? Fees. which many see as unreasonable, are facing acrackdown from the government, similar to a ban already in place in Scotland. That cannot come soon enough, according to many tenants. ""I pay a fee to renew every six months. I have no idea what that covers,"" says one. There is concern about the number of landlords who fail to ensure that the property is maintained properly. The general view is that some bad landlords has given the sector a bad name. Deposits are controversial. Some argue that a landlord expects too much, potentially withholding deposits for general wear and tear, or old things being thrown out. ""I can't wait for the day when I don't have to argue about why a three-and-a-half-year-old tin of paint the landlord left in my kitchen cupboard is no longer there,"" says one tenant. Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? Others worry that not every landlord is putting deposits into ring-fenced account. Across the UK, landlords must put deposits into a government-backedtenancy deposit protection scheme,external. Different schemes operate in different parts of the country. Nearly half of those asked in the Spareroom survey said that being in control of when they move home is a key attraction of buying. While renting does offer flexibility, one of the big fears among tenants is being told by their landlord that they will have to move. One tenant sums it up by saying there is ""constant uncertainty of [landlords] wanting to sell and therefore having to find somewhere else to live"". This has been tackled, to an extent, in Scotland wherenew rulesrequire longer notice periods and other measures designed to increase security.

Can a landlord kick me out?VideoVideoSex and dating when you live with parents'Nightmare' rental shortage for disabledReality Check: Are we spending more money on rent?,"Millions of people pay monthly rent to a landlord for a room or a home, but many will be unclear about their rights as a tenant. BBC News asked Citizens Advice to answer the 20 most commonly asked questions. Your landlord can't evict you during the fixed term of a tenancy unless you breach a term in the tenancy agreement, such as not paying rent or damaging the property, unless there is a break clause in your agreement. If you stay in the home beyond the fixed term and your landlord wants possession without a reason, they must give you at least two months' notice, often called a section 21 notice. There are a number of rules the landlord must follow for the notice to be valid. The landlord must apply to court for possession of the property if you don't leave when the notice expires. You should get advice from an independent adviser, like Citizens Advice, if you receive a notice. In Scotland, residential tenancies are open-ended, so tenants cannot be asked to leave simply because they have come to the end of the tenancy. If the landlord has grounds to evict the tenant, they must give 28 days' notice if the tenant has lived in the property for six months or less, or 84 days notice if the tenant has lived there for more than six months. For specific grounds, such as a criminal conviction, the notice is 28 days irrespective of how long they have been in the property. In Northern Ireland, once the fixed term is up, landlords must give four weeks' written notice, known as a Notice to Quit. Your rent cannot normally be increased unless you agree or the tenancy agreement allows it. A rent review clause in a fixed-term tenancy will not apply after the fixed term ends, if your tenancy becomes ""statutory periodic"". This is when your fixed term ends and your tenancy automatically continues month-by-month or week-by-week - usually based on your rent payment period - until you or your landlord gives notice. Landlords of periodic tenants can use special procedures to raise rents by giving you a formal notice, details of which are set down in law. This can be appealed against in England to the first-tier property tribunal, or to the rent assessment committee in Wales, which will determine a ""market rent"" for the property. In Scotland, landlords can increase rent once a year but must give three months' written notice. Tenants can contact their local authority rent officer if they think the increase is too high For Northern Ireland, once the fixed term is up, there are no limits to rent increases, either by how much or how often a landlord can raise the rent. Tenants' tales - in five charts Number of middle-aged renters doubles First, ensure you are not responsible for the repairs. Tenants are usually expected to do small maintenance jobs such as changing a light bulb or repairing damage they have caused. If the landlord is not doing repairs they are responsible for, speak to them first to make sure they understand your concerns. If this does not help you can make a formal complaint by writing a letter to your landlord, explaining the problem, what you want them to do and including any evidence you have. If this does not solve your problem you can go to your council, which can help with complaints about repairs that cause a risk to health and safety. Your council can look at your home and order the landlord to do the repairs if they think it is harmful to your health or safety. Some landlords may try to evict a tenant who complains about repairs - so-called ""retaliatory eviction"". There is some legal protection for tenants in this position but talk to Citizens Advice if you're worried about this risk. You should not withhold rent because of repair issues because your landlord may then have reason to evict you. Eviction by coercion may be an illegal eviction in Scotland, which is a criminal offence. Scotland has had the Repairing Standard set of rules since September 2017. A tenant can refer the matter to the Housing and Property Chamber First Tier Tribunal for Scotland. In Northern Ireland, there is no legal protection against retaliatory eviction. Your six pros and cons of renting a home 'Nightmare' rental shortage for the disabled Most deposits should be protected in a tenancy deposit scheme and a landlord cannot take money from your deposit without either your agreement or arbitration by the scheme. A landlord who has failed to protect a deposit may have to pay a penalty to the tenant and face restrictions on serving notice. You might not get the full amount of your deposit back if, for example, you owe rent, you have damaged the property or you have lost or broken items on the inventory. Landlords should not take money for reasonable wear and tear, such as a carpet that has gradually worn out over time, or to fix repairs that were their responsibility. If your deposit is in a tenancy deposit scheme, you should get your deposit back within 10 days of agreeing any deductions with your landlord. If you cannot reach agreement, you will need to check how to access arbitration with your scheme. If your deposit has not been protected, seek help from Citizens Advice about recovering your deposit through the court. Your landlord may also have to pay you a penalty for failing to protect your deposit. Scotland has similar deposit protection schemes. In Northern Ireland, your landlord has 30 days to get your deposit back to you after agreeing any deductions. Sex and dating when you live with your parents Reality Check: Are we spending more money on rent? Your landlord has a legal obligation to look after any of your belongings left in a property after you have moved out or been evicted. They must make reasonable efforts to trace you, and serve you with notice - usually 28 days, but three months if you owe them money - stating how you can collect the goods, and that they will be disposed of if they have not been collected by the expiry of the notice. If the goods remain uncollected, the landlord may sell or dispose of them and make a deduction from any proceeds for expenses reasonably incurred in storage or disposal. The balance will belong to the tenant. If you have a joint tenancy with your housemate - each tenant is legally liable for the whole of the rent. This means, for example, that if they don't pay the landlord could pursue you, and any other joint tenants, for the money. If your housemate is a joint tenant and wants to leave during the fixed term, they could find a replacement agreed by you and the landlord. It is a good idea to put the agreement in writing so everyone knows where they stand. Without finding a replacement, your housemate would either have to continue paying rent in order not to breach the tenancy, or come to an agreement for them to pay you to make up the shortfall. In each case, the landlord must agree to the change before you can go ahead as they need to agree to the surrender of the existing joint tenancy and the creation of a new tenancy. If you are having problems you should get advice from an experienced adviser, like Citizens Advice. For tenants in Northern Ireland, check your agreement to see if you are ""jointly and severally liable"". If you are, each tenant is liable for the rent of another who leaves; if not, the landlord would have to pursue the tenant for unpaid rent. If you do not have a spare set of keys then you should check if your landlord or their agent has a spare set of keys you can use to get a new set cut. Your tenancy agreement might also give details about how you can do this and any fees you will be charged for a replacement. If there is no a spare set you can contact a locksmith to get the locks changed but you will have to pay for this and will also be responsible for any damage caused, for example, to the door or doorframe. Check your tenancy agreement to see if you have to tell your landlord if you change the locks. You should try to speak to your housemate first to see if you can find a way forward, but only do this if you feel able to do so. Your landlord may be able to help you by speaking to the housemate but there is no duty for them to do so. Your landlord may be able to take action to evict the housemate if they have breached the tenancy agreement in some way but this can take time.  If you're a joint tenant and your housemate is evicted this would also end your tenancy so it is worth getting advice first. If you are in fear of violence or if you are being racially or sexually harassed you should contact the police. The landlord has a right to reasonable access to carry out repairs for which they are responsible and to inspect the property, but usually they must give 24 hours' notice in writing. In most cases, a landlord does not have the right to demand access without notice, or to enter the property without permission when the tenant is not there. In Northern Ireland, the notice does not need to be in writing. If you have a disability and are having accessibility trouble in your home, you can ask your landlord to either make adaptations or let you make the changes. If your landlord refuses, seek advice from an experienced adviser, like Citizens Advice. This video can not be played One city, seven agents... and nowhere I can live Disabled facility grants from local councils - or the Housing Executive in Northern Ireland - are available to landlords and tenants to cover the costs of adaptations in some circumstances. Not all landlords and letting agents allow housing benefit or housing costs payments through Universal Credit, but you only need to say you receive them if they ask. You might be able to get a landlord or letting agent to accept you by giving extra references or you could also get a guarantor (someone who agrees to pay the rent if you don't). Ask your council if they have a list of landlords and letting agents who will rent to people who are getting Housing Benefit or Universal Credit, although this does not apply in Northern Ireland. Check your tenancy agreement to see if you have agreed to leave the property in a certain condition. In general, you shouldn't be charged for wear and tear, but the landlord might ask you to pay for damage beyond that. If you've paid a deposit, the landlord might ask for that payment to be deducted from the deposit. If you can't agree, you can ask the tenancy deposit scheme that holds your deposit to make a decision. Yes they can, but they must ask for your permission first. If you plan to rent through a letting agent and have bad credit history, tell them before they take any fees as you may not get these back. If the landlord refuses you because he thinks there is a risk of you not paying the rent, you could offer rent in advance if you can afford it, or a guarantor - if one is available - to secure the property. Most lettings agents will charge you to check your references and credit - the amount you can be asked to pay can vary a lot between agents. You might also be asked to pay fees if you renew your tenancy. Ask about your letting agent's fees before taking the property and before you pay any money. Their fees must be displayed on their website and in their offices. They have to give you details of their fees before you agree to rent. It is against the law for your letting agent to charge you for registering with them and giving information or lists of properties available for rent, although this may not apply in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, there is a mandatory register of lettings agents. Apart from rent and the security deposit, letting fees have been banned in Scotland since 2012. You are entitled to ""quiet enjoyment"" of your home, which includes having the occasional overnight visitor. In some cases tenants will be held responsible for the behaviour of their visitors that could lead to renters breaching their tenancy agreement. Any term in a tenancy agreement that says you can't have overnight guests without permission from the landlord or that you have to pay a fee is likely to be ""unfair"" and unenforceable. You should bear in mind the risk of eviction if you are outside a fixed term and you antagonise your landlord. Be clear your guest is a visitor and you're not sub-letting. Most tenancy agreements say that you are not allowed to sub-let all or part of your property without your landlord's agreement. If your guest pays money to stay it's likely to be seen as sub-let. If you think you are being  discriminated against because of your disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation, you may be able to take legal action. You should get advice from an experienced adviser, like Citizens Advice. You should seek help immediately from an independent adviser, like Citizens Advice. An adviser will be able to check whether your landlord has followed the correct procedure to evict you and whether you have rights to be allowed back into your property. They should also be able to help you with finding alternative accommodation. Also, if you are homeless, your local council may have to help find you somewhere to live. Depending on your circumstances, they might also provide you with emergency accommodation. Again, an independent adviser will be able to help you with this application. In Northern Ireland, the Housing Executive may have to help you find somewhere to live. If you need help to pay your rent you may be able to apply for housing benefit or for help with your housing costs from Universal Credit. You may also be entitled to other benefits if you are unemployed or on a low income. If you are struggling with debt, seek help from an independent adviser, like Citizens Advice. Landlords must be registered in Wales. If you feel your landlord has done something wrong, check your landlord is registered as there are financial penalties if they're not. If the landlord holds a licence, it may be revoked for not following the code of conduct. In Scotland, landlords must register with the local council. The local authority must be satisfied that the owner of the property and the agent are fit and proper to let residential property, before registering them. Tenants can search the register and it is an offence for a landlord not to register. This advice applies to assured shorthold tenants, and most private tenancies in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, a new tenancy law was enacted in December 2017, affecting new tenancies from 1 December 2017, and the differences are explained where possible.

'Nightmare' rental shortage for disabledReality Check: Are we spending more money on rent?,"This video can not be played One city, seven agents... and nowhere I can live The dire shortage of private rental properties suitable for disabled people has been exposed by a new report. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said 93% of 8.5 million rental properties in the UK were not accessible to the disabled. It called on ministers to take action to improve housing accessibility. The government said it was providing councils with almost Â£1bn over the next two years to adapt properties for disabled people. ""We expect landlords to adapt properties for tenants. We are clear they must not unreasonably withhold consent if they are asked to make changes to homes,"" a Department of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesman said. Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? Tenants' tales - in five charts Number of middle-aged renters doubles The EHRC said its 18-month review found 365,000 disabled people were in homes unsuitable for their needs. ""Accommodation for disabled people in this country is not acceptable,"" said David Isaac, chairman of the commission. ""The lack of accessible housing stops disabled people from being able to live independently."" Neil Heslop, chief executive of the Leonard Cheshire disability charity, said the report was a ""shocking indictment of how disabled people have largely been forgotten in the housing priorities of local and national government"". By BBC news reporter Ellis Palmer It's difficult enough trying to find somewhere to live when you're able-bodied; it can be something of a nightmare when you have a disability. I recently visited seven estate agents in Derby, where I have family, to try to find a property I could move into without having to make any adaptations. Despite looking at hundreds of listings, no accessible properties were available to rent on the private market in the city. Even getting in and out of the estate agents' shops was rather difficult. Five of the seven I visited had significant steps up, meaning I was not able to get in independently. Finding somewhere to live independently as a wheelchair user is extremely difficult. In my case, all I need is a wet room bathroom to be able to shower myself. Many young people, with or without disabilities, face an uncertain economic climate due to short-term contracts, meaning that buying somewhere with a mortgage on the private market just isn't possible. Additionally, for disabled people, only 7% of homes in England offer minimal accessibility features. Theoretically, newer properties are much more likely to be easily accessible, but that doesn't necessarily mean they will be ready for me to move into independently. Many of the flats I've looked around in the past few years don't even have that - many still have baths or showers with steps up. The EHRC report said many local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales have not collected data or planned for the future, even though the number of disabled people is increasing. It found that councils are only requiring about four in ten new homes to be accessible and adaptable, while just 5% required developers to construct wheelchair-accessible housing, which might include step-free bathrooms. Your six pros and cons of renting a home Sex and dating when you live with your parents Reality Check: Are we spending more money on rent? Just seven councils authorities have taken either formal or informal action against a developer who did not deliver the required number of accessible and/or adaptable properties, it found. The Equality Act (2010) says that changes or adjustments should be made to ensure someone with a disability has access to housing and that the individual should not have to pay. But adjustments only have to be made if it is reasonable and there is only a duty to do so if not doing so places the disabled person at a substantial disadvantage.

Reality Check: Are we spending more money on rent?,"In the UK, people are renting for longer periods of time, as buying a property has become more expensive and wages have struggled to keep up. As analysis for the BBC by Hometrack reveals, the average length of residence for private renters in England has increased to 4.3 years. This got Reality Check thinking about how much people are spending on rent. If people are renting for a longer period of time, how much of their pay packet is going on accommodation? While home ownership has declined in recent years, the number of private rented lettings has gone up. Between 2006 and 2016, the number of new private rented lettings increased by 24% to 1.3 million. Since 2008, there have been more new private rented lettings a year than new sales. There were a million residential sales in Great Britain in 2016. However, it's important to remember that the average length that a homeowner will stay in their home is about 20 years on average, so turnover would typically be lower. The number of private rented lettings did fall from 2014 to 2016, as the average length of a tenancy increased, meaning that tenants were staying longer in their rental properties too. Reality Check: How does renting a home in the UK compare? According to data from residential property analysts Hometrack, the average cost of rent per calendar month increased by 19% from 2007 to 2017 for private rents in England and Wales. Over the same period, real average weekly earnings in the UK fell from Â£463 in January 2007 to Â£458 in 2017, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS). London saw the largest rise in the past decade, with a 29% increase in how much the capital's renters are paying each month. In 2017, the average private rent in London stood at Â£1,590 per calendar month. London topped the regional list for median earnings for full-time employees in April 2017, at Â£692 per week. However, in the North East, the amount paid for private rents per month decreased by 3% over the past 10 years, falling to Â£544. Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? 'Nightmare' rental shortage for the disabled Tenants' tales - in five charts Number of middle-aged renters doubles The government's definition of affordable housing says that affordable homes for rent shouldn't cost any more than 80% of the average local market rent. Most definitions of affordability take into account the relationship between the average household income and the average rent in an area. Analysis by Hometrack of data from the ONS looked at the ratio between average annual salaries and house prices. It found that rent as a percentage of annual earnings across England and Wales had decreased from 31.1% in 2007 to 29.4% 10 years on. London was the least affordable region in England and Wales, with city-dwellers spending 41.1% of their annual salaries on rent in 2017. One of the reasons rental affordability in London has become stretched is the fact that more renters are sharing properties. This has pushed up rents ahead of earnings, as landlords charge more to groups of professionals occupying a property, according to Hometrack. The most affordable region was the North East, with the region's renters handing over 23.6% of their annual salaries on rent last year.

Pothole 'epidemic' costs Â£1m a month: AA,"Drivers and insurers are losing Â£1m a month repairing damage to vehicles caused by potholes, the AA says. The motorists' organisation says the number of claims for the first four months of 2018 already equal those for the whole of last year. It said there was a pothole ""epidemic"" that was a ""national embarrassment"". The Department for Transport said it was spending Â£23bn on England's roads to improve journeys, which included a pothole action fund. Based on its share of the car insurance market, the AA has extrapolated that there have been 4,200 such claims this year across the UK. Janet Connor, the AA's director of insurance, said spending cuts meant roads were not being properly maintained. ""Local council budgets have been squeezed to the extent that competing priorities mean they don't have the resources to keep their roads up to scratch,"" she said. ""Our nation's highways have become a national embarrassment."" The AA was seeing a growing number of pothole claims described as ""car severely damaged and un-driveable"", she said, which had not happened at all last year. The estimated average repair bill was Â£1,000, but the AA said that underestimated the true extent of the damage. Ms Connor said the Â£1m a month figure was not the whole story: ""In most cases the damage caused by a pothole - a ruined tyre or even two tyres and perhaps a wheel rim - doesn't justify making an insurance claim given that it is likely to lead to the loss of your excess and no-claim bonus. So the claims we are seeing are clearly much worse than that."" Pothole frustration led one Swindon man to start sticking dolls into offending holes in the road In March, the Secretary of State for Transport,Chris Grayling, announced a Â£100m fundfor road repairs, and admitted there had not been enough spent since the 1980s. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said it was providing councils in England with more than Â£6bn to help improve the condition of roads. ""This funding includes a record Â£296m through the Pothole Action Fund - enough to fix around 6 million potholes."" Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said councils needed more central funding to let them carry out the widespread improvement that roads required. A Highways England spokeswoman said it had replaced more than 4,400 miles of road surface in the past three years. The AA carries a check list for motorists on its website advising,externalwhat they should do if their vehicle is damaged by a pothole. Last week it said it had conducted a study and found that nine out of 10 drivers said the condition of UK roads had deteriorated over the past 10 years. Motorists' frustration with potholes have provoked some colourful protests recently. Last month, one motorist gained some publicity for his campaign against potholes that involved sticking dolls into holes in the road.

House '30in too tall' risks demolitionThe family home will be torn down unless a further Â£200k is spent on a replacement roof.,"Asif Naseem moved his wife and five children into the house two months ago A family has been told to tear down their new home or spend Â£200,000 on a new roof after it was found to be 30 inches (76cm) too tall. Asif Naseem moved into the property in Lightwood, Staffordshire, two months ago with his wife and five children. Stoke-on-Trent council turned down two retrospective planning applications for the Â£500,000 house due to complaints over the height and dormer windows. The family said they had nowhere else to go, and no funds for a new roof. Midlands Live: Pupils injured as primary school ceiling collapses;  M5 roadworks 'three months behind schedule' The family was told the roof ridge was too high and there were complaints about the dormer windows Thirty one objections to the family's retrospective planning application were sent to the council, along with seven letters of support, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Council planners recommended enforcement action being taken, which would mean demolishing the house. At a planning meeting on Wednesday, Shazad Hussein, Mr Naseem's brother, said reducing the house's height ""isn't going to make any visual difference"". ""We have spent all the money on the house,"" he said. ""There are seven people who have nowhere else to go. They sold their other house to fund the new one."" Local reaction to the ""enormous"" house has been ""mixed"", a neighbour said The family's representative said demolition would be ""excessive"" and ""draconian"", leaving the planning committee divided. Vice-chairman Andy Platt said it was ""wrong"" that the house had been built too tall, but to knock it down would be ""a little over the top"". However councillor Janine Bridges said it would ""set a precedent"" for developers to ""build what they like"" and ask permission later.
