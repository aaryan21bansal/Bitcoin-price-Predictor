PM to welcome Macron for Resistance anniversary,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron viewed documents and artefacts relating to General Charles de Gaulle Boris Johnson has met French President Emmanuel Macron in Downing Street to mark the 80th anniversary of a famous wartime broadcast. In 1940, French Resistance leader Charles de Gaulle used the BBC to send a radio message to Nazi-occupied France, urging people not to give up the struggle against Hitler. Mr Johnson praised the ""courage and sacrifice"" of those who fought on. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall welcomed Mr Macron to the UK. And the Red Arrows and their French counterparts, La Patrouille, performed a flypast above London to mark the occasion. Prince Charles to welcome Macron to London PM had to soothe concerns over virus strategy New momentum needed in trade talks, say UK and EU Churchill statue uncovered ahead of Macron visit During their meeting, Mr Johnson and Mr Macron discussed post-Brexit trade arrangements between the UK and EU, with No 10 saying the prime minister ""welcomed the agreement to intensify talks in July"". The air display flew directly over Westminster and the recently-uncovered Winston Churchill statue A spokesperson added that he had restated that the UK ""does not believe it makes sense for there to be prolonged negotiations into the autumn"". The ""transition period"" - during which the UK remains in the EU single market and customs union - is due to finish at the end of the year. The two leaders also talked about easing the 14-day coronavirus quarantine measures in place for visitors to - and UK citizens returning to - the UK. Mr Macron was exempt from the requirements, as a ""representative of a foreign country on business"". The Red Arrows and La Patrouille flew over Buckingham Palace It was earlier announced that four surviving French Resistance fighters are to be appointed honorary MBEs. Edgard Tupet-Thome, 100, Daniel Bouyjou-Cordier, 99, Hubert Germain, 99, and Pierre Simonet, 98, are already members of the Order of Liberation, an honour given by France to those who played an outstanding role in freeing the country from its four-year wartime occupation. Mr Macron's visit also comes after it was announced that Dame Vera Lynn, the singer dubbed the ""forces' sweetheart"" for her morale-boosting performances during World War Two,has died aged 103. Social distancing was maintained during the French president's visit to London The two leaders viewed artefacts and letters from General de Gaulle's time in London and from his partnership with the UK's wartime prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson presented Mr Macron with a framed montage of a telegram sent from General de Gaulle to Sir Winston on VE Day, in 1945, and Sir Winston's reply. He also gave him a model of Sir Winston's open-top Land Rover and a photograph of General de Gaulle in Paris, shortly after the city's liberation from German forces in 1944. By Gavin Stamp, BBC News It was 80 years ago that General Charles de Gaulle broadcast a historic message from London to his fellow countrymen imploring them not to give up the fight against Hitler. France was on its knees at the time, German troops having entered Paris four days earlier, and on the verge of agreeing an armistice confirming its formal military surrender. In the message, broadcast in French, De Gaulle said: ""Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished."" Transmitted on the BBC's French Service, the broadcast was not recorded and relatively few people in France heard it. But a similar broadcast four days later on the same network reached a wider audience and went a long way to establishing de Gaulle as his country's leader in-exile. The 18th June 1940 remains one of the most important dates in UK-French history and still has enormous resonance on both sides of the channel. After the fall of France, General de Gaulle made a speech from London 18 June 1940. Known as the ""Appel"", or appeal, it rallied the country in support of the Resistance. This video can not be played When she was 21, Olivia Jordan found herself driving French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle around London Mr Macron, speaking next to General de Gaulle's statue in Carlton Gardens, in central London, said: ""This is where de Gaulle was able to call on the French people to join the Resistance, the soldiers of the shadows. ""Because 80 years ago today, on June 18 1940, the United Kingdom gave Free France its first weapon, a BBC microphone."" Emmanuel Macron laid a wreath at the statue of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother Mr Johnson said General de Gaulle had arrived in 1940 knowing that Britain and France's shared values of ""freedom, tolerance and democracy"" were under threat and pledging to defend them. ""The struggles we face today are different to those we confronted together 80 years ago. But I have no doubt that - working side by side - the UK and France will continue to rise to every new challenge and seize every opportunity that lies ahead,"" he said.

Nationwide caps mortgage lending due to virus,"The UK's biggest building society has tripled the minimum deposit it will ask for from first-time buyers. The Nationwide will lower its ceiling for mortgage lending to new customers in response to the coronavirus crisis. It said the change, from Thursday, was due to ""these unprecedented times and an uncertain mortgage market"". First-time buyers are likely to be the most significantly affected because they often have smaller amounts saved to get on the property ladder. Nationwide has reduced the proportion of a home's value that is willing to lend from 95% to 85%. So for example, if a property costs Â£100,000, a new buyer would now need a Â£15,000 deposit rather than a Â£5,000 deposit. Nationwide made the move in case house prices fall and buyers go into negative equity - that is when the debt is greater than the value of the property. But it was also to cut the risk of customers not being able to make repayments if they lose their jobs. ""Our priority at this time must be to help members keep their homes. As such, we need to ensure our members can afford their repayments, while doing what we can to protect them from falling into negative equity,"" said Henry Jordan, Nationwide director of mortgages. After the elation over the re-opening of the housing market, Nationwide's move to limit how much we can borrow will bring everyone down to earth. If there is a downward lurch in house prices, recent buyers with big loans will be in serious danger of slipping into negative equity. Anyone who has been there in previous recessions will tell you it is stressful experience, and not just because of the usual worry about meeting the monthly payments. You can feel trapped, because if you sell you make a loss. Plus, there is virtually no prospect of getting another loan to move up the ladder. Of course, people who are priced out the market will welcome cheaper property, if that is what happens. But Nationwide is saying that it is time to ""protect"" us from risking too much to get a dream home. David Hollingworth, associate director of communications at L&C Mortgages, said that Nationwide was following many other major UK mortgage lenders. ""The market has been changing quickly,"" he said. When the lockdown started, many institutions dramatically dropped the percentage of a property's price they were willing to lend: this is known as the loan-to-value ratio. As the housing market has reopened, those maximum loan-to-value ceilings have been rising again, but not up to Nationwide's previous level of 95%. In a sense, Nationwide is now ""running with the rest of the pack"", Mr Hollingworth said. Some lenders, such as HSBC, still have mortgages with a 90% loan-to-value ratio. However, there is more demand for that type of mortgage than many banks have the capacity to deal with at the moment, he said. Emma Harvey, mortgages director at MoneySuperMarket, said: ""It's getting harder to borrow money to buy a house, as providers look to limit risk in these uncertain times, and Nationwide is the latest example of this. ""In addition, there are also fewer mortgage products out there to choose from. For example, whilst 90% [loan-to-value] mortgages were commonplace at the start of 2020, only a handful of lenders are still offering these, and even then only with restrictions."" Ms Harvey said that it has always been a good idea to have as large a deposit as you can save. ""If you're looking to get on the housing market, you should review your finances, look for areas of savings and be realistic about when you will be in a position to purchase a property. ""But with the Bank of England base rate so low, there are some great deals out there at the moment for people with a healthy deposit,"" she added.

Trump sought Xi's help with re-election - Bolton,"Mr Bolton denies that the book contains classified information US President Donald Trump sought help from Chinese President Xi Jinping to win re-election, ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton's new book says. Mr Bolton says Mr Trump wanted China to buy agricultural produce from US farmers, according to details of the forthcoming book previewed by US media. He also says Mr Trump ""remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House"". The Trump administration is trying to block the book from going on sale. Speaking to Fox News, Mr Trump said of Mr Bolton: ""He broke the law. This is highly classified information and he did not have approval."" ""He was a washed-up guy,"" the president added. ""I gave him a chance."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

John Bolton joined the White House in April 2018 and left in September the following year, saying he had decided to quit.President Trump, however, said he had fired Mr Boltonbecause he disagreed ""strongly"" with him. He is known as a foreign policy hardliner and also served in the administration of President George W Bush. As national security adviser, he was the top counsellor to the US president on security matters at home and abroad. Mr Bolton's 577-page tome, The Room Where It Happened, is due to go on sale on 23 June. But on Wednesday night, the Department of Justice sought an emergency order from a judge to stop the book's release. Ten biggest claims in John Bolton's book John Bolton: Who is man behind Trump-Xi allegations? Why has Trump's niece written a damning memoir? The publisher, Simon & Schuster, said in a statement: ""Tonight's filing by the government is a frivolous, politically motivated exercise in futility."" It said hundreds of thousands of copies of the book had already been distributed around the world and the injunction would accomplish nothing. Mr Trump's Democratic challenger in this November's election, Joe Biden, said in a statement about the book: ""If these accounts are true, it's not only morally repugnant, it's a violation of Donald Trump's sacred duty to the American people."" The allegations refer to a meeting between President Trump and President Xi at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June last year. ""Trump, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election [in 2020], alluding to China's economic capability and pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win,"" Mr Bolton wrote. ""He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome."" The two men met during a G20 meeting in Japan last year Farmers make up a key voting bloc and largely supported Mr Trump in the 2016 election. Speaking on Wednesday evening, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer disputed Mr Bolton's account, saying the request for help with re-election ""never happened"". Mr Bolton also mentions an earlier conversation at the summit's opening dinner, in which they discussed the building of camps in China's western Xinjiang region. Mr Trump said the construction should go ahead as it was ""exactly the right thing to do"". This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" China has detained about a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in the campsfor punishment and indoctrination. The Trump administration has been publicly critical of China's treatment of Uighurs, and on Wednesday the president signed legislation authorising US sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for the repression of Muslims in Xinjiang province. China denies mistreating Uighurs and attacked the US move, calling it malicious and threatening countermeasures. On one hand, the account John Bolton offers in his new book should seem somewhat familiar. This is hardly the first time a former adviser or anonymous current aide to Donald Trump has offered anecdotes about a president seemingly uninterested in the details of governing and uninformed on basic issues of foreign policy. For nearly three-and-a-half years, there have been plentiful stories about a White House rife with backbiting and internal power struggles. Mr Bolton's book goes beyond this well-trodden ground, however, in painting a broad portrait of a president willing to bend foreign policy to advance his domestic and personal political agenda. This was the heart of the impeachment case congressional Democrats made against Trump in January. Mr Bolton confirms their allegations that the president wanted the withholding of military aid to pressure Ukraine to provide damaging information about Democratic rival Joe Biden. Mr Bolton adds that Trump's dealings with China were also done with an eye on his re-election, and that he repeatedly intervened to assist friendly autocrats around the world. Republicans suggest this is all the work of a disgruntled employee trying to sell books, while Democrats are already growling that Bolton should have volunteered these bombshells during the impeachment proceedings. That ship has sailed, of course, but Bolton's book can still have a bite, distracting a presidential campaign struggling to find its footing less than five months before election day. Mr Bolton says the impeachment inquiry into the president might have had a different outcome this year if it had gone beyond Ukraine and investigated other instances of alleged political interference. In January, President Trump was impeached for withholding military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into starting a corruption investigation into Mr Biden and his son Hunter. The president denied the wrongdoing andwas acquitted after a two-week trialin the Republican-controlled Senate in February, which did not include any witnesses. Mr Bolton - who was criticised by Democrats for declining to testify to the hearings - does not discuss in the book whether he thinks that Mr Trump's actions on Ukraine were impeachable. The publication contains a number of other damaging allegations: Among other things, Mr Trump is alleged to have been unaware that the UK was a nuclear power. Britain's atomic deterrent came up during a meeting with Theresa May in 2018, when it was mentioned by one of the then-prime minister's officials. According to the book, Mr Trump said: ""Oh, are you a nuclear power?"" Mr Bolton said he could tell it ""was not intended as a joke"". Trump unaware UK was nuclear power - former aide Mr Trump also once asked his former chief-of-staff John Kelly if Finland was part of Russia, writes Mr Bolton. Mr Trump said invading Venezuela would be ""cool"", according to the book, and that the South American nation was ""really part of the United States"". But he was less enthusiastic about another invasion. Of the Afghanistan conflict, Mr Trump is quoted in the book as saying: ""This was done by a stupid person named George Bush."" Mr Bolton writes that in a May 2019 phone call Russian President Vladimir Putin pulled off a ""brilliant display of Soviet-style propaganda"" by likening Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, which ""largely persuaded Trump"". Mr Putin's objective was to defend his ally, Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, Mr Bolton writes. In 2018, Mr Trump labelled the leftist Mr Maduro a dictator and imposed sanctions, but he clung to power. In an interview with ABC News to be broadcast in full this Sunday, Mr Bolton says of Mr Trump: ""I think Putin thinks he can play him like a fiddle."" Mr Bolton writes that many of the president's closest aides privately disparaged him. When he arrived at the White House, Mr Bolton said Mr Kelly warned him: ""You can't imagine how desperate I am to get out of here. This is a bad place to work, as you will find out."" During Mr Trump's 2018 meeting with North Korea's leader, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo passed Mr Bolton a note about the president that said: ""He is so full of shit."" He writes that Mr Pompeo, often described as a Trump loyalist, was among aides who considered resigning in disgust in frustration at working for the president. Mr Bolton writes that the president ""saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.""

The players and match officials also all took a knee to mark the death of African American George Floyd in the US, and the players' names were replaced with the words Black Lives Matter.  An NHS nurse who spent 75 days as a coronavirus patient at the hospital where he works has recovered and left amid clapping from colleagues. Felix Khor, 68, spent 45 days in the intensive care ward at Southend Hospital in Essex, where he has worked for 15 years, and was put on a ventilator. He then spent several weeks on a different ward. He was admitted to hospital in early April and was discharged on Monday. Read his story here. Outbreaks of infection have been recorded at a number of slaughterhouses in Germany and worldwide Earlier we reported that 400 workers at a slaughterhouse in GÃ¼tersloh in western Germany had tested positive since Monday. Now some 7,000 people have been told to go into quarantine. Employees' families will have to isolate themselves and schools and nurseries in the area have been closed. The abattoir has also been temporarily shut. A number of abattoirs in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have been hit by Covid-19. They often rely on migrant labour. Some face allegations that poor working conditions and cramped accommodation facilitate the spread of the virus. Germany has had nearly 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, which is significantly less than some other western European countries, including the UK, France and Italy. More than 1,500 UK paediatricians have signed a letter to the prime minister calling for clear plans for getting children back into school. They say the absence of millions of children from schools ""risks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people"". Their concerns centre on the mental and physical health of children who have missed many months of education. Plans for schools reopening have been published in Scotland and Wales. The letter from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,externalcalls on the UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive to follow suit. Read aboutwhat they have to say here. A UK health says the country's coronavirus contact tracing app will be now ready ""before the winter"". Lord Bethell, the minister for innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care, said he was unable to give a date for its launch - adding that the application was ""not a priority"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergsaid,externalthe comments appeared to contradict statementsmade by ministers in the recent past. Read morehere. Financial pressure on the UK government due to the coronavirus outbreak has prompted more speculation over the level of future rises in the state pension. At the moment, pensioners are guaranteed rising payments through a so-called ""triple lock"". Pensions rise each year by a rate of inflation, the increase in average wages or 2.5% - whichever is highest. But with the coronavirus furlough scheme picking up 80% of millions of wages until it ends in October, next year's average wage rise will be as high as 18%. Will the government scrap the triple lock, will it postpone it, or are pensioners in line for a bumper increase? Read morehere. Around 2.8 million pints of out-of-date beer will need to be disposed of from Wales's shut pubs and clubs, the Campaign for Real Ale has estimated. But ""highly polluting"" beer ""poses a significant environmental risk"" according to Natural Resources Wales. Welsh Water says it will work with businesses ""to agree how and when the drinks can be disposed of"". But an opposition politician warned that the company was not used to dealing with such a volume of old beer. Wales's 3,500 pubs and clubs - along with cafes and restaurants - have been closed since 20 March. Read more here. Chile has announced a stricter lockdown in its capital after Covid-19 infections nationwide soared past 200,000. Chile is one of the worst affected nations in South America and Santiago has been badly hit. Residents of Santiago now face what has been termed ""maximum"" restrictions on movement. The infection rate nationwide rose to 220,628, the health ministry said, after 31,412 previously unconfirmed cases were added to 4,757 new ones. Chile has also recorded 3,383 deaths. In a joint ministerial briefing, officials said residents of Santiago would be
granted permission to leave their homes just twice a week
instead of five times. This is despite lockdowns lasting three months having already been in place in some parts of the capital. Lockdowns in Santiago have not halted the spread The return to Premier League football is having a poignant start. When the game began at Villa, players, officials and staff took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. When referee Michael Oliver blew the whistle for kick-off, he and his
officials joined all the players in kneeling for around 10 seconds to protest against racial injustice and to stand in support of others after the death of George Floyd in the US. All players warmed up in
Black Lives Matters t-shirts, with their names on the back of the match shirts
replaced with the same message. Games are being played behind closed doors because of the pandemic, with few journalists, officials and ground staff spaced out in the quiet stadium. Instead of crowd noise there is just the chat and commotion of the players, managers and officials. At the UK government daily briefing earlier, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned fans to watch the game at home, rather than meet up and spread the virus. Even the goalposts were disinfected before the match Seats remained empty, but shirts were filled with 'Black Lives Matter' Oktoberfest - the world's largest beer celebration - is normally held in September and October but this year's festivities were cancelled in April Germany has extended a ban on large gatherings until at least the end of October, Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced. The number of new coronavirus infections has stabilised at a low level, she said, but people should continue social distancing and wear masks, report German media. The ban could affect events including the Frankfurt book fair, which attracts around 300,000 visitors and which organisers had said until now was going ahead, plus of course large sports events. Rules on gathering size vary across Germany's states. Before the new announcement was made, for example, Berlin's rules allowed up to 200 people to gather for outdoor events until 16 June, increasing to 500 from 16 June and to 1,000 from 30 June. Schools will also return to normal after the summer holidays, Merkel added, after speaking with the leaders of Germany's 16 states in Berlin on Wednesday.  We reported yesterday on dexamethasone, the cheap and widely available drug thatcan help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. Today, the World Health Organization issued some cautions, stressing that the steroid should only be used under medical supervision and that it should be reserved for exceptionally ill patients. It also cautions there is no evidence it could prevent infection, or treat milder illness. The head of the WHO's emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, said: ""It is exceptionally important in this case, that the drug is reserved for use in severely ill and critical patients who can benefit from this drug clearly."" Some doctors also want to see more data, citing possible side-effects. A major trial in the UK showed the drug cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth. Read more about dexamethasonehere. Campaigners have called on the government to make pet theft a specific offence after instances of the crime ""went through the roof"" in lockdown. Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine, told MPs dog prices ""went up and up"" during lockdown and cases of theft increased. She joined others to tell MPs tougher penalties were needed to deter thieves. The government has said it is already an offence under the Theft Act 1968, with a maximum penalty of seven years. But campaigners complain those who steal animals can currently be punished in the same way as someone who steals a mobile phone or a laptop, as pets are classed simply as ""property"" under the act.

Tourism officials plan to start by limiting the number of visitors to the tower, following its longest closure since World War Two. Only the first and second floors will be accessible to visitors, and lifts will remain closed in the first stage of reopening. All surfaces in well-travelled areas will be cleaned every two hours, and all visitors over the age of 11 will be required to wear masks. A full reopening is expected by 25 June. The tower normally receives around seven million visitors per year, but France's tourism industry has been hit hard after a lockdown was imposed in March. Lifts will be closed at first, forcing visitors to hike up the stairs Reality Check Earlier, at the UK government briefing, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden was asked about when more public
toilets will reopen, to avoid parks and streets turning into âcesspitsâ. Management of public toilets is a council issue, meaning local
government will decide when the 4,500 plus council-run toilets in the UK can reopen
to the public. Additionally, public toilets run by private companies in places
like shopping centres will reopen when those companies think it is safe to do
so. The government has âstrongly encouragedâ the reopening of toilets
with appropriate social distancing measures such as a bigger gap between
urinals and electric hand dryers. A number of popular destinations have already reopened all or some
of their toilets including Brighton, North Norfolk, Cornwall and Blackpool. The
National Trust and Royal Parks have also reopened some of their toilets. If you are visiting somewhere and are concerned about access to
toilets, local council websites are supplying information on which ones have
now reopened. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world A woman in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg has been fined for writing on Facebook that her local hospital was avoiding diagnosing patients with coronavirus, according to Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. ""The hospital is packed, people are dying in their masses, everyone
is being diagnosed with 'pneumonia'. They put him in a corridor,"" Tatiana Znak wrote, describing the death of a family friend. The court found she has misrepresented the situation and insisted that no-one had died of the disease there. Znak was fined 15,000 roubles (about $200). Her lawyer says she will appeal against the decision, saying ""we will go to
the European Court of Human Rights if need be"". Russia has the third-highest number of cases in the world (552,549) and 7,468 deaths, according to official figures. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Trump sought Xi's help with re-election - BoltonDetails from the new book by the president's ex-national security adviser include damning accusations.US & Canada,"Mr Bolton denies that the book contains classified information US President Donald Trump sought help from Chinese President Xi Jinping to win re-election, ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton's new book says. Mr Bolton says Mr Trump wanted China to buy agricultural produce from US farmers, according to details of the forthcoming book previewed by US media. He also says Mr Trump ""remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House"". The Trump administration is trying to block the book from going on sale. Speaking to Fox News, Mr Trump said of Mr Bolton: ""He broke the law. This is highly classified information and he did not have approval."" ""He was a washed-up guy,"" the president added. ""I gave him a chance."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

John Bolton joined the White House in April 2018 and left in September the following year, saying he had decided to quit.President Trump, however, said he had fired Mr Boltonbecause he disagreed ""strongly"" with him. He is known as a foreign policy hardliner and also served in the administration of President George W Bush. As national security adviser, he was the top counsellor to the US president on security matters at home and abroad. Mr Bolton's 577-page tome, The Room Where It Happened, is due to go on sale on 23 June. But on Wednesday night, the Department of Justice sought an emergency order from a judge to stop the book's release. Ten biggest claims in John Bolton's book John Bolton: Who is man behind Trump-Xi allegations? Why has Trump's niece written a damning memoir? The publisher, Simon & Schuster, said in a statement: ""Tonight's filing by the government is a frivolous, politically motivated exercise in futility."" It said hundreds of thousands of copies of the book had already been distributed around the world and the injunction would accomplish nothing. Mr Trump's Democratic challenger in this November's election, Joe Biden, said in a statement about the book: ""If these accounts are true, it's not only morally repugnant, it's a violation of Donald Trump's sacred duty to the American people."" The allegations refer to a meeting between President Trump and President Xi at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June last year. ""Trump, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election [in 2020], alluding to China's economic capability and pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win,"" Mr Bolton wrote. ""He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome."" The two men met during a G20 meeting in Japan last year Farmers make up a key voting bloc and largely supported Mr Trump in the 2016 election. Speaking on Wednesday evening, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer disputed Mr Bolton's account, saying the request for help with re-election ""never happened"". Mr Bolton also mentions an earlier conversation at the summit's opening dinner, in which they discussed the building of camps in China's western Xinjiang region. Mr Trump said the construction should go ahead as it was ""exactly the right thing to do"". This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" China has detained about a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in the campsfor punishment and indoctrination. The Trump administration has been publicly critical of China's treatment of Uighurs, and on Wednesday the president signed legislation authorising US sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for the repression of Muslims in Xinjiang province. China denies mistreating Uighurs and attacked the US move, calling it malicious and threatening countermeasures. On one hand, the account John Bolton offers in his new book should seem somewhat familiar. This is hardly the first time a former adviser or anonymous current aide to Donald Trump has offered anecdotes about a president seemingly uninterested in the details of governing and uninformed on basic issues of foreign policy. For nearly three-and-a-half years, there have been plentiful stories about a White House rife with backbiting and internal power struggles. Mr Bolton's book goes beyond this well-trodden ground, however, in painting a broad portrait of a president willing to bend foreign policy to advance his domestic and personal political agenda. This was the heart of the impeachment case congressional Democrats made against Trump in January. Mr Bolton confirms their allegations that the president wanted the withholding of military aid to pressure Ukraine to provide damaging information about Democratic rival Joe Biden. Mr Bolton adds that Trump's dealings with China were also done with an eye on his re-election, and that he repeatedly intervened to assist friendly autocrats around the world. Republicans suggest this is all the work of a disgruntled employee trying to sell books, while Democrats are already growling that Bolton should have volunteered these bombshells during the impeachment proceedings. That ship has sailed, of course, but Bolton's book can still have a bite, distracting a presidential campaign struggling to find its footing less than five months before election day. Mr Bolton says the impeachment inquiry into the president might have had a different outcome this year if it had gone beyond Ukraine and investigated other instances of alleged political interference. In January, President Trump was impeached for withholding military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into starting a corruption investigation into Mr Biden and his son Hunter. The president denied the wrongdoing andwas acquitted after a two-week trialin the Republican-controlled Senate in February, which did not include any witnesses. Mr Bolton - who was criticised by Democrats for declining to testify to the hearings - does not discuss in the book whether he thinks that Mr Trump's actions on Ukraine were impeachable. The publication contains a number of other damaging allegations: Among other things, Mr Trump is alleged to have been unaware that the UK was a nuclear power. Britain's atomic deterrent came up during a meeting with Theresa May in 2018, when it was mentioned by one of the then-prime minister's officials. According to the book, Mr Trump said: ""Oh, are you a nuclear power?"" Mr Bolton said he could tell it ""was not intended as a joke"". Trump unaware UK was nuclear power - former aide Mr Trump also once asked his former chief-of-staff John Kelly if Finland was part of Russia, writes Mr Bolton. Mr Trump said invading Venezuela would be ""cool"", according to the book, and that the South American nation was ""really part of the United States"". But he was less enthusiastic about another invasion. Of the Afghanistan conflict, Mr Trump is quoted in the book as saying: ""This was done by a stupid person named George Bush."" Mr Bolton writes that in a May 2019 phone call Russian President Vladimir Putin pulled off a ""brilliant display of Soviet-style propaganda"" by likening Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, which ""largely persuaded Trump"". Mr Putin's objective was to defend his ally, Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, Mr Bolton writes. In 2018, Mr Trump labelled the leftist Mr Maduro a dictator and imposed sanctions, but he clung to power. In an interview with ABC News to be broadcast in full this Sunday, Mr Bolton says of Mr Trump: ""I think Putin thinks he can play him like a fiddle."" Mr Bolton writes that many of the president's closest aides privately disparaged him. When he arrived at the White House, Mr Bolton said Mr Kelly warned him: ""You can't imagine how desperate I am to get out of here. This is a bad place to work, as you will find out."" During Mr Trump's 2018 meeting with North Korea's leader, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo passed Mr Bolton a note about the president that said: ""He is so full of shit."" He writes that Mr Pompeo, often described as a Trump loyalist, was among aides who considered resigning in disgust in frustration at working for the president. Mr Bolton writes that the president ""saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.""

Apple accused of 'hostile' app fee policies,"Apple's chief executive will address app-makers at its online WWDC conference next week Apple is facing mounting calls to reconsider its App Store rules, from the creators of the apps themselves. Dozens have used the term ""hostile"",externalto describe how they perceive it treats its third-party developer community. The backlash has been sparked by a row between the tech giant and the makers of a new email app over a demand that Apple be given the means to take a cut of the services's subscription fee. The clash threatens to overshadow one of Apple's biggest annual events. The iPhone-maker hosts its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday. The five-day event is used to showcase new technologies and encourage software-makers to adopt them. Regulators and politicians have also questioned whether Apple is behaving illegally. On Tuesday, the European Union launched aformal probe into the firm's App store rulessaying it believed they might be ""distorting competition"" in the digital goods market. And in the US, Congress is waiting to hear whether chief executive Tim Cook will testify to a House committee investigating whether Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon are exploiting their size to obtain unfair advantages over smaller companies. Mr Cook has previously said that he thought it was fair for Apple to come under scrutiny, but the firm was not a monopoly in any of the markets it operated in. The dispute - with the Chicago-based software firm Basecamp - began on Monday when Apple rejected an update to its Hey app. Hey puts messages from familiar contacts into an Imbox - for important emails - while placing newsletters and promotional messages elsewhere Hey screens emails and separates them into different places, so that users can focus on the most important ones. It offers an alternative to Apple's own Mail app as well as other services such as Gmail and Outlook. It costs $99 (Â£87) a year. This fee must be paid for via Hey's own site, but the app does not contain links or other prompts to do so. Even so, Apple told Basecamp it must also offer an in-app payment option, from which the App Store owner would deduct a 30% cut. Apple added that the original version of the app should not have been approved in the first place. Basecamp's chief technology officer has tweeted his dismay, accusing Apple of a ""shakedown"" and being ""perversely abusive and unfair"". ""I will burn this house down myself, before I let gangsters like that spin it for spoils,""David Heinemeier Hansson added.,external Allow Twitter content?

The executive testified to Congress earlier this year when he complained about Apple's commission charges, at which time he was also critical of Google's business practices. However, he has noted in this latest dispute that Google's Play Store is not trying to impose a similar revenue share. His tweets have struck a nerve with other developers, some of whom have used the opportunity to express their own concerns. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For its part, Apple notes that policies in place since 2010 made clear that paid services must offer users the option to make the purchase within the app. The firm does make an exception for what it terms Reader apps - including magazines, books, newspapers, video-streamers and cloud storage - so long as they do not directly tell users to pay elsewhere. This is why Amazon's Kindle app, for example, lets iPhone-owners read books bought off the retailer's site, but does not direct them to buy other titles from there. Apple faces two EU anti-competition probes Apple claims 'half a trillion dollars' App Store economy Apple boosted by streaming services despite lockdown Apple has given some organisations further special dispensation - for example BBC's iPlayer app tells users they must pay the licence fee, but does not provide the US firm with a way of taking a cut. But otherwise, Apple says developers must follow its ""strict guidelines"". Mr Hansson, however, claims that Apple recently tightened the application of its rules, which would explain why some other apps appear to have escaped the in-app fee requirement. But Apple has said there has been no change of practice. Apple's model offers users convenience, but one company-watcher said it could also place them at a disadvantage, as they cannot be told it might be cheaper to sign up outside the app. iOS apps cannot inform users that it may be cheaper to buy digital content from an external website ""It's increasingly difficult for customers to understand all the different options open to them when subscribing to content, particularly through Apple's App Store, because developers aren't able to display all the deals available to them,"" explained Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""And there is little question that this debate has now exploded into the public domain. ""Therefore it's going to be interesting to see whether it's something that Apple addresses at WWDC.""

Beijing stops travel,"People queuing for a nucleic acid test on Wednesday - most people need a negative test before leaving the city, while others are banned entirely Millions of people in Beijing are living under renewed restrictions, as a spike in virus cases continues. The city reported another 31 cases on Wednesday, bringing the total to 137 in the past week. Before the recent spike, the Chinese capital had gone 57 days without a locally-transmitted case. The outbreak is believed to have started in the massive Xinfadi food market that supplies 80% of the city's meat and vegetables. At least 27 neighbourhoods have been classed as medium risk and one neighbourhood, near the market, is high risk. People in medium or high-risk areas cannot leave the city. People in low-risk areas can leave, but need to test negative first. However, getting a test is difficult - three testing stations told the BBC there were no tests available until July. Queues were seen outside other centres. More than 1,200 flights have been cancelled to and from the city and railway services have been reduced until at least 9 July. Primary school, middle school, and college classes are suspended, sports teams cannot play, and swimming pools and gyms are closed. However, roads are open, and companies and factories can still work. The city is on a ""level two"" alert, the second-highest. Restaurants, sport, packed trains, even the pubâ¦ there we were, basking in the glory of ""normal-ish"" life in Beijing, after more than 50 days without an infection. Then: bam! The market outbreak has dragged us back into a virus prevention bubble. In effect, it's very hard to leave Beijing right now. If you haven't done a test in the past week your departure is not allowed, and limited testing capacity is, understandably, being diverted to ""high risk"" groups. The airlines know this. That's why they've cancelled 1,255 flights in and out of the capital on Wednesday so far. For the moment, the authorities are managing Beijing districts almost like cities within the city, imposing strict measures where needed in the hope that they can control it. However, this is touching everyone's movements. The main difference between now and February is that businesses, government departments, manufacturing are all still operating. Perhaps because of this, there seems to be a general confidence that the cluster will be controlled - before becoming a full-blown second wave. Local media said the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at the Xinfandi market. The general manager of the market was dismissed, along with other local officials. Beijing tightens controls to tackle virus spike Fear of Beijing second wave after market outbreak The Beijing government said ""relevant people"" from the market would not be allowed to leave the city, regardless of which neighbourhood they live in. The market has tens of thousands of visitors each day. In general, China has successfully ""flattened the curve"" in recent months. After passing 80,000 confirmed cases at the start of March, it has added only around 3,200 since then. On Tuesday, for example, it reported just32 locally-transmitted cases,externalin the whole country - 27 were in Beijing with four in neighbouring Hebei.

The Premier League returns,"Liverpool (led by Jurgen Klopp, centre) could win the Premier League in their first game back The Premier League returns on Wednesday... but not exactly as we know it. After a 100-day absence because of the coronavirus pandemic, Aston Villa v Sheffield United will kick off the English top-flight's resumption. It is the first of 92 league games that will be packed into a frantic 40 days before the season concludes on 26 July. Fixtures will be played behind closed doors as one of a host of measures to prevent any further cases of the virus. A minute's silence to remember those who have died with coronaviruswill be held before the first matches, while heart-shaped badges in tribute to frontline NHS staff will also be worn on kits. For the first 12 matches of the restarted campaign, allplayer names on the back of shirts will be replaced by ""Black Lives Matter"". This followsthe death of George Floyd in the United States,which has sparked protests worldwide. Over eight rounds of twice-weekly coronavirus screenings of Premier League players and staff, there have been16 positive results from 8,687 tests.,external All remaining 92 games will be broadcast live, with four matches to be shown on the BBC - the first to be made free-to-air on terrestrial television since the Premier League's inception in 1992. Liverpool sit 25 points clear at the top of the table while Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Norwich City are in the relegation places. The Reds, chasing a first league title in 30 years, could clinch it with victory in their first game back should second-placed Manchester City lose to Arsenal on Wednesday. Coronavirus set to cost Premier League clubs Â£1bn - Deloitte Things we expect when the Premier League comes back 'Life hasn't been the same without football' - Phil McNulty on Premier League's return Quiz: what can you remember of the 2019-20 season so far? With the number of new infections falling and lockdown restrictions in England being gradually eased, thePremier League agreed it was safe to resume with the correct safety measures in place. This was followed by theUK government giving the go-aheadfor elite competitive sport to resume behind closed doors from 1 June. Clubs unanimously voted toresume contact trainingin the final week of May, having started non-contact training the previous week as part of Project Restart. Premier League players and staff will continue to be tested twice a week, with any players or staff who test positive self-isolating for a period of seven days. Thedelaying of Euro 2020 by a yearprovided the Premier League with greater flexibility in which to fit in fixtures. But there remains a time pressure imposed by issues with players' contracts, many of which run out on 30 June, and the scheduled start of the 2020-21 season in August. There is also a financial incentive to resume playing, with thethreat of an increased or restructured rebate to TV companies if fixtures are not completed. This video can not be played It's OK to say we've missed football - Lineker on Premier League return The fixture list, including kick-off times, forthe first 32 matches after the restart was announced on 5 June. Aston Villa will face Sheffield United in the opening match at 18:00 BST on Wednesday, before Manchester City host Arsenal later the same evening. The first full round of fixtures will then be played over the weekend. For the full list of Premier League fixtures,click here. All remaining 92 Premier League games will be broadcast liveon Sky Sports, BT Sport, BBC Sport or Amazon Prime. The BBC will show Bournemouth v Crystal Palace on 20 June at 19:45 BST, followed by Norwich v Everton on 24 June at 18:00, and then two matches yet to be confirmed. As well as the four live games, there will be additional Match of the Day highlights programmes. Sky Sports will make 25 of the remaining top-flight matches free to air, including the Merseyside derby at 19:00 on 21 June. Amazon Prime's four matches will also be broadcast for free. For the full list of free to air games,click here. BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport will also provide live radio commentaries for all the remaining matches, while BT Sport will show the first Saturday 15:00 Premier League match to be broadcast live in the UK when Brighton take on Arsenal on 20 June. This video can not be played What Match of the Day looked like the last time BBC broadcast the top flight in 1988 All matches behind closed doors, with number of key people allowed inside the stadium limited to 300. Stadiums divided into three zones - red (includes pitch and technical areas), amber (stands) and green (stand concourses) - with restrictions on who is allowed to enter each. Teamsable to make five substitutions,rather than three, in each match and able to name nine substitutes instead of the usual seven. Staggered entry on to pitch for players and staff and no handshakes before kick-off. Deep cleaning of corner flags, goalposts, substitution boards and match balls before and after each fixture. Extra disinfection, such as of the substitution board after it is used, likely during matches and at half-time. Medical protocols stipulate how squads and coaching staff must travel to and from games, observing social distancing. Post-match broadcast interviews will take place pitchside with press conferences conducted virtually. VAR will continue to be in operation. Before the suspension of play in the Premier League, Liverpool were hurtling towards their first top-flight title in 30 years. The league will restart with the Reds 25 points clear at the top and potentially one win away from confirming their triumph. If Manchester City lose their game in hand - against Arsenal on Wednesday - Jurgen Klopp's side will seal the title with victory in the Merseyside derby at Everton on Sunday. The race for a top-four spot is less of a formality. City's two-year ban from European competition (appeal pending) means fifth place will be enough for a Champions League spot. Liverpool, Leicester, Chelsea and Manchester United are currently occupying the qualification places, but the likes of Wolves, Sheffield United, Tottenham and Arsenal will all begin again with a place in Europe's top competition as their aim. Down at the bottom, six clubs are seemingly battling it out to avoid the drop. Bottom club Norwich are six points adrift on 21 points. Aston Villa and Bournemouth are the two clubs above them but are part of a group of five clubs, along with Watford, West Ham and Brighton, separated by just four points.

Virus drug 'major breakthrough',"A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. The low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. The drug is part ofthe world's biggest trial testing existing treatments,externalto see if they also work for coronavirus. It cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth. Had the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say. This video can not be played Katherine Millbank spent 15 days in hospital and was put on the drug trial And it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients. The UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate ""a remarkable British scientific achievement"", adding: ""We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak."" Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world. What is dexamethasone and how does it work? Latest coronavirus updates The drug combination that may help us beat Covid-19 About 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. Of those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. And these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. The drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions. And it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. This over-reaction,a cytokine storm, can be deadly. Inthe trial,external, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%. Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: ""This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough."" Lead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for: every eight patients on a ventilator every 20-25 treated with oxygen ""There is a clear, clear benefit,"" he said. ""The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about Â£5 per patient. ""So essentially it costs Â£35 to save a life. ""This is a drug that is globally available."" When appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said. But people should not go out and buy it to take at home. Dexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently beenditched amid concernsit increases fatalities and heart problems. The antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is alreadybeing made available on the NHS. The first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid. That is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. And that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. Dexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Half of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact. The drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. So far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola. That has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11. But the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. Unlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.

Rashford seeks more change after food voucher win,"This video can not be played Footballer Marcus Rashford's mother struggled to put food on the table for her five children Footballer Marcus Rashford says he wants to do more to help those in need after winning a battle to have a free school meal voucher scheme extended. His campaign prompted a government U-turn that will see parents claim vouchers for about 1.3 million children in England during the summer holidays. But he told BBC Breakfast there are ""more steps that need to be taken"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the England star's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". The Manchester United forward said he was ""grateful that the prime minister did change his decision"" and that, in a phone call, Mr Johnson had thanked him ""for using what I've built in a positive manner"". Mr Rashford said the extension of the scheme - launched when schools were closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown - has ""bought an extra six weeks"" to ""figure out what's next"". Laura Kuenssberg: Why policy U-turns matter Rashford's home town 'so proud' of 'real hero' Who gets free school meals? How other Premier League stars are making a difference Is this a chance to end 'holiday hunger' for good? ""I don't want this to be the end of it because there are more steps that need to be taken and we just need to analyse the response,"" he said in an exclusive interview. ""People are struggling all year around so we still need to learn more about the situation people are in and how we can help them best."" The government says Â£63m is available to support the most vulnerable families through a new local authority welfare assistance scheme, and its Holiday Activities and Food programme offers activities and free meals in the summer holidays. On Tuesday, Downing Street announced all children eligible for free school meals in term time in England would benefit from a ""Covid summer food fund"". The announcement came despite ministers having defended the decision not to extend the scheme for days beforehand. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthe ""involvement of a young, well-liked, articulate and high-profile figure"" like Mr Rashford ""made that defence less sustainable by the hour"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC it was ""totally reasonable"" for the government to listen to arguments and change its mind, as it had done in this case. He congratulated Mr Rashford on his ""impressive"" campaign which he said was conducted with ""such dignity and emotion"". Speaking on Sky News, Mr Hancock accidentally referred to the footballer as Daniel Rashford, which he put down to it being ""too early in the morning"", adding: ""I completely misspoke."" Responding on Twitter,external, Mr Rashford laughed it off, saying: ""I've been called much worse over the last couple of days."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I only became aware of Marcus Rashford's campaign today"" The voucher scheme in England works out at about Â£15 a week per child, and extending it over the summer will cost around Â£120m. The Scottish and Welsh governments had already said they would continue supporting families with food vouchers, meal deliveries or bank transfers. First Minister Arlene Foster has said she will propose an equivalent scheme in Northern Ireland be extended over the summer ""if the necessary finances can be secured"". Following Mr Rashford's campaign, Jessica Ekwunife, a single parent of five who uses the vouchers, said: ""I just want to thank that man. ""When I heard that the voucher scheme would end, I got so anxious. Its bad enough that we're in cramped conditions. [My children] are always in the fridge, and I have to ask them to wait awhile before they eat the next thing. I feel so bad doing that. They're children."" Analysis by Hannah Richardson, education and social affairs reporter Campaigns highlighting the struggle many poorer families have feeding their children during the holidays are nothing new. Every summer, charities produce reports detailing parents going without meals so their children can eat. But the intervention of Mr Rashford made that cause mainstream. When the young footballer says there is more to do, he'll draw fist-pumping and applause from those working on the front line. Firstly the scheme only covers this summer holiday. Secondly only those already on free school meals will be eligible. That means any family who falls into enough hardship to qualify - an income of less than Â£7,400 before benefits - between now and the end of term, will not receive those precious food parcels. And with three million new claimants for Universal Credit since lockdown began and more redundancies on the horizon, there will be questions as to whether this really is enough. A ""wave of unease amongst Conservative MPs over the handling of this latest U-turn"" is likely to be aired later, when the prime minister meets the executive of the backbench 1922 committee for the first time since the general election in December, says BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt. One MP told him the issue had been ""visible from outer space"", while a cabinet minister criticised Mr Johnson's top aide, Dominic Cummings, and said the issue of meal vouchers ""should have been dealt with a week ago"" when raised during Prime Minister's Questions. Came through the ranks at Manchester United, having grown up in the city and joined the club at the age of seven At the age of 18, he was named as a sub for a Europa League tie against Midtjylland, but was drafted into the starting line-up when Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up He went on to score two goals in that match, breaking George Best's record as Manchester United's youngest ever scorer in European competition, That immediate impact meant he made his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later He has now scored 64 goals in 137 matches for the club He scored three minutes into his England debut against Australia He played for England at both Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, where he converted a penalty in the famous shoot-out win over Colombia At the age of 22, he now has 38 England caps (more than World Cup winners George Cohen, Jack Charlton, Roger Hunt and Nobby Stiles) and has scored 10 international goals It comes amid heightened concern over the effects of the lockdown on livelihoods. On Tuesday, official figures suggested the number claiming work-related benefits - which includes the unemployed - was up 126% to 2.8 million, with analysts suggesting poorer areas were being hit hardest.

"Rashford seeks more change after food voucher win""People are struggling all year around,"" the footballer says, after forcing a government U-turn.","This video can not be played Footballer Marcus Rashford's mother struggled to put food on the table for her five children Footballer Marcus Rashford says he wants to do more to help those in need after winning a battle to have a free school meal voucher scheme extended. His campaign prompted a government U-turn that will see parents claim vouchers for about 1.3 million children in England during the summer holidays. But he told BBC Breakfast there are ""more steps that need to be taken"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the England star's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". The Manchester United forward said he was ""grateful that the prime minister did change his decision"" and that, in a phone call, Mr Johnson had thanked him ""for using what I've built in a positive manner"". Mr Rashford said the extension of the scheme - launched when schools were closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown - has ""bought an extra six weeks"" to ""figure out what's next"". Laura Kuenssberg: Why policy U-turns matter Rashford's home town 'so proud' of 'real hero' Who gets free school meals? How other Premier League stars are making a difference Is this a chance to end 'holiday hunger' for good? ""I don't want this to be the end of it because there are more steps that need to be taken and we just need to analyse the response,"" he said in an exclusive interview. ""People are struggling all year around so we still need to learn more about the situation people are in and how we can help them best."" The government says Â£63m is available to support the most vulnerable families through a new local authority welfare assistance scheme, and its Holiday Activities and Food programme offers activities and free meals in the summer holidays. On Tuesday, Downing Street announced all children eligible for free school meals in term time in England would benefit from a ""Covid summer food fund"". The announcement came despite ministers having defended the decision not to extend the scheme for days beforehand. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthe ""involvement of a young, well-liked, articulate and high-profile figure"" like Mr Rashford ""made that defence less sustainable by the hour"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC it was ""totally reasonable"" for the government to listen to arguments and change its mind, as it had done in this case. He congratulated Mr Rashford on his ""impressive"" campaign which he said was conducted with ""such dignity and emotion"". Speaking on Sky News, Mr Hancock accidentally referred to the footballer as Daniel Rashford, which he put down to it being ""too early in the morning"", adding: ""I completely misspoke."" Responding on Twitter,external, Mr Rashford laughed it off, saying: ""I've been called much worse over the last couple of days."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I only became aware of Marcus Rashford's campaign today"" The voucher scheme in England works out at about Â£15 a week per child, and extending it over the summer will cost around Â£120m. The Scottish and Welsh governments had already said they would continue supporting families with food vouchers, meal deliveries or bank transfers. First Minister Arlene Foster has said she will propose an equivalent scheme in Northern Ireland be extended over the summer ""if the necessary finances can be secured"". Following Mr Rashford's campaign, Jessica Ekwunife, a single parent of five who uses the vouchers, said: ""I just want to thank that man. ""When I heard that the voucher scheme would end, I got so anxious. Its bad enough that we're in cramped conditions. [My children] are always in the fridge, and I have to ask them to wait awhile before they eat the next thing. I feel so bad doing that. They're children."" Analysis by Hannah Richardson, education and social affairs reporter Campaigns highlighting the struggle many poorer families have feeding their children during the holidays are nothing new. Every summer, charities produce reports detailing parents going without meals so their children can eat. But the intervention of Mr Rashford made that cause mainstream. When the young footballer says there is more to do, he'll draw fist-pumping and applause from those working on the front line. Firstly the scheme only covers this summer holiday. Secondly only those already on free school meals will be eligible. That means any family who falls into enough hardship to qualify - an income of less than Â£7,400 before benefits - between now and the end of term, will not receive those precious food parcels. And with three million new claimants for Universal Credit since lockdown began and more redundancies on the horizon, there will be questions as to whether this really is enough. A ""wave of unease amongst Conservative MPs over the handling of this latest U-turn"" is likely to be aired later, when the prime minister meets the executive of the backbench 1922 committee for the first time since the general election in December, says BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt. One MP told him the issue had been ""visible from outer space"", while a cabinet minister criticised Mr Johnson's top aide, Dominic Cummings, and said the issue of meal vouchers ""should have been dealt with a week ago"" when raised during Prime Minister's Questions. Came through the ranks at Manchester United, having grown up in the city and joined the club at the age of seven At the age of 18, he was named as a sub for a Europa League tie against Midtjylland, but was drafted into the starting line-up when Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up He went on to score two goals in that match, breaking George Best's record as Manchester United's youngest ever scorer in European competition, That immediate impact meant he made his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later He has now scored 64 goals in 137 matches for the club He scored three minutes into his England debut against Australia He played for England at both Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, where he converted a penalty in the famous shoot-out win over Colombia At the age of 22, he now has 38 England caps (more than World Cup winners George Cohen, Jack Charlton, Roger Hunt and Nobby Stiles) and has scored 10 international goals It comes amid heightened concern over the effects of the lockdown on livelihoods. On Tuesday, official figures suggested the number claiming work-related benefits - which includes the unemployed - was up 126% to 2.8 million, with analysts suggesting poorer areas were being hit hardest. Charities say research among 3,105 parents suggests half of families receiving universal credit or child tax credit in June had fallen behind with rent or other bills.

Life-saving Covid drug used across NHS from today,"A life-saving treatment for seriously-ill hospital patients with Covid-19 is being used across the UK from today, following breakthrough results in a UK trial. Dexamethasone - a cheap, widely-available steroid - was shown to reduce deaths among patients on ventilators and on oxygen. The UK's chief medical officers say it should be used ""with immediate effect"". And there are no issues with supplies of the medicine in the UK. What is dexamethasone and how does it work? In an urgent letter from the UK's four chief medical officers to clinicians in the NHS, they said dexamethasone had ""a clear place in the management of hospitalised patients with Covid-19"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons that 240,000 doses of the drug are ""in stock and on order"". ""It is not by any means a cure but it is the best news we have had,"" he added. It comes as the UK government announced a further 184 people have died with coronavirus across all settings in the UK, taking the total to 42,153. The anti-inflammatory drug was tested as part ofthe world's biggest trial of existing treatments,externalto see if they could also work against coronavirus. In the trial, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%. Latest coronavirus updates The drug combination that may help us beat Covid-19 The researchers said this was equivalent to one life being saved for every eight patients on a ventilator and one life being saved for every 20-25 being treated with oxygen. Marium Zumeer was given the drug as part of the trial Marium Zumeer, an 18-year-old from Bradford who was given the drug as part of the trial, said it had been ""life-saving"". She was admitted to hospital after 10 days of being extremely unwell, and after beginning a course of the drug she was told she would hopefully be home in a week. ""And a week later I did come home,"" Ms Zumeer said. On Monday 15 June, 385 people with Covid-19 were on mechanical ventilation in hospitals in the UK with hundreds more likely to be on oxygen support. They could all be candidates for receiving dexamethasone. The drug works by dampening down the reaction of the body's immune system to on Covid-19, which can often be more harmful than the virus itself. Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said it was ""the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly"". ""It's a major breakthrough,"" he added. However, it should not be used to treat anyone with coronavirus who is not in hospital. Its use is still being studied in children. Already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions, the cost of the drug would be as little as Â£5 per patient. The drug is also widely available around the world. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted?

About 500 staff have been producing parts for ventilators in the AMRC Cymru facility at Airbus's Broughton site in Flintshire. That work is due to stop at the end of this month.

Senedd members held a minute's silence in memory of him at the start of their virtual session on Wednesday. Paul Davies, Tory group leader in the Welsh Parliament, said he was a man whose life was ""dedicated to enriching and supporting those around him"". He said Mr Asghar had sought to ""widen every possible connection between the ethnic minority groups and this institution"". ""Oscar worked so hard to open the door and invite them in,"" he said. The Welsh government is
âintensely awareâ of the pressure on the tourism sector, Ms Morgan says but added that a second surge of cases in an area of Japan showed it
was necessary to âtread very, very carefullyâ. She
says the Welsh government will be âputting guidance in place that we've worked up
with the industryâ but the support of local communities was also needed. ""Just
to make it clear in relation to tourism, we are intensely aware of the pressure
that is on a sector which is fundamental to the Welsh economy. âWe
are acting sensitively, I hope, in discussing with all of the key actors in the
area, discussing with local authorities, discussing with the key stakeholders
in relation to the tourism sector. âThey
understand that we need to do this carefully and the most important thing is to
see how we can avoid a second peak.â The
first minister will announce the outcome of the fourth lockdown review on
Friday. Children should speak to their friends in Welsh while playing on games consoles to keep up their use of the language, according to the Welsh language minister. Eluned Morgan acknowledged that non-Welsh speaking parents of children who go to Welsh-medium schools were âanxiousâ to ensure they have opportunities to use the language while schools are closed. She said the government had provided online resources to help. âThere's also opportunities for people to use their language, we've seen the Urdd for example undertake a significant digital event, the Eisteddfod T, with thousands of children from Welsh speaking homes and non-Welsh speaking homes were able to use the language. âAnd also I think it's worth just making the point that they have friends, they can speak to their friends in Welsh. âSo I'd encourage them if they are going to be playing on their Xboxes or their PS4s, then there's no reason why they couldn't be chatting to their friends through the medium of Welsh."" The Welsh secretary has been accused of being âreducedâ to lobbying on behalf of the UK government. Simon Hart wrote to council leaders in Wales and members of the Welsh Parliament urging them to encourage the Welsh government to announce plans to reopen the tourism sector. Ms Morgan said: âHe has the right to make his case known but it is an odd situation where the office of the secretary of state for Wales is reduced to being a lobbying outfit for the UK government. âWe will make the decisions based on the scientific evidence and the headroom that is available to us so that we can keep our communities safe in Wales. âWe will do what's right for Wales, when it's right for Wales. Of course we will make every effort to open the sectors that are sensitive in this area at this time, as soon as we possibly can.â Â© 2025 BBC.

New advice on shielding will be given 'very soon',"People most at risk from coronavirus will ""very soon"" be told when they can stop isolating, the government says. Some 2.2 million people in England - who have been told to stay home since the beginning of lockdown in March - will get a letter detailing the change, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. Charities say the government must explain why it will be safe to change the shielding programme. Scotland has extended its advice to shielduntil at least the end of July. In Northern Ireland, about 80,000 people who were told in March to shield for at least 12 weeksare now receiving lettersasking them to continue to do so until the end of June - although they can now spend some time outdoors. In Wales, since 1 June some 130,000 people shielding have been allowed to do unlimited outdoor exercise - but still should not go to work or do their own shopping. Who should be shielding? Shielders face dilemma: Should I go outside or not? New advice for 80,000 people shielding in NI At the start of June,people shielding in England were told they could go out once a day- to meet one person from another household - while maintaining social distancing. This advice is in place until the end of the month. Asked about how the advice might change, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""If you are in the shielded category we will announce very soon what the plans are and we will write to you personally through the NHS so that you can get the direct clinical advice."" It comes after the Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported that England's shielding programme will end at the end of July. The HSJ, which publishes news, analysis and advice for healthcare workers,reported that the announcement would mean,externalfood packages and medicine deliveries for people on the shielding list would also stop. But the government said ""no final decision has yet been made"" about when to end the shielding programme. This video can not be played Primary school teacher Lynne Loomes says shielding has become more challenging as lockdown measures ease ""We've always said we will be looking at making life easier for those having to shield, when it is safe to do so,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are considering the next steps for the shielding programme beyond the end of June, based on the latest medical and scientific advice."" As the UK went into lockdown, people in England considered to be most at risk from Covid-19 were contacted telling them not to leave home and to avoid contact with others. Among thelist of people who should be shielding,externalare solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:The rules as they are now TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Several charities have urged the government to explain the rationale behind ending the programme, if and when the decision is made. Steven McIntosh, policy director at Macmillan Cancer Support, said the communication that the shielded have received ""hasn't been good enough up 'til now"" - and any announcement must make clear why it is safe for people to stop isolating. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that cancer patients Macmillan nurses have spoken to are ""mentally and physically struggling with isolation"" and are facing ""increasing pressure from their employers to return to work, even though it isn't yet safe to do so"". He added that people need to know what will happen if the infection rate begins to go back up. Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said the government must ""do all it can"" to support older people who are worried their employers may be unwilling or unable to let them return to work, ""for fear of being unable to keep them safe"". Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, added: ""There is a real danger that people will face a choice between financial security and their health, and this would be unacceptable... we're concerned the government is taking a one-size-fits-all approach to lifting shielding.""

About 500 staff have been producing parts for ventilators in the AMRC Cymru facility at Airbus's Broughton site in Flintshire. That work is due to stop at the end of this month.

Politicians in Cardiff Bay have paid tribute to the Conservative Senedd member Mohammad Asghar, whodied on Tuesday aged 74. Mr Asghar - the South Wales East member who was known as Oscar - became the Senedd's first ethnic minority member when he was elected in 2007. Senedd members held a minute's silence in memory of him at the start of their virtual session on Wednesday. Paul Davies, Tory group leader in the Welsh Parliament, said he was a man whose life was ""dedicated to enriching and supporting those around him"". He said Mr Asghar had sought to ""widen every possible connection between the ethnic minority groups and this institution"". ""Oscar worked so hard to open the door and invite them in,"" he said. The Welsh government is
âintensely awareâ of the pressure on the tourism sector, Ms Morgan says but added that a second surge of cases in an area of Japan showed it
was necessary to âtread very, very carefullyâ. She
says the Welsh government will be âputting guidance in place that we've worked up
with the industryâ but the support of local communities was also needed. ""Just
to make it clear in relation to tourism, we are intensely aware of the pressure
that is on a sector which is fundamental to the Welsh economy. âWe
are acting sensitively, I hope, in discussing with all of the key actors in the
area, discussing with local authorities, discussing with the key stakeholders
in relation to the tourism sector. âThey
understand that we need to do this carefully and the most important thing is to
see how we can avoid a second peak.â The
first minister will announce the outcome of the fourth lockdown review on
Friday. Children should speak to their friends in Welsh while playing on games consoles to keep up their use of the language, according to the Welsh language minister. Eluned Morgan acknowledged that non-Welsh speaking parents of children who go to Welsh-medium schools were âanxiousâ to ensure they have opportunities to use the language while schools are closed. She said the government had provided online resources to help. âThere's also opportunities for people to use their language, we've seen the Urdd for example undertake a significant digital event, the Eisteddfod T, with thousands of children from Welsh speaking homes and non-Welsh speaking homes were able to use the language. âAnd also I think it's worth just making the point that they have friends, they can speak to their friends in Welsh. âSo I'd encourage them if they are going to be playing on their Xboxes or their PS4s, then there's no reason why they couldn't be chatting to their friends through the medium of Welsh."" The Welsh secretary has been accused of being âreducedâ to lobbying on behalf of the UK government. Simon Hart wrote to council leaders in Wales and members of the Welsh Parliament urging them to encourage the Welsh government to announce plans to reopen the tourism sector. Ms Morgan said: âHe has the right to make his case known but it is an odd situation where the office of the secretary of state for Wales is reduced to being a lobbying outfit for the UK government. âWe will make the decisions based on the scientific evidence and the headroom that is available to us so that we can keep our communities safe in Wales. âWe will do what's right for Wales, when it's right for Wales. Of course we will make every effort to open the sectors that are sensitive in this area at this time, as soon as we possibly can.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Boohoo swoops again to snap up High Street rivals,"Online fashion retailer Boohoo has agreed to buy the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for Â£5.25m. Boohoo made the announcement as it said online sales rose by 45% in the three months to May, partly boosted by demand for athleisure items during lockdown. Manchester-based Boohoo also owns PLT and Nasty Gal. Earlier this year, it bought struggling brands MissPap, Karen Millen and Coast. In April, Oasis and Warehouse went into administration losing 1,800 jobs. The brands were forced to shut their 90 UK stores in March because of the coronavirus lockdown, which also closed its 437 concessions in department stores including Debenhams and Selfridges. Online shoppers had also been unable to place orders with the fashion chains for a number of weeks. Oasis and Warehouse customers have not been able to place orders online for a number of weeks The previous owner had been in talks to sell the businesses before the crisis, but no buyer could be found  for the High Street stores as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated the shift of shoppers to online. The brand and stock were bought by Hilco Capital, which has now sold them on to Boohoo. Boohoo said on Wednesday that the sales of loungewear and ""athleisure"" had done well during lockdown as customers adapted to a ""stay-at-home lifestyle"". Worldwide sales were Â£368m in the quarter to May. In the UK, which accounts for half of its total revenue, sales were up 30% to Â£183m. That came despite an initial slowdown in towards the end of March and early April as the initial impact of the pandemic hit. Boohoo says that its social media strategy and ""flexible supply chain"", largely based in the UK, are what drives its growth, allowing the quick turnaround and promotion of what some have criticised as ""fast fashion"" items. Boohoo competitor Asos has said it had seen a downturn in demand since the Covid-19 outbreak Online retailer, and Boohoo competitor, Asos previously said it had seen a downturn in demand since the Covid-19 outbreak. It has revamped its social media strategy and announced a share sale in April in a bid to turn around its fortunes. On the High Street retailers in the UK were facing a tough environment before the crisis, due to rising costs and changes in people's shopping habits. But the temporary closure of many shops, which have since reopened in England and Northern Ireland, heaped more pressure on retailers. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Boohoo's own latest purchases would need refreshing: ""It's up to Boohoo to rejuvenate [Oasis and Warehouse] and hope they resonate well with its traditionally younger, more fashion forward customer base. ""It's a similar move to the Karen Millen and Coast acquisitions, but while we've heard trading's going well with these additions, we haven't had any numbers to crunch, so it's hard to say what the big picture looks like."" The 22-year-old taking on the gym wear world 'I returned my suits and spent Â£100 on joggers' Boohoo, founded in 2006, sells fashion, beauty and products and shoes aimed at 16 to 24-year-olds. The brand is popular with young women in particular, who it targets with marketing campaigns using Instagram influencers and Love Island contestants. Boohoo bought its Nasty Gal's brand's assets in 2017 for $20m (Â£15m). It was founded by US businesswoman Sophia Amoruso who is widely credited with popularising the term ""girl boss"".

According to research by polling firm YouGov in May,external, 11% of 18 to 24-year-olds had purchased something from Boohoo for themselves in the previous three months.

John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said there could also be more acquisitions to come: ""Boohoo continues to deliver strong results, regardless of the challenges placed in front of it, which highlights the company's flexibility and entrepreneurial drive. ""With excess cash on its balance sheet, you wouldn't rule out further additions in the months ahead as less resilient names struggle in the current retail climate.""

The Manchester United and England forward, 22, persuaded the government to extend the free school meal vouchers scheme in England throughout the summer after he penned an open letter to MPs. The government had previously insisted it would not award vouchers outside term time. In his#maketheUturncampaign, Rashford recalled relying on free school meals and food banks as a boy in Wythenshawe. So what do people there make of his success? Christian Latimer and daughter Mia says the Manchester United star ""stood up for those who need it"" Christian Latimer's six-year-old daughter Mia has benefited from free schools meals during the lockdown. The 27-year-old shop worker praised Rashford for his ""amazing"" campaign. He said: ""He showed great fight and he has achieved so much in helping families who struggle to feed their children. ""Mia had them [free meals] at school and it is a great support and boost for families. ""Marcus has stood up for those who need it,. ""As a United fan I thought he was great before but now he has shown the whole country what sort of a person he is off the pitch. ""I know he visits his old school and gives presents out to the kids. ""He is a great role model."" Former neighbour Anson James says Marcus Rashford ""always had a ball"" Rashford's former neighbours recall him playing football as a boy in front of his house in the Northern Moor area. ""He played out the front all the time with his brother,"" Anson James, 45, said. ""He always had a ball with him. ""People living round here don't have a lot of money so his family would have struggled. ""He is a great credit to the area with everything he has done."" Mike Graham, 51, said Rashford was also given free chicken patties from his favourite Caribbean takeaway J S Rhythm. ""He was so polite that the people who ran it would give him free food now and again as he did not have the money to buy it,"" Mr Graham said. ""He's a smashing lad."" Kate Jenner lives in Rashford's former family home HR worker Kate Jenner, 31, lives in Rashford's old house which she rents from his family. The footballer lived in the semi-detached home from 2006. She said: ""Marcus has been back to the area and the house a few times. What he has done is amazing to stand up for those in poverty and taking on the government. ""He is a credit to the country."" Neighbours recall the England international playing football outside his house The Bideford Community Centre in Wythenshawe has turned into a food hub during lockdown and said volunteers ""leapt up and down"" when they heard the free meals scheme was being extended through the holidays. ""We're over the moon and so proud of Marcus,"" said Kirsty Taylor from the centre. ""This will make such a difference because we really are at crisis point. ""There is a lot of poverty in this area and we have been so worried - it is heartbreaking to see children hungry."" She added: ""We have been making 1,000-1,200 meals a week since the lockdown."" Kerry James, 31, who has used local foodbanks to help feed her two daughters, aged six and nine, said: ""It can be such a struggle to give them food and clothes. ""I've gone hungry so they can eat and it's heartbreaking sometimes when I can't get them all they need."" She added: ""Marcus is a hero that he is fighting for poor families and made the government change [its] mind."" Rashford's former head teacher Emma Roberts at Button Lane Primary School said the footballer was ""a real hero to our children"" and staff were ""really proud"". The school has twice the national average number of pupils eligible for the free school meals. She said some families faced further financial strains with unemployment or reduction in working hours as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Rashford's old football club Fletcher Moss FC also praised their former player. It tweeted his actions show ""how footballers can help their own and other communities"" adding it was ""very proud of him"".

Accuracy of UK illegal immigration data questionedThe National Audit Office said the Home Office has not produced a workable estimate since 2005.UK,"The government has not had an up-to-date estimate of the number of immigrants in the UK illegally in 15 years, according to a report. The last official estimate in 2005 found about 430,000 people were in the country with no legal right to remain. But independent research since then has put the figure at over a million, the National Audit Office said. The Home Office said it worked ""tirelessly"" with other departments and partners to tackle illegal migration. Meg Hillier, from Parliament's financial watchdog, said it appeared the Home Office had ""no idea"" how many people were in the UK illegally. The Labour MP, who chairs the public accounts committee, added the department ""doesn't seem interested in finding out"". Are there 800,000 illegal immigrants in the UK? Five migrant boats intercepted in Channel The report found that the Home Office put demand for its immigration enforcement services at between 240,000 and 320,000 cases per year. But the NAO said this figure excluded those who had no contact with government in the previous two years, and ""does not yet provide a baseline"" to measure the effectiveness of the department's enforcement action. ""Due to data quality issues, Immigration Enforcement cannot say whether the number of people 'genuinely putting a demand' on its activities is increasing or decreasing,"" it found. It suggested the Home Office should look at how other parts of government come up with estimates of ""hidden activity"" such as serious and organised crime, which it said could help to ""improve its understanding of the full scale of the illegal population in the UK"". The highest estimate of the illegal population in the UK is 1.2m, given by the Pew Research Centre last year - although the NAO said it had not attempted to verify the number. The NAO suggested the Home Office could learn from other parts of government. The NAO also found that voluntary and enforced returns of people living the UK illegally had ""fallen dramatically"" since 2015. Voluntary returns had reduced from an average of 1,200 a month in 2015 to approximately 460 a month in 2019, the watchdog said - although the number of foreign criminals departed had ""remained more stable"". In their2019 election manifesto,external, the Conservative Party pledged to ""keep track of who is coming in and out of our country"". Garth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: ""While the Home Office has introduced significant changes to its enforcement activity, it cannot demonstrate that overall performance is improving. ""The department needs a better understanding of the impact of its immigration enforcement activity on its overarching vision to reduce the size of the illegal population and the harm it causes."" A spokesman from the Home Office said it was working ""tirelessly... to tackle illegal migration, close down routes for people smuggling and return those with no right to remain the UK wherever possible"". He added: ""We have taken back control of our immigration system and for the first time in a generation, we will have full control over who comes and stays here.""

Voluntary returns had reduced from an average of 1,200 a month in 2015 to approximately 460 a month in 2019, the watchdog said - although the number of foreign criminals departed had ""remained more stable"". In their2019 election manifesto,external, the Conservative Party pledged to ""keep track of who is coming in and out of our country"". Garth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: ""While the Home Office has introduced significant changes to its enforcement activity, it cannot demonstrate that overall performance is improving. ""The department needs a better understanding of the impact of its immigration enforcement activity on its overarching vision to reduce the size of the illegal population and the harm it causes."" A spokesman from the Home Office said it was working ""tirelessly... to tackle illegal migration, close down routes for people smuggling and return those with no right to remain the UK wherever possible"". He added: ""We have taken back control of our immigration system and for the first time in a generation, we will have full control over who comes and stays here.""

Record fuel price slump pushes down UK inflation,"A record fall in fuel prices, including petrol, pushed the UK's inflation rate down to 0.5% in May, the second full month of the coronavirus lockdown. Fuel prices declined by 16.7% during the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, dragging the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to the lowest level since June 2016. Clothing and footwear prices also fell. Supermarkets were among the few shops allowed to open in May and food prices rose, the ONS said. May's inflation rate was down from 0.8% in April, the first full month of the pandemic lockdown. Clothing and footwear prices fell 3.1% amid heavy discounting. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It's one of the key measures of financial wellbeing because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. It's expressed as a percentage increase or decrease in prices over time. For example, if the inflation rate for the cost of a litre of petrol is 2% a year, motorists need to spend 2% more at the pump than 12 months earlier. And if wages don't keep up with inflation, purchasing power and the standard of living falls. What is the inflation rate? ""The growth in consumer prices again slowed to the lowest annual rate in four years,"" said ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow. ""The cost of games and toys fell back from last month's rises, while there was a continued drop in prices at the pump in May, following the huge crude price falls seen in recent months. ""Outside these areas, we are seeing few significant changes to the prices in the shops."" The ONS admitted that it had difficulty compiling inflation statistics for May, since many areas of the economy were completely shut down. For instance, inflation figures for holidays had had to be ""imputed"", it said. Separate figures issued by the ONS on Tuesday showed that in the three months to April, workers' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew at an annual rate of 1.7%, the weakest since January 2015. However, when measured against the comparable three-monthly inflation rate, that means pay growth is continuing to outstrip inflation. CPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Inflation is one of the main factors that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the ""base rate"". That influences what interest rates banks can charge people to borrow money, or what they pay on their savings. Interest rates are currently at 0.1%, the lowest level in the Bank's 325-year history. ""May's further fall in inflation is probably only the beginnings of a prolonged period of very soft price pressure,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. He added that MPC members were expected to opt for more stimulus measures to boost the economy at their policy meeting on Thursday. Rising prices are certainly not something Cristina Bruzzolo needs to worry about the moment. She owns Colibri Boutique, a high-end women's clothes shop in north London. Monthly sales would normally be about Â£40,000, but have fallen to about Â£10,000, she says. ""We were hurt, but we are managing to cover our costs."" Ms Bruzzolo has been discounting by a hefty 20%-30%. She's had to be inventive in order to make sales, including using Zoom video calls to show customers clothes and then take items to their homes so they can try before they buy. ""The stock for this season has already been paid for,"" she said. ""I need to generate cash flow to pay for next summer's stock."" But Ms Bruzzolo is expecting another big sales hit in the autumn when the furlough scheme ends and, she fears, many people are made redundant. Nevertheless, while Ms Bruzzolo is pessimistic about the near term, she's optimistic about the long-term future. ""It's going to be a very tough year, probably even two years,"" she says. But she's survived previous downturns and believes that, with good cost-control and some good luck, she'll survive this one. ""I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" she says.

Hancock responds to coronavirus questions,"Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer face each other at PMQs Keir Starmer accused the PM of ""inaction"" on child poverty Matt Hancock tells MPs virus drug breakthrough will be ""life saving"" Doctors call for regular virus testing of NHS staff Low fuel costs pushes down UK inflation Facebook to let users turn off political advertising England's county councils warn of cuts to services Kate Whannel, Brian Wheeler and Paul Seddon PM emerges from No 10 earlier as he left for PMQs Thanks for following along with us today. You can scroll back on this feed to catch up on all the questions put to the prime minister at this week's PMQs. We'll be back on theBBC's Coronavirus Live Pagefrom 17:00 BST for our rolling coverage of the government's daily briefing at Downing Street. Do join us there... and we hope you'll be back here with us again next week. We're going to pause our live text coverage of the Commons today. Before we go, here's a quick recap of the main points from this week's PMQs: House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Chris Bryant highlights that there has been a ""significant increase"" in the number of cycling accidents during the coronavirus lockdown, resulting in head injuries in particular to children not wearing helmets. He also says that with more people out in the sun, there is an increased risk of future skin cancers. Matt Hancock says that he will write to him about what can be done in both areas. House of CommonsParliament Matt Hancock has apologised to England forward Marcus Rashford for getting his name wrong earlier today. The health secretary referred to the footballer as ""Daniel Rashford"" in an interview with Sky News this morning. Mr Hancock explains that he was reading a 'Harry Potter' book to his son last night, and it must have ""stuck in my mind"". But he goes on to praise the star's ""brilliant"" campaign - which prompted the government toextend a free school voucher schemeyesterday. House of CommonsParliament SNP health and care spokesperson Philippa Whitford welcomes the positive outcome of the drug trials. She uses her question to ask why a Â£108m contract to provide PPE was awarded, without being advertised, to a small pest extermination company. ""Why was such a large contract awarded to a company with no expertise in supply large quantities of PPE,"" she asks. ""We have enhanced the supplies of PPE across the whole of the UK,"" replies Matt Hancock. He acknowledges it ""was difficult"" at the beginning but says the government has made ""huge strides"" in the area. House of CommonsParliament Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth also says he welcomes the
news about the new treatment for the virus. The Labour MP says that student nurses who have volunteered to
work in the NHS are now seeing their paid contracts finish. He adds this has left them ""with no income"". He calls for ministers to make sure further easing of the lockdown does not bring a ""deadly"" second wave of the virus. Matt Hancock says, the government will move ""carefully and cautiously"" in easing lockdown restrictions and adds that all measures of the disease are moving down, in the right direction. ""We are winning the battle against this disease"", he says. House of CommonsParliament Mr Hancock tells MPs that clinical trials are ongoing for a further nine drug treatments for coronavirus. He also updates them that, as of yesterday, over 592,000 people have had an NHS test to see if they have antibodies against the virus. He says this will inform work towards how a potential vaccine should be deployed. House of CommonsParliament With PMQs over, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is now responding to an urgent question on coronavirus. He says news yesterday about alow-dose steroid treatmentfor the virus shows British science is the ""best in the world"". He says the research ""breakthrough"" will be ""life-saving"" - and there are now 240,000 doses ""in stock and on order"". ""This is an important moment in the fight against this virus,"" he adds. House of CommonsParliament The prime minister ends the session in high spirits, as he claims EU laws are to blame for a ""loophole"" allowing meat to be labelled as being from the UK, if it is packaged there. Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmicheal says the rule is harming the beef farmers in his Orkney and Shetland constituency and asks if it can be changed in future trade negotiations. Reality Check Earlier, Conservative MP Lia Nici asked the
prime minister if he agrees that âtaking back control of our fishing waters in
January 2021"" will benefit fishermen in her Great Grimsby
constituency. Fishing rights are a sticking
point in the UKâs negotiations with the European Union for a post-Brexit trade deal. One of the disagreements is that
the EU wants to make access to European markets for fish caught by British
boats dependent on European fishermen having access to UK waters. But the UK
rejects that link - read morehere. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Jeremy Wright - a member of the committee on standards in public life - urges the prime minister to push ahead with promised legislation to curb ""online harms"". Mr Johnson says ""we are working at pace"" on new legislation, adding that during lockdown ""terrible things have been going on behind closed doors. closed curtains, in this country on the internet"".  House of CommonsParliament Labour's Stephen Timms says a million people have ""no recourse to public funds"" and points to the PM's previous comments that such hard working families should have help. He asks the PM to deliver help by suspending ""no recourse to public funds"" so people can have access support - including the free schools vouchers during the summer holidays. ""Of course they should be eligible for those,"" Boris Johnson replies. He adds that those with ""no recourse to public funds"" do have access to other support schemes. Mr Timms previously raised the issue with the PM when he appeared in front of the Commons Liaison Committee. Reality Check Conservative MP Rob Butler asked the prime minister whether social distancing may be reduced from two metres. The World Health Organization
recommends keeping a distance of at least one metre. China, Denmark, France, Hong Kong,
Lithuania and Singapore also set the distance at one metre. The UK, along with Canada and
Spain, sets the distance at two metres. Itâs also reported that
bars and restaurants in Irelandmay be allowedto reduce the distance to one
metre for a maximum of 90 minutes. You can read more about the two
metre rulehere. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Chris Matheson asks the PM to confirm that he, nor any of his advisers had any correspondence with the housing secretary about the Westferry development. The MP also asks if the government will publish all correspondence relating to the matter. The PM says he hasn't had any discussions on the matter and adds ""nor as far as I am aware have any of my officials"". Read the background on the Westferry development here.

House of CommonsParliament Acting Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says tens of thousands of business face
bankruptcy due to the coronavirus. He urges the PM to ""show some good old fashioned British common sense"" and extend the transition period for negotiating Brexit. ""The people of this country are heartily sick of going on
about Brexit,"" says the PM. ""We got it done, time to move forward."" House of CommonsParliament SNP Westminster lead SNP Ian Blackford urges the prime minister to uplift the child element of Universal Credit by an extra Â£20 a week to prevent millions of families ""from having to make choice between paying their bills and feeding their children"". Boris Johnson says the government has done ""everything we possibly can"" to help families in need - and points to a previous rise in universal credit. Mr Blackford says the PM is ""more interested in spending money on his own vanity project for a luxury VIP plane"".

NZ military put in charge of quarantines,"Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden urges people not to watch football matches together The Premier League returns on Wednesday evening in empty stadiums A life-saving coronavirus treatment has gone into use across the UK Dexamethasone is a cheap, widely available steroid that reduces deaths among seriously ill patients New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern orders the military to oversee the country's quarantine and border operations Any visitors for Russian President Vladimir Putin must pass through a special disinfection tunnel, state media report Brazil reports almost 35,000 new cases - its highest daily figure Globally, there have been 8.1m confirmed cases since the outbreak began, and 441,000 deaths Martha Buckley So that's the end of our live page coverage for Wednesday. Thanks for joining us. Here are the people who contributed to the page today. Saira Asher, Yvette Tan, Krutika Pathi, Josh Cheetham,  Mary O'Connor, Paulin Kola, Patrick Jackson, Gavin Stamp. Paul Seddon, Claire Heald, Gary Kitchener, Georgina Rannard, Martha Buckley, Max Matza and George Bowden Be sure to join us again tomorrow. And as we wind down our live page, hereâs a round-up of some of the biggest stories in the UK: We will shortly be pausing our live coverage. Today there were signs of the pandemic worsening in Latin America, and localised infections are causing concern in some countries where the virus is largely considered to be under control. The top stories on Wednesday: The US opens up After two months at home - two months of virtual happy hours, socially distanced hangouts, and learning when to unmute yourself on Zoom - all 50 US states and the District of Columbia have begun the process of reopening. For some, that means the first face-to-face interactions with friends and family outside of their household in weeks. But how do you navigate the risks? Is sharing snacks okay? And is the briefest of hugs acceptable?Find out here. We reported earlier that Honduran President Juan
Orlando Hernandez had announced he and his wife had tested positive for Covid-19. The president was later taken to hospital and is now being treated for pneumonia, Reuters quotes Francis Contreras, a spokesman for Honduran health agency Sinager, as saying. He said the president was on an intravenous drip but was generally in good heath. Mr Hernandez tweeted that he felt good and appreciated all the support he had received. The Latin American nation has registered just under 10,000 Covid-19 infections and 330 deaths. The Premier League has finally returned.There were no fans. But then there were no goals either. Aston Villa and Sheffield United drew 0-0 at Villa Park after a 100-day hiatus. There was a moment's silence observed to remember all those who have died in the coronavirus outbreak, including the father of Villa manager Dean Smith. The players and match officials also all took a knee to mark the death of African American George Floyd in the US, and the players' names were replaced with the words Black Lives Matter.  An NHS nurse who spent 75 days as a coronavirus patient at the hospital where he works has recovered and left amid clapping from colleagues. Felix Khor, 68, spent 45 days in the intensive care ward at Southend Hospital in Essex, where he has worked for 15 years, and was put on a ventilator. He then spent several weeks on a different ward. He was admitted to hospital in early April and was discharged on Monday. Read his story here. Outbreaks of infection have been recorded at a number of slaughterhouses in Germany and worldwide Earlier we reported that 400 workers at a slaughterhouse in GÃ¼tersloh in western Germany had tested positive since Monday. Now some 7,000 people have been told to go into quarantine. Employees' families will have to isolate themselves and schools and nurseries in the area have been closed. The abattoir has also been temporarily shut. A number of abattoirs in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have been hit by Covid-19. They often rely on migrant labour. Some face allegations that poor working conditions and cramped accommodation facilitate the spread of the virus. Germany has had nearly 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, which is significantly less than some other western European countries, including the UK, France and Italy. More than 1,500 UK paediatricians have signed a letter to the prime minister calling for clear plans for getting children back into school. They say the absence of millions of children from schools ""risks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people"". Their concerns centre on the mental and physical health of children who have missed many months of education. Plans for schools reopening have been published in Scotland and Wales. The letter from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,externalcalls on the UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive to follow suit. Read aboutwhat they have to say here. A UK health says the country's coronavirus contact tracing app will be now ready ""before the winter"". Lord Bethell, the minister for innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care, said he was unable to give a date for its launch - adding that the application was ""not a priority"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergsaid,externalthe comments appeared to contradict statementsmade by ministers in the recent past. Read morehere. Financial pressure on the UK government due to the coronavirus outbreak has prompted more speculation over the level of future rises in the state pension. At the moment, pensioners are guaranteed rising payments through a so-called ""triple lock"". Pensions rise each year by a rate of inflation, the increase in average wages or 2.5% - whichever is highest. But with the coronavirus furlough scheme picking up 80% of millions of wages until it ends in October, next year's average wage rise will be as high as 18%. Will the government scrap the triple lock, will it postpone it, or are pensioners in line for a bumper increase? Read morehere. Around 2.8 million pints of out-of-date beer will need to be disposed of from Wales's shut pubs and clubs, the Campaign for Real Ale has estimated. But ""highly polluting"" beer ""poses a significant environmental risk"" according to Natural Resources Wales. Welsh Water says it will work with businesses ""to agree how and when the drinks can be disposed of"". But an opposition politician warned that the company was not used to dealing with such a volume of old beer. Wales's 3,500 pubs and clubs - along with cafes and restaurants - have been closed since 20 March. Read more here. Chile has announced a stricter lockdown in its capital after Covid-19 infections nationwide soared past 200,000. Chile is one of the worst affected nations in South America and Santiago has been badly hit. Residents of Santiago now face what has been termed ""maximum"" restrictions on movement. The infection rate nationwide rose to 220,628, the health ministry said, after 31,412 previously unconfirmed cases were added to 4,757 new ones. Chile has also recorded 3,383 deaths. In a joint ministerial briefing, officials said residents of Santiago would be
granted permission to leave their homes just twice a week
instead of five times. This is despite lockdowns lasting three months having already been in place in some parts of the capital. Lockdowns in Santiago have not halted the spread The return to Premier League football is having a poignant start. When the game began at Villa, players, officials and staff took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. When referee Michael Oliver blew the whistle for kick-off, he and his
officials joined all the players in kneeling for around 10 seconds to protest against racial injustice and to stand in support of others after the death of George Floyd in the US. All players warmed up in
Black Lives Matters t-shirts, with their names on the back of the match shirts
replaced with the same message. Games are being played behind closed doors because of the pandemic, with few journalists, officials and ground staff spaced out in the quiet stadium. Instead of crowd noise there is just the chat and commotion of the players, managers and officials. At the UK government daily briefing earlier, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned fans to watch the game at home, rather than meet up and spread the virus. Even the goalposts were disinfected before the match Seats remained empty, but shirts were filled with 'Black Lives Matter' Oktoberfest - the world's largest beer celebration - is normally held in September and October but this year's festivities were cancelled in April Germany has extended a ban on large gatherings until at least the end of October, Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced. The number of new coronavirus infections has stabilised at a low level, she said, but people should continue social distancing and wear masks, report German media. The ban could affect events including the Frankfurt book fair, which attracts around 300,000 visitors and which organisers had said until now was going ahead, plus of course large sports events. Rules on gathering size vary across Germany's states. Before the new announcement was made, for example, Berlin's rules allowed up to 200 people to gather for outdoor events until 16 June, increasing to 500 from 16 June and to 1,000 from 30 June. Schools will also return to normal after the summer holidays, Merkel added, after speaking with the leaders of Germany's 16 states in Berlin on Wednesday.  We reported yesterday on dexamethasone, the cheap and widely available drug thatcan help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. Today, the World Health Organization issued some cautions, stressing that the steroid should only be used under medical supervision and that it should be reserved for exceptionally ill patients. It also cautions there is no evidence it could prevent infection, or treat milder illness. The head of the WHO's emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, said: ""It is exceptionally important in this case, that the drug is reserved for use in severely ill and critical patients who can benefit from this drug clearly."" Some doctors also want to see more data, citing possible side-effects. A major trial in the UK showed the drug cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth. Read more about dexamethasonehere. Campaigners have called on the government to make pet theft a specific offence after instances of the crime ""went through the roof"" in lockdown. Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine, told MPs dog prices ""went up and up"" during lockdown and cases of theft increased. She joined others to tell MPs tougher penalties were needed to deter thieves. The government has said it is already an offence under the Theft Act 1968, with a maximum penalty of seven years. But campaigners complain those who steal animals can currently be punished in the same way as someone who steals a mobile phone or a laptop, as pets are classed simply as ""property"" under the act. Read more here. The Eiffel Tower is visited by around seven million people each year The Eiffel Tower in Paris, one of Franceâs most visited landmarks, will reopen to visitors next week. Tourism officials plan to start by limiting the number of visitors to the tower, following its longest closure since World War Two. Only the first and second floors will be accessible to visitors, and lifts will remain closed in the first stage of reopening. All surfaces in well-travelled areas will be cleaned every two hours, and all visitors over the age of 11 will be required to wear masks. A full reopening is expected by 25 June. The tower normally receives around seven million visitors per year, but France's tourism industry has been hit hard after a lockdown was imposed in March. Lifts will be closed at first, forcing visitors to hike up the stairs Reality Check Earlier, at the UK government briefing, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden was asked about when more public
toilets will reopen, to avoid parks and streets turning into âcesspitsâ. Management of public toilets is a council issue, meaning local
government will decide when the 4,500 plus council-run toilets in the UK can reopen
to the public. Additionally, public toilets run by private companies in places
like shopping centres will reopen when those companies think it is safe to do
so. The government has âstrongly encouragedâ the reopening of toilets
with appropriate social distancing measures such as a bigger gap between
urinals and electric hand dryers. A number of popular destinations have already reopened all or some
of their toilets including Brighton, North Norfolk, Cornwall and Blackpool. The
National Trust and Royal Parks have also reopened some of their toilets. If you are visiting somewhere and are concerned about access to
toilets, local council websites are supplying information on which ones have
now reopened. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world A woman in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg has been fined for writing on Facebook that her local hospital was avoiding diagnosing patients with coronavirus, according to Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. ""The hospital is packed, people are dying in their masses, everyone
is being diagnosed with 'pneumonia'. They put him in a corridor,"" Tatiana Znak wrote, describing the death of a family friend. The court found she has misrepresented the situation and insisted that no-one had died of the disease there. Znak was fined 15,000 roubles (about $200). Her lawyer says she will appeal against the decision, saying ""we will go to
the European Court of Human Rights if need be"". Russia has the third-highest number of cases in the world (552,549) and 7,468 deaths, according to official figures. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

The abattoir has also been temporarily shut. A number of abattoirs in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have been hit by Covid-19. They often rely on migrant labour. Some face allegations that poor working conditions and cramped accommodation facilitate the spread of the virus. Germany has had nearly 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, which is significantly less than some other western European countries, including the UK, France and Italy. More than 1,500 UK paediatricians have signed a letter to the prime minister calling for clear plans for getting children back into school. They say the absence of millions of children from schools ""risks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people"". Their concerns centre on the mental and physical health of children who have missed many months of education. Plans for schools reopening have been published in Scotland and Wales. The letter from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,externalcalls on the UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive to follow suit. Read aboutwhat they have to say here. A UK health says the country's coronavirus contact tracing app will be now ready ""before the winter"". Lord Bethell, the minister for innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care, said he was unable to give a date for its launch - adding that the application was ""not a priority"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergsaid,externalthe comments appeared to contradict statementsmade by ministers in the recent past. Read morehere. Financial pressure on the UK government due to the coronavirus outbreak has prompted more speculation over the level of future rises in the state pension. At the moment, pensioners are guaranteed rising payments through a so-called ""triple lock"". Pensions rise each year by a rate of inflation, the increase in average wages or 2.5% - whichever is highest. But with the coronavirus furlough scheme picking up 80% of millions of wages until it ends in October, next year's average wage rise will be as high as 18%. Will the government scrap the triple lock, will it postpone it, or are pensioners in line for a bumper increase? Read morehere. Around 2.8 million pints of out-of-date beer will need to be disposed of from Wales's shut pubs and clubs, the Campaign for Real Ale has estimated. But ""highly polluting"" beer ""poses a significant environmental risk"" according to Natural Resources Wales. Welsh Water says it will work with businesses ""to agree how and when the drinks can be disposed of"". But an opposition politician warned that the company was not used to dealing with such a volume of old beer. Wales's 3,500 pubs and clubs - along with cafes and restaurants - have been closed since 20 March. Read more here. Chile has announced a stricter lockdown in its capital after Covid-19 infections nationwide soared past 200,000. Chile is one of the worst affected nations in South America and Santiago has been badly hit. Residents of Santiago now face what has been termed ""maximum"" restrictions on movement. The infection rate nationwide rose to 220,628, the health ministry said, after 31,412 previously unconfirmed cases were added to 4,757 new ones. Chile has also recorded 3,383 deaths. In a joint ministerial briefing, officials said residents of Santiago would be
granted permission to leave their homes just twice a week
instead of five times. This is despite lockdowns lasting three months having already been in place in some parts of the capital. Lockdowns in Santiago have not halted the spread The return to Premier League football is having a poignant start. When the game began at Villa, players, officials and staff took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. When referee Michael Oliver blew the whistle for kick-off, he and his
officials joined all the players in kneeling for around 10 seconds to protest against racial injustice and to stand in support of others after the death of George Floyd in the US. All players warmed up in
Black Lives Matters t-shirts, with their names on the back of the match shirts
replaced with the same message. Games are being played behind closed doors because of the pandemic, with few journalists, officials and ground staff spaced out in the quiet stadium. Instead of crowd noise there is just the chat and commotion of the players, managers and officials. At the UK government daily briefing earlier, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned fans to watch the game at home, rather than meet up and spread the virus. Even the goalposts were disinfected before the match Seats remained empty, but shirts were filled with 'Black Lives Matter' Oktoberfest - the world's largest beer celebration - is normally held in September and October but this year's festivities were cancelled in April Germany has extended a ban on large gatherings until at least the end of October, Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced. The number of new coronavirus infections has stabilised at a low level, she said, but people should continue social distancing and wear masks, report German media. The ban could affect events including the Frankfurt book fair, which attracts around 300,000 visitors and which organisers had said until now was going ahead, plus of course large sports events. Rules on gathering size vary across Germany's states. Before the new announcement was made, for example, Berlin's rules allowed up to 200 people to gather for outdoor events until 16 June, increasing to 500 from 16 June and to 1,000 from 30 June. Schools will also return to normal after the summer holidays, Merkel added, after speaking with the leaders of Germany's 16 states in Berlin on Wednesday.  We reported yesterday on dexamethasone, the cheap and widely available drug thatcan help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. Today, the World Health Organization issued some cautions, stressing that the steroid should only be used under medical supervision and that it should be reserved for exceptionally ill patients. It also cautions there is no evidence it could prevent infection, or treat milder illness. The head of the WHO's emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, said: ""It is exceptionally important in this case, that the drug is reserved for use in severely ill and critical patients who can benefit from this drug clearly."" Some doctors also want to see more data, citing possible side-effects. A major trial in the UK showed the drug cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth. Read more about dexamethasonehere. Campaigners have called on the government to make pet theft a specific offence after instances of the crime ""went through the roof"" in lockdown. Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine, told MPs dog prices ""went up and up"" during lockdown and cases of theft increased. She joined others to tell MPs tougher penalties were needed to deter thieves. The government has said it is already an offence under the Theft Act 1968, with a maximum penalty of seven years. But campaigners complain those who steal animals can currently be punished in the same way as someone who steals a mobile phone or a laptop, as pets are classed simply as ""property"" under the act.

Tourism officials plan to start by limiting the number of visitors to the tower, following its longest closure since World War Two. Only the first and second floors will be accessible to visitors, and lifts will remain closed in the first stage of reopening. All surfaces in well-travelled areas will be cleaned every two hours, and all visitors over the age of 11 will be required to wear masks. A full reopening is expected by 25 June. The tower normally receives around seven million visitors per year, but France's tourism industry has been hit hard after a lockdown was imposed in March. Lifts will be closed at first, forcing visitors to hike up the stairs Reality Check Earlier, at the UK government briefing, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden was asked about when more public
toilets will reopen, to avoid parks and streets turning into âcesspitsâ. Management of public toilets is a council issue, meaning local
government will decide when the 4,500 plus council-run toilets in the UK can reopen
to the public. Additionally, public toilets run by private companies in places
like shopping centres will reopen when those companies think it is safe to do
so. The government has âstrongly encouragedâ the reopening of toilets
with appropriate social distancing measures such as a bigger gap between
urinals and electric hand dryers. A number of popular destinations have already reopened all or some
of their toilets including Brighton, North Norfolk, Cornwall and Blackpool. The
National Trust and Royal Parks have also reopened some of their toilets. If you are visiting somewhere and are concerned about access to
toilets, local council websites are supplying information on which ones have
now reopened. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world A woman in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg has been fined for writing on Facebook that her local hospital was avoiding diagnosing patients with coronavirus, according to Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. ""The hospital is packed, people are dying in their masses, everyone
is being diagnosed with 'pneumonia'. They put him in a corridor,"" Tatiana Znak wrote, describing the death of a family friend. The court found she has misrepresented the situation and insisted that no-one had died of the disease there. Znak was fined 15,000 roubles (about $200). Her lawyer says she will appeal against the decision, saying ""we will go to
the European Court of Human Rights if need be"". Russia has the third-highest number of cases in the world (552,549) and 7,468 deaths, according to official figures. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Beijing stops travel as virus spike continues,"People queuing for a nucleic acid test on Wednesday - most people need a negative test before leaving the city, while others are banned entirely Millions of people in Beijing are living under renewed restrictions, as a spike in virus cases continues. The city reported another 31 cases on Wednesday, bringing the total to 137 in the past week. Before the recent spike, the Chinese capital had gone 57 days without a locally-transmitted case. The outbreak is believed to have started in the massive Xinfadi food market that supplies 80% of the city's meat and vegetables. At least 27 neighbourhoods have been classed as medium risk and one neighbourhood, near the market, is high risk. People in medium or high-risk areas cannot leave the city. People in low-risk areas can leave, but need to test negative first. However, getting a test is difficult - three testing stations told the BBC there were no tests available until July. Queues were seen outside other centres. More than 1,200 flights have been cancelled to and from the city and railway services have been reduced until at least 9 July. Primary school, middle school, and college classes are suspended, sports teams cannot play, and swimming pools and gyms are closed. However, roads are open, and companies and factories can still work. The city is on a ""level two"" alert, the second-highest. Restaurants, sport, packed trains, even the pubâ¦ there we were, basking in the glory of ""normal-ish"" life in Beijing, after more than 50 days without an infection. Then: bam! The market outbreak has dragged us back into a virus prevention bubble. In effect, it's very hard to leave Beijing right now. If you haven't done a test in the past week your departure is not allowed, and limited testing capacity is, understandably, being diverted to ""high risk"" groups. The airlines know this. That's why they've cancelled 1,255 flights in and out of the capital on Wednesday so far. For the moment, the authorities are managing Beijing districts almost like cities within the city, imposing strict measures where needed in the hope that they can control it. However, this is touching everyone's movements. The main difference between now and February is that businesses, government departments, manufacturing are all still operating. Perhaps because of this, there seems to be a general confidence that the cluster will be controlled - before becoming a full-blown second wave.

"Record fuel price slump pushes down UK inflationFuel costs fell sharply in May, pushing the inflation rate down to a fresh four-year low of 0.5%.","A record fall in fuel prices, including petrol, pushed the UK's inflation rate down to 0.5% in May, the second full month of the coronavirus lockdown. Fuel prices declined by 16.7% during the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, dragging the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to the lowest level since June 2016. Clothing and footwear prices also fell. Supermarkets were among the few shops allowed to open in May and food prices rose, the ONS said. May's inflation rate was down from 0.8% in April, the first full month of the pandemic lockdown. Clothing and footwear prices fell 3.1% amid heavy discounting. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It's one of the key measures of financial wellbeing because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. It's expressed as a percentage increase or decrease in prices over time. For example, if the inflation rate for the cost of a litre of petrol is 2% a year, motorists need to spend 2% more at the pump than 12 months earlier. And if wages don't keep up with inflation, purchasing power and the standard of living falls. What is the inflation rate? ""The growth in consumer prices again slowed to the lowest annual rate in four years,"" said ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow. ""The cost of games and toys fell back from last month's rises, while there was a continued drop in prices at the pump in May, following the huge crude price falls seen in recent months. ""Outside these areas, we are seeing few significant changes to the prices in the shops."" The ONS admitted that it had difficulty compiling inflation statistics for May, since many areas of the economy were completely shut down. For instance, inflation figures for holidays had had to be ""imputed"", it said. Separate figures issued by the ONS on Tuesday showed that in the three months to April, workers' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew at an annual rate of 1.7%, the weakest since January 2015. However, when measured against the comparable three-monthly inflation rate, that means pay growth is continuing to outstrip inflation. CPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Inflation is one of the main factors that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the ""base rate"". That influences what interest rates banks can charge people to borrow money, or what they pay on their savings. Interest rates are currently at 0.1%, the lowest level in the Bank's 325-year history. ""May's further fall in inflation is probably only the beginnings of a prolonged period of very soft price pressure,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. He added that MPC members were expected to opt for more stimulus measures to boost the economy at their policy meeting on Thursday. Rising prices are certainly not something Cristina Bruzzolo needs to worry about the moment. She owns Colibri Boutique, a high-end women's clothes shop in north London. Monthly sales would normally be about Â£40,000, but have fallen to about Â£10,000, she says. ""We were hurt, but we are managing to cover our costs."" Ms Bruzzolo has been discounting by a hefty 20%-30%. She's had to be inventive in order to make sales, including using Zoom video calls to show customers clothes and then take items to their homes so they can try before they buy. ""The stock for this season has already been paid for,"" she said. ""I need to generate cash flow to pay for next summer's stock."" But Ms Bruzzolo is expecting another big sales hit in the autumn when the furlough scheme ends and, she fears, many people are made redundant. Nevertheless, while Ms Bruzzolo is pessimistic about the near term, she's optimistic about the long-term future. ""It's going to be a very tough year, probably even two years,"" she says. But she's survived previous downturns and believes that, with good cost-control and some good luck, she'll survive this one. ""I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" she says.

The Premier League returns - all you need to know,"Liverpool (led by Jurgen Klopp, centre) could win the Premier League in their first game back The Premier League returns on Wednesday... but not exactly as we know it. After a 100-day absence because of the coronavirus pandemic, Aston Villa v Sheffield United will kick off the English top-flight's resumption. It is the first of 92 league games that will be packed into a frantic 40 days before the season concludes on 26 July. Fixtures will be played behind closed doors as one of a host of measures to prevent any further cases of the virus. A minute's silence to remember those who have died with coronaviruswill be held before the first matches, while heart-shaped badges in tribute to frontline NHS staff will also be worn on kits. For the first 12 matches of the restarted campaign, allplayer names on the back of shirts will be replaced by ""Black Lives Matter"". This followsthe death of George Floyd in the United States,which has sparked protests worldwide. Over eight rounds of twice-weekly coronavirus screenings of Premier League players and staff, there have been16 positive results from 8,687 tests.,external All remaining 92 games will be broadcast live, with four matches to be shown on the BBC - the first to be made free-to-air on terrestrial television since the Premier League's inception in 1992. Liverpool sit 25 points clear at the top of the table while Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Norwich City are in the relegation places. The Reds, chasing a first league title in 30 years, could clinch it with victory in their first game back should second-placed Manchester City lose to Arsenal on Wednesday.

With the number of new infections falling and lockdown restrictions in England being gradually eased, thePremier League agreed it was safe to resume with the correct safety measures in place. This was followed by theUK government giving the go-aheadfor elite competitive sport to resume behind closed doors from 1 June. Clubs unanimously voted toresume contact trainingin the final week of May, having started non-contact training the previous week as part of Project Restart. Premier League players and staff will continue to be tested twice a week, with any players or staff who test positive self-isolating for a period of seven days. Thedelaying of Euro 2020 by a yearprovided the Premier League with greater flexibility in which to fit in fixtures. But there remains a time pressure imposed by issues with players' contracts, many of which run out on 30 June, and the scheduled start of the 2020-21 season in August. There is also a financial incentive to resume playing, with thethreat of an increased or restructured rebate to TV companies if fixtures are not completed.

Aston Villa will face Sheffield United in the opening match at 18:00 BST on Wednesday, before Manchester City host Arsenal later the same evening. The first full round of fixtures will then be played over the weekend. For the full list of Premier League fixtures,click here. All remaining 92 Premier League games will be broadcast liveon Sky Sports, BT Sport, BBC Sport or Amazon Prime. The BBC will show Bournemouth v Crystal Palace on 20 June at 19:45 BST, followed by Norwich v Everton on 24 June at 18:00, and then two matches yet to be confirmed. As well as the four live games, there will be additional Match of the Day highlights programmes. Sky Sports will make 25 of the remaining top-flight matches free to air, including the Merseyside derby at 19:00 on 21 June. Amazon Prime's four matches will also be broadcast for free.

This video can not be played What Match of the Day looked like the last time BBC broadcast the top flight in 1988 All matches behind closed doors, with number of key people allowed inside the stadium limited to 300. Stadiums divided into three zones - red (includes pitch and technical areas), amber (stands) and green (stand concourses) - with restrictions on who is allowed to enter each. Teamsable to make five substitutions,rather than three, in each match and able to name nine substitutes instead of the usual seven. Staggered entry on to pitch for players and staff and no handshakes before kick-off. Deep cleaning of corner flags, goalposts, substitution boards and match balls before and after each fixture. Extra disinfection, such as of the substitution board after it is used, likely during matches and at half-time. Medical protocols stipulate how squads and coaching staff must travel to and from games, observing social distancing. Post-match broadcast interviews will take place pitchside with press conferences conducted virtually. VAR will continue to be in operation. Before the suspension of play in the Premier League, Liverpool were hurtling towards their first top-flight title in 30 years. The league will restart with the Reds 25 points clear at the top and potentially one win away from confirming their triumph. If Manchester City lose their game in hand - against Arsenal on Wednesday - Jurgen Klopp's side will seal the title with victory in the Merseyside derby at Everton on Sunday. The race for a top-four spot is less of a formality. City's two-year ban from European competition (appeal pending) means fifth place will be enough for a Champions League spot. Liverpool, Leicester, Chelsea and Manchester United are currently occupying the qualification places, but the likes of Wolves, Sheffield United, Tottenham and Arsenal will all begin again with a place in Europe's top competition as their aim. Down at the bottom, six clubs are seemingly battling it out to avoid the drop. Bottom club Norwich are six points adrift on 21 points. Aston Villa and Bournemouth are the two clubs above them but are part of a group of five clubs, along with Watford, West Ham and Brighton, separated by just four points.

Boohoo swoops again as snaps up High Street rivals,"Online fashion retailer Boohoo has agreed to buy the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for Â£5.25m. Boohoo made the announcement as it said online sales rose by 45% in the three months to May, partly boosted by demand for athleisure items during lockdown. Manchester-based Boohoo also owns PLT and Nasty Gal. Earlier this year, it bought struggling brands MissPap, Karen Millen and Coast. In April, Oasis and Warehouse went into administration losing 1,800 jobs. The brands were forced to shut their 90 UK stores in March because of the coronavirus lockdown, which also closed its 437 concessions in department stores including Debenhams and Selfridges. Online shoppers had also been unable to place orders with the fashion chains for a number of weeks. Oasis and Warehouse customers have not been able to place orders online for a number of weeks The previous owner had been in talks to sell the businesses before the crisis, but no buyer could be found  for the High Street stores as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated the shift of shoppers to online. The brand and stock were bought by Hilco Capital, which has now sold them on to Boohoo. Boohoo said on Wednesday that the sales of loungewear and ""athleisure"" had done well during lockdown as customers adapted to a ""stay-at-home lifestyle"". Worldwide sales were Â£368m in the quarter to May. In the UK, which accounts for half of its total revenue, sales were up 30% to Â£183m. That came despite an initial slowdown in towards the end of March and early April as the initial impact of the pandemic hit. Boohoo says that its social media strategy and ""flexible supply chain"", largely based in the UK, are what drives its growth, allowing the quick turnaround and promotion of what some have criticised as ""fast fashion"" items. Boohoo competitor Asos has said it had seen a downturn in demand since the Covid-19 outbreak Online retailer, and Boohoo competitor, Asos previously said it had seen a downturn in demand since the Covid-19 outbreak. It has revamped its social media strategy and announced a share sale in April in a bid to turn around its fortunes. On the High Street retailers in the UK were facing a tough environment before the crisis, due to rising costs and changes in people's shopping habits. But the temporary closure of many shops, which have since reopened in England and Northern Ireland, heaped more pressure on retailers. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Boohoo's own latest purchases would need refreshing: ""It's up to Boohoo to rejuvenate [Oasis and Warehouse] and hope they resonate well with its traditionally younger, more fashion forward customer base. ""It's a similar move to the Karen Millen and Coast acquisitions, but while we've heard trading's going well with these additions, we haven't had any numbers to crunch, so it's hard to say what the big picture looks like."" The 22-year-old taking on the gym wear world 'I returned my suits and spent Â£100 on joggers' Boohoo, founded in 2006, sells fashion, beauty and products and shoes aimed at 16 to 24-year-olds. The brand is popular with young women in particular, who it targets with marketing campaigns using Instagram influencers and Love Island contestants. Boohoo bought its Nasty Gal's brand's assets in 2017 for $20m (Â£15m). It was founded by US businesswoman Sophia Amoruso who is widely credited with popularising the term ""girl boss"".

According to research by polling firm YouGov in May,external, 11% of 18 to 24-year-olds had purchased something from Boohoo for themselves in the previous three months. Separately, Boohoo predicted ""another year of strong profitable growth"" which would outdo analysts' expectations. John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said there could also be more acquisitions to come: ""Boohoo continues to deliver strong results, regardless of the challenges placed in front of it, which highlights the company's flexibility and entrepreneurial drive. ""With excess cash on its balance sheet, you wouldn't rule out further additions in the months ahead as less resilient names struggle in the current retail climate."" Investors were delighted with the company's announcement and sent the shares up 9% at the start of trading.

Accuracy of UK illegal immigration data questioned,"The government has not had an up-to-date estimate of the number of immigrants in the UK illegally in 15 years, according to a report. The last official estimate in 2005 found about 430,000 people were in the country with no legal right to remain. But independent research since then has put the figure at over a million, the National Audit Office said. The Home Office said it worked ""tirelessly"" with other departments and partners to tackle illegal migration. Meg Hillier, from Parliament's financial watchdog, said it appeared the Home Office had ""no idea"" how many people were in the UK illegally. The Labour MP, who chairs the public accounts committee, added the department ""doesn't seem interested in finding out"". Are there 800,000 illegal immigrants in the UK? Five migrant boats intercepted in Channel The report found that the Home Office put demand for its immigration enforcement services at between 240,000 and 320,000 cases per year. But the NAO said this figure excluded those who had no contact with government in the previous two years, and ""does not yet provide a baseline"" to measure the effectiveness of the department's enforcement action. ""Due to data quality issues, Immigration Enforcement cannot say whether the number of people 'genuinely putting a demand' on its activities is increasing or decreasing,"" it found. It suggested the Home Office should look at how other parts of government come up with estimates of ""hidden activity"" such as serious and organised crime, which it said could help to ""improve its understanding of the full scale of the illegal population in the UK"". The highest estimate of the illegal population in the UK is 1.2m, given by the Pew Research Centre last year - although the NAO said it had not attempted to verify the number. The NAO suggested the Home Office could learn from other parts of government. The NAO also found that voluntary and enforced returns of people living the UK illegally had ""fallen dramatically"" since 2015. Voluntary returns had reduced from an average of 1,200 a month in 2015 to approximately 460 a month in 2019, the watchdog said - although the number of foreign criminals departed had ""remained more stable"". In their2019 election manifesto,external, the Conservative Party pledged to ""keep track of who is coming in and out of our country"". Garth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: ""While the Home Office has introduced significant changes to its enforcement activity, it cannot demonstrate that overall performance is improving. ""The department needs a better understanding of the impact of its immigration enforcement activity on its overarching vision to reduce the size of the illegal population and the harm it causes."" A spokesman from the Home Office said it was working ""tirelessly... to tackle illegal migration, close down routes for people smuggling and return those with no right to remain the UK wherever possible"". He added: ""We have taken back control of our immigration system and for the first time in a generation, we will have full control over who comes and stays here.""

The Premier League returns - all you need to knowBBC Sport provides you with all the information you need ahead of the resumption of the English top-flight.BBC SportComments,"Liverpool (led by Jurgen Klopp, centre) could win the Premier League in their first game back The Premier League returns on Wednesday... but not exactly as we know it. After a 100-day absence because of the coronavirus pandemic, Aston Villa v Sheffield United will kick off the English top-flight's resumption. It is the first of 92 league games that will be packed into a frantic 40 days before the season concludes on 26 July. Fixtures will be played behind closed doors as one of a host of measures to prevent any further cases of the virus. A minute's silence to remember those who have died with coronaviruswill be held before the first matches, while heart-shaped badges in tribute to frontline NHS staff will also be worn on kits. For the first 12 matches of the restarted campaign, allplayer names on the back of shirts will be replaced by ""Black Lives Matter"". This followsthe death of George Floyd in the United States,which has sparked protests worldwide. Over eight rounds of twice-weekly coronavirus screenings of Premier League players and staff, there have been16 positive results from 8,687 tests.,external All remaining 92 games will be broadcast live, with four matches to be shown on the BBC - the first to be made free-to-air on terrestrial television since the Premier League's inception in 1992. Liverpool sit 25 points clear at the top of the table while Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Norwich City are in the relegation places. The Reds, chasing a first league title in 30 years, could clinch it with victory in their first game back should second-placed Manchester City lose to Arsenal on Wednesday. Coronavirus set to cost Premier League clubs Â£1bn - Deloitte Things we expect when the Premier League comes back 'Life hasn't been the same without football' - Phil McNulty on Premier League's return Quiz: what can you remember of the 2019-20 season so far? With the number of new infections falling and lockdown restrictions in England being gradually eased, thePremier League agreed it was safe to resume with the correct safety measures in place. This was followed by theUK government giving the go-aheadfor elite competitive sport to resume behind closed doors from 1 June. Clubs unanimously voted toresume contact trainingin the final week of May, having started non-contact training the previous week as part of Project Restart. Premier League players and staff will continue to be tested twice a week, with any players or staff who test positive self-isolating for a period of seven days. Thedelaying of Euro 2020 by a yearprovided the Premier League with greater flexibility in which to fit in fixtures. But there remains a time pressure imposed by issues with players' contracts, many of which run out on 30 June, and the scheduled start of the 2020-21 season in August. There is also a financial incentive to resume playing, with thethreat of an increased or restructured rebate to TV companies if fixtures are not completed. This video can not be played It's OK to say we've missed football - Lineker on Premier League return The fixture list, including kick-off times, forthe first 32 matches after the restart was announced on 5 June. Aston Villa will face Sheffield United in the opening match at 18:00 BST on Wednesday, before Manchester City host Arsenal later the same evening. The first full round of fixtures will then be played over the weekend. For the full list of Premier League fixtures,click here. All remaining 92 Premier League games will be broadcast liveon Sky Sports, BT Sport, BBC Sport or Amazon Prime. The BBC will show Bournemouth v Crystal Palace on 20 June at 19:45 BST, followed by Norwich v Everton on 24 June at 18:00, and then two matches yet to be confirmed. As well as the four live games, there will be additional Match of the Day highlights programmes. Sky Sports will make 25 of the remaining top-flight matches free to air, including the Merseyside derby at 19:00 on 21 June. Amazon Prime's four matches will also be broadcast for free. For the full list of free to air games,click here. BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport will also provide live radio commentaries for all the remaining matches, while BT Sport will show the first Saturday 15:00 Premier League match to be broadcast live in the UK when Brighton take on Arsenal on 20 June. This video can not be played What Match of the Day looked like the last time BBC broadcast the top flight in 1988 All matches behind closed doors, with number of key people allowed inside the stadium limited to 300. Stadiums divided into three zones - red (includes pitch and technical areas), amber (stands) and green (stand concourses) - with restrictions on who is allowed to enter each. Teamsable to make five substitutions,rather than three, in each match and able to name nine substitutes instead of the usual seven. Staggered entry on to pitch for players and staff and no handshakes before kick-off. Deep cleaning of corner flags, goalposts, substitution boards and match balls before and after each fixture. Extra disinfection, such as of the substitution board after it is used, likely during matches and at half-time. Medical protocols stipulate how squads and coaching staff must travel to and from games, observing social distancing. Post-match broadcast interviews will take place pitchside with press conferences conducted virtually. VAR will continue to be in operation. Before the suspension of play in the Premier League, Liverpool were hurtling towards their first top-flight title in 30 years. The league will restart with the Reds 25 points clear at the top and potentially one win away from confirming their triumph. If Manchester City lose their game in hand - against Arsenal on Wednesday - Jurgen Klopp's side will seal the title with victory in the Merseyside derby at Everton on Sunday. The race for a top-four spot is less of a formality. City's two-year ban from European competition (appeal pending) means fifth place will be enough for a Champions League spot. Liverpool, Leicester, Chelsea and Manchester United are currently occupying the qualification places, but the likes of Wolves, Sheffield United, Tottenham and Arsenal will all begin again with a place in Europe's top competition as their aim. Down at the bottom, six clubs are seemingly battling it out to avoid the drop. Bottom club Norwich are six points adrift on 21 points.

Boohoo buys Oasis and Warehouse online businesses,"Online fashion retailer Boohoo has agreed to buy the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for Â£5.25m. Boohoo made the announcement as it said online sales rose by 45% in the three months to May, partly boosted by demand for athleisure items during lockdown. Manchester-based Boohoo also owns PLT and Nasty Gal. Earlier this year, it bought struggling brands MissPap, Karen Millen and Coast. In April, Oasis and Warehouse went into administration losing 1,800 jobs. The brands were forced to shut their 90 UK stores in March because of the coronavirus lockdown, which also closed its 437 concessions in department stores including Debenhams and Selfridges. Online shoppers had also been unable to place orders with the fashion chains for a number of weeks. Oasis and Warehouse customers have not been able to place orders online for a number of weeks The previous owner had been in talks to sell the businesses before the crisis, but no buyer could be found  for the High Street stores as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated the shift of shoppers to online. The brand and stock were bought by Hilco Capital, which has now sold them on to Boohoo. Boohoo said on Wednesday that the sales of loungewear and ""athleisure"" had done well during lockdown as customers adapted to a ""stay-at-home lifestyle"". Worldwide sales were Â£368m in the quarter to May. In the UK, which accounts for half of its total revenue, sales were up 30% to Â£183m. That came despite an initial slowdown in towards the end of March and early April as the initial impact of the pandemic hit. Boohoo says that its social media strategy and ""flexible supply chain"", largely based in the UK, are what drives its growth, allowing the quick turnaround and promotion of what some have criticised as ""fast fashion"" items. Boohoo competitor Asos has said it had seen a downturn in demand since the Covid-19 outbreak Online retailer, and Boohoo competitor, Asos previously said it had seen a downturn in demand since the Covid-19 outbreak. It has revamped its social media strategy and announced a share sale in April in a bid to turn around its fortunes. On the High Street retailers in the UK were facing a tough environment before the crisis, due to rising costs and changes in people's shopping habits. But the temporary closure of many shops, which have since reopened in England and Northern Ireland, heaped more pressure on retailers. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Boohoo's own latest purchases would need refreshing: ""It's up to Boohoo to rejuvenate [Oasis and Warehouse] and hope they resonate well with its traditionally younger, more fashion forward customer base. ""It's a similar move to the Karen Millen and Coast acquisitions, but while we've heard trading's going well with these additions, we haven't had any numbers to crunch, so it's hard to say what the big picture looks like."" The 22-year-old taking on the gym wear world 'I returned my suits and spent Â£100 on joggers' Boohoo, founded in 2006, sells fashion, beauty and products and shoes aimed at 16 to 24-year-olds. The brand is popular with young women in particular, who it targets with marketing campaigns using Instagram influencers and Love Island contestants. Boohoo bought its Nasty Gal's brand's assets in 2017 for $20m (Â£15m). It was founded by US businesswoman Sophia Amoruso who is widely credited with popularising the term ""girl boss"".

According to research by polling firm YouGov in May,external, 11% of 18 to 24-year-olds had purchased something from Boohoo for themselves in the previous three months. Separately, Boohoo predicted ""another year of strong profitable growth"" which would outdo analysts' expectations. John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said there could also be more acquisitions to come: ""Boohoo continues to deliver strong results, regardless of the challenges placed in front of it, which highlights the company's flexibility and entrepreneurial drive. ""With excess cash on its balance sheet, you wouldn't rule out further additions in the months ahead as less resilient names struggle in the current retail climate."" Investors were delighted with the company's announcement and sent the shares up 9% at the start of trading.

New trials planned for cash-stricken communities,"Hay-on-Wye, home of a major book festival, is one area that will hold a trial Eight locations across the UK, including an army barracks, have been chosen for trials to help solve problems with access to cash. Organisers hope they will inform debate over the future of cash in the UK, particularly for those who rely on it. The Community Access to Cash Pilot will test new subsidised ATMs and local cash deposit centres for retailers. It comes as a new forecast suggests cash use will fall faster in the UK than in much of Europe. The plan for trials was drawn up in light ofa major report,externalwarning that the country is ""sleepwalking"" into becoming a cashless society. It concluded that eight million people in the UK rely on notes and coins, ranging from those without a bank account to people who are not comfortable with digital payments. That work was led by Natalie Ceeney, who is also in charge of the pilot projects. ""Over the past decade we've seen a massive shift from cash to digital payments, andÂ Covid-19 has accelerated that trend further.Â But we know that digital payments don't yet work for everyone, and for many individuals and communities, cashÂ remainsÂ essential,"" she said. ""ButÂ the world is changing - we can't just magic back our old bank branch and ATM infrastructure. Instead, we need to use innovation toÂ develop new solutions as well as harness tried and tested approachesÂ to meet people'sÂ needs."" Cash is vital to avoid overspending, says 20-year-old civil engineering apprentice Brandon Wilson Not long ago there were two banks with branches in Ampthill. Then there was one. Now there is none. Currently just one cash machine is left to serve a population of more than 8,000. Brandon Wilson, 20, is currently on furlough from a civil engineering apprenticeship at Luton Airport. He said using cash helps him stick more rigidly to his spending plans to ensure he does not spend beyond his means. ""In general I try and budget my daily routine and having the physical money there means it is harder to spend than just placing a piece of card on to a machine,"" he says. The town where 8,000 people share a cash machine Some of the places selected for the project are remoteÂ communities,Â such as the village of Botton, North Yorkshire, and Lulworth Camp, a military barracks in DorsetÂ miles away from the nearest cash machine. Small towns withÂ thousands of residents whichÂ have seen bank branches or cash dispensersÂ disappear are also included, such as Ampthill, along with Rochford, in Essex,Â Denny near Falkirk, and Cambuslang, in Lanarkshire. Burslem, in Staffordshire, is also on the list, as is Hay-on-Wye, which has a large number of bookshops and other small businesses with no bank branchÂ to deposit notes and coins. Banks have been persuaded to pay for the pilots, trying out ideas likeÂ shared branches, more cashback in shops, as well asÂ better bus services to allow people to visit surviving branches. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, which represents the banks, said the sector was ""committed to ensuring that access to cash remains free and widely accessible to those who need it"". Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' A new rural bank branch opening! What's going on? The coronavirus outbreak has accelerated the decline of cash use for many people. A recent survey by Link, which oversees the UK's cash machine network, suggested that 75% of people had used less cash during lockdown. One new forecast by consultants Accenture claimed that cash usage in the UK would drop by 40% this year, compared with 2019 - a faster drop than a 30% predicted fall in the major economies of Europe. Sulabh Agarwal, from Accenture, said: ""One of the key issues facing [retailers] will be how to take payment. While the decline of cash in the UK isn't new, there's little doubt that lockdown and social distancing measures have pushed consumers who typically rely on cash into digital payments."" Gareth Shaw, from consumer organisation Which?, said: ""With the existing cash system being pushed closer to the edge of collapse by the coronavirus outbreak, it is clear that new solutions are desperately needed to secure people's access and ability to pay with cash, which millions of people still rely on as their main form of payment."" The results of the pilots will be published in early 2021.

"Beijing stops travel as virus spike continuesSchools are shut and travel is restricted, as the city reports another 31 Covid-19 cases.China","People queuing for a nucleic acid test on Wednesday - most people need a negative test before leaving the city, while others are banned entirely Millions of people in Beijing are living under renewed restrictions, as a spike in virus cases continues. The city reported another 31 cases on Wednesday, bringing the total to 137 in the past week. Before the recent spike, the Chinese capital had gone 57 days without a locally-transmitted case. The outbreak is believed to have started in the massive Xinfadi food market that supplies 80% of the city's meat and vegetables. At least 27 neighbourhoods have been classed as medium risk and one neighbourhood, near the market, is high risk. People in medium or high-risk areas cannot leave the city. People in low-risk areas can leave, but need to test negative first. However, getting a test is difficult - three testing stations told the BBC there were no tests available until July. Queues were seen outside other centres. More than 1,200 flights have been cancelled to and from the city and railway services have been reduced until at least 9 July. Primary school, middle school, and college classes are suspended, sports teams cannot play, and swimming pools and gyms are closed. However, roads are open, and companies and factories can still work. The city is on a ""level two"" alert, the second-highest. Restaurants, sport, packed trains, even the pubâ¦ there we were, basking in the glory of ""normal-ish"" life in Beijing, after more than 50 days without an infection. Then: bam! The market outbreak has dragged us back into a virus prevention bubble. In effect, it's very hard to leave Beijing right now. If you haven't done a test in the past week your departure is not allowed, and limited testing capacity is, understandably, being diverted to ""high risk"" groups. The airlines know this. That's why they've cancelled 1,255 flights in and out of the capital on Wednesday so far. For the moment, the authorities are managing Beijing districts almost like cities within the city, imposing strict measures where needed in the hope that they can control it. However, this is touching everyone's movements. The main difference between now and February is that businesses, government departments, manufacturing are all still operating. Perhaps because of this, there seems to be a general confidence that the cluster will be controlled - before becoming a full-blown second wave. Local media said the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at the Xinfandi market. The general manager of the market was dismissed, along with other local officials. Beijing tightens controls to tackle virus spike Fear of Beijing second wave after market outbreak The Beijing government said ""relevant people"" from the market would not be allowed to leave the city, regardless of which neighbourhood they live in. The market has tens of thousands of visitors each day. In general, China has successfully ""flattened the curve"" in recent months. After passing 80,000 confirmed cases at the start of March, it has added only around 3,200 since then. On Tuesday, for example, it reported just32 locally-transmitted cases,externalin the whole country - 27 were in Beijing with four in neighbouring Hebei. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic Do you live in one of the 27 Beijing neighbourhoods where restrictions are in place?

UK inflation rate falls to fresh four-year low,"A record fall in fuel prices, including petrol, pushed the UK's inflation rate down to 0.5% in May, the second full month of the coronavirus lockdown. Fuel prices declined by 16.7% during the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, dragging the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to the lowest level since June 2016. Clothing and footwear prices also fell. Supermarkets were among the few shops allowed to open in May and food prices rose, the ONS said. May's inflation rate was down from 0.8% in April, the first full month of the pandemic lockdown. Clothing and footwear prices fell 3.1% amid heavy discounting. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It's one of the key measures of financial wellbeing because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. It's expressed as a percentage increase or decrease in prices over time. For example, if the inflation rate for the cost of a litre of petrol is 2% a year, motorists need to spend 2% more at the pump than 12 months earlier. And if wages don't keep up with inflation, purchasing power and the standard of living falls. What is the inflation rate? ""The growth in consumer prices again slowed to the lowest annual rate in four years,"" said ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow. ""The cost of games and toys fell back from last month's rises, while there was a continued drop in prices at the pump in May, following the huge crude price falls seen in recent months. ""Outside these areas, we are seeing few significant changes to the prices in the shops."" The ONS admitted that it had difficulty compiling inflation statistics for May, since many areas of the economy were completely shut down. For instance, inflation figures for holidays had had to be ""imputed"", it said. Separate figures issued by the ONS on Tuesday showed that in the three months to April, workers' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew at an annual rate of 1.7%, the weakest since January 2015. However, when measured against the comparable three-monthly inflation rate, that means pay growth is continuing to outstrip inflation. CPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Inflation is one of the main factors that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the ""base rate"". That influences what interest rates banks can charge people to borrow money, or what they pay on their savings. Interest rates are currently at 0.1%, the lowest level in the Bank's 325-year history. ""May's further fall in inflation is probably only the beginnings of a prolonged period of very soft price pressure,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. He added that MPC members were expected to opt for more stimulus measures to boost the economy at their policy meeting on Thursday. Rising prices are certainly not something Cristina Bruzzolo needs to worry about the moment. She owns Colibri Boutique, a high-end women's clothes shop in north London. Monthly sales would normally be about Â£40,000, but have fallen to about Â£10,000, she says. ""We were hurt, but we are managing to cover our costs."" Ms Bruzzolo has been discounting by a hefty 20%-30%. She's had to be inventive in order to make sales, including using Zoom video calls to show customers clothes and then take items to their homes so they can try before they buy. ""The stock for this season has already been paid for,"" she said. ""I need to generate cash flow to pay for next summer's stock."" But Ms Bruzzolo is expecting another big sales hit in the autumn when the furlough scheme ends and, she fears, many people are made redundant. Nevertheless, while Ms Bruzzolo is pessimistic about the near term, she's optimistic about the long-term future. ""It's going to be a very tough year, probably even two years,"" she says. But she's survived previous downturns and believes that, with good cost-control and some good luck, she'll survive this one. ""I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" she says.

Facebook to let users turn off political adverts,"Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg says users will be able to turn off political adverts on the social network in the run-up to the 2020 US election. In a piece written for USA Today newspaper, he also says he hopes to help four million Americans sign up as new voters. Facebook has faced heavy criticism for allowing adverts from politicians that contain false information. Rival social platform Twitter banned political advertising last October. âFor those of you whoâve already made up your minds and just want the election to be over, we hear you -- so weâre also introducing the ability to turn off seeing political ads,â Mr Zuckerberg wrote. Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram will give users the option to turn off political adverts when they appear or they can block them using the settings features. Facebook launches WhatsApp digital payment service Trump signs order targeting social media giants Instagram 'will overtake Twitter as a news source' Users that have blocked political adverts will also be able to report them if they continue to appear. The feature, which will start rolling out on Wednesday, allows users to turn off political, electoral and social issue adverts from candidates and other organisations that have the ""Paid for"" political disclaimer. The company said it plans to make the feature available to all US users over the next few weeks and will offer it in other countries this autumn. Mr Zuckerberg went on to encourage people who aren't signed up as voters to register in time for the US election in November. âVoting is voice. Itâs the single most powerful expression of democracy, the best way to hold our leaders accountable, and how we address many of the issues our country is grappling with."" âI believe Facebook has a responsibility not just to prevent voter suppression -- which disproportionately targets people of colour -- but to actively support well-informed voter engagement, registration, and turnout.â As part of the initiative a new information hub, called The Voting Information Center, will be put at the top of American usersâ Facebook and Instagram feeds from the beginning of July. Information on offer will include how to register to vote and details about mail-in ballots. The firm also said it will share reliable information from state and local election authorities. Facebook estimates that the hub will reach 160 million Americans by the 3 November election. Facing criticism from inside and outside the company over the way it regulates political speech, Facebook has unveiled what look like fairly minor tweaks to policies in the run-up to the US elections. Yes, it will become more evident to users what is and is not a political advert, and they will be able to opt out of seeing them. But that was never the main concern of critics, such as the web's creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Last November Sir Tim told the BBC that Mark Zuckerberg needed to ""turn off "" targeted political advertising altogether. ""It's not fair to risk democracy by allowing all these very subtle manipulations with targeted ads which promote completely false ideas,"" he explained. I'm told his views have not changed. Facebook's communications supremo Sir Nick Clegg made it clear on BBC Radio 4's Today that the social media giant will also not bow to pressure to fact check political content. The UK's former deputy prime minister was hired by Facebook to be its global affairs chief in 2018 Challenged over Facebook's failure to follow Twitter in at least putting a warning on a post from President Trump saying ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"", Sir Nick trod a delicate path. He described the comment as ""abhorrent"" but backed a collective decision not to take action. President Trump is unlikely to be impressed by that ""abhorrent"" comment. Nor will he be enthused by Facebook's promise to help to register four million voters, which may well do more to boost votes for Democratic candidates than Republican ones. Meanwhile Joe Biden is still calling on Facebook to tackle misinformation by fact-checking all political ads over the fortnight before the US Presidential election. Both contenders feel that Facebook could be crucial to the outcome of that vote, so the next months will see unrelenting pressure on Mark Zuckerberg and his team to prove they can play a positive rather than a destructive role in the democratic process. Social media companies are at the centre of a political storm in the run-up to the US election. Last month Mr Zuckerberg faced criticism for leaving up a series of posts by President Donald Trump, including one that Twitter labelled as containing misleading information about mail-in ballots. It was the first time that Twitter had flagged the US president's tweets. Also in May, Mr Trump signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms. It came as Mr Trump continued to accuse companies such as Twitter and Facebook of stifling conservative voices.

Nor will he be enthused by Facebook's promise to help to register four million voters, which may well do more to boost votes for Democratic candidates than Republican ones. Meanwhile Joe Biden is still calling on Facebook to tackle misinformation by fact-checking all political ads over the fortnight before the US Presidential election. Both contenders feel that Facebook could be crucial to the outcome of that vote, so the next months will see unrelenting pressure on Mark Zuckerberg and his team to prove they can play a positive rather than a destructive role in the democratic process. Social media companies are at the centre of a political storm in the run-up to the US election. Last month Mr Zuckerberg faced criticism for leaving up a series of posts by President Donald Trump, including one that Twitter labelled as containing misleading information about mail-in ballots. It was the first time that Twitter had flagged the US president's tweets. Also in May, Mr Trump signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms. It came as Mr Trump continued to accuse companies such as Twitter and Facebook of stifling conservative voices.

But former sports minister Richard Caborn has suggested smaller crowds could be permitted at some fixtures even if a vaccine isn't found. ""I understand discussions are ongoing with some Premier League clubs to see whether they can start using testing, but also digital passports as well,"" Caborn told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""There are some British companies working with the clubs, both on testing and there's obviously some fairly advanced technology."" Digital passport technology is currently used by the United Nations to monitor infection rates. BBC Sport The players of rugby union club Sale Sharks haveagreed to take permanent pay cutsto help them through the Covid-19 pandemic.

The boss of a banknote printing firmsays the coronavirus crisis may mean countries replace notes more frequently. But some experts say the virus will speed up the decline in cash use in favour of digital payments. De La Rue chief executive Clive Vacher also said the company would be ending banknote printing at its Gateshead plant, putting 260 jobs at risk. The firm plans to raise Â£100m as part of a turnaround plan focused on shifting to plastic notes. The secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport says the ""world will be watching"" the restart of Premier League football games tonight. Aston Villa and Sheffield United kicked off shortly after 18:00 BST, following a minute's silence to remember those who died with coronavirus. Man City and Arsenal are due to play at 20:15. He urges football fans in the UK to watch the games tonight at home and not to gather with friends. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden says people must not gather together as the Premier League restarts. You can follow the games livehere. Aston Villa v Sheffield United (18:00 BST) The Premier League's return is not far away as Villa Park hosts the first fixture between Aston Villa and Sheffield United. You canfollow the build-up hereand also tune into live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live. Here's a summary of the strict conditions matches are being played under: Aston Villa are getting readyto face Sheffield United as the Premier League returns- 96 long days after it was suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Although fans aren't allowed in the stadium, one is still going to feel like he is in Villa Park, after his wife recreated it in their living room. Paul Sargent, who lives in Manchester but is originally from Erdington, said he ""couldn't believe"" the effort wife Justine put into transforming their home ahead of kick off at 18:00. ""Sheâs put two beer fridges in the living room and stocked them
up,"" he said. ""Sheâs created a bar above the fireplace with Villa cups, taken all our wedding photos from the walls and
replaced them with my Villa photos. ""And sheâs bought some Pukka Pies which are in the fridge ready to go into the oven for half
time."" ""I said, 'Iâm not sure
who is more excited for the football me or you?'"" Mr Sargent said Villa, who are 19th in the table ""need a win"" in tonight's game. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has told reporters at the UK government's daily coronavirus briefing that even with social distancing there are greater risks involved with resuming indoor performances than there would be with outdoor stadia for sporting events for example. It comes after the producer of Hamilton, Les Miserables, Mary Poppins and The Phantom of the Operasaid the shows will not return to London's West End until 2021. Sir Cameron Mackintosh said ""drastic steps"", including redundancies, were required if the shows were to reopen ""as early as practical"" next year. ""This decision is heartbreaking for me, as I am sure it is for my employees,"" he said in a statement. It is not known how many jobs are at risk at this stage. Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer earlier asked the PM for more money for local authorities struggling to balance their books during the pandemic. He quoted the head of the Local Government Association who said back in April there would be a shortfall of Â£10bn this year and the Conservative leader of Lancashire County Council who warned the government in early May the financial hit for councils would be far more than the Â£3.2bn they had been given. Boris Johnson said as well as that Â£3.2bn, the government had given councils a further Â£1.6bn as well as Â£600m for social care. But itâs unclear where the additional Â£1.6bn he refers to has come from. A pledge of Â£3.2bn has been made in two separate announcements - Â£1.6bn from theÂ£5 billion COVID-19 fund,externalon 19 March and a further Â£1.6bn on 18 April. We know Â£600m was given to councils to help reduce coronavirus infections in care homes, plus Â£300m to support test and trace, and another Â£63m announced last week to help people struggling to afford food and other essentials due to coronavirus. Pupils and staff at a Kent primary school have beentold to self-isolate after a child tested positive for coronavirus. St Francis Catholic Primary in Maidstone remains open, but the child's class ""bubble"" is now in isolation. Head teacher Elisabeth Blanden said the pupil did not catch the virus at school and had not displayed symptoms while on school premises. Those staff and children affected will isolate for 14 days. The UK government's daily press briefing is about to begin at Downing Street. It will be fronted by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden. As it stands, he is expected to appear on his own, without any scientific or medical officials alongside him. The Premier League football season is due to resume at 18.00 BST, so he is likely to want to talk about that. But he will face questions on plenty of other subjects as well. Follow it hereas well as on the BBC News channel and app. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has beenspotted slapping a colleague on the back in the House of Commons,despite social distancing measures in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mr Hancock's moment of apparent forgetfulness happened as he arrived at Prime Minister's Questions. He and other ministers have repeatedly urged the importance of people keeping two metres away from one another. The Department of Health has been contacted for comment. Manchester City v Arsenal (20:15 BST) Simon StoneBBC Sport Manchester City have just distributed some pictures of the Etihad Stadium looking in fine shape ahead of tonight's game against Arsenal. The club have launched a few initiatives to try and keep fans involved, even though there won't be any spectators allowed in the stadium. They include installing two additional LED screens pitchside to show a live streams of fans. A digital programme has been produced. There will be a pre-match show - which normally takes place just outside the stadium - and there will even be special ticket books for season ticket holders. BBC Radio Devon Three more beaches in Devon are to have RNLI lifeguard cover from this weekend. RNLI lifeguards started working on Croyde and Woolacombe beaches at the beginning of June From Saturday there will now also be cover at Bantham, Exmouth and Sedgewell Cove. The charity had planned to only provide cover at70 beaches across the UK this summerbecause of Covid-19 safety. Chief executive Mark Dowie said more cover was being rolled out because ""we have a better idea of the journey out of lockdown for all parts of the UK... and, most importantly, feel we can properly manage the risks associated with coronavirus"". The RNLI said the service would ""expand to more beaches over the coming weeks and months"" and the latest updatescould be found on its website,external. The English Football League has confirmed12 individuals from EFL clubs tested positive for coronavirusin the past week. The EFL said eight cases came from six Championship clubs, withBrentford,externalconfirming one case. The other four positive tests came at two League One clubs, from which only the four play-off entrants were involved in the testing process. There were no positive results from the tests at four League Two clubs. The Championship season resumes on Saturday with the intention to complete it by the end of July while the League Two play-off semi-finals begin on Thursday evening. League One's play-offs will start in the first week of July. Cyclists are beingdiscouraged from ridingthe route of an informal bike event that normally attracts 1,500 people. The Dunwich Dynamo sees riders set off from London in the evening to cycle 115 miles (185km) to the Suffolk coast overnight. It was due to take place on the weekend of 4-5 July. Organisers say it will not ""officially"" be happening this year due to the coronavirus pandemic but stopping people doing it themselves ""would be like trying to stop Ramadan or Christmas"". Coronavirus has left aÂ£500m black hole in the London's finances,the capital's mayor has revealed. Sadiq Khan warns services, including the police and fire brigade, will need to be cut back without a government bailout. Local authorities across England face a shortfall of business rate and council tax income caused by the impact of Covid-19, he said. The mayor will cut his own pay by 10% and freeze pay for his senior staff. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also highlighted in Prime Minister's Questions earlier that English councils are facing a funding shortfall of Â£10bn. Boris Johnson stated the government has provided Â£1.6bn to support councils on the front line and Â£600m to social care, as well as Â£3.2bn to councils in general. Â© 2025 BBC.

'Invisible' unpaid carers going hungry in lockdown,"Christie has stayed at home through the lockdown to keep her mother safe Christie Michael is so worried about protecting her elderly mother that she has not gone outside her front door since the lockdown began in March. She says it is ""lonely and isolating"" - but the mother and daughter in Essex have also found themselves hungry. Research from Sheffield and Birmingham universities suggests more than 100,000 unpaid carers in the UK have had to rely on food banks during the pandemic. Helen Walker of Carers UK says unpaid carers are at ""breaking point"". The study looked at the experiences of people caring for parents and disabled relatives during the lockdown - and found 229,000 unpaid carers were in households where people had ""gone hungry"". The hidden role of unpaid carers in Scotland Parent carers in Wales struggling in pandemic Parents of disabled feel 'cut off and ignored' Christie, now in her thirties, lives with her mother in Waltham Abbey and has been caring for her since childhood - watching over her mother as she suffered from seizures and other health problems. But during the lockdown they faced a different kind of problem: ""We were actually hungry."" Christie did not want to risk going to the shops while she was shielding her 76-year-old mother. Since she was a child, Christie has been a carer for her mother And even if they could have got an online delivery, they didn't have enough money - so much so that they depended on deliveries brought by food banks. ""People don't understand the importance of food banks,"" she says, or how widely they are now being used. When they had emptied their cupboards, using up the baked beans and cereals, she said they were ""not eating"". ""I don't know what we would have done without the food bank."" When government food parcels did arrive, she didn't like to complain that much of it contained dairy products, when her mother was lactose intolerant. As a full-time carer she is entitled to a carer's allowance of about Â£67 per week - and the Carers UK charity is pushing for an increase. But even with other benefits on top, Christie says her current reality is ""spending every penny on food, rent and bills"". Every other cost that comes along, ""like something breaking down"", means borrowing and that creates another second wave of financial problems. What makes it tougher, says Christie, is the lack of recognition for such carers, protecting the people they love, but spending their waking hours looking after someone and being trapped without any money. During the lockdown, she says the sense of being invisible and forgotten has been even more intense. She has remained behind her door - and doesn't expect to be outside until the end of July, so as not to ""put mum in jeopardy"". In the past, she says there were some respite hours available to people caring for relatives - but that has gone. And she calls for a more consistent approach for support available for carers. The study from academics at Birmingham and Sheffield universities suggests that unpaid carers are twice as likely to have used food banks during the pandemic, compared to the general population. Professor Sue Yeandle of Sheffield University says this should ""shock the nation"". ""It cannot be right that carers are hidden from view, with declining mental wellbeing or face hunger or food poverty,"" she says. The chief executive of Carers UK, Helen Walker, says: ""Surely when the majority of carers are providing even more care for relatives during this pandemic, and spending more to do so, they deserve some help?"" A spokeswoman from the Department for Health and Social Care said: ""The government is hugely grateful for the crucial role that carers play, especially during this unprecedented period and we recently announced an extra Â£63m to support people struggling to afford food and other essentials due to coronavirus. ""The rate of carer's allowance was recently increased and we are working closely with carers organisations to further support carers during this outbreak, including funding to extend Carers UK's helpline opening times so unpaid carers are able to access trusted information and advice.""

Eight locations chosen for access to cash trials,"Hay-on-Wye, home of a major book festival, is one area that will hold a trial Eight locations across the UK, including an army barracks, have been chosen for trials to help solve problems with access to cash. Organisers hope they will inform debate over the future of cash in the UK, particularly for those who rely on it. The Community Access to Cash Pilot will test new subsidised ATMs and local cash deposit centres for retailers. It comes as a new forecast suggests cash use will fall faster in the UK than in much of Europe. The plan for trials was drawn up in light ofa major report,externalwarning that the country is ""sleepwalking"" into becoming a cashless society. It concluded that eight million people in the UK rely on notes and coins, ranging from those without a bank account to people who are not comfortable with digital payments. That work was led by Natalie Ceeney, who is also in charge of the pilot projects. ""Over the past decade we've seen a massive shift from cash to digital payments, andÂ Covid-19 has accelerated that trend further.Â But we know that digital payments don't yet work for everyone, and for many individuals and communities, cashÂ remainsÂ essential,"" she said. ""ButÂ the world is changing - we can't just magic back our old bank branch and ATM infrastructure. Instead, we need to use innovation toÂ develop new solutions as well as harness tried and tested approachesÂ to meet people'sÂ needs."" Cash is vital to avoid overspending, says 20-year-old civil engineering apprentice Brandon Wilson Not long ago there were two banks with branches in Ampthill. Then there was one. Now there is none. Currently just one cash machine is left to serve a population of more than 8,000. Brandon Wilson, 20, is currently on furlough from a civil engineering apprenticeship at Luton Airport. He said using cash helps him stick more rigidly to his spending plans to ensure he does not spend beyond his means. ""In general I try and budget my daily routine and having the physical money there means it is harder to spend than just placing a piece of card on to a machine,"" he says. The town where 8,000 people share a cash machine Some of the places selected for the project are remoteÂ communities,Â such as the village of Botton, North Yorkshire, and Lulworth Camp, a military barracks in DorsetÂ miles away from the nearest cash machine. Small towns withÂ thousands of residents whichÂ have seen bank branches or cash dispensersÂ disappear are also included, such as Ampthill, along with Rochford, in Essex,Â Denny near Falkirk, and Cambuslang, in Lanarkshire. Burslem, in Staffordshire, is also on the list, as is Hay-on-Wye, which has a large number of bookshops and other small businesses with no bank branchÂ to deposit notes and coins. Banks have been persuaded to pay for the pilots, trying out ideas likeÂ shared branches, more cashback in shops, as well asÂ better bus services to allow people to visit surviving branches. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, which represents the banks, said the sector was ""committed to ensuring that access to cash remains free and widely accessible to those who need it"". Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' A new rural bank branch opening! What's going on? The coronavirus outbreak has accelerated the decline of cash use for many people. A recent survey by Link, which oversees the UK's cash machine network, suggested that 75% of people had used less cash during lockdown. One new forecast by consultants Accenture claimed that cash usage in the UK would drop by 40% this year, compared with 2019 - a faster drop than a 30% predicted fall in the major economies of Europe. Sulabh Agarwal, from Accenture, said: ""One of the key issues facing [retailers] will be how to take payment. While the decline of cash in the UK isn't new, there's little doubt that lockdown and social distancing measures have pushed consumers who typically rely on cash into digital payments."" Gareth Shaw, from consumer organisation Which?, said: ""With the existing cash system being pushed closer to the edge of collapse by the coronavirus outbreak, it is clear that new solutions are desperately needed to secure people's access and ability to pay with cash, which millions of people still rely on as their main form of payment."" The results of the pilots will be published in early 2021.

Stars urge BBC to save regional current affairs,"Stephen Fry, Fern Britton and Sir Lenny Henry are among those to have signed the letter Dozens of broadcasters from Stephen Fry to Sir Lenny Henry have signed a letter asking the BBC not to cut its English regional current affairs programmes. The BBC has cancelled the autumn series of Inside Out and merged its weekly regional political programmes. The BBC is now ""seriously under-serving regional audiences"", the letter sent by the National Union of Journalists said. In response, the corporation said the coronavirus pandemic had ""forced us to prioritise our resources"". The letter is addressed to outgoing director general Lord Hall, whohas said the BBC must find Â£125m savings this year, and his successor Tim Davie. The signatories also include presenter Fern Britton, actor Dominic West, naturalist Chris Packham, writer and actress Daisy May Cooper, poet Benjamin Zephaniah, director Ken Loach and broadcaster Gloria Hunniford. It says: ""Never has in-depth investigative journalism, holding people to account and reflecting the regional diversity of England been more important."" Inside Out is broadcast in 11 regions, covering a wide array of stories and issues affecting life in those areas. Meanwhile, the regional Sunday morning political programmes have been replaced during the pandemic by a single show. The BBC's outgoing director-general Lord Hall has said the BBC must find Â£125m in savings this year The letter continues: ""If these cuts were to become permanent they risk damaging English democracy by the failure to provide an important platform for those voices in our communities who need and want to be heard. ""Even when faced with financial pressures we urge the BBC to not reduce regional programming and to defend a vital element of public service broadcasting not available anywhere else."" A BBC spokesman said: ""Local and regional broadcasting is in the BBC's DNA and we're especially proud of how our services have performed during recent months. ""The pandemic has forced us to prioritise our resources so we've cancelled the autumn series of Inside Out and are continuing with the single political programme for England through to the summer. ""The BBC does face very real financial challenges so naturally we are looking at what savings might be possible across the BBC.""

And as we wind down our live page, hereâs a round-up of some of the biggest stories in the UK: We will shortly be pausing our live coverage. Today there were signs of the pandemic worsening in Latin America, and localised infections are causing concern in some countries where the virus is largely considered to be under control. The top stories on Wednesday: The US opens up After two months at home - two months of virtual happy hours, socially distanced hangouts, and learning when to unmute yourself on Zoom - all 50 US states and the District of Columbia have begun the process of reopening. For some, that means the first face-to-face interactions with friends and family outside of their household in weeks. But how do you navigate the risks? Is sharing snacks okay? And is the briefest of hugs acceptable?Find out here. We reported earlier that Honduran President Juan
Orlando Hernandez had announced he and his wife had tested positive for Covid-19. The president was later taken to hospital and is now being treated for pneumonia, Reuters quotes Francis Contreras, a spokesman for Honduran health agency Sinager, as saying. He said the president was on an intravenous drip but was generally in good heath. Mr Hernandez tweeted that he felt good and appreciated all the support he had received. The Latin American nation has registered just under 10,000 Covid-19 infections and 330 deaths. The Premier League has finally returned.There were no fans. But then there were no goals either. Aston Villa and Sheffield United drew 0-0 at Villa Park after a 100-day hiatus. There was a moment's silence observed to remember all those who have died in the coronavirus outbreak, including the father of Villa manager Dean Smith. The players and match officials also all took a knee to mark the death of African American George Floyd in the US, and the players' names were replaced with the words Black Lives Matter.  An NHS nurse who spent 75 days as a coronavirus patient at the hospital where he works has recovered and left amid clapping from colleagues. Felix Khor, 68, spent 45 days in the intensive care ward at Southend Hospital in Essex, where he has worked for 15 years, and was put on a ventilator. He then spent several weeks on a different ward. He was admitted to hospital in early April and was discharged on Monday. Read his story here. Outbreaks of infection have been recorded at a number of slaughterhouses in Germany and worldwide Earlier we reported that 400 workers at a slaughterhouse in GÃ¼tersloh in western Germany had tested positive since Monday. Now some 7,000 people have been told to go into quarantine. Employees' families will have to isolate themselves and schools and nurseries in the area have been closed. The abattoir has also been temporarily shut. A number of abattoirs in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have been hit by Covid-19. They often rely on migrant labour. Some face allegations that poor working conditions and cramped accommodation facilitate the spread of the virus. Germany has had nearly 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, which is significantly less than some other western European countries, including the UK, France and Italy. More than 1,500 UK paediatricians have signed a letter to the prime minister calling for clear plans for getting children back into school. They say the absence of millions of children from schools ""risks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people"". Their concerns centre on the mental and physical health of children who have missed many months of education. Plans for schools reopening have been published in Scotland and Wales. The letter from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,externalcalls on the UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive to follow suit. Read aboutwhat they have to say here. A UK health says the country's coronavirus contact tracing app will be now ready ""before the winter"". Lord Bethell, the minister for innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care, said he was unable to give a date for its launch - adding that the application was ""not a priority"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergsaid,externalthe comments appeared to contradict statementsmade by ministers in the recent past. Read morehere. Financial pressure on the UK government due to the coronavirus outbreak has prompted more speculation over the level of future rises in the state pension. At the moment, pensioners are guaranteed rising payments through a so-called ""triple lock"". Pensions rise each year by a rate of inflation, the increase in average wages or 2.5% - whichever is highest. But with the coronavirus furlough scheme picking up 80% of millions of wages until it ends in October, next year's average wage rise will be as high as 18%. Will the government scrap the triple lock, will it postpone it, or are pensioners in line for a bumper increase? Read morehere. Around 2.8 million pints of out-of-date beer will need to be disposed of from Wales's shut pubs and clubs, the Campaign for Real Ale has estimated. But ""highly polluting"" beer ""poses a significant environmental risk"" according to Natural Resources Wales. Welsh Water says it will work with businesses ""to agree how and when the drinks can be disposed of"". But an opposition politician warned that the company was not used to dealing with such a volume of old beer. Wales's 3,500 pubs and clubs - along with cafes and restaurants - have been closed since 20 March. Read more here. Chile has announced a stricter lockdown in its capital after Covid-19 infections nationwide soared past 200,000. Chile is one of the worst affected nations in South America and Santiago has been badly hit. Residents of Santiago now face what has been termed ""maximum"" restrictions on movement. The infection rate nationwide rose to 220,628, the health ministry said, after 31,412 previously unconfirmed cases were added to 4,757 new ones. Chile has also recorded 3,383 deaths. In a joint ministerial briefing, officials said residents of Santiago would be
granted permission to leave their homes just twice a week
instead of five times. This is despite lockdowns lasting three months having already been in place in some parts of the capital. Lockdowns in Santiago have not halted the spread The return to Premier League football is having a poignant start. When the game began at Villa, players, officials and staff took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. When referee Michael Oliver blew the whistle for kick-off, he and his
officials joined all the players in kneeling for around 10 seconds to protest against racial injustice and to stand in support of others after the death of George Floyd in the US. All players warmed up in
Black Lives Matters t-shirts, with their names on the back of the match shirts
replaced with the same message. Games are being played behind closed doors because of the pandemic, with few journalists, officials and ground staff spaced out in the quiet stadium. Instead of crowd noise there is just the chat and commotion of the players, managers and officials. At the UK government daily briefing earlier, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned fans to watch the game at home, rather than meet up and spread the virus. Even the goalposts were disinfected before the match Seats remained empty, but shirts were filled with 'Black Lives Matter' Oktoberfest - the world's largest beer celebration - is normally held in September and October but this year's festivities were cancelled in April Germany has extended a ban on large gatherings until at least the end of October, Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced. The number of new coronavirus infections has stabilised at a low level, she said, but people should continue social distancing and wear masks, report German media. The ban could affect events including the Frankfurt book fair, which attracts around 300,000 visitors and which organisers had said until now was going ahead, plus of course large sports events. Rules on gathering size vary across Germany's states. Before the new announcement was made, for example, Berlin's rules allowed up to 200 people to gather for outdoor events until 16 June, increasing to 500 from 16 June and to 1,000 from 30 June. Schools will also return to normal after the summer holidays, Merkel added, after speaking with the leaders of Germany's 16 states in Berlin on Wednesday.  We reported yesterday on dexamethasone, the cheap and widely available drug thatcan help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. Today, the World Health Organization issued some cautions, stressing that the steroid should only be used under medical supervision and that it should be reserved for exceptionally ill patients. It also cautions there is no evidence it could prevent infection, or treat milder illness. The head of the WHO's emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, said: ""It is exceptionally important in this case, that the drug is reserved for use in severely ill and critical patients who can benefit from this drug clearly."" Some doctors also want to see more data, citing possible side-effects. A major trial in the UK showed the drug cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth. Read more about dexamethasonehere. Campaigners have called on the government to make pet theft a specific offence after instances of the crime ""went through the roof"" in lockdown. Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine, told MPs dog prices ""went up and up"" during lockdown and cases of theft increased. She joined others to tell MPs tougher penalties were needed to deter thieves. The government has said it is already an offence under the Theft Act 1968, with a maximum penalty of seven years. But campaigners complain those who steal animals can currently be punished in the same way as someone who steals a mobile phone or a laptop, as pets are classed simply as ""property"" under the act.

Tourism officials plan to start by limiting the number of visitors to the tower, following its longest closure since World War Two. Only the first and second floors will be accessible to visitors, and lifts will remain closed in the first stage of reopening. All surfaces in well-travelled areas will be cleaned every two hours, and all visitors over the age of 11 will be required to wear masks. A full reopening is expected by 25 June. The tower normally receives around seven million visitors per year, but France's tourism industry has been hit hard after a lockdown was imposed in March. Lifts will be closed at first, forcing visitors to hike up the stairs Reality Check Earlier, at the UK government briefing, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden was asked about when more public
toilets will reopen, to avoid parks and streets turning into âcesspitsâ. Management of public toilets is a council issue, meaning local
government will decide when the 4,500 plus council-run toilets in the UK can reopen
to the public. Additionally, public toilets run by private companies in places
like shopping centres will reopen when those companies think it is safe to do
so. The government has âstrongly encouragedâ the reopening of toilets
with appropriate social distancing measures such as a bigger gap between
urinals and electric hand dryers. A number of popular destinations have already reopened all or some
of their toilets including Brighton, North Norfolk, Cornwall and Blackpool. The
National Trust and Royal Parks have also reopened some of their toilets. If you are visiting somewhere and are concerned about access to
toilets, local council websites are supplying information on which ones have
now reopened. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world A woman in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg has been fined for writing on Facebook that her local hospital was avoiding diagnosing patients with coronavirus, according to Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. ""The hospital is packed, people are dying in their masses, everyone

the European Court of Human Rights if need be"". Russia has the third-highest number of cases in the world (552,549) and 7,468 deaths, according to official figures. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Eight locations chosen for access to cash trialsOrganisers hope the projects will inform debate over the future of cash at a time when card use in rising.Business,"Hay-on-Wye, home of a major book festival, is one area that will hold a trial Eight locations across the UK, including an army barracks, have been chosen for trials to help solve problems with access to cash. Organisers hope they will inform debate over the future of cash in the UK, particularly for those who rely on it. The Community Access to Cash Pilot will test new subsidised ATMs and local cash deposit centres for retailers. It comes as a new forecast suggests cash use will fall faster in the UK than in much of Europe. The plan for trials was drawn up in light ofa major report,externalwarning that the country is ""sleepwalking"" into becoming a cashless society. It concluded that eight million people in the UK rely on notes and coins, ranging from those without a bank account to people who are not comfortable with digital payments. That work was led by Natalie Ceeney, who is also in charge of the pilot projects. ""Over the past decade we've seen a massive shift from cash to digital payments, andÂ Covid-19 has accelerated that trend further.Â But we know that digital payments don't yet work for everyone, and for many individuals and communities, cashÂ remainsÂ essential,"" she said. ""ButÂ the world is changing - we can't just magic back our old bank branch and ATM infrastructure. Instead, we need to use innovation toÂ develop new solutions as well as harness tried and tested approachesÂ to meet people'sÂ needs."" Cash is vital to avoid overspending, says 20-year-old civil engineering apprentice Brandon Wilson Not long ago there were two banks with branches in Ampthill. Then there was one. Now there is none. Currently just one cash machine is left to serve a population of more than 8,000. Brandon Wilson, 20, is currently on furlough from a civil engineering apprenticeship at Luton Airport. He said using cash helps him stick more rigidly to his spending plans to ensure he does not spend beyond his means. ""In general I try and budget my daily routine and having the physical money there means it is harder to spend than just placing a piece of card on to a machine,"" he says. The town where 8,000 people share a cash machine Some of the places selected for the project are remoteÂ communities,Â such as the village of Botton, North Yorkshire, and Lulworth Camp, a military barracks in DorsetÂ miles away from the nearest cash machine. Small towns withÂ thousands of residents whichÂ have seen bank branches or cash dispensersÂ disappear are also included, such as Ampthill, along with Rochford, in Essex,Â Denny near Falkirk, and Cambuslang, in Lanarkshire. Burslem, in Staffordshire, is also on the list, as is Hay-on-Wye, which has a large number of bookshops and other small businesses with no bank branchÂ to deposit notes and coins. Banks have been persuaded to pay for the pilots, trying out ideas likeÂ shared branches, more cashback in shops, as well asÂ better bus services to allow people to visit surviving branches. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, which represents the banks, said the sector was ""committed to ensuring that access to cash remains free and widely accessible to those who need it"". Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' A new rural bank branch opening! What's going on? The coronavirus outbreak has accelerated the decline of cash use for many people. A recent survey by Link, which oversees the UK's cash machine network, suggested that 75% of people had used less cash during lockdown. One new forecast by consultants Accenture claimed that cash usage in the UK would drop by 40% this year, compared with 2019 - a faster drop than a 30% predicted fall in the major economies of Europe. Sulabh Agarwal, from Accenture, said: ""One of the key issues facing [retailers] will be how to take payment. While the decline of cash in the UK isn't new, there's little doubt that lockdown and social distancing measures have pushed consumers who typically rely on cash into digital payments."" Gareth Shaw, from consumer organisation Which?, said: ""With the existing cash system being pushed closer to the edge of collapse by the coronavirus outbreak, it is clear that new solutions are desperately needed to secure people's access and ability to pay with cash, which millions of people still rely on as their main form of payment."" The results of the pilots will be published in early 2021.

Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough',"A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. The low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. The drug is part ofthe world's biggest trial testing existing treatments,externalto see if they also work for coronavirus. It cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth. Had the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say. This video can not be played Katherine Millbank spent 15 days in hospital and was put on the drug trial And it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients. The UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate ""a remarkable British scientific achievement"", adding: ""We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak."" Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world. What is dexamethasone and how does it work? Latest coronavirus updates The drug combination that may help us beat Covid-19 About 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. Of those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. And these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. The drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions. And it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. This over-reaction,a cytokine storm, can be deadly. Inthe trial,external, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%. Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: ""This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough."" Lead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for: every eight patients on a ventilator every 20-25 treated with oxygen ""There is a clear, clear benefit,"" he said. ""The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about Â£5 per patient. ""So essentially it costs Â£35 to save a life. ""This is a drug that is globally available."" When appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said. But people should not go out and buy it to take at home. Dexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently beenditched amid concernsit increases fatalities and heart problems. The antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is alreadybeing made available on the NHS. The first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid. That is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. And that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. Dexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Half of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact. The drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. So far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola. That has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11. But the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. Unlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.

"'Invisible' unpaid carers going hungry in lockdownUnpaid carers looking after their parents and relatives are turning to food banks, say researchers.","Christie has stayed at home through the lockdown to keep her mother safe Christie Michael is so worried about protecting her elderly mother that she has not gone outside her front door since the lockdown began in March. She says it is ""lonely and isolating"" - but the mother and daughter in Essex have also found themselves hungry. Research from Sheffield and Birmingham universities suggests more than 100,000 unpaid carers in the UK have had to rely on food banks during the pandemic. Helen Walker of Carers UK says unpaid carers are at ""breaking point"". The study looked at the experiences of people caring for parents and disabled relatives during the lockdown - and found 229,000 unpaid carers were in households where people had ""gone hungry"". The hidden role of unpaid carers in Scotland Parent carers in Wales struggling in pandemic Parents of disabled feel 'cut off and ignored' Christie, now in her thirties, lives with her mother in Waltham Abbey and has been caring for her since childhood - watching over her mother as she suffered from seizures and other health problems. But during the lockdown they faced a different kind of problem: ""We were actually hungry."" Christie did not want to risk going to the shops while she was shielding her 76-year-old mother. Since she was a child, Christie has been a carer for her mother And even if they could have got an online delivery, they didn't have enough money - so much so that they depended on deliveries brought by food banks. ""People don't understand the importance of food banks,"" she says, or how widely they are now being used. When they had emptied their cupboards, using up the baked beans and cereals, she said they were ""not eating"". ""I don't know what we would have done without the food bank."" When government food parcels did arrive, she didn't like to complain that much of it contained dairy products, when her mother was lactose intolerant. As a full-time carer she is entitled to a carer's allowance of about Â£67 per week - and the Carers UK charity is pushing for an increase. But even with other benefits on top, Christie says her current reality is ""spending every penny on food, rent and bills"". Every other cost that comes along, ""like something breaking down"", means borrowing and that creates another second wave of financial problems. What makes it tougher, says Christie, is the lack of recognition for such carers, protecting the people they love, but spending their waking hours looking after someone and being trapped without any money. During the lockdown, she says the sense of being invisible and forgotten has been even more intense. She has remained behind her door - and doesn't expect to be outside until the end of July, so as not to ""put mum in jeopardy"". In the past, she says there were some respite hours available to people caring for relatives - but that has gone. And she calls for a more consistent approach for support available for carers. The study from academics at Birmingham and Sheffield universities suggests that unpaid carers are twice as likely to have used food banks during the pandemic, compared to the general population. Professor Sue Yeandle of Sheffield University says this should ""shock the nation"". ""It cannot be right that carers are hidden from view, with declining mental wellbeing or face hunger or food poverty,"" she says. The chief executive of Carers UK, Helen Walker, says: ""Surely when the majority of carers are providing even more care for relatives during this pandemic, and spending more to do so, they deserve some help?"" A spokeswoman from the Department for Health and Social Care said: ""The government is hugely grateful for the crucial role that carers play, especially during this unprecedented period and we recently announced an extra Â£63m to support people struggling to afford food and other essentials due to coronavirus. ""The rate of carer's allowance was recently increased and we are working closely with carers organisations to further support carers during this outbreak, including funding to extend Carers UK's helpline opening times so unpaid carers are able to access trusted information and advice.""

Food voucher U-turn after Rashford campaignThe Manchester United star praises the government for agreeing to fund free school meals in England this summer.UK,"This video can not be played Marcus Rashford: ""I'm grateful the prime minister changed his decision"" About 1.3m children in England will be able to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays, after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. The Manchester United forward, 22, welcomed the six-week voucher for eligible children, saying: ""Look at what we can do when we come together."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the move was a ""welcome U-turn"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised Mr Rashford's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". During the coronavirus lockdown the government is providing vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals. But it had insisted this would not continue outside of term time. This prompted the England squad footballerto pen an open letterto MPs. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday evening, Mr Rashford said he was ""grateful that the prime minister did change his decision"". The credibility factor: why policy u-turns matter Who gets free school meals? Live reaction as school meal fund promised NI only part of UK not to extend free school meals The footballer said he spoke with Mr Johnson on the phone earlier and that the PM thanked him ""for using what I've built in a positive manner"". ""He was just grateful that someone had an opinion and shared it with people,"" Mr Rashford added. ""Being that voice for people who didn't really have the platform to speak out as much as they would like to."" At the daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Mr Johnson said: ""I talked to Marcus Rashford today and congratulated him on his campaign which to be honest I only became aware of very recently, today - and I thank him for what he's done."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I only became aware of Marcus Rashford's campaign today"" ""Clearly free schools meals should generally apply in term time... but we have to understand the pressure that families are under right now,"" he said. ""It will help the kids from the families that really need it."" All children eligible for free school meals in term time in England will benefit from the ""Covid summer food fund"", Downing Street said. Scotland and Wales will also continue with the voucher programme, while Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has said she will be proposing that the scheme be extended over the summer ""if the necessary finances can be secured"". This video can not be played Man Utd's Rashford speaks about mother's sacrifices in his bid to end food poverty The support in England works out at about Â£15 a week per recipient, and will cost around Â£120m.

In a statement ""to all MPs""posted on Twitter,external, Mr Rashford said he was ""thankful"" that they had given families ""one less thing to worry about"". Allow Twitter content?

For weeks, campaigners have been calling for free school meals to be offered during the holidays. 'We go hungry so we can feed our children' Court action threatened over school meal vouchers Many families whose children qualify for free meals have since the lockdown began been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth Â£15 each week per pupil, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. Almost 1.3 million school children in England - accounting for 15.4% of state-educated pupils - were eligible for and claiming free school meals in January 2019,according to the latest available data,external. Last year's figures showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were getting the free meals. The prime minister's official spokesman said the food vouchers to cover the six-week holiday period were a response to the ""unique circumstances of the pandemic"" and would not continue beyond the summer. Referring to Mr Rashford, he added: ""The PM welcomes his contribution to the debate around poverty and respects the fact that he has been using his profile as a leading sportsman to highlight important issues."" As a striker with a killer instinct in front of goal, Marcus Rashford is used to beating defences. And he's cut straight through a nervous defensive wall of Conservative ministers - leaving them wrong-footed and facing an embarrassing own goal. A number of Tory MPs had already voiced their disquiet - and how many of them really wanted to find themselves up against an England football hero, and the risk of children going hungry? The U-turn means the government will pay the extra Â£120m to extend free school meal vouchers across the six weeks of the holidays, available to 1.3 million children. It's a one-off deal for the unprecedented pressure caused by the coronavirus - with food banks warning of growing demands. But Mr Rashford, and his 2.7 million Twitter followers, proved a tough target for the government - and he's beaten them with a fast-footed appeal directly to public opinion. Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey waswidely criticised for a comment she madein response to Mr Rashford's campaign. Mr Rashford had asked others to think about struggling parents who have had their ""water turned off"", and whose children have gone hungry. Ms Coffey replied to his Twitter thread on free school meals, saying ""water cannot be disconnected"" - prompting the footballer to say he was ""concerned"" she had only acknowledged part of his message. Among Tory MPs praising the U-turn was Tim Loughton, who said he was ""delighted"" the government had ""listened to Conservative backbenchers"". Opposition parties also welcomed the move - while Manchester United said Mr Rashford was a ""hero"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, who wrote to the chancellor about the issue last week, said she was pleased ministers had ""seen sense and changed their minds"". Sonja from near Basingstoke, who has three teenage children, said the government's change of heart was ""wonderful"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive she found herself out of work and relying on benefits because of the pandemic. The free school meals vouchers have been a lifeline so far, Sonja says, adding that she was grateful to Mr Rashford for his campaign. ""[The U-turn] takes away that worry of the six-week summer holiday and makes it so much less stressful."" she said. But she added: ""I feel sad that it had to be a campaign. They have been throwing money to keep everyone afloat but left behind people on universal credit and free school meals."" Dev Sharma, Youth MP for Leicestershire, said the vouchers have been a safety net for his family and expressed his delight the government has decided to fund them over the summer after all. Dev Sharma is a member of the Bite Back youth campaign for better nutrition for young people The 15-year-old said the move ""means the world"" to him and his brother ""to know that my mum and dad have now sufficient funds to feed [us] over six weeks"". ""I can now have access to a decent meal and be on the same level as my peers from more affluent backgrounds,"" he said. DIET AND IMMUNITY:How important is diet for the immune system? CORONAVIRUS QUIZ:Debunk the myths Several charities have praised Mr Rashford's campaign. Andrew Forsey, chief executive of Feeding Britain, said the footballer has ""done incredibly well for himself, but hasn't forgotten his roots"". But Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the government's scheme ""only covers a minority of children in poverty and the pressures are much wider than just school meals"". She said ""soaring numbers of families"" were having to rely on foodbanks to get through the pandemic, even with the voucher scheme in place. Does you child qualify for free school meals?
