"Celtic and Rangers held, Saints win","FT: Celtic 1-1 Partick Thistle (Sinclair; Azeez) - Cerny saved Sinclair penalty at 1-1 FT: Kilmarnock 0-0 Rangers - Rangers 12 points behind Aberdeen FT: St Johnstone 1-0 Hearts (Shaughnessy) - Nicholson sent off for Hearts, Saints go five points clear of Hearts FT: Motherwell 0-0 Hamilton Academical - MacKinnon sent off for Accies Andy Burke Not a night littered with goals in the Premiership but some big results. Partick Thistle produced an excellent display to become just the third team this season to deny champions Celtic all three points. Ade Azeez cancelled out Scott Sinclair's opener before Tomas Cerny denied Sinclair from the penalty spot to earn his side a point. St Johnstone were deserved 1-0 winners over Hearts, whose night was made even worse by Sam Nicholson's red card over an alleged spitting incident. Kilmarnock and Rangers played out a 0-0 draw at Rugby Park and Motherwell and Hamilton could not produce a goal either in the Lanarkshire derby. That's it for this evening. Thanks for your company and contributions. Goodnight. FT: St Johnstone 1-0 Hearts Hearts manager Ian Cathrowas asked onBBC Radio Scotlandabout people questioning his poor win ratio since taking charge. ""They are right to question that,"" Cathro said.Â ""That run is one that is unacceptable for this club, it's unacceptable for me. It's the situation that we're in. None of those things can be changed.Â ""The only thing we can focus on is making sure we improve."" FT: St Johnstone 1-0 Hearts St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright on BBC Radio Scotland: ""Hearts kept the ball pretty well in the first 10 or 15 minutes without creating one chance.Â ""Once that spell was over the game opened up. We were the dominant team throughout and probably should have been up at half time. The win was fully deserved. ""I can't speak highly enough of the players. There was a lot of good play and there was a lot of character tonight. They've been superb all season and tonight was another good performance."" FT: Celtic 1-1 Partick Thistle Celtic manager Brendan Rodgerstalking to BBC Sportsound: ""In the first half we had good control and good interplay but we were missing that bit of penetration to get behind Partick, who were very well organised. ""After we score, we made changes and there's a bit of disruption which they take advantage of.Â ""Scotty will be disappointed not to score the penalty and then Partick showed why they haven't been conceding too many goals. ""I'm proud of the players because sometimes a game like that can get away from you. ""Our job is to peak for the semi final [against Rangers on 23 April]. If there was a game to give some players rest, tonight was it. I'm pleased to give game time to a few that needed it. Eboue [Kouassi] made his first start and Tom Rogic is back."" FT: Motherwell 0-0 Hamilton Kenny CrawfordBBC Sport Scotland at Fir Park To put a positive spin on this for both sides, this is
Motherwell's first clean sheet in 16 attempts in all competitions, while
hamilton have now taken four points from their last six. This stalemate will be remembered for the goal that might
have been - Ben Heneghan's header cleared by Accies' Alex D'Acol, but did it

Much better in the second half in terms of keeping the ball and creating openings.Â ""I thought they were going to nick the win because we've lost a late goal here before. Delighted with the point. It was a good performance."" FT: Kilmarnock 0-0 Rangers Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha on Sky Sports: ""We need to show initiative. ""If one team deserves to be the winner, it should be us.

FT: St Johnstone 1-0 Hearts Allan PrestonBBC Scotland summariser at McDiarmid Park It (the red card) is 100% for spitting. He doesn't spit on the linesman. He steps away from the linesman, goes on his tip-toes, arches his back and spits. The linesman clearly thinks it's aimed at him, that's the reason he's put his flag up. He's called the referee over and Sam Nicholson has been sent off for spitting.  FT: Kilmarnock 0-0 Rangers Kilmarnock manager Lee McCulloch:""We really took the game to Rangers. All in all, delighted with the point. ""Delighted with how the boys showed resilience at the end. ""Maybe a bit unfortunate not nick it in the end but if we're being realistic, we'll take a point. ""Every point's a prisoner as they say."" FT: Celtic 1-1 Partick Thistle Pat BonnerFormer Celtic goalkeeper on BBC Sportsound  Celtic looked in control after Sinclair's opening goal but there was total confusion when Emilio Izaguirre went off and they had no one at left-back, with Partick Thistle taking advantage.  @bbcsportscot & facebook.com/bbcsportscotland  Allow Twitter content?

A fiercely contested affair at Fir Park but neither side able to find the breakthrough. Darian MacKinnon plays the game right on the edge and he saw red after allegedly - and we await conformation of this - gesturing at a Motherwell fan. With a man advantage it will be Motherwell who will be the more frustrated side this evening at failing to take all three points. A terrific point for Partick Thistle at the home of the champions. When Scott Sinclair gave Celtic a second half lead it looked like it would be a routine win for Brendan Rodgers' side, but Ade Azeez hit back for Thistle and Thistle Tomas Cerny saved a Sinclair penalty to ensure his side secured a share of the spoils. Celtic drop league points for just the third time this season. St Johnstone move five points ahead of Hearts in the Premiership table after a deserved victory at McDiarmid Park. Joe Shaugnessy's second half goal proved to be the winner, and another miserable night for Hearts was completed with Sam Nicholson's red card. Tricky times for Ian Cathro who just can't seem to build up any sort of momentum at Hearts. Celtic 1-1 Partick Thistle Tom EnglishBBC Scotland chief sports writer at Celtic Park This has suddenly got very, very interesting. Everybody
in this stadium will have assumed that when Scott Sinclair scored then that,
pretty much, was that. Then Ade Azeez shocked the place with the equaliser.Â Everybody got noisy again when that penalty was awarded, then everybody
fell quiet again when Sinclair missed. Little happened in the first half.
Everything happening now.Â It ends in probably the right result. Neither side really did enough to win and there was a distinct lack of cutting edge at both ends of the park. St Johnstone 1-0 Hearts Martin DowdenBBC Sport Scotland It's simply unarguable that St Johnstone don't deserve three points. They've created good chances and looked head and shoulders above this Hearts side. They're on course for a five-point lead over their visitors and given the run Hearts are on, it's hard to see that being overhauled. Sam Nicholson's ordering off has just put the seal on another disappointing evening for Ian Cathro's side.

Inside GCHQ's operations centre,"This video can not be played Security correspondent Gordon Corera has had a rare tour of GCHQ The operations centre sits on one of the upper floors of GCHQ and runs 24/7. At any one time, a team of analysts might be monitoring the kidnap of a British citizen abroad or an ongoing counter-terrorist operation run jointly with MI5. In one corner, a large globe visualises all the cyber attacks targeting the UK from around the world. The room is a reminder of the range of activity that GCHQ is involved in - as well as its global reach in monitoring communications and data flows. Russian cyber attacks are high up the agenda, in the wake of claims Moscow interfered in the US election and is trying the same in Europe. ""We have been watching Russian cyber activity since the mid 1990s,""GCHQ's outgoing director, Robert Hannigan, tells the BBC. ""The scale has changed. They've invested a lot of money and people in offensive cyber behaviour and critically they've decided to do reckless and interfering things in European countries."" Mr Hannigan says that whilst it is impossible to be absolutely sure, the defences against such attacks seem to have held in the UK. One of his legacies will be thecreation of the National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of GCHQ which is based in London and is much more public facing in providing protective advice to the country about the threats in cyberspace. Terrorism sits alongside cyber threats on the agenda. So-called Islamic State - or ISIL - has proved adept at exploiting the power of the internet. The Queen visits the National Cyber Security Centre - part of intelligence agency GCHQ ""It's one of their most important assets. As they are defeated on the ground, the 'online caliphate' will become more important. ""They will continue to try to use the media to crowd-source terrorism to get people around the world to go and commit acts of violence on their behalf... ""There are things we can do to contest ISIL in this media space... but it's not just for governments to do operations online. It's for the companies and for the rest of media and society to have the will to drive this material off the internet..."" When hetook over as head of GCHQ in 2014, Mr Hannigan launched what was seen as a broadside against technology companies - arguing they were in denial about the way they were used by terrorist groups to communicate and spread their message. In the wake of the Westminster attack, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that companies should not offer a safe space for terrorists to hide - a reference to thedevelopment of end-to-end encryption serviceswhich make it impossible to provide the content of communications, even on production of a warrant. GCHQ, as well as trying to break codes, also works to secure communications and so treads a fine line. ""Encryption matters hugely to the safety of citizens and to the economy.... The home secretary is talking about a particular problem - that this strong encryption is being abused by terrorists and criminals... ""Our best way forward is to sit down with the tech companies..."" Robert Hannigan steps down as GCHQ boss on Friday after nearly three years in the job The other area of tension with firms has been over extremist content hosted on websites. Here, government has recently been placing pressure on the companies to be more proactive in taking down content rather than waiting for it to be reported to them. ""I think they have moved a long way [but] there's further to go,"" Mr Hannigan says. ""When I started the job in 2014 they really were reluctant to accept responsibility for anything they carried on their networks - whether that was terrorism, child sexual exploitation or any other kind of crime."" GCHQ can detect the work of hackers around the globe The threat from IS has been particularly acute in Europe in the last few years. That has driven increased security co-operation - so will Brexit be a problem? ""I don't think so, because the intelligence-sharing has never been through EU structures and national security has never been part of the European Union's remit. ""It's simply a statement of fact that we have very, very strong intelligence and security and defence capabilities and we bring a lot to Europe and to our European partners..."" The relationship with the US is by far the deepest, which he says will not change under the Trump administration. ""It's the most powerful weapon we have against terrorism in particular and has massively paid dividends in the last 10 years."" In recent weeks, there wascontroversy after reports claimed the Obama administration asked GCHQ to spyon President-elect Donald Trump. GCHQ took the unusual step of publicly denying this. ""We get crazy conspiracy theories thrown at us every day,"" Mr Hannigan says. ""We ignore most of them. On this occasion it was so crazy that we felt we should say so and we have said it's a ridiculous suggestion."" A globe in the operations centre visualises the cyber attacks targeting the UK Deep underground, beneath the grass sit a series of cavernous computer halls. The noise is at points overwhelming. Much effort goes into cooling the machines. Some of the endless racks contain off-the-shelf server technology but large specialist supercomputers sit alongside which are used by the cryptanalysts for code-breaking. The exact specifications of these machines and just how much computing power sits in Cheltenham is classified largely to keep other states - primarily the Russians and Chinese -  guessing. ""It's impossible to do counterterrorism or cyber security without that kind of power,"" Mr Hannigan explains, arguing that the challenge remains finding the small needle in the haystack of the massive volume of data on the internet. Another aspect of Mr Hannigan's legacy will be the push for greater transparency and openness. ""It's very important in a democracy to have the consent of the public as well as the legislation in place and to explain that everything we do is under the law,"" Mr Hannigan says. He took over an agency bruised by the Edward Snowden revelations and allegations of ""mass surveillance"". ""Obviously a debate on privacy and greater transparency are good things - but it was perfectly possible to do that and indeed it was happening anyway without the damage that the Snowden revelations did. The same is true of the WikiLeaks disclosures."" Mr Hannigan says he and the organisation remain optimistic, rather than pessimistic, about the spread of technology. ""Technology and the internet are overwhelmingly brilliant things for human progress,"" Mr Hannigan says. ""Unfortunately there will always be people who want to abuse the latest technology. And it's our job to deal with that dark side."" Mr Hannigan's successor, Jeremy Fleming, formerly Deputy Director of MI5, takes over on Friday.

How France's alt-right seeks to sway election,"The most distinctive feature of France's alt-right is its youth France, despite its reputation as a beacon of progressive liberalism, has been at the forefront of a burgeoning pan-European far-right movement. Marine Le Pen, an anti-immigration Eurosceptic who may well top the first round of France's presidential election on 23 April, is riding a populist insurgency that has been growing over the past 15 years. Its themes are familiar in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit: concern for hardworking people, support for traditional values, and opposition to immigration and supranational busybodies. But the most distinctive characteristic of France's patriotic surge is youth. Unlike their contemporaries in the US and the UK, the under-30s in France are more nationalistic than the general population. At the radical end of the movement are the ""identitaires"", or identitarians - the equivalent of the American alt-right. Their standard bearers are GÃ©nÃ©ration Identitaire (GI), a group that specialises in publicity stunts that it films and posts online to advertise its fight to reclaim French territory said to have been lost to foreign migrants. In 2012 GI occupied a mosque in Poitiers, a city historically linked with resistance to Muslims GI has 120,000 Facebook fans - almost twice as many as the youth wings of the Socialist Party and the centre-right Republicans combined. Unlike the skinheads of old, the group sticks to non-violence. The iPhone, it has found, is mightier than the boot. France votes:  on the BBC The five main candidates are (L-R) Francois Fillon, Benoit Hamon, Marine Le Pen, Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Luc Melenchon Is Marine Le Pen far right? Macron: Ambitious man on the move One-time favourite devoured by 'fake jobs' affair Fillon payment inquiry: What you need to know Who are the candidates? Inside France's young far right Following a group of activists handing out flyers in Paris, however, it is clear that they relish verbal confrontation. Their leader Pierre Larti, 26, stands surrounded by a group of North African men. ""When I read this leaflet I understand that you don't want me here,"" one says. ""What we don't want is the replacement of our values by Islamic ones,"" replies Mr Larti. ""France is historically a Christian country. I'm not criticising anyone. What happens in your land is your business.  What happens here is ours.  We are against colonisation, and this is why we don't want the same phenomenon to happen in reverse."" ""This is OUR homeland,"" the French identitarians insist Oddly, perhaps, for a group passionately attached to national differences, GI is sprouting branches across Europe. But identitarians see the whole continent as a battleground between European and Islamic culture. Jean-Yves Le Gallou, a former Euro-MP, speaks of a struggle for ""civilisational"" identity. ""Whether you are Dutch, German or French,"" he says, ""you have the same problem and have the same view of the world."" Mr Le Gallou, 69, has produced a video entitled Being European (""Europe is not a globalised, borderless space. Europe is not African or Muslim territory."") that has been viewed more than 3.2m times on YouTube in less than two years - three times as many as Being French, a sister video extolling his homeland. Mr Le Gallou's website, Polemia, stands at the high-brow end of France's identitarian spectrum. In the 1970s, he was a leading member of the Nouvelle Droite, an influential group of far-right thinkers. His continued influence is testament to the deep intellectual roots of the identitarian movement. It also highlights the power of new media. Without the internet, Mr Le Gallou and others would have no mass audience. Their warnings against the ""Great Replacement"" of locals by immigrants are no-go areas for mainstream journalists. Shut out by traditional media, identitarians have thrived on the web over the past decade. One of the online stars is Fdesouche, a news aggregator that features links to articles and clips from mainstream sites selected to chronicle chaos in migrant suburbs. Fdesouche offers no comment, but leaves readers to draw their own conclusions: Islamists and""racaille""(""rabble"" - code for dark-skinned criminals) are threatening to take over the country, one housing estate at a time. Fdesouche gets about 3m views per month, dwarfing the websites of mainstream politicians. Emmanuel Macron, a centrist with a devoted following of hipsters, manages less than 1m. Fdesouche's success has spawned a swarm of imitators and rivals. Is France's online far right a threat to democracy? Often collectively called the ""fachosphÃ¨re"" (from ""fascist""), websites denouncing mass immigration and Islam have seen spectacular growth in France over the past 10 years. And France's cyber-patriots are a diverse lot. Read more here from Henri Astier's investigation One fault line divides new-model identitarians, who view Muslims as the main threat, from traditionalists who believe the chief malevolent force in the world is ""Zionism"". The most prominent anti-Zionist is Alain Soral. His website, ÃgalitÃ© et Reconciliation (E&R), weaves nationalist and left-wing themes by calling for solidarity with people from poor countries. Soral rejects accusations of ""anti-Semitism"". He sees a clear distinction between ""ordinary Jews"" and what he calls the organised Jewish lobby, which he says is persecuting him. He sympathises with native French people, but feels identitarians are focusing on the wrong target. By ""inciting poor whites to turn against blacks and Muslims"" they were doing the work of Zionists, he told the BBC. Alain Soral has been prosecuted dozens of times for incitement Alain Soral is regularly prosecuted for incitement. But he is no bit-part player. E&R has more readers than Fdesouche, and by some measures is France's most popular political website. Various parts of the online alt-right may be firing from different directions, but their target is the same: the political and media establishment. Such resentment is not the preserve of the identitarian fringe, or of people languishing in neglected provinces. Opposition to liberal elites and concern about the disappearance of borders are widespread, and increasingly being aired in the heart of Paris. At Sciences Po, an institution that trains the next generation of government and business leaders. Eurosceptic students have set up a club, ""Critique of European Reason"" (CRE), to wage the fight where it matters. Its leader, Nicolas Pouvreau, says the group has managed to ""create a Eurosceptic safe space in an environment that remains hostile."" Another member, Sarah Knafo, says the rising popularity of Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) - France's largest party - has earned the group a grudging respect on campus: ""We represent something bigger than us, and people dare not despise us as much as they used to."" Last year's Brexit vote in the UK thrilled CRE members. The next morning they gathered outside the UK embassy to drink champagne and sing God Save the Queen. Beyond hostility to the EU, CRE members regard uncontrolled migration and trade flows as a source of social disintegration. It would be wrong to label Critique of European Reason as far-right. The group brings together one-nation activists from both the left and the right who have much more in common with one another than with the moderates in their respective camps. This video can not be played Student Paul Zurkinden gives his perspective on Euroscepticism Kevin, another CRE student who supports hard-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, is as hostile to multiculturalism as the conservatives within the group. Having lived in an immigrant banlieue (suburb) he says he has often been called ""dirty white"", and says the mainstream press denies the reality of ""anti-white racism"". Unfashionable as they are, these feelings are widespread among those who have left the banlieues. ""I have suffered from being white,"" says Ugo Iannuzzi, a Sorbonne student. ""I have often cried. I used to go to school with fear in my stomach. You start to feel bad about being white, about being French and loving your origins because you get beaten up, your phone gets stolen and glasses smashed."" Mr Iannuzzi supports the FN.  But his resentment of the political and media elites mirrors that of left-wingers like Mr Vercin. Alexandre Devecchio, a journalist and author of abook on various tribes of young French rebels,external, calls all those preoccupied with the erosion of identity the ""Zemmour generation"". Eric Zemmour is an influential writer-broadcaster who argues that the 1968 revolt has led France to ruin. Many of today's twentysomethings, Mr Devecchio argues, agree with Zemmour because they feel let down. Born after the fall of the Berlin Wall, they were expected to blossom in an open, rainbow society within a pacified, post-historical Europe. Mr Devecchio edits Figarovox, a website for vigorous debate set up by Le Figaro newspaper ""For that generation, reality did not follow the script,"" Mr Devecchio told the BBC. What they have experienced is unemployment, insecure jobs, and a sense of physical and cultural insecurity in areas where radical Islam is on the rise, he believes. Could the identitarians and the wider Zemmour generation help Marine Le Pen win power? At the moment that appears unlikely. Ms Le Pen lacks the backing of a major party, and is expected to be defeated by any second-round opponent. But she can draw comfort from the fact that polls have underestimated the support of other populist leaders. High abstention levels could also help her. The instinct to rally around whoever runs against the FN is much weaker now than in the past. Polls suggest that half the voters backing hard-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon would either abstain or back Ms Le Pen in a second round against Emmanuel Macron. And should she lose the race, the setback could be temporary if her victorious opponent fails to bring about reform. Identitarianism feeds on pessimism. The country's patriotic rebels are young and may have time on their side. Is France's online far right a threat to democracy? Inside France's young far-right.

Sleeping with a stranger to save your marriage,"A number of online services are charging ""divorced"" Muslim women thousands of pounds to take part in ""halala"" Islamic marriages, a BBC investigation has found. Women pay to marry, have sex with and then divorce a stranger, so they can get back with their first husbands. Farah - not her real name - met her husband after being introduced to him by a family friend when she was in her 20s. They had children together soon afterwards but then, Farah says, the abuse began. ""The first time he was abusive was over money,"" she tells the BBC'sAsian NetworkandVictoria Derbyshire programme. ""He dragged me by my hair through two rooms and tried to throw me out of the house. There would be times where he would just go crazy."" Despite the abuse, Farah hoped things would change. Her husband's behaviour though became increasingly erratic - leading to him ""divorcing"" her via text message. ""I was at home with the children and he was at work. During a heated discussion he sent me a text saying, 'talaq, talaq, talaq'."" ""Triple talaq"" - where a man says ""talaq"", or divorce, to his wife three times in a row - is a practice which some Muslims believe ends an Islamic marriage instantly. It is banned in most Muslim countries but still happens, though it is impossible to know exactly how many women are ""divorced"" like this in the UK. ""I had my phone on me,"" Farah explains, ""and I just passed it over to my dad. He was like, 'Your marriage is over, you can't go back to him.'"" This video can not be played Farah would have had to consummate her halala marriage Farah says she was ""absolutely distraught"", but willing to return to her ex-husband because he was ""the love of my life"". She says her ex-husband also regretted divorcing her. This led Farah to seek the controversial practice known as halala, which is accepted by a small minority of Muslims who subscribe to the concept of a triple talaq. They believe halala is the only way a couple who have been divorced, and wish to reconcile, can remarry. Halala involves the woman marrying someone else, consummating the marriage and then getting a divorce - after which she is able to remarry her first husband. But in some cases, women who seek halala services are at risk of being financially exploited, blackmailed and even sexually abused. It's a practice the vast majority of Muslims are strongly against and is attributed to individuals misunderstanding the Islamic laws around divorce. But an investigation by the BBC has found a number of online accounts offering halala services, several of which are charging women thousands of pounds to take part in temporary marriages. One man, advertising halala services on Facebook, told an undercover BBC reporter posing as a divorced Muslim woman that she would need to pay Â£2,500 and have sex with him in order for the marriage to be ""complete"" - at which point he would divorce her. The man also said he had several other men working with him, one who he claims initially refused to issue a woman a divorce after a halala service was complete. There is nothing to suggest the man is doing anything illegal. The BBC contacted him after the meeting - he rejects any allegations against him, claiming he has never carried out or been involved in a halala marriage and that the Facebook account he created was for fun, as part of a social experiment. In her desperation to be reunited with her husband, Farah began trying to find men who were willing to carry out a halala marriage. ""I knew of girls who had gone behind families' backs and had it done and been used for months,"" she says. ""They went to the mosque, there was apparently a designated room where they did this stuff and the imam or whoever offers these services, slept with her and then allowed other men to sleep with her too."" Khola Hasan says halala services are ""abusing vulnerable people"" But the Islamic Sharia Council in East London, which regularly advises women on issues around divorce, strongly condemns halala marriages. ""This is a sham marriage, it is about making money and abusing vulnerable people,"" says Khola Hasan from the organisation. ""It's haram, it's forbidden. There's no stronger word I can use. There are other options, like getting help or counselling. We would not allow anyone to go through with that. You do not need halala, no matter what,"" she adds. Farah ultimately decided against getting back with her husband - and the risks of going through a halala marriage. But she warns there are other women out there, like her, who are desperate for a solution. ""Unless you're in that situation where you're divorced and feeling the pain I felt, no-one's going to understand the desperation some women feel.

What are the European Parliament's 'red lines' on Brexit?,"Michel Barnier (R), European Chief Negotiator for Brexit and Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission will pay a key role in negotiations The European Parliament has overwhelmingly approved a non-binding resolution that lays out its views on the Brexit negotiations. The parliament will have no formal role in shaping the Brexit talks. The negotiations will be led by the European Commission on behalf of the EU's remaining 27 member states. Their draft negotiating guidelines wereissued last week. But the parliament's views still matter because under the Article 50 rules it will get a vote on the final EU-UK ""divorce"" deal and if it does not like what has been agreed it could demand changes and delay the process. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris teases out some of the key sentences from the resolution and explains their significance. - A revocation of notification needs to be subject to conditions set by all EU-27, so that it cannot be used as a procedural device or abused in an attempt to improve on the current terms of the United Kingdom's membership; This is interesting. It implies that the European Parliament thinks the UK can change its mind about Article 50 (whereas the UK government has implied the opposite). The truth is that irrevocability is the subject of legal dispute and, as this is a matter of interpreting a European treaty, the ultimate arbiter would be the European Court of Justice. Either way, the parliament makes clear here that it would not allow the UK to plead for a better deal if it tried to return - even the package of measures offered to David Cameron in February 2016 (remember this?) is now null and void. - Reiterates the importance of the withdrawal agreement and any possible transitional arrangement(s) entering into force well before the elections to the European Parliament of May 2019; In theory the two-year Article 50 negotiating period could be extended if all parties agreed, but no-one really wants that to happen. And this is one of the reasons why the timetable is so tight. If the UK was still part of the European Union in May 2019, it might have to hold elections to elect British MEPs, despite being on the verge of leaving. It would raise all sorts of complications that the European Parliament is determined to avoid. - Stresses that the United Kingdom must honour all its legal, financial and budgetary obligations, including commitments under the current multiannual financial framework, falling due up to and after the date of its withdrawal; Another reminder of the looming fight about settling the accounts (also known as the divorce bill). Parliament insists that the UK must honour all its commitments under the current multiannual financial framework - a kind of long-term budget -  which runs until 2020. Because of the way the EU budget process works, that would mean the UK would have to help pay for things like infrastructure projects in poorer EU countries several years after it had left the Union. - States that, whatever the outcome of the negotiations on the future European Union-United Kingdom relationship, they cannot involve any trade-off between internal and external security including defence co-operation, on the one hand and the future economic relationship, on the other hand; I think this is probably cleared up by now, but the implied link between security co-operation and trade in Theresa May's Article 50 letter raised a few eyebrows elsewhere in the EU. Cooler heads suggested it was there for domestic consumption and the UK government said it was all a misunderstanding. But the parliament is putting down an explicit marker that trade-offs between security and the future economic relationship won't be acceptable. - Stresses that any future agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom is conditional on the UK's continued adherence to the standards provided by international obligations, including human rights and the Union's legislation and policies, in, among others, the field of the environment, climate change, the fight against tax evasion and avoidance, fair competition, trade and social rights, especially safeguards against social dumping; The resolution suggests that the future relationship could be built upon an agreement under which the UK would have to accept EU standards over a wide range of policy areas from climate change to tax evasion. In some areas that might be exactly what the UK government wants to do anyway, given that the UK has played a leading role in forging those policy positions in the first place. But domestic politics in the UK means any wholesale acceptance of EU policies could be a tough sell. - Believes that transitional arrangements ensuring legal certainty and continuity can only be agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom if they contain the right balance of rights and obligations for both parties and preserve the integrity of the European Union's legal order, with the Court of Justice of the European Union responsible for settling any legal challenges; believes, moreover, that any such arrangements must also be strictly limited both in time - not exceeding three years - and in scope, as they can never be a substitute for European Union membership; Two important points here. Firstly, the parliament is determined that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would continue to run during any transition period. The draft guidelines produced by the European Council last week made the same point but in less explicit language. If it wants a transition, the UK will have to accept a role for the ECJ. Secondly, the parliament says the transition should last no longer than three years, which is a shorter period than some might think necessary.

Syria chemical 'attack': Is Russia's account credible?,"More than 80 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in north-western Syria on 4 April. Hundreds suffered symptoms consistent with reaction to a nerve agent after what the opposition and Western powers said was a Syrian government air strike on the area. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the incident was fabricated, while his ally Russia said an air strike hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions. Witnesses and activists say warplanes attacked Khan Sheikhoun, about 50km (30 miles) south of the city of Idlib, early on 4 April, when many people were asleep. Mariam Abu Khalil, a 14-year-old resident who was awake,told the New York Times,externalthat she had seen an aircraft drop a bomb on a one-storey building. The explosion sent a yellow mushroom cloud into the air that stung her eyes. ""It was like a winter fog,"" she said. She sheltered in her home, but recalled that when people started arriving to help the wounded, ""they inhaled the gas and died"". Hussein Kayal, a photographer for the pro-opposition Edlib Media Center (EMC), wasreported,externalas saying that he was awoken by the sound of an explosion at about 06:30 (03:30 GMT). When he reached the scene, there was no smell, he said. He found people lying on the floor, unable to move and with constricted pupils. Opposition activists said government warplanes dropped bombs containing chemicals Mohammed Rasoul, the head of a charity ambulance service in Idlib, told the BBC that he heard about the attack at about 06:45 and that when his medics arrived 20 minutes later they found people, many of them children, choking in the street. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations (UOSSM), which funds hospitals in rebel-held Syria,said,externalthree of its staff in Khan Sheikhoun were affected while treating patients in the streets and had to be rushed to intensive care. Victims experienced symptoms including redness of the eyes, foaming from the mouth, constricted pupils, blue facial skin and lips, severe shortness of breath and asphyxiation, it added. This video can not be played Rescue workers said many children were among those killed or injured in the attack A Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) medical team supporting the Bab al-Hawa hospital, near the Turkish border,confirmed,externalsimilar symptoms in eight patients brought there from Khan Sheikhoun. Aftermath of attack in pictures(Warning: graphic images) Rescue workers and opposition activists posted photos and videos on social media that showed victims exhibiting the symptoms described by doctors, as well as many people who had died. The EMCposted photos,externalshowing what appeared to be at least seven dead children in the back of a pick-up truck. There were no visible traumatic injuries. The Syrian military insisted it had never used chemical weapons Another photo published by the group showed the bodies of at least 14 men, women and children on a street outside a hospital in Khan Sheikhoun. The opposition-run health directorate in Idlib province - which is almost entirely controlled by rebel fighters and al-Qaeda-linked jihadists -says,externalat least 89 people were killed, including 33 children and 18 women. Another 541 people were injured. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, put the death toll at 86 and said it was likely to rise, with many of the injured in a serious condition in hospital. Witnesses said clinics treating the wounded were subject to air strikes It was also not immediately clear whether anyone was killed when Khan Sheikhoun's main hospital was struck by a rocket on the afternoon of 4 April. The source of the projectile was not clear, but the EMC said warplanes had targeted clinics and the headquarters of the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are known as the White Helmets. The Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weaponssaid,externalon 19 April that bio-medical samples collected from three victims during their post-mortems had been analysed by two OPCW-designated laboratories. The results of the analysis indicated that the victims were exposed to Sarin or a Sarin-like substance. Samples taken from seven survivors showed similar results. ""While further details of the laboratory analyses will follow, the analytical results already obtained are incontrovertible,"" said OPCW head Ahmet Uzumcu. The OPCW says victims were exposed to Sarin or a Sarin-like substance Mr Uzumcu gave no further details, but Turkish Health Minister Recep Akdagsaid,externalon 11 April that traces of one of the decomposition products of Sarin, a chemical known as isopropyl methyphosphonic acid (IMPA), had been detected in the blood and urine of victims brought to Turkey. A declassified report by French intelligence agencies published on 26 Aprilsaid,externalanalysis of environmental samples collected in Khan Sheikhoun had also revealed the presence of Sarin, diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) and hexamine. The report concluded that the Syrian government had manufactured the Sarin because the process of synthesizing the nerve agent developed by the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) and employed by the Syrian armed forces and security services involved the use of hexamine as a stabilizer. DIMP was also known as a by-product generated by this process, it added. What can forensics tell us? A Syrian military statementpublished,externalby state media on 4 April denied the use of ""any chemical or toxic substance"" in Khan Sheikhoun, adding that the military ""has never used them, anytime, anywhere, and will not do so in the future"". President Bashar al-Assad subsequently said the incident was a ""fabrication"" used to justify a UScruise missile strikeon Syria's Shayrat airbase on 7 April. This video can not be played Bashar al-Assad, speaking in an interview approved by the Syrian presidency: ""A 100%... fabrication."" ""Our impression is that the West, mainly the United States, is hand-in-glove with the terrorists. They fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack,"" hetold,externalAFP news agency. Mr Assad insisted that it was ""not clear"" whether an attack had even happened. ""You have a lot of fake videos now,"" he said. ""We don't know whether those dead children were killed in Khan Sheikhoun. Were they dead at all?"" Russia, which has carried out air strikes in support of President Assad since 2015,said,externalthe Syrian air force had struck Khan Sheikhoun ""between 11:30am and 12:30pm local time"" on 4 April, but that the target had been ""a large terrorist ammunition depot"" on its eastern outskirts. Residents of Khan Sheikhoun began burying the victims of the incident the following day ""On the territory of the depot, there were workshops which produced chemical warfare munitions,"" it added, without providing any evidence. ""Terrorists had been transporting chemical munitions from this largest arsenal to the territory of Iraq."" The ministry said the chemical munitions had also been used during the final stages of the battle for control of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo last autumn, asserting that the symptoms of the victims were ""the same"". Syria chemical 'attack': What now? US intelligence agenciesbelieve,externalthe Syrian government struck Khan Sheikhoun in response to a rebel offensive in northern Hama province, and that senior military leaders were probably involved in planning the attack. US military radar systems monitored Syrian Air Force Sukhoi Su-22 fixed-wing aircraft take off from the government-controlled Shayrat airbase on 4 April and fly over Khan Sheikhoun on two occasions - at 06:37 (03:37 GMT) and 06:46. Officialstold,externalNBC News that the radar systems picked up flashes on the ground, indicating that ordnance had been dropped on the rebel-held town about the same time that the first casualties with breathing difficulties were reported. The US said these were the paths of the Syrian Air Force jets that bombed Khan Sheikhoun Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the British Armed Forces Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment, said Russia's assertion that the strikes had hit rebel chemical weapons were ""pretty fanciful"". ""Axiomatically, if you blow up Sarin, you destroy it,"" he told the BBC. The explosion resulting from an air strike on a chemical weapons facility would most likely incinerate any agents. Sarin and other nerve agents are alsousually stocked in a ""binary manner"",external, which means they are kept as two distinct chemical precursors that are combined just before use, either manually or automatically inside a weapon when launched. US satellite imagery identified the impact crater associated with suspected chemical attack ""It's very clear it's a Sarin attack,"" Mr de Bretton-Gordon added. ""The view that it's an al-Qaeda or rebel stockpile of Sarin that's been blown up in an explosion, I think is completely unsustainable and completely untrue."" He also noted that chlorine was the only chemical believed to have been used in attacks in Aleppo over the past year. A recent report by Human Rights Watchsaid,externalgovernment helicopters had dropped bombs containing chlorine on rebel-held areas of Aleppo on at least eight occasions between 17 November and 13 December, killing nine civilians. It was also not clear why there was five hours' difference between the time of the strike reported by multiple witnesses in Khan Sheikhoun and that stated by Russia. Moscow's short account gave no evidence for its suggestion that a group was sending chemical weaponry to Iraq. So-called Islamic State, which has used the the blister agent sulphur mustard in Syria and Iraq, is not present in Khan Sheikhoun. Human Rights Watch said helicopters dropped chlorine bombs over rebel-held Aleppo last year Hasan Haj Ali, commander of the Free Idlib Army rebel group, called Russia's claim a ""lie"" and said rebel fighters did not have the capability to produce nerve agents. Thereport,externalby French intelligence agencies supported that assertion, saying no opposition armed groups in Syria were believed to have the capability to employ a neurotoxic agent, or the air capacities required. It also said the theory of a staged attack or manipulation by the opposition was not credible, citing ""the massive influx in a very limited time towards hospitals in Syria and Turkey, and the simultaneous, massive uploading of videos showing symptoms of the use of neurotoxic agents"". Why is there a war in Syria? Sarin is highly toxic and considered 20 times as deadly as cyanide. As with all nerve agents, Sarin inhibits the action of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which deactivates signals that cause human nerve cells to fire. This blockage pushes nerves into a continual ""on"" state. The heart and other muscles - including those involved in breathing - spasm. Sufficient exposure can lead to death via asphyxiation within minutes. Sarin is almost impossible to detect because it is a clear, colourless and tasteless liquid that has no odour in its purest form. It can also evaporate and spread through the air. The spectre of nerve agents in Syria - again The Syrian government was accused by Western powers of firing rockets filled with Sarin at several rebel-held suburbs of the capital Damascus in August 2013, killing hundreds of people. President Bashar al-Assad denied the charge, blaming rebel fighters, but he did subsequently agree to destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. UN inspectors found rockets containing Sarin were used in a 2013 attack outside Damascus Despite that, the OPCW and UN have continued to document the use of chemicals in attacks. A joint investigation concluded in October that government forces had used chlorine as a weapon at least three times between 2014 and 2015. It also found Islamic State militants had used sulphur mustard in one attack.

Who are contenders for the 2017 Masters?,"This video can not be played The quirky world of Augusta Masters 2017 on the BBC Venue:Augusta NationalDates:6-9 April Coverage:Watch highlights of the first two days before live and uninterrupted coverage of the weekend's action on BBC Two and up to four live streams available online. Listen on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio 5 live sports extra. Read live text commentary, analysis and social media on the BBC Sport website and the sport app. Full details Augusta National. The Green Jacket. Amen Corner. The manicured fairways. The blooming azaleas. Unmistakably, the Masters. Golf's first major of the year is upon us, with the world's finest players making their annual pilgrimage to one of sport's most iconic venues. The first tee shot will be hit at 13:00 BST on Thursday with a field of 94 men aiming to sink the winning putt come Sunday. World number one Dustin Johnson and Northern Ireland's four-time major winner Rory McIlroy head the field in the year's first major. Quiz: Match the Masters winner with his champions dinner. What else do you need to know? Plenty. Here's the lowdown... Plenty of people backedDustin Johnsonto win his first Green Jacket - but that was before the current world number one suffered a backinjurythe day before the tournament started, after a fall at his rented home. Johnson tried to take part in the tournament, butwalked off the first tee on Thursday without playing his shot and withdrew. The American, 32, had been head and shoulders above his rivals over the past nine months, winnnig seven of the 17 tournaments he has played since claiming his first major at theUS Open at Oakmont in June,racking up another seven top-10 finishes in the process. In Johnson's absence,Jordan Spiethwill look to banish memories of last year's spectacular final-day collapse by winning his second Masters. The American, 23, led by five shots as he approached the 10th at Augusta on the Sunday, only to dramatically drop six shots in three holes and allow England's Danny Willett to take advantage. ""No matter what happens at this year's Masters, whether I can grab the jacket back or I miss the cut or I finish 30th, it will be nice having this Masters go by,"" he said earlier this month. ""The Masters lives on for a year. It brings a non-golf audience into golf. And it will be nice once this year has finished to be brutally honest."" Spieth has dropped to sixth in the world rankings since his Masters meltdown, but did claim his first PGA Tour title since May when he won the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am last month. This video can not be played Jordan Spieth's calamitous seven at the par-three 12th World number threeJason Daywill play at Augusta after pulling out of a recent tournament to spend time with his mother, who has been treated for lung cancer. The Australian, 29, broke down in tears after withdrawing from the WGC Match Play a fortnight ago. ""There's been a lot of things go on this year that have been somewhat distracting to my golf,"" he said. ""Golf was the last thing that I was ever thinking about when this first came about. I'm in a much better place now. ""I feel happier to be on the golf course and enjoying myself out here a lot more than I was the last month or two."" Japan'sHideki Matsuyamais bidding to become the first Asian player to win the Masters, having risen to fourth in the world after a stellar finish to the 2016 season. The 25-year-old ended last year with four victories in five tournaments - finishing second in the other - but has not been able to recapture the form in recent weeks. ""I'm really not hitting it as well as I would like, so whether or not my confidence level is where it should be, I'm not sure,"" said Matsuyama, who finished fifth in the 2015 Masters and shared seventh place last year. That is the question we have been asking since McIlroy won the 2014 Open Championship at Hoylake. The Northern Irishman steps on to Augusta's first tee on Thursday (18:41 BST) aiming to become only the sixth man to win all four majors. He is seeking a first Masters title following victories at the US Open, the Open Championship and the US PGA Championship. Winning the Green Jacket would propel the 27-year-old into exalted company alongside Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Gene Sarazen, Gary Player and Ben Hogan. And, after three consecutive top-10 finishes at Augusta, the world number two has made no secret that finally sealing victory is his main priority. ""I don't feel like I can fly under the radar anymore, but at the same time it has been nice to just go about my business and try to get ready for this tournament,"" McIlroy said. ""I've realised that the more I can get comfortable with this golf course and the club as a whole, the better. ""The more I can just play the golf course and almost make it seem like second nature to me, the better."" When the fourth home nations golfer followed in the footsteps of Sandy Lyle, Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam to win the Masters, most expected it would be Rory McIlroy slipping into the iconic wool jacket. Instead it was Danny Willett. The Englishman, playing in only his second Masters, was three shots adrift of Spieth going into Sunday's final round last year, but was catapulted to victory thanks to a superb five-under-par 67 and the Texan's meltdown. What made his triumph even more remarkable was his participation at Augusta had been in doubt. His wife Nicole was due to give birth on the final day, with only the early arrival of baby Zachariah allowing him to play. ""It's going to be awesome to go back as defending champion,"" he said in BBC documentaryWhen Danny Won the Masters. ""I can't wait to take part in all the things you get to take part in, the par three competition, the champion's dinner and see all the other people who've won that golf tournament who are still there to be able to enjoy it with you. This video can not be played Who will follow in Danny Willett's footsteps and pull on the famous green jacket this year? ""It is something that you can't buy in life. You can only earn and the fact that I've earned is going to be something pretty special."" However, Willett has since struggled to match his form over those four days at Augusta. He rose to a career-high ranking of ninth in the world following his maiden major, but has dropped to 17th after managing just four top-10 finishes in the past 12 months. ""The game is not far away,"" said the 29-year-old Yorkshireman. ""Our run of form obviously has been nowhere near what it was last year and nowhere near what some of the other guys are playing."" Willett is one of a record 11 English players in the 94-strong field at Augusta, while Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are also represented. McIlroyis the only Northern Irishman taking part, while Scotland'sSandy Lyleand Wales'Ian Woosnammake their annual return as former champions. England'sJustin Rosehas been a regular top-10 finisher in golf's four majors over the past decade, but only has one victory at the 2013 US Open to show for his efforts. He finished tied 10th at Augusta last year, his fourth top-10 finish at the Masters. UK and Irish hopes Paul Casey (Eng) Ross Fisher (Eng) Matt Fitzpatrick (Eng) Tommy Fleetwood (Eng) Scott Gregory (Eng) Tyrrell Hatton (Eng) Russell Knox (Sco) Shane Lowry (Ire) Sandy Lyle (Sco) Rory McIlroy (NI) Justin Rose (Eng) Andy Sullivan (Eng) Lee Westwood (Eng) Danny Willett (Eng) Chris Wood (Eng) Ian Woosnam (Wal) Tommy Fleetwood, Tyrrell Hattonand English amateur championScott Gregoryare making their Masters debuts this week - no player has won the Masters on their debut since American Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979. Fleetwood, 26, was ranked 188th in the world in September 2016, but has climbed to career-high 32nd after returning to former coach Alan Thompson and employing friend Ian Finnis as his caddie. ""One of the greatest accomplishments I've had in my career was actually qualifying for the Masters,"" said Fleetwood. Gregory, a 22-year-old from Hampshire, secured his place by winning the British Amateur Championship last summer. His preparations have included watching hours of footage from the past four tournaments at Augusta. ""I've watched a lot of clips on YouTube,"" he told BBC South Today. Willett's surprise success ended a long European drought at Augusta, becoming the continent's first winner since Jose Maria Olazabal's success 17 years previously. This year, American players will be hoping to regain their recent dominance. Ten of the previous 16 winners have been home players, with Johnson and Spieth leading the charge alongside fellow top-15 players Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler and Patrick Reed. And rule out left handers Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson at your peril. Between them the veteran pair have five Green Jackets hung up in their wardrobes - three for Mickleson and two for Watson - and are still loitering around the world's top 20. ""I always think I have a chance,"" said 38-year-old Watson, who has won just one PGA Tour title in nearly two years. Strong winds and cool temperatures have been forecast on Thursday and Friday, conditions which 46-year-old Mickelson believes will play into his hands. ""I hope to rely on that knowledge and skill to keep myself in it heading into the weekend where players less experienced with the golf course will possibly miss it in the wrong spots and shoot themselves out,"" said the world number 18. Recent Masters winners 2016: Danny Willett (Eng) 2011: Charl Schwartzel (SA) 2015: Jordan Spieth (US) 2010: Phil Mickelson (US) 2014: Bubba Watson (US) 2009: Angel Cabrera (Arg) 2013: Adam Scott (Aus) 2008: Trevor Immelman (SA) 2012: Bubba Watson (US) 2007: Zach Johnson (US) Twenty years ago at Augusta, Tiger Woods memorably blitzed his way to a first major, the first step towards his impending global superstardom. But the 41-year-old will not be marking the special anniversary by walking the fairways after pulling out this week through injury. The 14-time major winner, who has been plagued by injury problems in recent years, said he is not ""tournament ready"" to tee up at an event with which he is synonymous. The American went on to wear the Green Jacket on another three occasions - 2001, 2002 and 2005 - but has not been able to play in two of the past three tournaments because of long-running back problems. ""I did about everything I could to play at this year's Masters,"" he said. ""I'm especially upset because it's a special anniversary for me that's filled with a lot of great memories. ""I have no timetable for my return, but I will continue my diligent effort to recover, and want to get back out there as soon as possible."" Woods has only played twice this year, missing the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open in January and withdrawing from the following week's Dubai Desert Classic before the second round. Woods is the youngest ever Masters champion, triumphing aged 21 years, 3 months and 14 days in 1997 This year's tournament will be tinged with sadness - but also a cause for celebration - as Augusta pays its own tribute to the man who won four Masters titles and was fondly known as 'The King' in golfing circles. Arnold Palmer, viewed as one of the greatest and most influential players in the sport's history, died at the age of 87 in September. ""His presence at Augusta National will be sorely missed, but his impact on the Masters remains immeasurable - and it will never wane,"" said Billy Payne, chairman of Augusta National, shortly after his death. This video can not be played Arnold Palmer - The man who changed golf One of the most ominous yet anticipated stretch of holes in golf Seeing the sign pointing towards Amen Corner can strike fear into the minds of even the world's best golfers. Amen Corner, a term coined by legendary sports writer Herbert Warren Wind in 1958, geographically refers to the approach to the par-four 11th, all of the short 12th and the first half of the par-five 13th but many tend to think of it as all three holes in their entirety. ""If you can get through those in level par you're a happy man,""says BBC golf commentator Ken Brown. The 11th has overtaken the 10th in recent years as Augusta's most testing. A wind that is difficult to judge and a pond to the left of the green means the 505-yard par four, which has been lengthened by 45 yards since 2002, ranks as Augusta's all-time most difficult hole The par-three 12th is one of the most cherished holes in golf. Unpredictable winds, Rae's Creek, a shallow green... players stride across Hogan Bridge hoping to have avoided serious damage on Augusta's shortest hole The 13th tee offers a rare moment of solitude for Masters hopefuls, on the furthest part of the course from the patrons. The 510-yard par five is the final hole of Amen Corner - but, unlike its unforgiving predecessors, offers a good eagle chance If Jordan Spieth had got through those holes in level par in the final round last year then he, and not Danny Willett, would have won the Green Jacket. The Texan appeared to be cruising towards becoming only the fourth man to win back-to-back Masters, leading by five shots as he approached the 10th. But he twice found the water on the iconic 12th to card a quadruple bogey seven - following successive bogeys on the 10th and 11th holes - to hand the advantage to Willett. Spieth was not the first Masters contender to see their dreams fade on the back nine on the final day, with Greg Norman in 1996 and Rory McIlroy in 2011 immediately springing to mind. One suspects he won't be the last...

However, Augusta members had worn the coloured coats since 1937, encouraged by co-founder Clifford Roberts, so patrons could easily identify ""a source of reliable information"". Once Snead received his Green Jacket, the coat became a symbol of success - and is now one of the most iconic prizes in sport. Winners are allowed to take the jacket home for a year and are rather generously allowed to wear the single-breasted, lightweight jacket ""in public during that time on special occasions"". After that, past champions have a custom-tailored coat waiting for them on their return to the Augusta clubhouse. ""It felt like my old friend was back on my shoulders,"" said 2013 champion Adam Scott when he returned a year later.

Will making India's holiest river a 'person' save it?,"This video can not be played 'Mother' Ganges: India's river becomes a legal person A court in India has declared the Ganges river a legal ""person"" in a fresh effort to save it from pollution. Research associate Shyam Krishnakumar explains how the ruling could help preserve the waterway upon which so many depend. The legal battle to save the Ganges, the lifeline of more than 500 million people across India, has received a fresh boost thanks to a series of rulings by the high court in the north Indian state of Uttarakhand. First the court declared the Ganges and Yamuna rivers to be legal persons. In a subsequent hearing, it also gave this designation to glaciers, including Gangotri and Yamunotri (where the Ganges and Yamuna originate from), rivers, streams, rivulets, lakes, air, meadows, dales, jungles, forests wetlands, grasslands, springs and waterfalls. These verdicts represent a shift from a view that sees nature as a resource to one that considers it an entity with fundamental rights. Other non-human entities that have legal personalities in India include companies, temple deities and trusts. In jurisprudence, nature is considered property with no legal rights. Environmental laws only focus on regulating exploitation. But this is now changing, with calls for the inherent rights of nature to be recognised, both in India and around the world. The Ganges is seen as sacred by Hindus In Ecuador, a new constitution mandates that nature has the right to exist, maintain and regenerate. New Zealand recently granted the Whanganui River personhood status, the culmination of a 140-year legal struggle by the Maori people. Making nature a legal entity means that cases can be brought up directly on its behalf. This has the potential to become a game-changer in legally enforcing environmental protection. For instance, it may no longer be necessary to prove in court that polluting the Ganges actually harms humans. Contamination on its own could be enough to make the case that it violates the river's ""right to life"". India's dying mother - BBC News India holy rivers get legal human status In addition to this, in a related order, the court imposed a blanket ban on new mining licenses for four months and has set up a committee to explore the environmental impact of mining in India's mountainous regions. The Uttarakhand state government is planning to challenge the ban in the Supreme Court. But it is not just mining. The court has also directed the state pollution control board to shut down hotels, industries and ashrams that discharge untreated waste into the river. This is expected to affect over 700 hotels in the tourist areas of Haridwar and Rishikesh alone. These rulings indicate that the court will strictly monitor polluting of the Ganges. The response of the government, however, is yet to be seen. The ruling could be a powerful tool in the fight to save the Ganges from pollution It may no longer be required to prove in court that polluting the Ganges actually harms humans Some aspects of this ruling are still unclear, though. What does a right to life mean for a river or a water body? If it means the right to flow freely, what happens to dams across the Ganges? Enforceability is another issue. Will this ruling be restricted to only the state of Uttarakhand or will it be extended across India? The legal guardians appointed are members of the government. Will they have the independence to appeal against governmental actions like unsustainable canal dredging? Can a citizen bring a case representing a water body? If yes, this can become a powerful legal tool in the hands of communities and activists to safeguard the environment. While radically new from a legal perspective, the case has also been about recognising the traditional Hindu view that regards the universe as a manifestation of the divine. This means that rivers, plants, animals and even the earth are considered sentient divinities with particular forms, qualities and characteristics. Millions of people across India depend on the Ganges for their livelihoods Hindus come from across India to bathe in the waters of the Ganges Personification as a deity cultivates empathy and creates a strong emotional bond with the ecosystem, leading to social norms emphasising conservation. This principle of sacredness and respect has been passed down through the generations through stories and local bio-cultural traditions. In Hinduism, the Ganges is revered as a goddess who purifies a person of all sins. The river is worshipped as ""Ganga Mata"", the divine mother who has sustained life and nurtured civilisation for thousands of years. Expressions of her worship include the Ganga Aarti, where thousands offer lit lamps to the river every evening, and the Kumbh Mela, a pilgrimage of over 100 million people. Can this view that considers rivers, trees and animals sacred, personifies them as deities and reveres them through bio-cultural traditions hold possibilities for sustainability in India? Evidence seems to suggest so. The most famous case is the ""Chipko"" movement of the 1970s where tribal women hugged trees to prevent the felling of their sacred groves. And recently, the north-eastern state of Sikkim became India's first fully organic state in just 10 years, as people saw organic farming as taking their traditional way forward. In the case of the Ganges, the organisers of the Ganga Aarti use the occasion to raise awareness about actions that pollute the river and administer a pledge to keep it clean to thousands every day. When environmental conservation is seen to be in alignment with the cultural context, it drives community involvement.  The High Court's judgement is a welcome step in that direction.

The drink Brits go to bed with and Indians wake up with,"In the UK, Horlicks has long been seen as a soothing bedtime drink ""Comforting, warming, fortifying since 1906,"" is written on the promotional mug Horlicks launched in the UK last year. In Britain, the malted milk drink has long been linked to bedtime, a soothing aid to sleep. In India, it's an entirely different story. ""Taller, stronger, sharper,"" is at the top of theIndian website,external, which has lots of photos of energetic schoolchildren leaping about. In India, Horlicks is a breakfast drink, given to children as an energy boost to fortify them ahead of a long day of learning. Yet the drink's main ingredients are exactly the same: wheat, malted barley and milk. The fact that the same liquid can be perceived in two such different ways is a great example of the ""crazy nonsense and beauty of marketing"", says Andrew Welch. As London managing director for brand consultancy Landor, Mr Welch's job is to help brands build and improve their reputation, and ultimately create higher sales. Horlicks has significantly boosted owner GlaxoSmithKline's non-pharmaceutical sales in India International expansion is often the only way for firms to do this. When domestic growth has stalled, other countries can provide a business with fresh customers potentially in an area with less competition or where demand for a particular product or service is higher. And of course, having a presence in more than one country ensures a firm isn't reliant on the health of just one nation's economy for its success. But how exactly do companies go from being a local firm based in one country to a global name? Mr Welch says how Horlicks has been marketed is a great example of how to do it, with the drink's attributes emphasised in different ways to appeal to specific audiences. The drink has significantly boosted non-pharmaceutical sales in India for its owner, drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline. ""You can't cookie cutter your brand around the world. This is an organisation which has gone beyond its home market and managed to stay relevant,"" says Mr Welch. Or, to use the industry lingo, ""global is out"" and ""multi-local"" is in. A well-known brand in the West, eBay had to change its tactics to succeed in China But it's not easy. Online auction site eBay is one of the world's best-known firms, boasting 167 million active buyers and reporting just shy of $9bn (Â£7bn) in revenues last year. Yet when it first tried to launch in Chinait failed,external. The difficulty of competing with local rivals meant that in 2006, a mere two years after entering China, it was forced to admit defeat and shut down its main website in the country. Instead it formed a joint venture with a local partner to help operate an online auction business in the country. Critics say it failed to recognise that having a strong US brand would not automatically translate to success in China. Airbnb boss Brian Chesky has rebranded itself in China in a bid to make the home rental firm more appealing Home rental site Airbnb is already trying to avoid that mistake, recentlyrebranding itself as ""Aibiying"" in China,external. The name translates as ""welcome each other with love"", and the company reportedly said it would be easier for Chinese people to pronounce. One of the frequent criticisms of globalisation is that it is eroding countries' distinctive differences, making cities everywhere look more and more similar. From Germany to the United Arab Emirates to China you can visit the same shops, buy the same furniture, eat the same food, watch the same programmes and listen to the same music. Chris Hirst, European and UK group chief executive of advertising agency Havas, says firms expanding overseas have to overcome people's natural antipathy to this. ""People don't like the idea of a global phenomenon. They want to feel close to a brand and want it to be relevant to them."" Part of the appeal of luxury firms such as Louis Vuitton is that they're foreign The one exception to this is luxury firms, such as Louis Vuitton or Hermes, who can get away with less local differentiation because their foreignness is part of what makes them desirable, he says. At the other end of the scale, firms such as fast-food chain McDonald's may appear the same in whichever country you go to, but actually works hard to localise its branches, he says. He notes the firm differentiates some menu items to fit in with the local cuisine and tends to source ingredients from the host country. But the number of potential countries a firm can now reach has made it harder. In the 1990s, going global simply meant expanding into western Europe and north America, now countries such as India, China and Russia are all in play, says Mr Hirst. In fact, many of the areas that will generate the most growth in future are currently unfamiliar in the West, according to management consultancy McKinsey. It predicts about 400 midsize emerging-market cities will create nearly 40% of global growth over the next 15 years. ""Increasingly, global means global,"" says Mr Hirst. Tech firms such as Apple consistently are ranked amongst the world's most successful brands In some ways advances in technology have made this easier, enabling firms to be present around the world, even in places where they don't have a physical presence. The latestannual ranking,externalof the world's most valuable brands by consultancy Interbrand is dominated by tech firms. Apple and Google came top for the fourth year in a row. Simon Cotterrell, head of strategy at Interband, says that as well as needing to invest less in infrastructure when they expand, their success is also down to the simplicity of their business models. ""The utility is staring customers in the face and doesn't need an explanation."" In the end, what determines global success for all firms is the same thing that drives success in a company's home market, he says. ""You have to have an offer that meets the needs of that audience. Your relevance has to come back to that problem: are you solving a customer problem in that market? ""It's not brain surgery,"" he says.

Syria chemical 'attack': What now?,"A Civil Defence volunteer uses an oxygen mask to help him breathe. The response to this latest chemical ""attack"" in Syria will provide a measure of just how far the international community has come in struggling with the security crisis in Syria. It also demonstrates the growing calamity in the country where the conflict moves from phase to phase, but shows no sign of ending. Perhaps at the outset it should be established what we know. There seems no doubt that a chemical incident occurred, and there were Syrian government air attacks in the area. The opposition of course has no air force. The West places the blame squarely on the Assad regime. Russia - one of President Assad's few allies - has a different story. It says an air attack hit a weapons dump, thus releasing the chemical agent. All of the Western experts on chemical warfare contacted by the BBC have been highly sceptical about the Russian claim. Syria chemical 'attack': Russia blames rebel weapons Syria conflict: The spectre of nerve agents - again Aftermath of attack in pictures (Warning graphic images) As yet there has been no clear analysis of samples from the location of the strike or from the victims. More information will undoubtedly become available. Reports of the first significant use of chemical weapons - including Sarin nerve agent - by the Assad regime in 2013, prompted the international community's first purposeful diplomatic intervention in the Syrian War. The Obama administration had marked down the use of chemical arms as ""a red line"", which, if crossed, would lead to serious consequences for the Assad regime. In the event, President Obama decided to pull back and avoid military action. The US and Russia came together and brokered a deal under which the Assad regime would give up its chemical arsenal under international inspection. The problem of chemical weapons in Syria appeared to have been resolved. But this was not so. Since then there have been sporadic reports of the further use of chemical weapons both by the Assad regime and so-called Islamic State. These have often involved the use of commercial chemicals like chlorine. But this latest use of what looks to be a nerve agent like Sarin, and the frightful images of the attack, have underscored just how little progress has been made. This video can not be played Rescue workers said many children were among those killed or injured in the attack Between the Ghoutta attack in August 2013 to the incident in Idlib province this week, the situation on the ground in Syria has changed dramatically. Then the Assad regime seemed to have only a tenuous grip on power. The policy of the West and its allies was to see Syria's leader - already branded by some as a war criminal - forced from office. There was still a good deal of talk about a credible ""democratic"" opposition, which, if given sufficient means, could wrest control of much of the country from the Assad regime and IS alike. Fast forward to today. Such hopes proved illusory. The ""democratic"" opposition proved to have a very limited military capacity. Many of its most capable elements are closely linked to al-Qaeda: the next major problem that is likely to face the West some way down the line. The Assad regime, bolstered by Iranian military assistance and Russian air power, has more than consolidated its position. And the most successful Western-backed elements of the opposition - the coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters in northern Syria - may be advancing against IS, but its success brings a host of other problems, notably in relations with Turkey, whose troops and proxies already occupy a significant zone inside the country. The saga of the West's response to the use of chemical weapons underscores the improvised and uncertain course of policy towards Syria almost from the outset. Russia's intervention in the conflict managed to turn the tide in favour of Assad President Obama's declaration in 2012 that the use of chemical arms would cross ""a red line"" and change Washington's ""calculus"" seemed to go further than many of his advisers had expected. But in the event - when push came to shove in 2013 - there were no punitive air strikes and the chemical disarmament deal seems now incomplete at best. Neither is US policy today any more coherent. The Trump administration has roundly condemned the attacks, but President Trump himself has used the opportunity to condemn his predecessor for ""weakness and irresolution"" for not making good on his threats when the red line was crossed in 2013. However, back then, Mr Trump seemed to endorse the President's caution. He tweeted on 1 September 2013 that ""President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria."" Today, the international reaction in the wake of this latest episode is predictable and formulaic. With Russia already providing an alibi for the Syrian regime, it is hard to see what can come out of the UN Security Council's meeting. It has been consistently and fatally divided on Syria since the outset of the crisis. But the chemical attack could still change ""the calculus"" around Syria to use President Obama's phrase. President Obama's failure to forcefully respond to the first chemical weapons attacks disappointed the Syrian opposition For one thing, there will be a renewed debate about the whole question of ""safe areas"" and ""no-fly zones"" to provide protection to civilians, principally from regime air attack. Indeed the potential for such zones - especially in northern Syria close to the border with Turkey - has increased in the wake of the Turkish Army's entry on to Syrian soil. Such zones though are a vexed question. At some point - however defined or delineated - they require a willingness to take action against aircraft who strike inside them. Russia's air campaign complicates matters and so far has pretty well ruled out their establishment. The chemical attack could change diplomatic calculations as well. The Trump administration's policy on Syria is still unformed. The last major attack in 2013 brought Washington and Moscow together, albeit briefly. So far the Trump administration's much heralded reset with Moscow has proved elusive. Could this latest tragedy - whatever its cause - change that? The Syrian crisis has decidedly entered a new phase - with new threats and new challenges emerging. Peace remains as elusive as ever.

Is Trump wise to take on China over trade?,"Presidents Xi and Trump meet in Florida on Thursday US President Donald Trump has said that trade negotiations with China will be ""very difficult,external"" when he meets President Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, on Thursday. Trade will be one of two key issues on the agenda, along with North Korea. But what's the problem - and what can Trump do about it? The problem with the US-China trade relationship is that it is highly unequal and has been for a long time. In 2016 alone, the US imported $480bn (Â£385bn) of goods and services from China - mostly consumer items like clothing, shoes, televisions, smartphones, laptops and tablets. Those imports keep prices low for American consumers. In return, the US sold just $170bn (Â£137bn) worth of exports to China - including sophisticated machinery like aircraft and agricultural products like soybeans. It also makes money from services, like the education of an estimated 350,000 Chinese students in the US. Overall, China is the largest source of the US trade deficit - the amount by which the value of its imports exceeds the value of its exports. In 2016 it accounted for about 60% of its overall deficit of $500bn (402bn). Read more on this story: An A-Z of issues as Trump meets Xi This video can not be played The meeting takes place at Mar-a-Lago in Florida - a private members club as well as the Trump family's winter getaway President Trump is unhappy with this state of affairs, tweeting in January: ""China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the US in totally one-sided trade,external."" He sees a link with the loss of manufacturing jobs - and he has a point, because a large trade deficit generally goes hand-in-hand with a smaller manufacturing sector. This is a problem, because for people without college degrees these jobs tend to be well-paying ones. US shoppers have enjoyed years of cheap imports During his campaign, Mr Trump spoke often of wanting to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US and, in the first presidential debate, said: ""They're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China.,external"" After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 there was a surge of Chinese imports into the US, something economists called the ""China shock"". Between 2000 and 2007, US manufacturing jobs fell sharply, from 16.9 million to 13.6 million. The 2008 financial crisis pushed the number lower, to 11.2 million, although the number has since been fairly stable. Trade crackdown 'not about China' Will Donald Trump mean the end of global trade? Trump and trade: A radical agenda? Workers making clothing and electronic goods were among the worst affected. It is difficult to settle upon an exact figure, but some economists think that 40% of these job losses can be linked to Chinese imports. However, the influx of cheap goods also created non-manufacturing jobs in the US, because consumers had more money to spend on other things. That boosted healthcare, entertainment, travel, and leisure. So, think of the trade deficit destroying some jobs and creating others. So, what can President Trump do about the trade deficit? Candidate Trump threatened harsh protectionist measures, such as a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, but history shows that protectionism does not reduce trade deficits. He also threatened to name China a ""currency manipulator"" and at one point during his campaign went so far as to accuse it of""raping"" the USwith its trade policy. For years China intervened to keep its exchange rate low, which kept the price of its goods down and helped increase the US deficit. But more recently its central bank has kept the currency high - making its exports more expensive - and it is in the US's interest to encourage more of this. The US has long been spending more on goods from other countries than it sells The most promising route for President Trump is to negotiate better access to Chinese consumers. China has many restrictions on imports, for example a 25% tariff on cars. And while the US sells a lot of agricultural products to China, notably soy beans, key markets like beef and pork are highly restricted. Probably most important for the US is that modern service sectors like finance, social media, telecommunications, health care and transportation are largely closed to imports and foreign investment. So far there has been little progress, but opening China's markets would offer more choice to its own consumers and would help maintain a stable relationship with the US. China's economy depends on keeping the trade flowing with its biggest customer. Will there be a trade war? Probably not, because protectionist measures would hurt the US economy and the Chinese are counting on it to be impractical. The Chinese Communist Party has an important congress at the end of the year and it will be difficult for Xi to do anything bold before then. Even afterwards, China is likely to move very gradually on market opening. Trump was smart to set low expectations for the summit.

Should exercise be compulsory at work?,"The news this week that more than 20 million people in the UK arephysically inactivehas led to a lot of discussion over how to tackle the problem. But with no easy solution and rates of obesity rising fast has it come to the point that exercise should become part of our working day? ""Exercise in the office isn't a new idea. But it's such a clear win-win - in terms of health, morale and productivity,"" says Ryan Holmes, the CEO of HootSuite, a social media platform. In a first-person articleon Medium,externalentitled, Why It's Time We Paid Employees to Exercise at Work, Holmes makes a passionate case for exercise becoming part of the working day and bosses paying for it. His social media tech company has about 700 employees, and exercise before, during and after working hours is encouraged, in the small on-site gym. ""Yoga classes are packed before work, at lunch and after work. In the gym, volunteers from our company lead sweaty bootcamps and cross-training classes. Groups set out from our office for lunchtime runs and evening hikes. We have a hockey team and a road biking team and even a Quidditch team that does battle on broomsticks in the park."" Tech giant Google led the way in office gyms but Holmes doesn't believe a company has to have a gym on site, and says he encouraged staff to exercise even when they were a small start-up. ""We made it clear that anyone could block off an hour for exercise during the day, provided it didn't conflict with meetings and they made up the time (by having lunch at their desks, for instance)."" And he believes it's more than worth it. ""I see employees return from workouts refreshed and better focused on their jobs. Time lost on exercise is made back and more in terms of improved productivity."" And he believes he'd never have built up his company without taking exercise himself during the day that enabled him to ""maintain composure and focus in the midst of chaos"". Are exercise classes in the office a far-fetched idea? Themain barrierraised by many against taking regular exercise is work-life commitments so finding more time in the day for exercise does lead us to the workplace. The government issued guidelines via NICE in 2015 on how promoting a culture that improves the health and wellbeing of employees is ""good management and leads to healthy and productive workplaces"". And there is an economic case for promoting exercise at work - healthy staff mean fewer absences due to illness. Each year, more than a million working people in the UK experience a work-related illness. This leads to around 27 million lost working days costing the economy an estimated Â£13.4bn. Astudy at Bristol University showed,externalthat employees who can exercise at work ""are more productive, happy, efficient and calm"". Exercise re-energised staff, improved their concentration and problem-solving and made them feel calmer. Many major companies now have gyms on site With 60% of our day often spent at work, the British Heart Foundation wants employers to make workplaces healthier places. They havelots of tips for employers,externalon how to make businesses more healthy and point out that classes like pilates and boxercise can be popular in the workplace if organised to fit around the working day, and delivered on-site or in a facility nearby. But if employers can't go that far, the foundation says bosses should encourage staff to take a short active break during the day as shown in their10 minute workout video.,external Exercise breaks are a feature of a number of large Japanese companies. In 2010, China reintroduced mandatory exercises twice a day at state-owned companies after a three-year gap. Set up by the Communist Party, they had previously been running since the 1950s, with state radio broadcasting music at 10:00 and 15:00 for workers to do their set exercises. Making exercise compulsory would be seen as a step too far for a country like the UK, but with more and more desk-bound jobs these days, do employers hold the key? One place to start could be for employers toban ""cake culture""in the office. Prof Nigel Hunt, from the Faculty of Dental Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons, says the habit of bringing cakes into the office fuels obesity and dental problems. ""For many people, the workplace is now the primary site of their sugar intake,"" he says, and suggests staff should be rewarded with fruit, nuts or cheese instead. Working standing up is being encouraged to improve workers' health Another very simple step to help our health in the office is to stand up more. The NHS offers advice on how to manage the government's recommended 150 minutes of exercise a week, but they also have advice on how much just standing up can improve our health. The link between illness and sitting first emerged in the 1950s, when researchers found London bus drivers were twice as likely to have heart attacks as their bus conductor colleagues. Standing upthree hours a day, five days a week for a year, would be the equivalent of ""running 10 marathons"", according to experts. NHS Choices recommends breaking up long periods of sitting time with ""shorter bouts of activity for just one to two minutes"". And some people now choose to work standing at higher desks. Tips to reduce sitting time: stand on the train or bus take the stairs and walk up escalators set a reminder to get up every 30 minutes place a laptop on a box or similar to work standing stand or walk around while on the phone take a walk break every time you take a coffee or tea break walk to a co-worker's desk instead of emailing or calling One final option we could suggest is getting an office dog. Nestle's headquarters in London allows employees to bring their dogs to work because they say it promotes a less stressful office and encourages more exercise and a healthier work-life blend.

'Undocumented students' in US face anxious future,"There have been fears about deportation among migrant families in the US Sitting in a lecture hall at the University of California, Los Angeles, Maria Marquez found her mind was wandering. The history undergraduate was wondering what would happen if she or a member of her family were to be deported from the United States. ""I remember sitting in class and making a list of people I would contact,"" she says. ""I made a list of the lawyers I would go to and the paperwork I would need."" Ms Marquez, 25, is an ""undocumented student"". Her family moved from Guadalajara, Mexico to California without papers when she was just three years old and have lived there ever since. Hundreds of thousands of students are in a similar position. They have succeeded at school, and started university, with dreams of professional careers in fields such as medicine and law. A charity in Connecticut is running workshops for migrants fearing deportation But since the election of President Trump, and his tough talking on illegal immigration, they feel increasingly vulnerable. The subject of undocumented students' status has electrified US college campuses since the election. As students ramp up campaigns for immigrants' rights, university leaders are appointing full-time immigration lawyers and counsellors to support them, running ""know your rights"" classes and even lobbying the government on their behalf. Ms Marquez is in a legal grey area. She is one of about 750,000 young people recognised under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme, an Obama-era measure that offers two-year protection from deportation, as well as work permits, to some undocumented immigrants who moved to the US as children. Yale student Larissa Martinez is worried about her future status in the US President Trump's campaign website said he would ""immediately terminate"" the DACA programme. He has so far left it in place, but many students worry that its days might be numbered. And many students without DACA are more worried than before about deportation, because the administration has toughened guidance on enforcement to expand the list of prioritised ""removable aliens"". However, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said that the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency was focusing on ""convicted criminals who pose a threat to public safety as well as recent border crosses"". Amid this uncertainty, universities are offering extra support for undocumented students. University leaders have called on President Trump to lift the ""cloud of fear"" Harvard University in January appointed an in-house immigration lawyer, Jason Corral, to handle their concerns. ""Since the election we've stepped up our efforts because our students feel vulnerable,"" says Loc Truong, the university's director of diversity and inclusion. He says that Mr Corral has been kept ""very busy"". The university has attempted to reassure students by saying it will not share their information with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement without a court order. Others, including New York University and Columbia University, have given similar reassurances. But the Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ""has not and does not conduct enforcement on campuses unless there is a serious and extraordinary circumstance such as a threat to national security"". Harvard has an in-house immigration lawyer to help anxious students Meanwhile 560 college and university presidents signed a letter in March that urged President Trump to lift the ""cloud of fear"" over undocumented students. Ignacia Rodriguez, an immigration policy advocate at the National Immigration Law Centre, says the number of requests from colleges for its ""know your rights"" training sessions for undocumented students has significantly increased. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. But universities' support for undocumented students attracts criticism. ""I think that frankly universities should not be going to efforts to support people who are here breaking the law [by living in the US without papers],"" says Sterling Beard, editor-in-chief of the conservative site Campus Reform. He said he had ""sympathy"" for young people brought to the US illegally as children, but that those who were in the country lawfully should be a priority. There are also voices saying universities should not support students in the US illegally ""You have American students who are graduating tens of thousands of dollars in debt, or foreign students who come to the United States legally, but they don't get the same kind of attention,"" he said. As the political battles rage, students are trying to carry on with their education - but this can be difficult. Larissa Martinez, 19, is in her first year at Yale University. She is an undocumented student who is not eligible for DACA status, because her family moved to the US in 2010, and the programme requires applicants to have lived in the US since 2007. ""There's an everyday struggle of wondering whether the worries of school are as important as they are to all of my peers,"" she says. ""I care about school, and I understand its importance, but sometimes it's hard to reconcile that with real life problems. ""Like, sometimes I wonder, what if every day I try my hardest and three and a half years into this [degree] I get deported? Then all of the struggle of working hard to be here meant nothing if it can be taken away so easily."" Migrant parents in Connecticut assign custody of their children to friends if they are deported Ms Marquez, who is due to finish her studies in June, is rethinking her plans in the wake of the election. She had hoped to go to graduate school in a northern area of California, such as San Francisco or Berkeley - but has decided to study somewhere further south where she will be closer to her parents because she is worried that they might be deported. ""Since Trump took office I've thought, I can't leave southern California,"" she says. ""I'm focusing on schools where I can easily go to my parents if they need me or if I need them."" Marisa Herrera, executive director for community building and inclusion at the University of Washington in Seattle, says such concerns show how quickly undocumented students' experience has changed. ""A year ago, these kids thought anything was possible, regardless of their immigration status, whether that was studying abroad or being a doctor or a lawyer,"" she says. ""They really were unstoppable. Those possibilities are not out of the question for them now, but things have significantly changed,"" she says. ""Now, it's complicated.""

The Green Jacket. Amen Corner. The manicured fairways. The blooming azaleas. Unmistakably, the Masters. Golf's first major of the year is upon us, with the world's finest players making their annual pilgrimage to one of sport's most iconic venues. The first tee shot will be hit at 13:00 BST on Thursday with a field of 94 men aiming to sink the winning putt come Sunday. World number one Dustin Johnson and Northern Ireland's four-time major winner Rory McIlroy head the field in the year's first major. Quiz: Match the Masters winner with his champions dinner. What else do you need to know? Plenty. Here's the lowdown... Plenty of people backedDustin Johnsonto win his first Green Jacket - but that was before the current world number one suffered a backinjurythe day before the tournament started, after a fall at his rented home. Johnson tried to take part in the tournament, butwalked off the first tee on Thursday without playing his shot and withdrew. The American, 32, had been head and shoulders above his rivals over the past nine months, winnnig seven of the 17 tournaments he has played since claiming his first major at theUS Open at Oakmont in June,racking up another seven top-10 finishes in the process. In Johnson's absence,Jordan Spiethwill look to banish memories of last year's spectacular final-day collapse by winning his second Masters. The American, 23, led by five shots as he approached the 10th at Augusta on the Sunday, only to dramatically drop six shots in three holes and allow England's Danny Willett to take advantage. ""No matter what happens at this year's Masters, whether I can grab the jacket back or I miss the cut or I finish 30th, it will be nice having this Masters go by,"" he said earlier this month. ""The Masters lives on for a year. It brings a non-golf audience into golf. And it will be nice once this year has finished to be brutally honest."" Spieth has dropped to sixth in the world rankings since his Masters meltdown, but did claim his first PGA Tour title since May when he won the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am last month. This video can not be played Jordan Spieth's calamitous seven at the par-three 12th World number threeJason Daywill play at Augusta after pulling out of a recent tournament to spend time with his mother, who has been treated for lung cancer. The Australian, 29, broke down in tears after withdrawing from the WGC Match Play a fortnight ago. ""There's been a lot of things go on this year that have been somewhat distracting to my golf,"" he said. ""Golf was the last thing that I was ever thinking about when this first came about. I'm in a much better place now. ""I feel happier to be on the golf course and enjoying myself out here a lot more than I was the last month or two."" Japan'sHideki Matsuyamais bidding to become the first Asian player to win the Masters, having risen to fourth in the world after a stellar finish to the 2016 season. The 25-year-old ended last year with four victories in five tournaments - finishing second in the other - but has not been able to recapture the form in recent weeks. ""I'm really not hitting it as well as I would like, so whether or not my confidence level is where it should be, I'm not sure,"" said Matsuyama, who finished fifth in the 2015 Masters and shared seventh place last year. That is the question we have been asking since McIlroy won the 2014 Open Championship at Hoylake. The Northern Irishman steps on to Augusta's first tee on Thursday (18:41 BST) aiming to become only the sixth man to win all four majors. He is seeking a first Masters title following victories at the US Open, the Open Championship and the US PGA Championship. Winning the Green Jacket would propel the 27-year-old into exalted company alongside Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Gene Sarazen, Gary Player and Ben Hogan. And, after three consecutive top-10 finishes at Augusta, the world number two has made no secret that finally sealing victory is his main priority. ""I don't feel like I can fly under the radar anymore, but at the same time it has been nice to just go about my business and try to get ready for this tournament,"" McIlroy said. ""I've realised that the more I can get comfortable with this golf course and the club as a whole, the better. ""The more I can just play the golf course and almost make it seem like second nature to me, the better."" When the fourth home nations golfer followed in the footsteps of Sandy Lyle, Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam to win the Masters, most expected it would be Rory McIlroy slipping into the iconic wool jacket. Instead it was Danny Willett. The Englishman, playing in only his second Masters, was three shots adrift of Spieth going into Sunday's final round last year, but was catapulted to victory thanks to a superb five-under-par 67 and the Texan's meltdown. What made his triumph even more remarkable was his participation at Augusta had been in doubt. His wife Nicole was due to give birth on the final day, with only the early arrival of baby Zachariah allowing him to play. ""It's going to be awesome to go back as defending champion,"" he said in BBC documentaryWhen Danny Won the Masters. ""I can't wait to take part in all the things you get to take part in, the par three competition, the champion's dinner and see all the other people who've won that golf tournament who are still there to be able to enjoy it with you. This video can not be played Who will follow in Danny Willett's footsteps and pull on the famous green jacket this year? ""It is something that you can't buy in life. You can only earn and the fact that I've earned is going to be something pretty special."" However, Willett has since struggled to match his form over those four days at Augusta. He rose to a career-high ranking of ninth in the world following his maiden major, but has dropped to 17th after managing just four top-10 finishes in the past 12 months. ""The game is not far away,"" said the 29-year-old Yorkshireman. ""Our run of form obviously has been nowhere near what it was last year and nowhere near what some of the other guys are playing."" Willett is one of a record 11 English players in the 94-strong field at Augusta, while Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are also represented. McIlroyis the only Northern Irishman taking part, while Scotland'sSandy Lyleand Wales'Ian Woosnammake their annual return as former champions. England'sJustin Rosehas been a regular top-10 finisher in golf's four majors over the past decade, but only has one victory at the 2013 US Open to show for his efforts. He finished tied 10th at Augusta last year, his fourth top-10 finish at the Masters. UK and Irish hopes Paul Casey (Eng) Ross Fisher (Eng) Matt Fitzpatrick (Eng) Tommy Fleetwood (Eng) Scott Gregory (Eng) Tyrrell Hatton (Eng) Russell Knox (Sco) Shane Lowry (Ire) Sandy Lyle (Sco) Rory McIlroy (NI) Justin Rose (Eng) Andy Sullivan (Eng) Lee Westwood (Eng) Danny Willett (Eng) Chris Wood (Eng) Ian Woosnam (Wal) Tommy Fleetwood, Tyrrell Hattonand English amateur championScott Gregoryare making their Masters debuts this week - no player has won the Masters on their debut since American Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979. Fleetwood, 26, was ranked 188th in the world in September 2016, but has climbed to career-high 32nd after returning to former coach Alan Thompson and employing friend Ian Finnis as his caddie. ""One of the greatest accomplishments I've had in my career was actually qualifying for the Masters,"" said Fleetwood. Gregory, a 22-year-old from Hampshire, secured his place by winning the British Amateur Championship last summer. His preparations have included watching hours of footage from the past four tournaments at Augusta. ""I've watched a lot of clips on YouTube,"" he told BBC South Today. Willett's surprise success ended a long European drought at Augusta, becoming the continent's first winner since Jose Maria Olazabal's success 17 years previously. This year, American players will be hoping to regain their recent dominance. Ten of the previous 16 winners have been home players, with Johnson and Spieth leading the charge alongside fellow top-15 players Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler and Patrick Reed. And rule out left handers Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson at your peril. Between them the veteran pair have five Green Jackets hung up in their wardrobes - three for Mickleson and two for Watson - and are still loitering around the world's top 20. ""I always think I have a chance,"" said 38-year-old Watson, who has won just one PGA Tour title in nearly two years. Strong winds and cool temperatures have been forecast on Thursday and Friday, conditions which 46-year-old Mickelson believes will play into his hands. ""I hope to rely on that knowledge and skill to keep myself in it heading into the weekend where players less experienced with the golf course will possibly miss it in the wrong spots and shoot themselves out,"" said the world number 18.

But the 41-year-old will not be marking the special anniversary by walking the fairways after pulling out this week through injury. The 14-time major winner, who has been plagued by injury problems in recent years, said he is not ""tournament ready"" to tee up at an event with which he is synonymous. The American went on to wear the Green Jacket on another three occasions - 2001, 2002 and 2005 - but has not been able to play in two of the past three tournaments because of long-running back problems. ""I did about everything I could to play at this year's Masters,"" he said. ""I'm especially upset because it's a special anniversary for me that's filled with a lot of great memories. ""I have no timetable for my return, but I will continue my diligent effort to recover, and want to get back out there as soon as possible."" Woods has only played twice this year, missing the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open in January and withdrawing from the following week's Dubai Desert Classic before the second round. Woods is the youngest ever Masters champion, triumphing aged 21 years, 3 months and 14 days in 1997 This year's tournament will be tinged with sadness - but also a cause for celebration - as Augusta pays its own tribute to the man who won four Masters titles and was fondly known as 'The King' in golfing circles. Arnold Palmer, viewed as one of the greatest and most influential players in the sport's history, died at the age of 87 in September. ""His presence at Augusta National will be sorely missed, but his impact on the Masters remains immeasurable - and it will never wane,"" said Billy Payne, chairman of Augusta National, shortly after his death. This video can not be played Arnold Palmer - The man who changed golf One of the most ominous yet anticipated stretch of holes in golf Seeing the sign pointing towards Amen Corner can strike fear into the minds of even the world's best golfers. Amen Corner, a term coined by legendary sports writer Herbert Warren Wind in 1958, geographically refers to the approach to the par-four 11th, all of the short 12th and the first half of the par-five 13th but many tend to think of it as all three holes in their entirety. ""If you can get through those in level par you're a happy man,""says BBC golf commentator Ken Brown. The 11th has overtaken the 10th in recent years as Augusta's most testing. A wind that is difficult to judge and a pond to the left of the green means the 505-yard par four, which has been lengthened by 45 yards since 2002, ranks as Augusta's all-time most difficult hole The par-three 12th is one of the most cherished holes in golf. Unpredictable winds, Rae's Creek, a shallow green... players stride across Hogan Bridge hoping to have avoided serious damage on Augusta's shortest hole The 13th tee offers a rare moment of solitude for Masters hopefuls, on the furthest part of the course from the patrons. The 510-yard par five is the final hole of Amen Corner - but, unlike its unforgiving predecessors, offers a good eagle chance If Jordan Spieth had got through those holes in level par in the final round last year then he, and not Danny Willett, would have won the Green Jacket. The Texan appeared to be cruising towards becoming only the fourth man to win back-to-back Masters, leading by five shots as he approached the 10th. But he twice found the water on the iconic 12th to card a quadruple bogey seven - following successive bogeys on the 10th and 11th holes - to hand the advantage to Willett. Spieth was not the first Masters contender to see their dreams fade on the back nine on the final day, with Greg Norman in 1996 and Rory McIlroy in 2011 immediately springing to mind. One suspects he won't be the last...

However, Augusta members had worn the coloured coats since 1937, encouraged by co-founder Clifford Roberts, so patrons could easily identify ""a source of reliable information"". Once Snead received his Green Jacket, the coat became a symbol of success - and is now one of the most iconic prizes in sport. Winners are allowed to take the jacket home for a year and are rather generously allowed to wear the single-breasted, lightweight jacket ""in public during that time on special occasions"". After that, past champions have a custom-tailored coat waiting for them on their return to the Augusta clubhouse. ""It felt like my old friend was back on my shoulders,"" said 2013 champion Adam Scott when he returned a year later.

Sleeping with a stranger to save their marriage,"A number of online services are charging ""divorced"" Muslim women thousands of pounds to take part in ""halala"" Islamic marriages, a BBC investigation has found. Women pay to marry, have sex with and then divorce a stranger, so they can get back with their first husbands. Farah - not her real name - met her husband after being introduced to him by a family friend when she was in her 20s. They had children together soon afterwards but then, Farah says, the abuse began. ""The first time he was abusive was over money,"" she tells the BBC'sAsian NetworkandVictoria Derbyshire programme. ""He dragged me by my hair through two rooms and tried to throw me out of the house. There would be times where he would just go crazy."" Despite the abuse, Farah hoped things would change. Her husband's behaviour though became increasingly erratic - leading to him ""divorcing"" her via text message. ""I was at home with the children and he was at work. During a heated discussion he sent me a text saying, 'talaq, talaq, talaq'."" ""Triple talaq"" - where a man says ""talaq"", or divorce, to his wife three times in a row - is a practice which some Muslims believe ends an Islamic marriage instantly. It is banned in most Muslim countries but still happens, though it is impossible to know exactly how many women are ""divorced"" like this in the UK. ""I had my phone on me,"" Farah explains, ""and I just passed it over to my dad. He was like, 'Your marriage is over, you can't go back to him.'"" This video can not be played Farah would have had to consummate her halala marriage Farah says she was ""absolutely distraught"", but willing to return to her ex-husband because he was ""the love of my life"". She says her ex-husband also regretted divorcing her. This led Farah to seek the controversial practice known as halala, which is accepted by a small minority of Muslims who subscribe to the concept of a triple talaq. They believe halala is the only way a couple who have been divorced, and wish to reconcile, can remarry. Halala involves the woman marrying someone else, consummating the marriage and then getting a divorce - after which she is able to remarry her first husband. But in some cases, women who seek halala services are at risk of being financially exploited, blackmailed and even sexually abused. It's a practice the vast majority of Muslims are strongly against and is attributed to individuals misunderstanding the Islamic laws around divorce. But an investigation by the BBC has found a number of online accounts offering halala services, several of which are charging women thousands of pounds to take part in temporary marriages. One man, advertising halala services on Facebook, told an undercover BBC reporter posing as a divorced Muslim woman that she would need to pay Â£2,500 and have sex with him in order for the marriage to be ""complete"" - at which point he would divorce her. The man also said he had several other men working with him, one who he claims initially refused to issue a woman a divorce after a halala service was complete. There is nothing to suggest the man is doing anything illegal. The BBC contacted him after the meeting - he rejects any allegations against him, claiming he has never carried out or been involved in a halala marriage and that the Facebook account he created was for fun, as part of a social experiment. In her desperation to be reunited with her husband, Farah began trying to find men who were willing to carry out a halala marriage. ""I knew of girls who had gone behind families' backs and had it done and been used for months,"" she says. ""They went to the mosque, there was apparently a designated room where they did this stuff and the imam or whoever offers these services, slept with her and then allowed other men to sleep with her too."" Khola Hasan says halala services are ""abusing vulnerable people"" But the Islamic Sharia Council in East London, which regularly advises women on issues around divorce, strongly condemns halala marriages. ""This is a sham marriage, it is about making money and abusing vulnerable people,"" says Khola Hasan from the organisation. ""It's haram, it's forbidden. There's no stronger word I can use. There are other options, like getting help or counselling. We would not allow anyone to go through with that. You do not need halala, no matter what,"" she adds. Farah ultimately decided against getting back with her husband - and the risks of going through a halala marriage. But she warns there are other women out there, like her, who are desperate for a solution. ""Unless you're in that situation where you're divorced and feeling the pain I felt, no-one's going to understand the desperation some women feel. ""If you ask me now, in a sane state, I would never do it. I'm not going to sleep with someone to get back with a man. But at that precise time I was desperate to get back with my ex-partner at any means or measure.""

Patriot power: How France's alt-right seeks to sway election,"The most distinctive feature of France's alt-right is its youth France, despite its reputation as a beacon of progressive liberalism, has been at the forefront of a burgeoning pan-European far-right movement. Marine Le Pen, an anti-immigration Eurosceptic who may well top the first round of France's presidential election on 23 April, is riding a populist insurgency that has been growing over the past 15 years. Its themes are familiar in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit: concern for hardworking people, support for traditional values, and opposition to immigration and supranational busybodies. But the most distinctive characteristic of France's patriotic surge is youth. Unlike their contemporaries in the US and the UK, the under-30s in France are more nationalistic than the general population. At the radical end of the movement are the ""identitaires"", or identitarians - the equivalent of the American alt-right. Their standard bearers are GÃ©nÃ©ration Identitaire (GI), a group that specialises in publicity stunts that it films and posts online to advertise its fight to reclaim French territory said to have been lost to foreign migrants. In 2012 GI occupied a mosque in Poitiers, a city historically linked with resistance to Muslims GI has 120,000 Facebook fans - almost twice as many as the youth wings of the Socialist Party and the centre-right Republicans combined. Unlike the skinheads of old, the group sticks to non-violence. The iPhone, it has found, is mightier than the boot. France votes:  on the BBC The five main candidates are (L-R) Francois Fillon, Benoit Hamon, Marine Le Pen, Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Luc Melenchon Is Marine Le Pen far right? Macron: Ambitious man on the move One-time favourite devoured by 'fake jobs' affair Fillon payment inquiry: What you need to know Who are the candidates? Inside France's young far right Following a group of activists handing out flyers in Paris, however, it is clear that they relish verbal confrontation. Their leader Pierre Larti, 26, stands surrounded by a group of North African men. ""When I read this leaflet I understand that you don't want me here,"" one says. ""What we don't want is the replacement of our values by Islamic ones,"" replies Mr Larti. ""France is historically a Christian country. I'm not criticising anyone. What happens in your land is your business.  What happens here is ours.  We are against colonisation, and this is why we don't want the same phenomenon to happen in reverse."" ""This is OUR homeland,"" the French identitarians insist Oddly, perhaps, for a group passionately attached to national differences, GI is sprouting branches across Europe. But identitarians see the whole continent as a battleground between European and Islamic culture. Jean-Yves Le Gallou, a former Euro-MP, speaks of a struggle for ""civilisational"" identity. ""Whether you are Dutch, German or French,"" he says, ""you have the same problem and have the same view of the world."" Mr Le Gallou, 69, has produced a video entitled Being European (""Europe is not a globalised, borderless space. Europe is not African or Muslim territory."") that has been viewed more than 3.2m times on YouTube in less than two years - three times as many as Being French, a sister video extolling his homeland. Mr Le Gallou's website, Polemia, stands at the high-brow end of France's identitarian spectrum. In the 1970s, he was a leading member of the Nouvelle Droite, an influential group of far-right thinkers. His continued influence is testament to the deep intellectual roots of the identitarian movement. It also highlights the power of new media. Without the internet, Mr Le Gallou and others would have no mass audience. Their warnings against the ""Great Replacement"" of locals by immigrants are no-go areas for mainstream journalists. Shut out by traditional media, identitarians have thrived on the web over the past decade. One of the online stars is Fdesouche, a news aggregator that features links to articles and clips from mainstream sites selected to chronicle chaos in migrant suburbs. Fdesouche offers no comment, but leaves readers to draw their own conclusions: Islamists and""racaille""(""rabble"" - code for dark-skinned criminals) are threatening to take over the country, one housing estate at a time. Fdesouche gets about 3m views per month, dwarfing the websites of mainstream politicians. Emmanuel Macron, a centrist with a devoted following of hipsters, manages less than 1m. Fdesouche's success has spawned a swarm of imitators and rivals. Is France's online far right a threat to democracy? Often collectively called the ""fachosphÃ¨re"" (from ""fascist""), websites denouncing mass immigration and Islam have seen spectacular growth in France over the past 10 years. And France's cyber-patriots are a diverse lot. Read more here from Henri Astier's investigation One fault line divides new-model identitarians, who view Muslims as the main threat, from traditionalists who believe the chief malevolent force in the world is ""Zionism"". The most prominent anti-Zionist is Alain Soral. His website, ÃgalitÃ© et Reconciliation (E&R), weaves nationalist and left-wing themes by calling for solidarity with people from poor countries. Soral rejects accusations of ""anti-Semitism"". He sees a clear distinction between ""ordinary Jews"" and what he calls the organised Jewish lobby, which he says is persecuting him. He sympathises with native French people, but feels identitarians are focusing on the wrong target. By ""inciting poor whites to turn against blacks and Muslims"" they were doing the work of Zionists, he told the BBC. Alain Soral has been prosecuted dozens of times for incitement Alain Soral is regularly prosecuted for incitement. But he is no bit-part player. E&R has more readers than Fdesouche, and by some measures is France's most popular political website. Various parts of the online alt-right may be firing from different directions, but their target is the same: the political and media establishment. Such resentment is not the preserve of the identitarian fringe, or of people languishing in neglected provinces. Opposition to liberal elites and concern about the disappearance of borders are widespread, and increasingly being aired in the heart of Paris. At Sciences Po, an institution that trains the next generation of government and business leaders. Eurosceptic students have set up a club, ""Critique of European Reason"" (CRE), to wage the fight where it matters. Its leader, Nicolas Pouvreau, says the group has managed to ""create a Eurosceptic safe space in an environment that remains hostile."" Another member, Sarah Knafo, says the rising popularity of Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) - France's largest party - has earned the group a grudging respect on campus: ""We represent something bigger than us, and people dare not despise us as much as they used to."" Last year's Brexit vote in the UK thrilled CRE members. The next morning they gathered outside the UK embassy to drink champagne and sing God Save the Queen. Beyond hostility to the EU, CRE members regard uncontrolled migration and trade flows as a source of social disintegration. It would be wrong to label Critique of European Reason as far-right. The group brings together one-nation activists from both the left and the right who have much more in common with one another than with the moderates in their respective camps. This video can not be played Student Paul Zurkinden gives his perspective on Euroscepticism Kevin, another CRE student who supports hard-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, is as hostile to multiculturalism as the conservatives within the group. Having lived in an immigrant banlieue (suburb) he says he has often been called ""dirty white"", and says the mainstream press denies the reality of ""anti-white racism"". Unfashionable as they are, these feelings are widespread among those who have left the banlieues. ""I have suffered from being white,"" says Ugo Iannuzzi, a Sorbonne student. ""I have often cried. I used to go to school with fear in my stomach. You start to feel bad about being white, about being French and loving your origins because you get beaten up, your phone gets stolen and glasses smashed."" Mr Iannuzzi supports the FN.  But his resentment of the political and media elites mirrors that of left-wingers like Mr Vercin. Alexandre Devecchio, a journalist and author of abook on various tribes of young French rebels,external, calls all those preoccupied with the erosion of identity the ""Zemmour generation"". Eric Zemmour is an influential writer-broadcaster who argues that the 1968 revolt has led France to ruin. Many of today's twentysomethings, Mr Devecchio argues, agree with Zemmour because they feel let down. Born after the fall of the Berlin Wall, they were expected to blossom in an open, rainbow society within a pacified, post-historical Europe. Mr Devecchio edits Figarovox, a website for vigorous debate set up by Le Figaro newspaper ""For that generation, reality did not follow the script,"" Mr Devecchio told the BBC. What they have experienced is unemployment, insecure jobs, and a sense of physical and cultural insecurity in areas where radical Islam is on the rise, he believes. Could the identitarians and the wider Zemmour generation help Marine Le Pen win power? At the moment that appears unlikely. Ms Le Pen lacks the backing of a major party, and is expected to be defeated by any second-round opponent. But she can draw comfort from the fact that polls have underestimated the support of other populist leaders. High abstention levels could also help her. The instinct to rally around whoever runs against the FN is much weaker now than in the past. Polls suggest that half the voters backing hard-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon would either abstain or back Ms Le Pen in a second round against Emmanuel Macron. And should she lose the race, the setback could be temporary if her victorious opponent fails to bring about reform. Identitarianism feeds on pessimism. The country's patriotic rebels are young and may have time on their side. Is France's online far right a threat to democracy? Inside France's young far-right.
