Foster says abortion vote no impact on NI,"Attention has turned to Northern Ireland after the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favour of overturning the country's abortion ban The result of Ireland's abortion referendum has no impact on the law in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader has said. Arlene Foster said the legislation governing abortion is a devolved issue and the Northern Ireland Assembly should debate such issues. The government agreed with Mrs Foster. Labour and a number of senior Conservative MPs have called on Theresa May to back a reform in NI's abortion law after Friday's historic referendum. A government spokesperson said abortion law is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland. ""This very sensitive issue highlights the pressing need to restore a fully functioning executive,"" the spokesperson added. Northern Ireland's abortion law is more restrictive than the rest of the UK. NI women 'in limbo' over abortion law What next for abortion in NI? Moment Ireland's referendum result is announced 'Her soul will rest in peace now' Mrs Foster, whose party is propping up Theresa May's minority government, said a referendum was held in the Republic of Ireland because of the constitutional prohibition that existed there. She said no such constitutional bar exists in Northern Ireland. ""Friday's referendum has no impact upon the law in Northern Ireland, but we obviously take note of issues impacting upon our nearest neighbour,"" Mrs Foster said in a statement. ""The legislation governing abortion is a devolved matter and it is for the Northern Ireland Assembly to debate and decide such issues."" DUP leader Arlene Foster says the referendum in the Republic of Ireland has no impact on the law in Northern Ireland Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for almost 18 months, and several rounds of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have ended in failure. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissionhas brought a case before the Supreme Court arguing that current abortion legislation is contrary to human rights, especially with regard to victims of sex crime and fatal foetal abnormality. If the challenge proves successful, the court's ruling would go back to politicians. ""Then it would fall to the Northern Ireland Executive and the assembly, if it was sitting, or in the absence of an assembly it would then fall to Westminster to deal with this,"" the commission's Les Allamby said. ""If there was a refusal to deal with that, then that would become a very significant issue."" This video can not be played Labour's Chakrabarti says 'feminist' May must act on Northern Ireland abortion Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, has called on the government to support legislation to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland. She called it an ""injustice"" that women in Northern Ireland are ""having to travel to mainland UK"" to access an abortion. ""Labour's manifesto commits to working with the Northern Ireland Assembly to bring about these changes and we want to see the Assembly reconvened to make such important decisions, but nearly eighteen months on, women in Northern Ireland should not have to suffer in its absence,"" Ms Butler said. Labour's Dawn Butler said the party is looking at legislative options to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland The shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, Tony Lloyd, said the Labour Party wanted to ensure that women in Northern Ireland had access ""to safe and legal abortion"". He said the preferred route to do that was through the assembly in Northern Ireland. Shadow attorney general, Labour's Shami Chakrabarti, called on Mrs May ""a self-identifying feminist, to negotiate with the parties of Northern Ireland and legislate on this without delay. We can't have democracy without fundamental human rights"". Dr Sarah Wollaston, chair of Westminster's health committee, said women in Northern Ireland should have the same rights as other UK residents. This video can not be played After Ireland's abortion referendum, BBC News NI gauges opinion north of the border Prime Minister Theresa May is facing pressure to act afterIreland voted to end its abortion ban in Friday's referendum. But a Downing Street says the issue remains devolved in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, after a power-sharing deal between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. Mrs May tweeted on Sunday: ""The Irish Referendum yesterday was an impressive show of democracy which delivered a clear and unambiguous result. I congratulate the Irish people on their decision and all of #Together4Yes on their successful campaign."" - PM @theresa_may #repealedthe8th"" By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter At Saturday's results announcement in Dublin Castle, Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill held up a sign saying: ""The north is next"". But the other main party in Northern Ireland, the DUP, will be fiercely opposing moves from Westminster or elsewhere to bring about change. The party has deep religious roots and has always said that any relaxation in NI's laws could bring about abortion on demand. It has many supporters who feel the same. Nonetheless, the issue is out of Stormont's hands due to the continuing stalemate - and pro-choice campaigners will be focusing their fight at Westminster, which presents a major headache for the prime minister. Theresa May will have to walk yet another political tightrope. She won't want to upset theDUP and risk her parliamentary majority- especially at such a crucial time in the Brexit negotiations - but the growing pressure from within her own party and across Parliament on this issue means she will have to do something. This video can not be played How the referendum unfolded Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics programme, Dr Wollaston said she and other MPs in favour of abortion reform would put forward an amendment on the issue to Westminster's Domestic Violence Bill. However, she said she was not sure if the amendment would be accepted for debate as abortion would normally be a devolved issue for Stormont to decide on. The Women and Equalities minister Penny Mordaunt, and her predecessors Amber Rudd, Justine Greening, Nicky Morgan and Maria Miller, have also called for reform of Northern Ireland's abortion laws. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has said Mrs May should take advantage of the current lack of a devolved administration and push for reform from Westminster. ""The position in Northern Ireland is now highly anomalous and I think, probably, action will now have to be taken,"" he said. Emotions ran high during the referendum campaign in Ireland Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she did not want Westminster to legislate for abortions in Northern Ireland, but she argued that Irish law should apply to women from Northern Ireland. ""I couldn't envisage a situation where women from the north would be precluded from accessing services here in the south,"" she said. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which an abortion can be performed legally. A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth. However, anti-abortion campaigners argue that doctors cannot accurately predict death, saying that terminally-ill babies ""can and do defy the odds"". There is no restriction on travelling outside Northern Ireland to seek a legal termination in another jurisdiction. Last year, the Westminster government introduced measures to help women from Northern Ireland access free NHS abortions in England. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Anti-abortion group Precious Life said the result of the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum marked the ""most tragic day in Irish history"". Bernadette Smyth said the result would only ""spur on"" anti-abortion activists to step up their battle to protect the unborn north of the Irish border, ""Northern Ireland is now the beacon of hope to the pro-life movement around the world,"" she said. But Fr Joe McDonald, from St Matthew's Ballyfermot in Dublin, says the referendum result has been ""a huge wakeup call"" for the Catholic Church in Ireland. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, the priest, who is originally from west Belfast, said: ""It's a huge change for us. The church has, in my view, got a huge wakeup call but it's been having those for a while. ""The church is dying in front of us and it's whether we can respond to that in a healthy way. ""If we cannot listen to the roar of the Irish people, in particular women, and we're not good on that, then we're embracing the death and in the sense we deserve that.""

Music festival ban on under-18s proposed,"Mutiny in the Park was held a week after the Manchester Arena bombing Under-18s could be banned from a music festival in a bid to reduce crime at the event. Police have asked Portsmouth City Council to increase the minimum entry age for Mutiny in the Park in Cosham from 16 after reports of sex assaults, drug use and fighting. Hampshire Constabulary said children as young as 13 gained entry to the 2017 event. Organiser Luke Betts said revised entry procedures had already been devised. More on this and other stories from across the South of England In a submission to the council, police said ""children under the age of 16 were able to access the premises"" and ""this has led to children becoming victims and perpetrators of assaults and being sexually assaulted"". A report to the city's licensing sub-committee said one 14-year-old girl who had been ""signed in"" by a parent reported being sexually assaulted. Mr Betts said: ""It's a fact that last year a parent has lied when signing in their child. It was a flaw in the system and we recognise that. ""Young people often do not have ID, unfortunately, but this year we will require everyone to have photo ID. ""When you put 30,000 people in a field, there are going to be incidents. Organisers are constantly being challenged to improve and make things safer."" City culture councillor Linda Symes said licence holders found themselves in ""extraordinary circumstances"" following the Manchester Arena attack the Monday prior to the festival. She said: ""This put significant additional burden on to the event organisers as their whole event was re-evaluated."" The event at King George V Fields on 27 and 28 May featured Chase & Status and 50 Cent. Tickets for the 2018, scheduled for 26 and 27 May, are expected to go on sale on Friday.

Bid to form government in Italy fails,"Giuseppe Conte leaves after meeting President Mattarella Italian PM-designate Giuseppe Conte has given up his bid to form a government after the country's president vetoed his choice of economy minister. President Sergio Matarella said he had agreed to all proposals but could not back Paolo Savona, a eurosceptic. Mr Matarella's move angered populist parties trying to form a coalition. Luigi Di Maio, the leader of 5-Star, called for the president's impeachment. Italy has been without a government since elections on 4 March. Two populist parties, 5-Star, which won 32% of the vote, and the far-right League party, which won 18%, had agreed earlier this month after days of talks to form a coalition. There is now a real argument in Italy between the president and the populists about this country's position in the EU, the BBC's James Reynolds reports from Rome. As a stopgap move, the head of state has summoned former  International Monetary Fund (IMF) economist Carlo Cotarelli potentially to take over as a non-populist prime minister. But this appointment may not last and the only immediate solution may be an early election in which, all of a sudden, Italy's membership of the euro and its relationship with the EU itself really are up for discussion, our correspondent adds. Italy's economy in charts Italy populists: What you should know Should Europe be scared of Italy's coalition? Mr Conte, a political novice, was proposed by the two parties as prime minister in an attempt to break Italy's 11-week political deadlock. President Mattarella is now under attack He went to meet Mr Mattarella to put forward picks for his cabinet but the president vetoed Mr Savona as finance minister, citing his fierce opposition to the EU. Under Italian law, the president has the right to reject the appointment of a cabinet member but his decision was a controversial one. Mr Di Maio called for impeachment under article 90 of the constitution, which allows parliament to demand a president step down based on a simple majority vote. If a vote were to be successful, the country's constitutional court would then decide whether to impeach or not. ""After tonight, it's truly difficult to believe in the institutions and the laws of the state,"" Mr Di Maio said. Mr Mattarella said he had ""agreed and accepted all the proposals except that of the economy minister"". Carlo Cottarelli has a reputation for cutting public spending ""No-one can claim that I have stood in the way of the formation of the so-called government for change,"" he said. He said he would wait before deciding whether to call fresh elections, and summoned Mr Cottarelli for talks on Monday. Mr Cottarelli, 64, worked at the IMF from 2008 to 2013, gaining the nickname ""Mr Scissors"" for making cuts to public spending in Italy. Mr Di Maio said Mr Mattarella's rejection of Mr Savona was ""unacceptable"". ""It's an institutional clash without precedent,"" he said in a live Facebook video. Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, called for a new election. ""In a democracy, if we are still in democracy, there's only one thing to do, let the Italians have their say,"" he told supporters in a speech in central Italy. Italy country profile Mr Savona, who served as industry minister during the 1990s, has been an outspoken critic of the EU and an opponent of austerity programmes, prompting concern over the proposed government's commitment to the EU and ability to rein in the country's massive national debt - equal to 1.3 times its annual output. Paolo Savona is a strong critic of the EU The League had proposed to cut personal and business taxes and roll back planned pension reforms designed to cut government spending, at a cost running into tens of billions of euros. President Mattarella warned on Sunday that the prospect of a populist government had ""alarmed Italian and foreign investors"" and worsened the ""spread"" - the gap between Italian and German 10-year government bond yields. The spread rose to 215 basis points on Friday - the widest in four years. Ratings agency Moody's warned that it might downgrade Italy's sovereign debt rating to ""Baa3"" - one notch above the junk rating.

Doctors' gender pay gap 'to be eliminated',"Female medical staff are paid 15% less than their male counterparts The NHS in England is to review how much it pays male and female doctors in an effort to eliminate a gender pay gap of 15%. A review announced by the health secretary will look at why male doctors are paid on average Â£10,000 more than female doctors,as the BBC reported. Across the whole NHS, women are paid 23% less than men despite far more women being employed. A leading female doctor is to lead the review into the reasons behind the gap. Prof Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, will lead the independent review into gender pay inequality. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, she said women made ""brilliant doctors"" and had ""contributed hugely to the health service"", and the review would look to ""sort out a level of inequality that's been going on for many years"". She added that as more than 50% of medical school entrants were women, the problem ""needs to be fixed"". Male doctors are paid on average Â£67,788 in basic pay, compared with Â£57,569 for female doctors. Prof Dacre said the review would look at why some women's career trajectories might be slower than their male counterparts, adding ""societal expectations on women"" mean they are more likely to take time out to care for children, or relatives. Top women doctors lose out in NHS pay stakes Final gender pay gap figures revealed Top women doctors earn less than men NHS pay: Unions agree deal for 1.3 million staff Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary in England, said it was unacceptable that staff still faced gender inequality and he was ""determined"" to eliminate the pay gap. The pay gap exists because there are more higher-paid male doctors than female doctors in senior positions, although women make up more than half of junior doctors. Taking time out to have children can affect pay progression, particularly for female consultants. They are also much less likely to given reward payments for work done over-and-above their core roles. The review will look at a number of issues which can stop a woman progressing in her career, including: working patterns and their impact on those in the medical profession impact of motherhood on careers and progression care arrangements and their affordability, and issues around being a carer access to flexible working shared parental leave, identify factors that are resulting in a slow uptake the predominance of men in senior roles the impact of rewards payments geographical issues Dr Anthea Mowat, from the British Medical Association, said women still faced all kinds of barriers in their careers and she hoped the review would lead to policy changes.

Taylor Swift's hits-and-run set in Swansea,"Taylor Swift stayed true to her name, playing a brief, but flawless, set at the BBC's Biggest Weekend in Swansea. Effectively a stripped-back supercut of her current world tour, the six-song performance largely focused on the star's 2017 album Reputation. She opened with the pummelling goth-pop of Ready For It, before racing through songs like Gorgeous and Delicate. Fans were forced to wait to the end to hear the classics Blank Space and Shake It Off - and then it was all over. But if the 26,000-strong audience who'd crammed into Swansea's Singleton Park felt short-changed, they didn't show it, shimmying along with Swift and her tightly-drilled dancers. ""You're not just singing along but you're screaming along... which is the best,"" said Taylor, as she took stock of the crowd. ""It kind of took my breath away a little bit when I first came out here."" The star also worked in two plugs for her UK tour dates, as she played live on BBC TV and radio. Swift by name, swift by nature... the star was on stage for 28 minutes The star introduced her dancers to the crowd between songs But if her set was ruthless in its efficiency, it was nonetheless a masterclass in pop - from Swift's effortless vocals and shape-throwing choreography to her adorkable between-song banter. ""Oh wait, this is in the wrong key!"" she laughed as she fumbled the start of Delicate, sliding a capo up the neck of her guitar to find the right note. ""She was fantastic. She's amazing. She's unique,"" said Lauren, who was happy to see the star in her hometown. ""You don't often get to see Taylor Swift in Swansea, let's be fair."" Swift's Reputation was one of 2017's biggest-selling albums ""It was briefer than I thought it was going to be,"" added Chantelle from Miskin, Rhondda Cynon Taff. ""I was expecting a little bit more Swifty but she looked good."" Charis Lee, from Abergavenny, commented: ""I'd have liked to hear some of the older stuff - the country stuff - but she was amazing."" After performing, Swift admitted backstage that she had been ""a tiny bit nervous"". ""We pretty much had no time to rehearse for this. This was kind of like, on the fly,"" she told Radio 1's Greg James. The star also declared ""I'm not worth it!"" when she was told her performance bumped Antiques Roadshow off the Sunday night TV schedule. This video can not be played Florence Welch anoints the crowd Swift was followed by headliner, Florence + The Machine, who gave a spirited, spiritual performance, as she whirled across the stage like a barefoot shamanic warrior. After clasping a fan's head in her hands during What Kind Of Man, she closed her set with a promise about the restorative powers of her hit single Shake It Out. ""I've been to a lot of festivals, and I know how it feels at the end of the second day,"" she said. ""If you sing this song, I promise you will not have a hangover tomorrow. ""I wrote it with a hangover... but that's beside the point."" Camila Cabello said she'd enjoyed her first experience of Wales Earlier in the day, Camila Cabello - who is supporting Swift on her current world tour - gave a spectacular performance on Swansea's main stage, playing her own hits Havana and Never Be The Same alongside snippets of Prince's Purple Rain and Can't Help Falling In Love. The 21-year-old's pin-sharp choreography and exuberant charisma made her one of the day's stand-out performers - a feat that was all the more impressive given that she was battling the heat, while jet-lagged, in a skin-tight black catsuit. ""Why did I do that?"" she laughed, as she spoke to BBC News after the show. ""It was so hot up there, I thought I was going to pass out at one point but I was like, 'I'm going to give everything to Swansea. They'll have to carry me out of here!'"" The singer, who arrived in Wales on Saturday night after playing a show on Swift's world tour in Denver, said she'd been impressed by her first encounter with the country. ""I was in Cardiff last night and we were walking outside. It was like 11pm and there was a lady that was... drunk. She was wasted. ""She was approaching this guy [who was] playing guitar. And she was like, 'Play Havana!' and she started singing the chorus. ""I got out my phone to record it, and she just stumbled away!"" This video can not be played Rita Ora made Avicii's song the centrepiece of her set Other performers in Swansea on Sunday included Rita Ora, who opened the main stage with a clutch of her own hits, and a tribute to dance star Avicii, who died last month. Biggest Weekend: The power of a singalong Ed Sheeran 'warms up' Biggest Weekend George Ezra: 'It's like school backstage' Manics play 'Wireless' Biggest Weekend set One Direction star Niall Horan led a mass singalong to his solo tracks Slow Hands and This Town, as well as a slowed-down reggae version of the 1D hit Drag Me Down. Demi Lovato, Stefflon Don, Thirty Seconds To Mars and Jason Derulo also kept the crowd entertained as they waited for Swift and Florence + The Machine, who will close the event. Shawn Mendes drew one of the day's biggest crowds to the stage in Swansea's Singleton Park Meanwhile, Coventry's War Memorial Park saw Radio 2 continue its contribution to the Biggest Weekend, with sets from Snow Patrol, UB40 and headliner Liam Gallagher. Wearing his traditional uniform of a zipped-up cagoule and an Elvis sneer, he played a tried-and-tested festival set that kicked off with the Oasis classics Rock And Roll Star and Morning Glory. ""Alright Coventry, don't listen to what people say about you, you are a proper city,"" he announced at as he took the stage. It might have seemed like an odd way to win over the crowd - but he was aware they'd braved a rainstorm to watch him perform. ""Thanks for sticking round I know the weather ain't been nice,"" he acknowledged. Though his voice is clearly not what it was, the 45-year-old still carries himself like a rock star, belting out defiant lyrics, and closing his set with an emotional Live Forever - which he memorably sang at the One Love Manchester show last year. Liam Gallagher concentrated on Oasis songs, and his recent solo album Earlier, Coventry's main stage had been launched by Welsh rockers Stereophonics - a  band who aren't used to such an early morning slot. ""Let me think how it was sold to us,"" singer Kelly Jones told the BBC. ""Remember that time that U2 and Paul McCartney opened up Live 8? ""And we could be back in the pub by five. So yeah, we took it."" One artist who brought some Caribbean sunshine to Coventry was Billy Ocean, whose crowd-pleasing set included the Bob Marley classic No Woman, No Cry as well as Love Really Hurts, Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car and, of course, Caribbean Queen. Billy Ocean said he was thrilled by the response to his set in Coventry ""I saw lots of people enjoying themselves,"" he said after coming off the stage. ""The energy from them comes back to you. We keep doing what we do because we make people happy. There's nothing like it."" Full coverage of the four-day music festival is available on BBC TV, radio and the dedicatedBiggest Weekend website. The event wraps up in Coventry on Monday, with a day dedicated to classical music, including sets by Nigel Kennedy, Eliza Carthy and a ""Strictly Spectacular"" featuring the show's professional dancers and the BBC Concert Orchestra.

US and N Korea preparing leaders' summit,"This video can not be played Korean leaders' surprise ""Hollywood"" meeting A US team is holding talks with North Korean officials to prepare a possible meeting between President Donald Trump and the North's leader Kim Jong-un. The talks in the village of Panmunjom, in the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas, are the latest sign that the summit could take place after all. On Thursday Mr Trump called off the meeting - due in Singapore next month - citing the North's ""hostility"". But both sides have since been working to get it back on track. On Saturday Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held an unannounced meeting. Mr Moon said the North's leader had ""again made clear his commitment to a complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". Mr Kim later spoke of his ""fixed will"" that the summit should go ahead. On Sunday Mr Trump tweeted that it would help the North achieve its ""brilliant potential"". Allow Twitter content?

Rush to buy Trump-Kim coin after summit cancellation Analysis: Decoding Trump's letter to Kim 'My country was trying to test Trump' The team is reportedly led by Sung Kim, a former ambassador to South Korea, and was to hold talks with North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. The aim of the talks is to set an agenda for the summit between the leaders. While officials appear more optimistic about that meeting going ahead, recent weeks have shown that the relationship can change very quickly, says the BBC's Chris Butler in Washington. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. There is still a lot of ground to be covered and Mr Trump has clearly shown that if he does not think a deal can be done, he will not go. It is unclear whether Mr Kim will agree to fully abandon his nuclear arsenal. Similar pledges in the past have not been upheld. Analysts say the US had wanted denuclearisation first - followed by rewards in the form of lifted sanctions and economic aid. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Mr Kim has indicated he wants a phased approach, with his steps met by reciprocal ones from the US and the South - mainly on sanctions but also easing of the US military presence in South Korea. Mr Trump has not ruled out such an approach. North Korea has been subjected to numerous rounds of international sanctions since 2006, which has cut off most of its exports and capped its imports of oil. The North also wants assurances that its survival as a state would never be in question. Getting this far has been a surprise given that North Korea had maintained its strident rhetoric - and continued its nuclear and missile tests - through 2016 and 2017. This brought a bitter war of words between Mr Trump and the North Korean leadership. But a rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea. Koreans played under a unified flag at the Winter Olympics The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, held in the South. Mr Kim announced he was suspending nuclear tests and held his landmark summit with Mr Moon last month. This weekNorth Korea said it had dismantled its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, although scientists believe it partially collapsed after the last test in September 2017.

Food and farming sector makes Brexit demands,"The food and farming industry wants assurances from the government that it will still be able to recruit enough staff from the EU after Brexit. The demand came as part of a manifesto drawn up by more than 100 organisations across the industry and sent to the PM. It urges the government to publish a white paper setting out its immigration plans ""as a matter of priority"". A government spokesperson said those in the sector would be able to recruit EU citizens until December 2020. Those in the farming industry have previously raised concerns about the impact of leaving the European Union on agricultural labour, which is often short-term, flexible and seasonal. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said earlier this year that the case for a seasonal agricultural workers scheme after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 was ""compelling."" The future of farming after Brexit Gove backing Brexit farm workers support Seasonal staff shortfall blamed on Brexit The Food Supply Chain manifesto,externalwas sent to Prime Minister Theresa May by the National Farmers' Union president Minette Batters. It said the ""significant number"" of EU nationals the sector employed meant it was vital the government ""ensures a continuing, adequate supply of permanent and seasonal labour"" before and after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. The document said that recruitment difficulties from within the UK meant the government needed to guarantee that ""in the short- to medium-term, the industry has access to the overseas labour market to help meet its recruitment needs"". The other main issues raised in the manifesto, drawn up by organisations representing farmers and their suppliers as well as manufacturers and retailers, were: Maintaining ""frictionless"" trade with the EU Developing an agriculture policy which promotes food production while maintaining existing high standards Ensuring an ""efficient and proportionate"" regulatory system NFU president Ms Batters said a Brexit that failed to champion UK food producers ""will be bad for the country's landscape, the economy and, critically, our society"". She added: ""The signatories to this manifesto will be looking to government to ensure its objectives are aligned with ours, to ensure British food production - something of which every person in this country enjoys the benefits - gets the best possible deal post-Brexit."" In response to the manifesto, a government spokesperson said: ""We have been clear that up until December 2020, employers in the agricultural and food processing sectors will be free to recruit EU citizens to fill vacancies and those arriving to work will be able to stay in the UK afterwards. ""We are determined to get the best deal for the UK in our EU negotiations, not least for our world-leading food and farming industry which is a key part of our economic success.""

"Triathlon ad 'will ruin wedding photos'Man, 20, rescued from child's swingDog 'adopts' nine orphaned ducklingsVideoVideo","The billboard features images of local Olympic heroes the Brownlee brothers A bride-to-be says her wedding photos will be ruined by a huge advert across the front of the venue. Sarah Dooley is due to marry fiancÃ©, Andy Dodds, at Leeds Town Hall - outside which couples traditionally pose for photos - at the weekend. But they were unaware they would be sharing the stage with the advert for next month's World Triathlon. Leeds City Council said the Town Hall was ""important for promoting major events"" and the banner would remain. The sandstone facade of the picturesque Victorian building is currently hidden behind the endurance event billboard. More Yorkshire stories Ms Dooley, who met her partner while at university in Leeds, said the couple would have chosen another venue if they had known. ""We looked at tipis, castles, tree-houses, but picked Leeds Town Hall because it's iconic and we wanted our photos taken outside,"" she said. ""Leeds is really important to us, we brought our children up here and we wanted something that represented our relationship."" Sarah Dooley said she is ""disappointed"" to not have their wedding photos outside the Town Hall Ms Dooley said she did not want compensation but was ""disappointed"" that the couple were not told in advance about the banner. Instead of photos outside the town hall, the wedding party will walk to nearby Park Square. A spokesperson for Leeds City Council, which owns the town hall, said it ""understands Miss Dooley's disappointment"" but the banners would not be removed. ""Leeds Town Hall is the venue for hundreds of weddings each year and we always do our absolute best to make sure every couple's day is as special as possible"", he said. ""Banners promoting next month's World Triathlon Leeds are scheduled to be in place for several weeks and unfortunately, it isn't possible to remove them for a day.""

The 20-year-old had been firmly wedged in the child-sized seat for three hours before police were called to Landseer Park in Ipswich at 07:50 BST. When a ""shove and pull"" method of swing-release failed, the fire service arrived with a trusty screwdriver. The swing was taken apart and the ""grateful but embarrassed"" grown-up was freed unharmed. A Suffolk police community support officer quickly realised the man - who complained he had been in there for three hours - was definitely stuck. If a shove does not work, there's always the trusty screwdriver There was no shifting him as the girth of his rear was clearly too wide for the child-sized swing. After taking the swing to pieces and releasing the man, crews from Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service put it back together so it could be safely used by someone of the right size.

Dog 'adopts' nine orphaned ducklingsVideoVideo,"This video can not be played Fred the dog took the ducklings 'under his paw' A dog has ""adopted"" nine ducklings after their mother disappeared. Fred, a 10-year-old labrador has become ""dad"" to the baby birds at Mountfitchet Castle, a tourist attraction near Stansted Airport in Essex. The ducklings' mother was nowhere to be found when staff noticed them waddling around alone, but ""Fred... immediately took to them and has been babysitting ever since."" They have even followed him into the castle moat for a swim, staff said. Supermarket cat defies Tesco 'ban' Ducklings saved after mother run over Family 'shocked' by slithering toilet snake The reconstructed Norman castle is home to a number of rescued animals, but Fred is ""the resident dog"". Fred has become dad (and mum) to the nine ducklings This headgear would have gone down a storm at the Royal Wedding A spokeswoman said staff were ""very worried"" when the ducklings' mother disappeared on Thursday, leaving them ""looking a little bit lost"". But Fred, who belongs to one of the attraction's owners, Jeremy Goldsmith, stepped in to help. ""We brought the ducklings into the house as they are too young to fend for themselves, and Fred just took them under his paw - rather than his wing,"" said Mr Goldsmith. The ducklings follow the dog everywhere, its owner said It is not known what happened to the ducklings' mother ""He's got a lovely nature and has grown up around rescued animals."" The ducklings sleep in the dog basket with Fred and follow him around as though he was their mother. ""They absolutely adore him and he has now resigned himself to being a stay-at-home dad looking after the nine baby ducklings,"" Mr Goldsmith said. When they are old enough to fend for themselves, Fred's babysitting duties will cease Mr Goldsmith said he only expected Fred's babysitting services to last another few weeks, after which the ducklings will be free to stay at the castle or leave.

Lock up fewer offenders - minister,"There needs to be a ""massive reduction"" in the number of people sent to prison for 12 months or less, ministers say. Prisons minister Rory Stewart said short sentences made offenders more likely to commit crime. He also suggested prisoners released on licence could be used to fill labour shortages in low-skilled jobs caused ""partly"" by Brexit. The government is keen to reduce the UK's prison population, which has doubled over the past 25 years. Meanwhile, Justice Secretary David Gauke told The Times: ""Twenty-five years ago the population was 44,000. Today it's 84,000. I would like it to fall."" Why are community sentences falling out of favour? New body to get ex-prisoners into work Mr Stewart said the increase had been driven by longer sentences for violent offenders and ""many, many more sex offenders"". ""Nearly a quarter of our prisoners now are sex offenders, many of them older men in for historic sex offences,"" he told the Sunday Politics programme. There were also a lot of prisoners ""cycling"" in and out of the system on sentences of a few weeks or even less, in the case of those recalled to jail on licence days, he added. ""The statistics demonstrate that sending someone to prison for a very short period makes them more likely to re-offend compared to community sentences. ""So it's not good for them and it's not good for public safety."" Exceptions to any new sentencing guidelines would ""probably"" have to be made for violent offenders, he said, and it was important to retain an element of ""punishment"" in sentences. Community sentences have fallen out of favour with judges and magistrates in recent years over concerns about their effectiveness, amid budget cuts and the part-privatisation of the system. Greggs is among the companies offering offenders another chance But Mr Stewart said reoffending rates were ""far too high from short sentences"" and they were also disrupting the prison system. He also backed comments by his boss, David Gauke, who suggested prisoners could be let out for the day to work in sectors like catering, construction and agriculture, which were expected to be hit by Britain's departure from the EU. ""Partly because of Brexit, there is a labour shortage,"" said Mr Stewart. ""Which means that prisoners with the right kind of training, the right kind of attitudes, as Pret a Manger are finding, or Greggs the bakers are finding, or Timpson's the shoe company are finding, can provide very loyal, good employees."" The government has made a series of U-turns on allowing prisoners out to do work under licence, amid concerns some were absconding to commit further crime. Mr Stewart admitted the government had gone ""back and forth"" on the issue but, he said, prisoners who had a job to go to were less likely to re-offend, and ""only one in 10,000 people released on temporary license go on to commit a serious crime"". Are middle class drug users fuelling violent crime? In a separate development, Mr Gauke claimed middle class drug users should feel ""guilt and responsibility"" for fuelling the rise in fatal stabbings in the UK. ""People who do that have to recognise they are fuelling the industry that's resulting in the knife crimes, resulting in the difficulties we're having in prisons,"" Mr Gauke told Sky's Ridge on Sunday. UK becoming 'cocaine capital' of Europe 'McMafia gangs' fuel London violence - MP ""There's a responsibility for middle class people that take cocaine at a dinner party, that when they see a story of a 15-year-old boy stabbed in Hackney (east London) they should feel a degree of guilt and responsibility."" Police Federation deputy treasurer Simon Kempton has also blamed the wealthy for creating the demand for cocaine, while security minister Ben Wallace warned the UK was ""fast becoming the biggest consumer"" of the drug in Europe.

Taylor Swift's hits-and-run Swansea set,"Taylor Swift stayed true to her name, playing a brief, but flawless, set at the BBC's Biggest Weekend in Swansea. Effectively a stripped-back supercut of her current world tour, the six-song performance largely focused on the star's 2017 album Reputation. She opened with the pummelling goth-pop of Ready For It, before racing through songs like Gorgeous and Delicate. Fans were forced to wait to the end to hear the classics Blank Space and Shake It Off - and then it was all over. But if the 26,000-strong audience who'd crammed into Swansea's Singleton Park felt short-changed, they didn't show it, shimmying along with Swift and her tightly-drilled dancers. ""You're not just singing along but you're screaming along... which is the best,"" said Taylor, as she took stock of the crowd. ""It kind of took my breath away a little bit when I first came out here."" The star also worked in two plugs for her UK tour dates, as she played live on BBC TV and radio. Swift by name, swift by nature... the star was on stage for 28 minutes The star introduced her dancers to the crowd between songs But if her set was ruthless in its efficiency, it was nonetheless a masterclass in pop - from Swift's effortless vocals and shape-throwing choreography to her adorkable between-song banter. ""Oh wait, this is in the wrong key!"" she laughed as she fumbled the start of Delicate, sliding a capo up the neck of her guitar to find the right note. ""She was fantastic. She's amazing. She's unique,"" said Lauren, who was happy to see the star in her hometown. ""You don't often get to see Taylor Swift in Swansea, let's be fair."" Swift's Reputation was one of 2017's biggest-selling albums ""It was briefer than I thought it was going to be,"" added Chantelle from Miskin, Rhondda Cynon Taff. ""I was expecting a little bit more Swifty but she looked good."" Charis Lee, from Abergavenny, commented: ""I'd have liked to hear some of the older stuff - the country stuff - but she was amazing."" After performing, Swift admitted backstage that she had been ""a tiny bit nervous"". ""We pretty much had no time to rehearse for this. This was kind of like, on the fly,"" she told Radio 1's Greg James. The star also declared ""I'm not worth it!"" when she was told her performance bumped Antiques Roadshow off the Sunday night TV schedule. This video can not be played Florence Welch anoints the crowd Swift was followed by headliner, Florence + The Machine, who gave a spirited, spiritual performance, as she whirled across the stage like a barefoot shamanic warrior. After clasping a fan's head in her hands during What Kind Of Man, she closed her set with a promise about the restorative powers of her hit single Shake It Out. ""I've been to a lot of festivals, and I know how it feels at the end of the second day,"" she said. ""If you sing this song, I promise you will not have a hangover tomorrow. ""I wrote it with a hangover... but that's beside the point."" Camila Cabello said she'd enjoyed her first experience of Wales Earlier in the day, Camila Cabello - who is supporting Swift on her current world tour - gave a spectacular performance on Swansea's main stage, playing her own hits Havana and Never Be The Same alongside snippets of Prince's Purple Rain and Can't Help Falling In Love. The 21-year-old's pin-sharp choreography and exuberant charisma made her one of the day's stand-out performers - a feat that was all the more impressive given that she was battling the heat, while jet-lagged, in a skin-tight black catsuit. ""Why did I do that?"" she laughed, as she spoke to BBC News after the show. ""It was so hot up there, I thought I was going to pass out at one point but I was like, 'I'm going to give everything to Swansea. They'll have to carry me out of here!'"" The singer, who arrived in Wales on Saturday night after playing a show on Swift's world tour in Denver, said she'd been impressed by her first encounter with the country. ""I was in Cardiff last night and we were walking outside. It was like 11pm and there was a lady that was... drunk. She was wasted. ""She was approaching this guy [who was] playing guitar. And she was like, 'Play Havana!' and she started singing the chorus. ""I got out my phone to record it, and she just stumbled away!"" This video can not be played Rita Ora made Avicii's song the centrepiece of her set Other performers in Swansea on Sunday included Rita Ora, who opened the main stage with a clutch of her own hits, and a tribute to dance star Avicii, who died last month. Biggest Weekend: The power of a singalong Ed Sheeran 'warms up' Biggest Weekend George Ezra: 'It's like school backstage' Manics play 'Wireless' Biggest Weekend set One Direction star Niall Horan led a mass singalong to his solo tracks Slow Hands and This Town, as well as a slowed-down reggae version of the 1D hit Drag Me Down. Demi Lovato, Stefflon Don, Thirty Seconds To Mars and Jason Derulo also kept the crowd entertained as they waited for Swift and Florence + The Machine, who will close the event. Shawn Mendes drew one of the day's biggest crowds to the stage in Swansea's Singleton Park Meanwhile, Coventry's War Memorial Park saw Radio 2 continue its contribution to the Biggest Weekend, with sets from Snow Patrol, UB40 and headliner Liam Gallagher. Wearing his traditional uniform of a zipped-up cagoule and an Elvis sneer, he played a tried-and-tested festival set that kicked off with the Oasis classics Rock And Roll Star and Morning Glory. ""Alright Coventry, don't listen to what people say about you, you are a proper city,"" he announced at as he took the stage. It might have seemed like an odd way to win over the crowd - but he was aware they'd braved a rainstorm to watch him perform. ""Thanks for sticking round I know the weather ain't been nice,"" he acknowledged. Though his voice is clearly not what it was, the 45-year-old still carries himself like a rock star, belting out defiant lyrics, and closing his set with an emotional Live Forever - which he memorably sang at the One Love Manchester show last year. Liam Gallagher concentrated on Oasis songs, and his recent solo album Earlier, Coventry's main stage had been launched by Welsh rockers Stereophonics - a  band who aren't used to such an early morning slot. ""Let me think how it was sold to us,"" singer Kelly Jones told the BBC. ""Remember that time that U2 and Paul McCartney opened up Live 8? ""And we could be back in the pub by five. So yeah, we took it."" One artist who brought some Caribbean sunshine to Coventry was Billy Ocean, whose crowd-pleasing set included the Bob Marley classic No Woman, No Cry as well as Love Really Hurts, Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car and, of course, Caribbean Queen. Billy Ocean said he was thrilled by the response to his set in Coventry ""I saw lots of people enjoying themselves,"" he said after coming off the stage. ""The energy from them comes back to you. We keep doing what we do because we make people happy. There's nothing like it."" Full coverage of the four-day music festival is available on BBC TV, radio and the dedicatedBiggest Weekend website. The event wraps up in Coventry on Monday, with a day dedicated to classical music, including sets by Nigel Kennedy, Eliza Carthy and a ""Strictly Spectacular"" featuring the show's professional dancers and the BBC Concert Orchestra.

Biggest Weekend: Rita Ora's Avicii tribute,"This video can not be played Rita Ora made Avicii's song the centrepiece of her set Rita Ora paid an emotional tribute to dance producer Avicii as she opened up the third day of the BBC's Biggest Weekend festival in Swansea. Avicii's name flashed up on the video screens as Ora sang their collaboration Lonely Together - the final single the DJ released before his death in April. ""Thank you for singing that with me,"" she told the crowd as the song ended. ""It's always hard for me to sing that, so thank you so much for singing along."" Ora has previously said described Avicii as ""a really good friend"" who ""changed my life"". The Swedish musician, born Tim Bergling, died last month at the age of 28. Astatement released by his familyseemed to suggest the cause of death was suicide. Best known for the international hits Wake Me Up and Levels, he had recently retired from touring, saying the lifestyle was taking a toll on his health. After he was found dead in Oman, DJ Pete Tong suggested it was ""time to establish a support group"" for musicians who found themselves overwhelmed. Ora is not alone in paying tribute to Avicii. Calvin Harris said he was ""devastated"" and called the star ""a beautiful soul"" while Imagine Dragons said ""the world was a happier and fuller place with his presence"". Avicii's family announced last week that his funeral would be held privately ""in the presence of the people who were closest to Tim"".

Italy's Conte gives up bid for governmentGiuseppe Conte renounces his attempt to become PM amid reports the president vetoed his economy pick.5m6 minutes agoEurope,"Giuseppe Conte leaves after meeting President Mattarella Italian PM-designate Giuseppe Conte has given up his bid to form a government after the country's president vetoed his choice of economy minister. President Sergio Matarella said he had agreed to all proposals but could not back Paolo Savona, a eurosceptic. Mr Matarella's move angered populist parties trying to form a coalition. Luigi Di Maio, the leader of 5-Star, called for the president's impeachment. Italy has been without a government since elections on 4 March. Two populist parties, 5-Star, which won 32% of the vote, and the far-right League party, which won 18%, had agreed earlier this month after days of talks to form a coalition. There is now a real argument in Italy between the president and the populists about this country's position in the EU, the BBC's James Reynolds reports from Rome. As a stopgap move, the head of state has summoned former  International Monetary Fund (IMF) economist Carlo Cotarelli potentially to take over as a non-populist prime minister. But this appointment may not last and the only immediate solution may be an early election in which, all of a sudden, Italy's membership of the euro and its relationship with the EU itself really are up for discussion, our correspondent adds. Italy's economy in charts Italy populists: What you should know Should Europe be scared of Italy's coalition? Mr Conte, a political novice, was proposed by the two parties as prime minister in an attempt to break Italy's 11-week political deadlock. President Mattarella is now under attack He went to meet Mr Mattarella to put forward picks for his cabinet but the president vetoed Mr Savona as finance minister, citing his fierce opposition to the EU. Under Italian law, the president has the right to reject the appointment of a cabinet member but his decision was a controversial one. Mr Di Maio called for impeachment under article 90 of the constitution, which allows parliament to demand a president step down based on a simple majority vote. If a vote were to be successful, the country's constitutional court would then decide whether to impeach or not. ""After tonight, it's truly difficult to believe in the institutions and the laws of the state,"" Mr Di Maio said. Mr Mattarella said he had ""agreed and accepted all the proposals except that of the economy minister"". Carlo Cottarelli has a reputation for cutting public spending ""No-one can claim that I have stood in the way of the formation of the so-called government for change,"" he said. He said he would wait before deciding whether to call fresh elections, and summoned Mr Cottarelli for talks on Monday. Mr Cottarelli, 64, worked at the IMF from 2008 to 2013, gaining the nickname ""Mr Scissors"" for making cuts to public spending in Italy. Mr Di Maio said Mr Mattarella's rejection of Mr Savona was ""unacceptable"". ""It's an institutional clash without precedent,"" he said in a live Facebook video. Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, called for a new election. ""In a democracy, if we are still in democracy, there's only one thing to do, let the Italians have their say,"" he told supporters in a speech in central Italy. Italy country profile Mr Savona, who served as industry minister during the 1990s, has been an outspoken critic of the EU and an opponent of austerity programmes, prompting concern over the proposed government's commitment to the EU and ability to rein in the country's massive national debt - equal to 1.3 times its annual output. Paolo Savona is a strong critic of the EU The League had proposed to cut personal and business taxes and roll back planned pension reforms designed to cut government spending, at a cost running into tens of billions of euros. President Mattarella warned on Sunday that the prospect of a populist government had ""alarmed Italian and foreign investors"" and worsened the ""spread"" - the gap between Italian and German 10-year government bond yields. The spread rose to 215 basis points on Friday - the widest in four years. Ratings agency Moody's warned that it might downgrade Italy's sovereign debt rating to ""Baa3"" - one notch above the junk rating.

I don't wish to be PM - Rees-Mogg,"This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg: PM 'crucial' to delivering Brexit Leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has rejected press speculation he is planning to challenge Theresa May for the party leadership. ""I wouldn't challenge Theresa May. That's a ridiculous idea. The prime minister has my full support,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""I don't wish to be prime minister,"" he added, saying his ""only ambition"" was to make Brexit happen. He urged the PM to take a tougher line on Brexit, saying errors had been made. UK 'playing hide and seek' in EU talks Brexit customs plan 'could cost Â£20bn' Rees-Mogg: PM's customs plan cretinous Mr Rees-Mogg has been highly critical of the prime minister's preferred option for customs arrangements with the EU and has questioned whether her government is still on track to deliver Brexit. He said the UK had made ""a lot of compromises"" during Brexit negotiations with Brussels and ""nothing has come back"". But he added: ""I am reassured in the last week. I think the government is still committed. But there are concerns, inevitably, about the way the negotiations are proceeding."" He said the prime minister had made a ""mistake"" at the start of Brexit talks by unilaterally committing the UK to an open border with the Republic of Ireland, saying it was ""overwhelmingly"" in Ireland's interests to have one too. ""I think, if you are going into a negotiation, you should use your strongest cards and just to tear one of them up and set hares running on other issues is, I think, an error,"" he said. He said it was wrong to consider temporarily keeping the UK closely tied to the EU's customs rules as a ""backstop"", in an attempt to solve the Irish border issue, saying: ""If you offer a backstop that is more attractive than anything that you're likely to negotiate from the other side's point of view. ""The backstop ends up becoming the frontstop."" He also questioned claims this week by the head of HM Revenue and Customs, Jon Thompson, that his own preferred customs option would cost businesses up to Â£20bn, saying that sounded like a ""high figure"". Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs an influential group of Brexiteer Tory MPs. the European Research Group, said remaining in some form of customs union with the EU for years after Brexit - which some have suggested will be the outcome of the talks with Brussels - would not be delivering on Brexit. He did not believe Theresa May should walk away from Brexit negotiations, he added, but should instead threaten not to pay the Â£40bn ""divorce bill"" agreed with the EU in December. ""We should say quite clearly, if we don't get the trade deal we want, you don't get the money'. That's a very strong negotiating position,"" he told Andrew Marr. He denied trying to ""menace"" the prime minister by telling her what to do, saying he was ""very respectful"" of her position, adding that she was the ""most impressive and dutiful leader that this country has ever had"". There was ""no menace in me at all"", he added. Asked if he would back the PM even if she returned from Brussels with a deal he did not like, he said: ""I will back the prime minister on delivering on the promises she made in the Conservative manifesto and in her various speeches."" Mr Rees-Mogg is currently favourite at the bookmakers to be the next Conservative leader, but he rejected speculation in the media that he was plotting a challenge to Mrs May, saying his only ambition was to ensure ""Brexit means Brexit"" from the back benches. According to the Mail on Sunday,external, Mr Rees-Mogg's company, Somerset Capital Management, which manages nearly Â£7.5bn on behalf of private investors and City institutions, ""has interests in two Russian firms blacklisted by the US and others which are controlled by oligarchs in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle"". Mr Rees Mogg said he no longer ran Somerset Capital Management's investments but, he added, its clients had asked the company to invest their money in ""emerging markets"". ""We have a fiduciary duty to them to invest it as well as we can in businesses that we think will do well, subject to the law of the land,"" he told Andrew Marr. He added: ""We can not run our investments on my political opinions. I think we should be much tougher on Russia. I think we should impose a level of sanctions that America has imposed on Russia.""

"Baddiel reveals why he 'laughs at death'The comic and writer tells Desert Island Discs it's how he processes life ""getting darker"".2h2 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","David Baddiel Comic and writer David Baddiel has said he talks about ""sad and difficult"" topics including his father's dementia, as a way of ""processing"" life. He told BBC Radio 4'sDesert Island Discs: ""As you get older your life gets darker. You're faced with mortality."" Speaking about his ""truth urge"", he said: ""Let's find the funny in those things. I don't think it's a denial, it's a bulwark."" Baddiel went on to speak about his father suffering from Pick's disease. ""It's a form of dementia, and is a ridiculous and cartoonish version of what he was like,"" he said. ""It involves people being sweary and obscene and impatient and apathetic - and my dad was always like that."" David Baddiel on impact of dad's dementia Baddiel with his partner Morwenna Banks and children Dolly and Ezra The comic also said he didn't want to seem ""arrogant"" by saying how truthful he is, adding it was ""because of my own limitations as a performer"", saying he was the ""opposite"" to his partner Morwenna Banks ""in terms of versatility and range"". Baddiel also revealed his love of musicals, saying he was ""obsessed"" with Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell when he was younger. This was reflected in his musical choice on the show of one of the songs from The Book of Mormon. He also spoke about his mother having a ""very public affair"" with a golfing memorabilia salesman, and ""turning our house into a shrine for golf"". ""It's quite hard to forget about the affair when there's a statue of Lee Trevino in your eyeline,"" he added. ""She was a good mother in lots of ways, very devoted to us three brothers."" But he added that he thought he became a comedian because he suspected her favourite child was his brother, Dan. In her defence, he added: ""But there's something very beautiful about a person whose life is nearly taken away."" He said his mother was three months old when the war broke out in Nazi Germany, and that she ""just got out with her parents to London but the rest of her family was murdered"". One of Baddiel's choices was Three Lions - his song with Frank Skinner and The Lightning Seeds for the European Championships in 1996, which were held in England. He said the singing of it at Wembley was ""an extraordinary moment in my life"". ""As I'm speaking now the goose pimples are rising on my flesh,"" he added. ""I still can't believe it happened."" The song came at the height of his success alongside Frank Skinner and the duo also had a TV show - Fantasy Football League - which tied into the rise of ""laddism"". However, Baddiel says his past behaviour was never misogynistic despite him being a leading figure in the lad culture of the 1990s.

First T-level colleges announced,"Thefirst schools and colleges,externalto teach new technical qualifications called T-levels have been announced. From 2020, they will offer teenagers in England courses in construction, digital, and education and childcare. Each course will include a three-month work placement and are intended as vocational alternatives to A-levels. Prime Minister Theresa May said they would help the UK to ""compete globally"", but Labour called the plans ""little more than meaningless spin."" A further 22 courses will be rolled out in stages from 2021 which will cover sectors such as finance, hair and beauty, engineering, and the creative industries. The courses' curriculums are being ""created by expert panels of employers,"" the government said. The first 52 high schools and colleges to teach the courses span all parts of England. T-levels - What are they? Skills training revamp 'to boost economy' Exam pupils banned from wearing watches Education secretary Damian Hinds said England currently had too many courses on offer for 16 to 19-year-olds, which could be confusing for parents, students and industry. ""We haven't been teaching enough hours"" or had businesses as involved as they should be, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme. ""This is a really big reform,"" he said. T-levels will become one of three main options for post-16 study alongside apprenticeships and A levels. Government figures,externalshow the majority of 17-year-olds in England in 2016 were not studying A-levels. Businesses want people with technical education and workplace experience to ""help them fill the skills gap,"" said Jane Gratton, head of skills policy at the British Chambers of Commerce. She said: ""T-levels will be an important part of the solution."" The new two-year courses will have more teaching hours than most current technical programmes and will include a compulsory work placement of 40-60 working days. A report from policy think tank the Resolution Foundation said the success of T levels would be ""contingent"" ongetting commitment from employers,externaland the ""appropriate levels of funding"". It pointed to the fact that businesses around the country would need to welcome some 100,000 students for work placements which presents an ""operational challenge"" and also a ""challenge to the current relationship that exists between business, education and young people"". Earlier in May, Jonathan Slater, a top official at the Department for Education, wrote to Mr Hinds saying it would be ""challenging"" to ensure the first three T-levels are ready to be taught from 2020 to a ""consistently high standard"". Mr Hinds rejected the claims, saying: ""Naming the first 52 colleges and providers where young people will be able to study the first T-levels is an important step forward."" Mrs May said the new courses were the ""most significant reform to advanced technical education in 70 years"" and would ""ensure young people have gold standard qualifications open to them, whichever route they choose"". But Prof Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, warned parents of encouraging their children to take them. ""It must be absolutely clear they will be of value to employers before kids risk their futures,"" he told the Times newspaper. And Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said the government was attempting to hide its ""failure to properly prepare"" for T-levels. ""World-class technical education cannot simply be delivered by press release, while avoiding the impact of years of cuts on the sector,"" she said.

England spot-fixing claims 'outrageous',"This video can not be played Corruption claims outrageous - Root Claims England players were involved in spot-fixing are ""outrageous"", says Test captain Joe Root. The allegations are made in a new documentary by broadcaster Al Jazeera, released on Sunday. In the programme, an alleged criminal match-fixer says three England players spot-fixed part of a Test match against India. The England and Wales Cricket Board has spoken to the England players, who ""emphatically deny the allegations"". ""It's outrageous that England players have been accused of this,"" Root said. Similar claims are also made against two Australian players - which cricket chiefs in that country have equally vociferously rejected, calling for any evidence to be released. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has already begun an investigation. ""There is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever,"" said Tom Harrison, chief executive of the ECB. ""The limited information we have been given has been discussed with all the England players. ""They emphatically deny the allegations, have stated categorically that the claims are false, and they have our full support."" England coach Trevor Bayliss was equally emphatic, telling BBC Test Match Special: ""It's outrageous to be honest. We'll just leave that up to the ECB to deal with."" Australian cricket chiefs said they were not aware of ""any credible evidence"" linking their players to alleged corruption. ""Although not having been provided an opportunity to view the documentary or any raw footage, our long-standing position on these matters is that credible claims will be treated very seriously and fully investigated,"" Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said. Alex Marshall, the general manager of the ICC anti-corruption unit, said: ""We are taking the contents of the programme and the allegations it has made extremely seriously. A full investigation is now under way to examine each claim made. ""We have been in ongoing dialogue with the broadcaster, which has refused our continual requests to cooperate and share information, which has hampered our investigation to date."" Some of the claims in the programme - Cricket's Match-Fixers - relate to the Sri Lankan Test venue in Galle. Earlier, Sri Lanka Cricketsaid it would give its ""fullest co-operation""to any investigation into match-fixing. The Pakistan Cricket Board said it was ""in the process of reviewing reports regarding the alleged involvement"" of one of its players in the documentary. According to Al Jazeera, an undercover reporter spent 18 months posing as a wealthy businessman in order to speak to members of criminal gangs in India involved in spot-fixing, who it says were filmed on a hidden camera giving details of how they allegedly paid professional cricketers to fix parts of matches. Spot-fixing is a deliberate attempt to manipulate part of a match, such as an over or a period of overs. A player would deliberately under-perform, which would enable criminals to bet on various categories - such as amount of runs scored - during the selected period. The incidents in themselves can be trivial and may not affect the result of the match.

PM facing calls for abortion reform in NI,"Attention has turned to Northern Ireland after the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favour of overturning the country's abortion ban The result of Ireland's abortion referendum has no impact on the law in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader has said. Arlene Foster said the legislation governing abortion is a devolved issue and the Northern Ireland Assembly should debate such issues. The government agreed with Mrs Foster. Labour and a number of senior Conservative MPs have called on Theresa May to back a reform in NI's abortion law after Friday's historic referendum. A government spokesperson said abortion law is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland. ""This very sensitive issue highlights the pressing need to restore a fully functioning executive,"" the spokesperson added. Northern Ireland's abortion law is more restrictive than the rest of the UK. NI women 'in limbo' over abortion law What next for abortion in NI? Moment Ireland's referendum result is announced 'Her soul will rest in peace now' Mrs Foster, whose party is propping up Theresa May's minority government, said a referendum was held in the Republic of Ireland because of the constitutional prohibition that existed there. She said no such constitutional bar exists in Northern Ireland. ""Friday's referendum has no impact upon the law in Northern Ireland, but we obviously take note of issues impacting upon our nearest neighbour,"" Mrs Foster said in a statement. ""The legislation governing abortion is a devolved matter and it is for the Northern Ireland Assembly to debate and decide such issues."" DUP leader Arlene Foster says the referendum in the Republic of Ireland has no impact on the law in Northern Ireland Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for almost 18 months, and several rounds of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have ended in failure. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissionhas brought a case before the Supreme Court arguing that current abortion legislation is contrary to human rights, especially with regard to victims of sex crime and fatal foetal abnormality. If the challenge proves successful, the court's ruling would go back to politicians. ""Then it would fall to the Northern Ireland Executive and the assembly, if it was sitting, or in the absence of an assembly it would then fall to Westminster to deal with this,"" the commission's Les Allamby said. ""If there was a refusal to deal with that, then that would become a very significant issue."" This video can not be played Labour's Chakrabarti says 'feminist' May must act on Northern Ireland abortion Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, has called on the government to support legislation to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland. She called it an ""injustice"" that women in Northern Ireland are ""having to travel to mainland UK"" to access an abortion. ""Labour's manifesto commits to working with the Northern Ireland Assembly to bring about these changes and we want to see the Assembly reconvened to make such important decisions, but nearly eighteen months on, women in Northern Ireland should not have to suffer in its absence,"" Ms Butler said. Labour's Dawn Butler said the party is looking at legislative options to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland The shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, Tony Lloyd, said the Labour Party wanted to ensure that women in Northern Ireland had access ""to safe and legal abortion"". He said the preferred route to do that was through the assembly in Northern Ireland. Shadow attorney general, Labour's Shami Chakrabarti, called on Mrs May ""a self-identifying feminist, to negotiate with the parties of Northern Ireland and legislate on this without delay. We can't have democracy without fundamental human rights"". Dr Sarah Wollaston, chair of Westminster's health committee, said women in Northern Ireland should have the same rights as other UK residents. This video can not be played After Ireland's abortion referendum, BBC News NI gauges opinion north of the border Prime Minister Theresa May is facing pressure to act afterIreland voted to end its abortion ban in Friday's referendum. But a Downing Street says the issue remains devolved in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, after a power-sharing deal between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. Mrs May tweeted on Sunday: ""The Irish Referendum yesterday was an impressive show of democracy which delivered a clear and unambiguous result. I congratulate the Irish people on their decision and all of #Together4Yes on their successful campaign."" - PM @theresa_may #repealedthe8th"" By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter At Saturday's results announcement in Dublin Castle, Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill held up a sign saying: ""The north is next"". But the other main party in Northern Ireland, the DUP, will be fiercely opposing moves from Westminster or elsewhere to bring about change. The party has deep religious roots and has always said that any relaxation in NI's laws could bring about abortion on demand. It has many supporters who feel the same. Nonetheless, the issue is out of Stormont's hands due to the continuing stalemate - and pro-choice campaigners will be focusing their fight at Westminster, which presents a major headache for the prime minister. Theresa May will have to walk yet another political tightrope. She won't want to upset theDUP and risk her parliamentary majority- especially at such a crucial time in the Brexit negotiations - but the growing pressure from within her own party and across Parliament on this issue means she will have to do something. This video can not be played How the referendum unfolded Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics programme, Dr Wollaston said she and other MPs in favour of abortion reform would put forward an amendment on the issue to Westminster's Domestic Violence Bill. However, she said she was not sure if the amendment would be accepted for debate as abortion would normally be a devolved issue for Stormont to decide on. The Women and Equalities minister Penny Mordaunt, and her predecessors Amber Rudd, Justine Greening, Nicky Morgan and Maria Miller, have also called for reform of Northern Ireland's abortion laws. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has said Mrs May should take advantage of the current lack of a devolved administration and push for reform from Westminster. ""The position in Northern Ireland is now highly anomalous and I think, probably, action will now have to be taken,"" he said. Emotions ran high during the referendum campaign in Ireland Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she did not want Westminster to legislate for abortions in Northern Ireland, but she argued that Irish law should apply to women from Northern Ireland. ""I couldn't envisage a situation where women from the north would be precluded from accessing services here in the south,"" she said. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which an abortion can be performed legally. A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth. However, anti-abortion campaigners argue that doctors cannot accurately predict death, saying that terminally-ill babies ""can and do defy the odds"". There is no restriction on travelling outside Northern Ireland to seek a legal termination in another jurisdiction. Last year, the Westminster government introduced measures to help women from Northern Ireland access free NHS abortions in England. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Anti-abortion group Precious Life said the result of the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum marked the ""most tragic day in Irish history"". Bernadette Smyth said the result would only ""spur on"" anti-abortion activists to step up their battle to protect the unborn north of the Irish border, ""Northern Ireland is now the beacon of hope to the pro-life movement around the world,"" she said. But Fr Joe McDonald, from St Matthew's Ballyfermot in Dublin, says the referendum result has been ""a huge wakeup call"" for the Catholic Church in Ireland. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, the priest, who is originally from west Belfast, said: ""It's a huge change for us. The church has, in my view, got a huge wakeup call but it's been having those for a while. ""The church is dying in front of us and it's whether we can respond to that in a healthy way. ""If we cannot listen to the roar of the Irish people, in particular women, and we're not good on that, then we're embracing the death and in the sense we deserve that.""

Outside heart op baby moves hospitals,"Vanellope's heart was covered with her own skin after three operations A baby born with her heart outside her body has been moved to a hospital closer to her home. Vanellope Hope Wilkins was born in November and has hadthree operations to place her heart back in her chestat Glenfield Hospital, in Leicester. The six-month-old was transferred to the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC), near to where the family live in Nottingham. Mother Naomi Findlay said she had ""longed"" to have her daughter in a hospital that was closer. ""[Vanellope] is coming on in leaps and bounds... she's very feisty, she's also very vocal, if she's not happy she lets everybody know about it,"" she said. The family said the constant travel from Nottingham to Leicester had been hard, especially as they have other children. This video can not be played Against the odds: The story of baby Vanellope ""It was tough,"" said dad Dean Wilkins. ""You've got to look at all different things, if you're working, not working, if you've got the money or not."" Vanellope had the extremely rare condition, ectopia cordis, of which there are only a few cases per million births - most are stillborn. Glenfield Hospital said it did not know of any other case in the UK where the baby survived following an operation to place the heart back inside the body. Vanellope with mum Naomi Findlay at the QMC Dr Meissa Osman, paediatric registrar, at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said the transfer to the QMC was ""uneventful"". ""She slept all the way through so we're happy..."" she said. ""We're very proud to be involved in her care."" Vanellope was delivered by Caesarean section on 22 November in order to reduce the chances of infection and damage to the heart. There were about 50 medical staff present including obstetricians, heart surgeons, anaesthetists, neonatologists and midwives. She will need another operation to create a breastbone at some point in the future. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

Fewer offenders must be locked up - minister,"There needs to be a ""massive reduction"" in the number of people sent to prison for 12 months or less, ministers say. Prisons minister Rory Stewart said short sentences made offenders more likely to commit crime. He also suggested prisoners released on licence could be used to fill labour shortages in low-skilled jobs caused ""partly"" by Brexit. The government is keen to reduce the UK's prison population, which has doubled over the past 25 years. Meanwhile, Justice Secretary David Gauke told The Times: ""Twenty-five years ago the population was 44,000. Today it's 84,000. I would like it to fall."" Why are community sentences falling out of favour? New body to get ex-prisoners into work Mr Stewart said the increase had been driven by longer sentences for violent offenders and ""many, many more sex offenders"". ""Nearly a quarter of our prisoners now are sex offenders, many of them older men in for historic sex offences,"" he told the Sunday Politics programme. There were also a lot of prisoners ""cycling"" in and out of the system on sentences of a few weeks or even less, in the case of those recalled to jail on licence days, he added. ""The statistics demonstrate that sending someone to prison for a very short period makes them more likely to re-offend compared to community sentences. ""So it's not good for them and it's not good for public safety."" Exceptions to any new sentencing guidelines would ""probably"" have to be made for violent offenders, he said, and it was important to retain an element of ""punishment"" in sentences. Community sentences have fallen out of favour with judges and magistrates in recent years over concerns about their effectiveness, amid budget cuts and the part-privatisation of the system. Greggs is among the companies offering offenders another chance But Mr Stewart said reoffending rates were ""far too high from short sentences"" and they were also disrupting the prison system. He also backed comments by his boss, David Gauke, who suggested prisoners could be let out for the day to work in sectors like catering, construction and agriculture, which were expected to be hit by Britain's departure from the EU. ""Partly because of Brexit, there is a labour shortage,"" said Mr Stewart. ""Which means that prisoners with the right kind of training, the right kind of attitudes, as Pret a Manger are finding, or Greggs the bakers are finding, or Timpson's the shoe company are finding, can provide very loyal, good employees."" The government has made a series of U-turns on allowing prisoners out to do work under licence, amid concerns some were absconding to commit further crime. Mr Stewart admitted the government had gone ""back and forth"" on the issue but, he said, prisoners who had a job to go to were less likely to re-offend, and ""only one in 10,000 people released on temporary license go on to commit a serious crime"". Are middle class drug users fuelling violent crime? In a separate development, Mr Gauke claimed middle class drug users should feel ""guilt and responsibility"" for fuelling the rise in fatal stabbings in the UK. ""People who do that have to recognise they are fuelling the industry that's resulting in the knife crimes, resulting in the difficulties we're having in prisons,"" Mr Gauke told Sky's Ridge on Sunday. UK becoming 'cocaine capital' of Europe 'McMafia gangs' fuel London violence - MP ""There's a responsibility for middle class people that take cocaine at a dinner party, that when they see a story of a 15-year-old boy stabbed in Hackney (east London) they should feel a degree of guilt and responsibility."" Police Federation deputy treasurer Simon Kempton has also blamed the wealthy for creating the demand for cocaine, while security minister Ben Wallace warned the UK was ""fast becoming the biggest consumer"" of the drug in Europe.

England could have new national parks,"Dartmoor, in Devon, is one of England's 10 existing national parks England could get more national parks after Environment Secretary Michael Gove announced he is launching a review into the country's natural landscapes. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Gove said ""the time is right"" for a review, nearly 70 years on from the creation of the first national areas. It will consider whether to expand England's network of parks as well as areas of outstanding natural beauty. England has10 existing national parks,externalincluding Dartmoor and the New Forest. It also has 34 AONBs - including the Chilterns, the Cotswolds and the Isle of Wight. According to Mr Gove, the UK's population growth, combined with changes in technology and a decline in some habitats, meant it was time to ""look afresh at these landscapes"". Where are England's national parks? Mr Gove will look at evidence from industry experts He stressed that the goal of the review was not to diminish the protection of natural areas, but to ""strengthen it in the face of present-day challenges"". Former government aide and journalist Julian Glover has been appointed to carry it out. Mr Gove said: ""The creation of national parks almost 70 years ago changed the way we view our precious landscapes - helping us all access and enjoy our natural world. ""We want to make sure they are not only conserved, but enhanced for the next generation. ""Are we properly supporting all those who live in, work in, or want to visit these magnificent places? Should we indeed be extending our areas of designated land?"" He added: ""I want Julian explicitly to consider how we can extend and improve the protection we give to other precious landscapes."" Tony Juniper, the campaigns director for the WWF, welcomed the review, but warned that ""we need to do more"". ""Nature will continue to be at risk unless we have a plan for its recovery enshrined in law - through a new Environment Act that's backed by a strong watchdog with real power to enforce,"" he said. England has 10 national parks - the Broads, Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Lake District, the New Forest, Northumberland, the North York Moors, the Peak District, the South Downs and the Yorkshire Dales. The first national parks to be created were the Peak District, Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor in 1951. There are two in Scotland - Cairngorms; and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs - and three in Wales: the Brecon Beacons, Pembrokeshire Coast, and Snowdonia. Mr Gove said that unlike other nations' national parks, ""ours are working countryside"" and lived in by farmers. Mr Glover, who Mr Gove called a ""passionate advocate for the countryside"", said: ""Our protected landscapes are England's finest gems and we owe a huge debt to past generations who had the wisdom to preserve them. ""The system they created has been a strength, but it faces challenges too. ""It is an honour to be asked to find ways to secure them for the future. I can't wait to get started and learn from everyone who shares an interest in making England's landscapes beautiful, diverse and successful."" Margaret Paren, chairwoman ofNational Parks England,externalsaid the announcement was ""very much welcome"" and the organisation intended to ""to play a full part"". She added: ""And as we approach the 70th anniversary of the founding legislation we look forward to a future where their beauty is enhanced; they are loved and accessible for everyone; and they continue to support thriving communities in these working landscapes."" National parks are areas specifically protected because of their countryside, wildlife and cultural heritage and are funded by central government.

Mr Gove will look at evidence from industry experts He stressed that the goal of the review was not to diminish the protection of natural areas, but to ""strengthen it in the face of present-day challenges"". Former government aide and journalist Julian Glover has been appointed to carry it out. Mr Gove said: ""The creation of national parks almost 70 years ago changed the way we view our precious landscapes - helping us all access and enjoy our natural world. ""We want to make sure they are not only conserved, but enhanced for the next generation. ""Are we properly supporting all those who live in, work in, or want to visit these magnificent places? Should we indeed be extending our areas of designated land?"" He added: ""I want Julian explicitly to consider how we can extend and improve the protection we give to other precious landscapes."" Tony Juniper, the campaigns director for the WWF, welcomed the review, but warned that ""we need to do more"". ""Nature will continue to be at risk unless we have a plan for its recovery enshrined in law - through a new Environment Act that's backed by a strong watchdog with real power to enforce,"" he said. England has 10 national parks - the Broads, Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Lake District, the New Forest, Northumberland, the North York Moors, the Peak District, the South Downs and the Yorkshire Dales. The first national parks to be created were the Peak District, Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor in 1951. There are two in Scotland - Cairngorms; and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs - and three in Wales: the Brecon Beacons, Pembrokeshire Coast, and Snowdonia. Mr Gove said that unlike other nations' national parks, ""ours are working countryside"" and lived in by farmers. Mr Glover, who Mr Gove called a ""passionate advocate for the countryside"", said: ""Our protected landscapes are England's finest gems and we owe a huge debt to past generations who had the wisdom to preserve them. ""The system they created has been a strength, but it faces challenges too. ""It is an honour to be asked to find ways to secure them for the future. I can't wait to get started and learn from everyone who shares an interest in making England's landscapes beautiful, diverse and successful."" Margaret Paren, chairwoman ofNational Parks England,externalsaid the announcement was ""very much welcome"" and the organisation intended to ""to play a full part"". She added: ""And as we approach the 70th anniversary of the founding legislation we look forward to a future where their beauty is enhanced; they are loved and accessible for everyone; and they continue to support thriving communities in these working landscapes."" National parks are areas specifically protected because of their countryside, wildlife and cultural heritage and are funded by central government.

Biggest Weekend: Rita Ora's Avicii tributeRita Ora pays an emotional tribute to Avicii as she performs their collaborative single Lonely Together.,"This video can not be played Rita Ora made Avicii's song the centrepiece of her set Rita Ora paid an emotional tribute to dance producer Avicii as she opened up the third day of the BBC's Biggest Weekend festival in Swansea. Avicii's name flashed up on the video screens as Ora sang their collaboration Lonely Together - the final single the DJ released before his death in April. ""Thank you for singing that with me,"" she told the crowd as the song ended. ""It's always hard for me to sing that, so thank you so much for singing along."" Ora has previously said described Avicii as ""a really good friend"" who ""changed my life"". The Swedish musician, born Tim Bergling, died last month at the age of 28. Astatement released by his familyseemed to suggest the cause of death was suicide. Best known for the international hits Wake Me Up and Levels, he had recently retired from touring, saying the lifestyle was taking a toll on his health. After he was found dead in Oman, DJ Pete Tong suggested it was ""time to establish a support group"" for musicians who found themselves overwhelmed. Ora is not alone in paying tribute to Avicii. Calvin Harris said he was ""devastated"" and called the star ""a beautiful soul"" while Imagine Dragons said ""the world was a happier and fuller place with his presence"". Avicii's family announced last week that his funeral would be held privately ""in the presence of the people who were closest to Tim"".

"Kim Jong-un 'set on Trump summit'The on-off June summit may be on again, after positive comments from the North Korean and US leaders.4h4 hours agoAsia","This video can not be played Korean leaders' surprise ""Hollywood"" meeting It is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's ""fixed will"" that a summit with US President Donald Trump in Singapore should go ahead, state media say. This followed a surprise meeting on Saturday between Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Mr Trump had cancelled the 12 June summit citing North Korea's ""hostility"" - but on Saturday he said things were ""moving along very nicely"". Meanwhile US officials are reported to have travelled to the North on Sunday. The American team, led by Sung Kim, a former ambassador to South Korea, was due to hold talks with North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui on preparations for the summit, US and South Korean media say. Rush to buy Trump-Kim coin after summit cancellation Analysis: Decoding Trump's letter to Kim 'My country was trying to test Trump' The meeting would be the culmination of diplomatic efforts that began this year to try to defuse what had threatened to become a military confrontation between the nuclear-armed communist North and the South and its US ally. The North's KCNA agency released a detailed statement on the meeting and the South Korean president also delivered remarks. It was the leaders' second meeting in as many months. Mr Moon said he and Mr Kim had ""agreed that the 12 June summit should be held successfully"" and that the North Korean leader had ""again made clear his commitment to a complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". But Mr Moon suggested Mr Kim was not certain whether Washington could guarantee the stability of his regime. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. ""What Kim is unclear about is that he has concerns about whether his country can surely trust the United States over its promise to end hostile relations,"" Mr Moon said. The KCNA statement said the two leaders had had a ""candid dialogue"" and that Mr Kim had ""expressed his fixed will on the historic... summit talks"". He had called for co-operation to ""establish a mechanism for permanent and durable peace"" and the opening of a ""new era of reconciliation and unity"". It added that ""top leaders"" from the two nations would hold more talks on Friday. At the White House late on Saturday he said: ""It's moving along very nicely. We're looking at June 12 in Singapore. That hasn't changed."" He also took to Twitter to angrily dismiss media speculation that the summit, even if reinstated, could not now be held in Singapore in the existing time frame: This video can not be played Mr Trump said the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would be ""great for the world"" The White House confirmed that an advance team of officials would leave for Singapore this weekend, as originally scheduled, to prepare for the possible summit.

Mr Trump had declared the summit cancelled on Thursday, blaming North Korea's ""tremendous anger and open hostility"", but then tweeted on Friday that ""very productive talks"" had taken place with the North. Analysis by the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Seoul The pictures from the second summit between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in show how dramatically the atmosphere has changed here on the peninsula. Their first summit in April took months to arrange. On Saturday, they met just 24 hours after a phone call from Pyongyang. It is significant that this second meeting was requested by Mr Kim. It is clear he really wants to salvage the Singapore summit. The question that remains is why? President Trump's supporters think Mr Kim is now desperate to find a way out of crushing economic sanctions. But the rhetoric from Pyongyang suggests Kim Jong-un believes his nuclear arsenal puts him in a much stronger position than his father or grandfather and, because of that, he is very close to grasping the long-dreamed-of prize, a face-to-face summit with a US president. As Mr Moon alluded to, there is still a lot of ground to be covered and Mr Trump has clearly shown that if does not think a deal can be done, he will not go. Mr Moon said after Saturday's meeting that although the US and North Korea ""share the same resolve, there need to be discussions regarding the roadmap for how to make it happen, and that process could be tough"" This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Mr Moon himself has declined to define what ""complete denuclearisation"" means and it is unclear whether Mr Kim will agree to fully abandon his nuclear arsenal. Similar pledges in the past have not been upheld. Analysts say the US had wanted denuclearisation first - followed by rewards in the form of lifted sanctions and economic aid. Mr Kim has indicated he wants a phased approach, with his steps met by reciprocal ones from the US and the South - mainly on sanctions but also easing of the US military presence in South Korea. Mr Trump has not ruled out such an incremental approach. North Korea has been subjected to numerous rounds of international sanctions since 2006, which has cut off most of its exports and capped its imports of oil. The North also wants assurances that its survival as a state would never be in question. Getting this far has been a surprise given that North Korea had maintained its strident rhetoric - and continued its nuclear and missile tests - through 2016 and 2017. This brought a bitter war of words between Mr Trump and the North Korean leadership. But a rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea. Koreans played under a unified flag at the Winter Olympics The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, held in the South. Mr Kim announced he was suspending nuclear tests and held his landmark summit with Mr Moon last month, where the pair agreed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. This weekNorth Korea said it had dismantled its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, although scientists believe it partially collapsed after the last test in September 2017, rendering it unusable.

Pakistan thrash England in first Test,"This video can not be played Highlights: Pakistan thrash sorry England First Test, Lord's (day four) England 184(Cook 70, Abbas 4-23, Hasan 4-51)& 242(Root 68, Buttler 67, Amir 4-36, Abbas 4-41) Pakistan 363(Babar 68 ret hurt)&66-1 Pakistan won by nine wickets Scorecard England succumbed to a miserable nine-wicket defeat by brilliant Pakistan on the fourth day of the first Test at Lord's. Optimism provided by Jos Buttler and Dom Bess on the third evening was dashed by the eighth delivery of the day, when Buttler was trapped lbw by Mohammad Abbas for 67. That began a collapse of four wickets for six runs, leaving England 242 all out and Pakistan chasing only 64 to win. Although James Anderson bowled Azhar Ali in the third over, Haris Sohail and Imam-ul-Haq shared an unbroken stand of 54 that sealed victory 90 minutes into the day. Root tells England fans to 'keep the faith' Pakistan win their best at Lord's - Waqar 'When England lose, they get hammered' - listen to the TMS podcast Following a winter when they did not win in seven Tests in Australia and New Zealand, this is an awful result for England, who spoke before this match of returning to winning ways and developing skills that will make them more competitive in foreign conditions. Instead, have lost the first Test of a home summer for the first time in 23 years. For Pakistan, this is a wonderful result, their thorough preparation leading to a superiority over the hosts in all aspects of the game. They will have the opportunity to seal their first series win in England since 1996 when the second and final Test begins at Headingley on Friday. This video can not be played Haris Sohail hits winning runs as Pakistan secure nine-wicket victory England had hoped to move on from a wretched winter with a slightly new look. Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow were promoted in the batting order, Buttler was recalled and off-spinner Bess handed a debut in place of the injured Jack Leach. However, for the all of the optimism, acceptance of past failings and talk of improvement, England were behind in this game on the first day, when they were bowled out for 184 after opting to bat in helpful bowling conditions. This video can not be played England have got to be smarter - Root It says much about how poor England were that the inclusions of Buttler and Bess can be seen as a partial success because they at least prevented a defeat by an innings inside three days. On both occasions when they batted, England gifted wickets or lacked the defensive capability to deal with a potent Pakistan attack. The home bowling was adequate but lacking the penetration of the visitors, while most unforgivable was the dropping of five catches in Pakistan's first innings. The outcome was an eighth successive match without a win and the need for a vast improvement in the short time before the second Test. In slipping to 110-6 on the third afternoon, still 179 behind, England were heading for humiliation before Buttler and Bess came together. Their century stand took the hosts to 235-6 and they resumed on Sunday with a lead of 59, a remarkable comeback still possible if the lower order could add perhaps another 100 runs. Instead, Buttler was pinned in front by Abbas and, with a review unable to save him, England's hopes disappeared. This video can not be played Buttler out lbw as England collapse Pakistan took the second new ball in the next over and the tail was mopped up by Abbas and Mohammad Amir. Amir angled one across Mark Wood to find the edge and Stuart Broad poked at Abbas. Both were taken by wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed. When Bess, so impressive in making 57, lost his off stump to Amir, England had lost their last four wickets in the space of 18 balls. Visiting teams, especially those from the subcontinent, are often blown away in the early part of the English summer. Only three times before had England lost a home Test that has begun in May. At Lord's, Pakistan won by playing English conditions better than England. They showed restraint with the bat and moved the ball to more dangerous effect. Their fielding was far superior. They reaped the benefits of an elongated period of preparation. Their tour began in April and has taken in three games against counties as well as a Test in Ireland. Collectively, their XI has played more first-class cricket this summer than England's. Bar Saturday evening, Pakistan had the better of every session in the match. On Sunday, their excellent pace attack returned refreshed and surged the visitors towards victory. The skillful Abbas was excellent throughout, the 4-41 he picked up in the second innings giving him 8-64 for the match. Although Azhar was dismissed for only four, Haris made 39 not out, including a six off Bess and a leap for joy when he hit the winning runs. Pakistan became the first team since West Indies in 1995 to win the first Test of the summer in England Former England spinner Phil Tufnell on BBC Test Match Special:""England were absolutely walloped - out-batted, out-bowled, out fielded, out warmed-up. ""That should really really hurt for England. It has been a very, very, very, poor performance all round. "" I don't think I've seen England play that badly for a long time. We might not be quite as good as we think we are..."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""This England Test team is not a very good team, and they should be. They are playing 50-60% under their potential. ""That has been happening for too long. Last year they lost to the worst West Indies team to ever tour this country. ""It's not a surprise that they have lost to Pakistan - they've been losing for a while. But they are not just losing games - they are getting hammered."" Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed:""When we came here, we were very inexperienced but we are confident. We have a very good bowling side. They did a great job for us. ""The Malahide game was a very tough game for us. Ireland played really well. That is good practice before a Lord's Test match."" Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur on Sky Sports:""When you see a tour of England come up on your calendar, you're so excited. ""The Ireland Test match was great for us because we were put under pressure at times. All in all we've been going for six weeks, preparing for Lord's."" This is only the second time England have lost a home Test that began and ended in May, after defeat by Australia at Trent Bridge in 1921 Joe Root won five of his first seven Tests as captain, but has not won any of the next eight Under coach Trevor Bayliss, England have won 15 and lost 20 of their 44 Tests, compared to 38 wins in 57 one-day internationals Mohammad Abbas' match figures of 8-64 are the best by Pakistan seamer at Lord's Pakistan have won five and lost four Tests against England at Lord's; the only other team with more wins than losses against England at Lord's is Australia (W15, L7) Mickey Arthur is only the third coach to win two Tests against England at Lord's, after Bobby Simpson and John Buchanan Root tells England fans to 'keep the faith' Victory is Pakistan's best at Lord's - Waqar England spot-fixing claims outrageous - Root Pakistan thump England - watch the key moments Pakistan in England: Fixtures & results England and Wales Cricket Board Pakistan Cricket Board Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Bergvall is headline act as young Spurs show incredible maturity' West Ham to appoint Potter after sacking Lopetegui Tottenham's Bentancur taken off on stretcher after injury against Liverpool Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the factory he used to work in to find out how they bake 1.4 million loaves a week Dara Ã  Briain and Isy Suttie discover strange-but-true tales The pair are joined by astronaut Helen Sharman to learn about how humans learned to survive in space A round-up of 2024's top sports stories.

Abortion law by end of year - Irish PM,"It was a highly-emotive campaign and the result was overwhelming A new abortion law will be in place by the end of the year, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said. It follows alandslide vote in favour of repealing the Republic of Ireland's constitutional ban on abortion. The proposed legislation will allow abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and up to the 24th week in exceptional circumstances. Irish Minister for Health Simon Harris will seek the cabinet's backing on Tuesday to draft the new legislation. Seismic shift for Ireland Timeline: Ireland and abortion The result south of the border has shifted focus to Northern Ireland's similarly strict abortion laws, with UK Prime Minister Theresa May facing calls to act. Northern Ireland will soon become the only part of the UK and Ireland with an almost blanket ban on terminations. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald make their opinions known But Mrs May is in a difficult situation because her administration depends on thesupport of 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs- who strongly oppose any reform. On Saturday, Penny Mordaunt - who is responsible for the women and equalities brief in government - said the referendum signalled a ""historic and great day for Ireland"" and a ""hopeful one for Northern Ireland"". Nicky Morgan and three other former holders of the women and equalities role - Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and Maria Miller - all back Ms Mordaunt's support for liberalising the laws in Northern Ireland, the Sunday Times reported. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has said Mrs May should take advantage of the current lack of a devolved administration and push for reform from Westminster. ""The position in Northern Ireland is now highly anomalous and I think, probably, action will now have to be taken,"" he said. At Dublin Castle on Saturday, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald and her deputy Michelle O'Neill held up a sign saying ""The north is next"". On Sunday, Ms O'Neill said the referendum result showed there was a ""real appetite for change on the island of Ireland"". She also said the breakdown of government in Northern Ireland meant that alternative routes were needed to bring about reform. ""I would prefer we had the institutions up, I want to be a legislator to deliver for the people but in the absence of having institutions we need to find a way to deliver people's rights,"" she added. She said the Irish abortion referendum result shows there is a ""real appetite for change on the island of Ireland"". More than two thirds of voters backed the decision to change the law in every constituency in the Republic of Ireland,with the exception of Donegal. The referendum delivered a conclusive consensus for reform among men and women, nearly all age groups and across most counties. The final figures were 66.4% in favour of the change and 33.6% voting no. Mr Varadkar said Saturday would be remembered as the day Ireland ""embraced our responsibilities as citizens and as a country"". ""The day Ireland stepped out from under the last of our shadows and into the light,"" he added. ""The day we came of age as a country. The day we took our place among the nations of the world."" The Eighth Amendment was inserted into the Irish constitution in 1983 and it gave an equal right to life to the unborn and the mother. Thousands of Irish women travelled to the UK every year for abortions, or sourced abortion pills.

MP calls for abortion referendum in NI,"Attention has turned to Northern Ireland after the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favour of overturning the country's abortion ban The result of Ireland's abortion referendum has no impact on the law in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader has said. Arlene Foster said the legislation governing abortion is a devolved issue and the Northern Ireland Assembly should debate such issues. The government agreed with Mrs Foster. Labour and a number of senior Conservative MPs have called on Theresa May to back a reform in NI's abortion law after Friday's historic referendum. A government spokesperson said abortion law is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland. ""This very sensitive issue highlights the pressing need to restore a fully functioning executive,"" the spokesperson added. Northern Ireland's abortion law is more restrictive than the rest of the UK. NI women 'in limbo' over abortion law What next for abortion in NI? Moment Ireland's referendum result is announced 'Her soul will rest in peace now' Mrs Foster, whose party is propping up Theresa May's minority government, said a referendum was held in the Republic of Ireland because of the constitutional prohibition that existed there. She said no such constitutional bar exists in Northern Ireland. ""Friday's referendum has no impact upon the law in Northern Ireland, but we obviously take note of issues impacting upon our nearest neighbour,"" Mrs Foster said in a statement. ""The legislation governing abortion is a devolved matter and it is for the Northern Ireland Assembly to debate and decide such issues."" DUP leader Arlene Foster says the referendum in the Republic of Ireland has no impact on the law in Northern Ireland Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for almost 18 months, and several rounds of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have ended in failure. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissionhas brought a case before the Supreme Court arguing that current abortion legislation is contrary to human rights, especially with regard to victims of sex crime and fatal foetal abnormality. If the challenge proves successful, the court's ruling would go back to politicians. ""Then it would fall to the Northern Ireland Executive and the assembly, if it was sitting, or in the absence of an assembly it would then fall to Westminster to deal with this,"" the commission's Les Allamby said. ""If there was a refusal to deal with that, then that would become a very significant issue."" This video can not be played Labour's Chakrabarti says 'feminist' May must act on Northern Ireland abortion Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, has called on the government to support legislation to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland. She called it an ""injustice"" that women in Northern Ireland are ""having to travel to mainland UK"" to access an abortion. ""Labour's manifesto commits to working with the Northern Ireland Assembly to bring about these changes and we want to see the Assembly reconvened to make such important decisions, but nearly eighteen months on, women in Northern Ireland should not have to suffer in its absence,"" Ms Butler said. Labour's Dawn Butler said the party is looking at legislative options to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland The shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, Tony Lloyd, said the Labour Party wanted to ensure that women in Northern Ireland had access ""to safe and legal abortion"". He said the preferred route to do that was through the assembly in Northern Ireland. Shadow attorney general, Labour's Shami Chakrabarti, called on Mrs May ""a self-identifying feminist, to negotiate with the parties of Northern Ireland and legislate on this without delay. We can't have democracy without fundamental human rights"". Dr Sarah Wollaston, chair of Westminster's health committee, said women in Northern Ireland should have the same rights as other UK residents. This video can not be played After Ireland's abortion referendum, BBC News NI gauges opinion north of the border Prime Minister Theresa May is facing pressure to act afterIreland voted to end its abortion ban in Friday's referendum. But a Downing Street says the issue remains devolved in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, after a power-sharing deal between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. Mrs May tweeted on Sunday: ""The Irish Referendum yesterday was an impressive show of democracy which delivered a clear and unambiguous result. I congratulate the Irish people on their decision and all of #Together4Yes on their successful campaign."" - PM @theresa_may #repealedthe8th"" By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter At Saturday's results announcement in Dublin Castle, Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill held up a sign saying: ""The north is next"". But the other main party in Northern Ireland, the DUP, will be fiercely opposing moves from Westminster or elsewhere to bring about change. The party has deep religious roots and has always said that any relaxation in NI's laws could bring about abortion on demand. It has many supporters who feel the same. Nonetheless, the issue is out of Stormont's hands due to the continuing stalemate - and pro-choice campaigners will be focusing their fight at Westminster, which presents a major headache for the prime minister. Theresa May will have to walk yet another political tightrope. She won't want to upset theDUP and risk her parliamentary majority- especially at such a crucial time in the Brexit negotiations - but the growing pressure from within her own party and across Parliament on this issue means she will have to do something. This video can not be played How the referendum unfolded Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics programme, Dr Wollaston said she and other MPs in favour of abortion reform would put forward an amendment on the issue to Westminster's Domestic Violence Bill. However, she said she was not sure if the amendment would be accepted for debate as abortion would normally be a devolved issue for Stormont to decide on. The Women and Equalities minister Penny Mordaunt, and her predecessors Amber Rudd, Justine Greening, Nicky Morgan and Maria Miller, have also called for reform of Northern Ireland's abortion laws. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has said Mrs May should take advantage of the current lack of a devolved administration and push for reform from Westminster. ""The position in Northern Ireland is now highly anomalous and I think, probably, action will now have to be taken,"" he said. Emotions ran high during the referendum campaign in Ireland Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she did not want Westminster to legislate for abortions in Northern Ireland, but she argued that Irish law should apply to women from Northern Ireland. ""I couldn't envisage a situation where women from the north would be precluded from accessing services here in the south,"" she said. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which an abortion can be performed legally. A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth. However, anti-abortion campaigners argue that doctors cannot accurately predict death, saying that terminally-ill babies ""can and do defy the odds"". There is no restriction on travelling outside Northern Ireland to seek a legal termination in another jurisdiction. Last year, the Westminster government introduced measures to help women from Northern Ireland access free NHS abortions in England. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Anti-abortion group Precious Life said the result of the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum marked the ""most tragic day in Irish history"". Bernadette Smyth said the result would only ""spur on"" anti-abortion activists to step up their battle to protect the unborn north of the Irish border, ""Northern Ireland is now the beacon of hope to the pro-life movement around the world,"" she said. But Fr Joe McDonald, from St Matthew's Ballyfermot in Dublin, says the referendum result has been ""a huge wakeup call"" for the Catholic Church in Ireland. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, the priest, who is originally from west Belfast, said: ""It's a huge change for us. The church has, in my view, got a huge wakeup call but it's been having those for a while. ""The church is dying in front of us and it's whether we can respond to that in a healthy way. ""If we cannot listen to the roar of the Irish people, in particular women, and we're not good on that, then we're embracing the death and in the sense we deserve that.""

N Korea's nuclear programme,"The Hwasong-18 missile uses solid fuel North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un plans to meet President Putin this month about potentially providing Moscow with weapons for its war in Ukraine, according to a US official. There are concerns that in return, North Korea may seek advanced weapons technology from Russia. North Korea has continued regular tests of its missiles this year, after a significant increase in tests carried out in 2022. North Korea has tested a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles in recent years. It's also tested hypersonic missiles, which can fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude to escape radar detection, as well as others launched from submarines. In April, North Korea tested what it called ""its most powerful"" missile to date - the Hwasong-18. It's a solid-fuel missile, which are generally quicker to launch than liquid-fuel ones. It reportedly flew about 1,000km on its maiden flight, but its true range is estimated to be in excess of 15,000km, according to the US-based CSIS Missile Defense Project. A second test launch in July 2023 saw a Hwasong-18 reach a claimed altitude of over 6,600km, with a flight time of 74 minutes. In November last year, an intercontinental ballistic missilewas tested at a high angle, short-range trajectory. Launched at a lower trajectory, this same missile could have reached the US mainland, according to the Japanese government. Images from North Korean state media of Kim Jong-un with his daughter at the launch appear to show it was the Hwasong-17 - or possibly a modified version of it. The missile is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more, and could potentially carry three or four warheads, rather than only one. Several earlier attempts to launch the Hwasong-17 are thought to have failed, althoughit may have been used in a test carried out in March 2022.,external In October last year, North Korea fired another type of missile which flew over Japan - thought to have been the intermediate-range Hwasong-12. This can travel up to 4,500km - putting the US island of Guam in the Pacific within range. North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile with a range of 8,000km - although some studies suggest it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York. And there is the Hwasong-15 missile, which is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights. North Korea tested a record number of missiles in 2022, including ones capable of reaching US territory. The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or ""yield"", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device- the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon. However, North Korea may be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. ""It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles"" he says. North Korea says it simulated nuclear strike on South Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea saidit would shut the site down, because it had ""verified"" its nuclear capabilities. Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use. In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trumpthat North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities. However, the UN's atomic energy agency, the IAEA, says satellite images suggest that North Korea has restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium. In September 2022, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said there were signs that a test site at Punggye-ri was open again.  And in March this year, Mr Grossi said that activity thereas well as at Yongbyon was ""deeply regrettable."",external The IAEA has not had physical access to North Korea's nuclear facilities since April 2009.

England could have new national parksEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove launches a review of the country's protected landscapes.10h10 hours agoUK Politics,"Dartmoor, in Devon, is one of England's 10 existing national parks England could get more national parks after Environment Secretary Michael Gove announced he is launching a review into the country's natural landscapes. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Gove said ""the time is right"" for a review, nearly 70 years on from the creation of the first national areas. It will consider whether to expand England's network of parks as well as areas of outstanding natural beauty. England has10 existing national parks,externalincluding Dartmoor and the New Forest. It also has 34 AONBs - including the Chilterns, the Cotswolds and the Isle of Wight. According to Mr Gove, the UK's population growth, combined with changes in technology and a decline in some habitats, meant it was time to ""look afresh at these landscapes"". Where are England's national parks? Mr Gove will look at evidence from industry experts He stressed that the goal of the review was not to diminish the protection of natural areas, but to ""strengthen it in the face of present-day challenges"". Former government aide and journalist Julian Glover has been appointed to carry it out. Mr Gove said: ""The creation of national parks almost 70 years ago changed the way we view our precious landscapes - helping us all access and enjoy our natural world. ""We want to make sure they are not only conserved, but enhanced for the next generation. ""Are we properly supporting all those who live in, work in, or want to visit these magnificent places? Should we indeed be extending our areas of designated land?"" He added: ""I want Julian explicitly to consider how we can extend and improve the protection we give to other precious landscapes."" Tony Juniper, the campaigns director for the WWF, welcomed the review, but warned that ""we need to do more"". ""Nature will continue to be at risk unless we have a plan for its recovery enshrined in law - through a new Environment Act that's backed by a strong watchdog with real power to enforce,"" he said. England has 10 national parks - the Broads, Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Lake District, the New Forest, Northumberland, the North York Moors, the Peak District, the South Downs and the Yorkshire Dales. The first national parks to be created were the Peak District, Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor in 1951. There are two in Scotland - Cairngorms; and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs - and three in Wales: the Brecon Beacons, Pembrokeshire Coast, and Snowdonia. Mr Gove said that unlike other nations' national parks, ""ours are working countryside"" and lived in by farmers. Mr Glover, who Mr Gove called a ""passionate advocate for the countryside"", said: ""Our protected landscapes are England's finest gems and we owe a huge debt to past generations who had the wisdom to preserve them. ""The system they created has been a strength, but it faces challenges too. ""It is an honour to be asked to find ways to secure them for the future. I can't wait to get started and learn from everyone who shares an interest in making England's landscapes beautiful, diverse and successful."" Margaret Paren, chairwoman ofNational Parks England,externalsaid the announcement was ""very much welcome"" and the organisation intended to ""to play a full part"". She added: ""And as we approach the 70th anniversary of the founding legislation we look forward to a future where their beauty is enhanced; they are loved and accessible for everyone; and they continue to support thriving communities in these working landscapes."" National parks are areas specifically protected because of their countryside, wildlife and cultural heritage and are funded by central government.

I don't wish to be PM - Rees-MoggBut the leading Tory Brexiteer urges Theresa May to take a tougher line in Brexit negotiations.16m16 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg: PM 'crucial' to delivering Brexit Leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has rejected press speculation he is planning to challenge Theresa May for the party leadership. ""I wouldn't challenge Theresa May. That's a ridiculous idea. The prime minister has my full support,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""I don't wish to be prime minister,"" he added, saying his ""only ambition"" was to make Brexit happen. He urged the PM to take a tougher line on Brexit, saying errors had been made. UK 'playing hide and seek' in EU talks Brexit customs plan 'could cost Â£20bn' Rees-Mogg: PM's customs plan cretinous Mr Rees-Mogg has been highly critical of the prime minister's preferred option for customs arrangements with the EU and has questioned whether her government is still on track to deliver Brexit. He said the UK had made ""a lot of compromises"" during Brexit negotiations with Brussels and ""nothing has come back"". But he added: ""I am reassured in the last week. I think the government is still committed. But there are concerns, inevitably, about the way the negotiations are proceeding."" He said the prime minister had made a ""mistake"" at the start of Brexit talks by unilaterally committing the UK to an open border with the Republic of Ireland, saying it was ""overwhelmingly"" in Ireland's interests to have one too. ""I think, if you are going into a negotiation, you should use your strongest cards and just to tear one of them up and set hares running on other issues is, I think, an error,"" he said. He said it was wrong to consider temporarily keeping the UK closely tied to the EU's customs rules as a ""backstop"", in an attempt to solve the Irish border issue, saying: ""If you offer a backstop that is more attractive than anything that you're likely to negotiate from the other side's point of view. ""The backstop ends up becoming the frontstop."" He also questioned claims this week by the head of HM Revenue and Customs, Jon Thompson, that his own preferred customs option would cost businesses up to Â£20bn, saying that sounded like a ""high figure"". Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs an influential group of Brexiteer Tory MPs. the European Research Group, said remaining in some form of customs union with the EU for years after Brexit - which some have suggested will be the outcome of the talks with Brussels - would not be delivering on Brexit. He did not believe Theresa May should walk away from Brexit negotiations, he added, but should instead threaten not to pay the Â£40bn ""divorce bill"" agreed with the EU in December. ""We should say quite clearly, if we don't get the trade deal we want, you don't get the money'. That's a very strong negotiating position,"" he told Andrew Marr. He denied trying to ""menace"" the prime minister by telling her what to do, saying he was ""very respectful"" of her position, adding that she was the ""most impressive and dutiful leader that this country has ever had"". There was ""no menace in me at all"", he added. Asked if he would back the PM even if she returned from Brussels with a deal he did not like, he said: ""I will back the prime minister on delivering on the promises she made in the Conservative manifesto and in her various speeches."" Mr Rees-Mogg is currently favourite at the bookmakers to be the next Conservative leader, but he rejected speculation in the media that he was plotting a challenge to Mrs May, saying his only ambition was to ensure ""Brexit means Brexit"" from the back benches. According to the Mail on Sunday,external, Mr Rees-Mogg's company, Somerset Capital Management, which manages nearly Â£7.5bn on behalf of private investors and City institutions, ""has interests in two Russian firms blacklisted by the US and others which are controlled by oligarchs in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle"". Mr Rees Mogg said he no longer ran Somerset Capital Management's investments but, he added, its clients had asked the company to invest their money in ""emerging markets"". ""We have a fiduciary duty to them to invest it as well as we can in businesses that we think will do well, subject to the law of the land,"" he told Andrew Marr. He added: ""We can not run our investments on my political opinions. I think we should be much tougher on Russia. I think we should impose a level of sanctions that America has imposed on Russia.""

"Astronaut and artist Alan Bean dies at 86The fourth man to walk on the Moon became an accomplished painter, finding inspiration in space.5h5 hours agoUS & Canada","Alan Bean's paintings reflected his lifelong fascination with space Former US astronaut Alan Bean, who was the fourth man to walk on the Moon, has died in Texas aged 86, his family has said. In later life he became an accomplished artist, producing paintings that were inspired by space. His family said he had fallen ill two weeks ago in Indiana,externaland died peacefully at a hospital in Houston. Astronaut Mike Massimino described Bean as ""the most extraordinary person I ever met"". ""He was a one-of-a-kind combination of technical achievement as an astronaut and artistic achievement as a painter,"" said Massimino, who flew on two space shuttle missions. Allow Twitter content?

Alan Bean, a former US Navy test pilot, was selected by Nasa as a trainee in 1963. He went into space twice, the first time in November 1969 as the lunar module pilot on the Apollo 12 Moon-landing mission. What it's like to walk on the Moon He later described how complex and risky the mission had been: ""It was more science fiction to us, I think, than it was to the average public. ""We knew how difficult it was. We knew how many things had to go right. This is like going half way across the Sahara Desert and stopping your car and getting out and camping out for a couple of days and then hoping when you start it up the battery works because if doesn't you're up creek."" Alan Bean commanded the lunar module for Apollo 12 In 1973 he was commander of the second crewed flight to Skylab - America's first space station. He retired from Nasa in 1981 and carved a successful career as an artist. His paintings, inspired by space travel, featured lunar boot prints as well as small pieces of his mission patches which were stained by Moon dust. ""While he captured these great scenes from history, and scenes that never could be captured by a camera, and only in painting, he would also basically sprinkle them with moon dust,"" space history specialist Robert Z Pearlman told the BBC. ""And so they are a tremendous legacy for not just him but the Apollo programme in general."" The three astronauts who preceded Alan Bean to the moon's surface were Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11 in July 1969, and Charles Conrad who was also on the Apollo 12 mission. Of the four men, only Aldrin is still alive, now aged 88. In all, 24 people have flown to the Moon and 12 have set foot on it,external.

RBS closures decision criticised by MPs,"RBS is closing at least 52 of its branches in Scotland RBS has failed to appreciate the impact of its decision to close dozens of branches in Scotland, a report by MPs has found. The Scottish Affairs Committee described the move as a ""devastating blow"" for communities affected. It urged the bank, which is majority-owned by the taxpayer, to halt plans to axe up to 62 branches. RBS said the closures were in response to the increasing numbers of customers using mobile and online banking. However, the plans have attracted fierce criticism from local communities, business groups and politicians. RBS boss defends bank closures RBS boss says branch closures necessary Protests held over RBS branch closures RBS to close more than a third of branches In December, RBS announcedit would shut a total of 62 branchesnorth of the border. Ten of them were later given a stay of executionuntil at least the end of this year, pending a review. The committee report said the closures would remove ""vital services relied upon by businesses and disproportionately affect vulnerable customers"". It stated: ""We are not convinced that RBS fully appreciate the damage these closures will do to the communities and businesses that rely on these branches."" In its report, the committee argued that impact assessments carried out by the bank did not provide enough information on the situation with individual branches. It said: ""For example, whether customers have access to a suitably reliable broadband connection to allow them to use online banking, the practicality of travelling to the next nearest branch or the effective availability of alternative services such as mobile branches and community bankers. ""Without this information we do not see how these documents can be said to have properly assessed the impact of the closures on customers, businesses and communities."" RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has said the way bank customers use its services was changing Committee chairman Pete Wishart said: ""The loss of a permanent bank, and the services it provides, cannot be replicated by the occasional visit of a mobile bank or community banker. ""In rural areas, the local branch is an essential, whose withdrawal is compounded by poor access to broadband and journey time to the next available facility. ""RBS did not consult adequately and even at this last stage should reverse their decision to close these branches."" RBS said it welcomed the publication of the report. In a statement, it said: ""We would like to reassure our customers and the committee that we do understand closing a branch can be difficult for some customers and colleagues who work in these branches. It's not an easy decision. ""We have listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives, and welcome the committee's recognition that we have engaged and responded."" The bank said it was responding to changes in the way its customers banked, with branch usage falling by 44% since 2011, while seven in 10 customers were now using mobile or online banking. It added: ""We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service."" The Scottish Affairs Committee also urged the UK government to use any influence as the majority shareholder to pressure RBS to reconsider its closure programme Mr Wishart added: ""The UK government has an obligation to represent the interests of the citizens and communities in Scotland that will be harmed by this swathe of bank closures. ""They own 70% of the shares in this company and should use any influence they have to try and have this decision reversed."" An HM Treasury spokesman said: ""The decision to open and close branches is a commercial decision taken by the management team of each bank. ""The government does not intervene in these decisions. ""But we understand the impact that closures can have on communities and people's jobs. ""Banks must now give customers as much notice as possible when a branch is closing, and ensure they are made aware of the options they have locally to continue to access banking services.""

"Baddiel reveals why he 'laughs at death'The comic and writer tells Desert Island Discs it's how he processes life ""getting darker"".8h8 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","David Baddiel Comic and writer David Baddiel has said he talks about ""sad and difficult"" topics including his father's dementia, as a way of ""processing"" life. He told BBC Radio 4'sDesert Island Discs: ""As you get older your life gets darker. You're faced with mortality."" Speaking about his ""truth urge"", he said: ""Let's find the funny in those things. I don't think it's a denial, it's a bulwark."" Baddiel went on to speak about his father suffering from Pick's disease. ""It's a form of dementia, and is a ridiculous and cartoonish version of what he was like,"" he said. ""It involves people being sweary and obscene and impatient and apathetic - and my dad was always like that."" David Baddiel on impact of dad's dementia Baddiel with his partner Morwenna Banks and children Dolly and Ezra The comic also said he didn't want to seem ""arrogant"" by saying how truthful he is, adding it was ""because of my own limitations as a performer"", saying he was the ""opposite"" to his partner Morwenna Banks ""in terms of versatility and range"". Baddiel also revealed his love of musicals, saying he was ""obsessed"" with Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell when he was younger. This was reflected in his musical choice on the show of one of the songs from The Book of Mormon. He also spoke about his mother having a ""very public affair"" with a golfing memorabilia salesman, and ""turning our house into a shrine for golf"". ""It's quite hard to forget about the affair when there's a statue of Lee Trevino in your eyeline,"" he added. ""She was a good mother in lots of ways, very devoted to us three brothers."" But he added that he thought he became a comedian because he suspected her favourite child was his brother, Dan. In her defence, he added: ""But there's something very beautiful about a person whose life is nearly taken away."" He said his mother was three months old when the war broke out in Nazi Germany, and that she ""just got out with her parents to London but the rest of her family was murdered"". One of Baddiel's choices was Three Lions - his song with Frank Skinner and The Lightning Seeds for the European Championships in 1996, which were held in England. He said the singing of it at Wembley was ""an extraordinary moment in my life"". ""As I'm speaking now the goose pimples are rising on my flesh,"" he added. ""I still can't believe it happened."" The song came at the height of his success alongside Frank Skinner and the duo also had a TV show - Fantasy Football League - which tied into the rise of ""laddism"". However, Baddiel says his past behaviour was never misogynistic despite him being a leading figure in the lad culture of the 1990s. He said: ""I'm comfortable if you actually go and look at the work, because truth is always in the detail.""

Kim 'set on' Trump summit,"This video can not be played Korean leaders' surprise ""Hollywood"" meeting It is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's ""fixed will"" that a summit with US President Donald Trump in Singapore should go ahead, state media say. This followed a surprise meeting on Saturday between Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Mr Trump had cancelled the 12 June summit citing North Korea's ""hostility"" - but on Saturday he said things were ""moving along very nicely"". Meanwhile US officials are reported to have travelled to the North on Sunday. The American team, led by Sung Kim, a former ambassador to South Korea, was due to hold talks with North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui on preparations for the summit, US and South Korean media say. Rush to buy Trump-Kim coin after summit cancellation Analysis: Decoding Trump's letter to Kim 'My country was trying to test Trump' The meeting would be the culmination of diplomatic efforts that began this year to try to defuse what had threatened to become a military confrontation between the nuclear-armed communist North and the South and its US ally. The North's KCNA agency released a detailed statement on the meeting and the South Korean president also delivered remarks. It was the leaders' second meeting in as many months. Mr Moon said he and Mr Kim had ""agreed that the 12 June summit should be held successfully"" and that the North Korean leader had ""again made clear his commitment to a complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". But Mr Moon suggested Mr Kim was not certain whether Washington could guarantee the stability of his regime. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. ""What Kim is unclear about is that he has concerns about whether his country can surely trust the United States over its promise to end hostile relations,"" Mr Moon said. The KCNA statement said the two leaders had had a ""candid dialogue"" and that Mr Kim had ""expressed his fixed will on the historic... summit talks"". He had called for co-operation to ""establish a mechanism for permanent and durable peace"" and the opening of a ""new era of reconciliation and unity"". It added that ""top leaders"" from the two nations would hold more talks on Friday. At the White House late on Saturday he said: ""It's moving along very nicely. We're looking at June 12 in Singapore. That hasn't changed."" He also took to Twitter to angrily dismiss media speculation that the summit, even if reinstated, could not now be held in Singapore in the existing time frame: This video can not be played Mr Trump said the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would be ""great for the world"" The White House confirmed that an advance team of officials would leave for Singapore this weekend, as originally scheduled, to prepare for the possible summit.

Mr Trump had declared the summit cancelled on Thursday, blaming North Korea's ""tremendous anger and open hostility"", but then tweeted on Friday that ""very productive talks"" had taken place with the North. Analysis by the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Seoul The pictures from the second summit between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in show how dramatically the atmosphere has changed here on the peninsula. Their first summit in April took months to arrange. On Saturday, they met just 24 hours after a phone call from Pyongyang. It is significant that this second meeting was requested by Mr Kim. It is clear he really wants to salvage the Singapore summit. The question that remains is why? President Trump's supporters think Mr Kim is now desperate to find a way out of crushing economic sanctions. But the rhetoric from Pyongyang suggests Kim Jong-un believes his nuclear arsenal puts him in a much stronger position than his father or grandfather and, because of that, he is very close to grasping the long-dreamed-of prize, a face-to-face summit with a US president. As Mr Moon alluded to, there is still a lot of ground to be covered and Mr Trump has clearly shown that if does not think a deal can be done, he will not go. Mr Moon said after Saturday's meeting that although the US and North Korea ""share the same resolve, there need to be discussions regarding the roadmap for how to make it happen, and that process could be tough"" This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Mr Moon himself has declined to define what ""complete denuclearisation"" means and it is unclear whether Mr Kim will agree to fully abandon his nuclear arsenal. Similar pledges in the past have not been upheld. Analysts say the US had wanted denuclearisation first - followed by rewards in the form of lifted sanctions and economic aid. Mr Kim has indicated he wants a phased approach, with his steps met by reciprocal ones from the US and the South - mainly on sanctions but also easing of the US military presence in South Korea. Mr Trump has not ruled out such an incremental approach. North Korea has been subjected to numerous rounds of international sanctions since 2006, which has cut off most of its exports and capped its imports of oil. The North also wants assurances that its survival as a state would never be in question. Getting this far has been a surprise given that North Korea had maintained its strident rhetoric - and continued its nuclear and missile tests - through 2016 and 2017. This brought a bitter war of words between Mr Trump and the North Korean leadership. But a rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea. Koreans played under a unified flag at the Winter Olympics The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, held in the South. Mr Kim announced he was suspending nuclear tests and held his landmark summit with Mr Moon last month, where the pair agreed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. This weekNorth Korea said it had dismantled its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, although scientists believe it partially collapsed after the last test in September 2017, rendering it unusable.

England could get new national parks,"Dartmoor, in Devon, is one of England's 10 existing national parks England could get more national parks after Environment Secretary Michael Gove announced he is launching a review into the country's natural landscapes. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Gove said ""the time is right"" for a review, nearly 70 years on from the creation of the first national areas. It will consider whether to expand England's network of parks as well as areas of outstanding natural beauty. England has10 existing national parks,externalincluding Dartmoor and the New Forest. It also has 34 AONBs - including the Chilterns, the Cotswolds and the Isle of Wight. According to Mr Gove, the UK's population growth, combined with changes in technology and a decline in some habitats, meant it was time to ""look afresh at these landscapes"". Where are England's national parks? Mr Gove will look at evidence from industry experts He stressed that the goal of the review was not to diminish the protection of natural areas, but to ""strengthen it in the face of present-day challenges"". Former government aide and journalist Julian Glover has been appointed to carry it out. Mr Gove said: ""The creation of national parks almost 70 years ago changed the way we view our precious landscapes - helping us all access and enjoy our natural world. ""We want to make sure they are not only conserved, but enhanced for the next generation. ""Are we properly supporting all those who live in, work in, or want to visit these magnificent places? Should we indeed be extending our areas of designated land?"" He added: ""I want Julian explicitly to consider how we can extend and improve the protection we give to other precious landscapes."" Tony Juniper, the campaigns director for the WWF, welcomed the review, but warned that ""we need to do more"". ""Nature will continue to be at risk unless we have a plan for its recovery enshrined in law - through a new Environment Act that's backed by a strong watchdog with real power to enforce,"" he said. England has 10 national parks - the Broads, Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Lake District, the New Forest, Northumberland, the North York Moors, the Peak District, the South Downs and the Yorkshire Dales. The first national parks to be created were the Peak District, Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor in 1951. There are two in Scotland - Cairngorms; and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs - and three in Wales: the Brecon Beacons, Pembrokeshire Coast, and Snowdonia. Mr Gove said that unlike other nations' national parks, ""ours are working countryside"" and lived in by farmers. Mr Glover, who Mr Gove called a ""passionate advocate for the countryside"", said: ""Our protected landscapes are England's finest gems and we owe a huge debt to past generations who had the wisdom to preserve them. ""The system they created has been a strength, but it faces challenges too. ""It is an honour to be asked to find ways to secure them for the future.
