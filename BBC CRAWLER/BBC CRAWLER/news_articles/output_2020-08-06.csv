Belgium and Bahamas arrivals in UK must quarantine,"People arriving into the UK from Belgium, the Bahamas and Andorra will have to quarantine for 14 days. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes start at 04:00 BST on Saturday except in Wales, where it started midnight on Thursday. The countries are the latest to have a change in rules, after quarantines were reimposed for Spain and Luxembourg. The Foreign Office is also warning against ""all but essential travel"" to the three countries. But travellers from Brunei and Malaysia arriving in England and Wales will no longer need to self-isolate, after a decrease in confirmed coronavirus cases. The transport secretary has previously said he ""cannot rule out"" other countries being included on the list as the travel advice is kept under review. People who do not self-isolate when required can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland and those returning to Scotland could be fined Â£480, with fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. What are the UK travel quarantine rules? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Up to 1.8 million British nationals visit Belgium every year, while 150,000 visit Andorra. The Bahamas, meanwhile, saw more than 36,000 visits from the UK in 2018. According to figures on Thursday,,externalBelgium has a rate of 49.2 new cases per 100,000 people, above the UK's latest rate of 14.3. For comparison, Spain's rate was 27.4 around the time it was removed from the UK's travel corridor list. Last week, Belgium introduced new restrictions that mean that people can only meet the same five people outside their household in a month.

Holidaymakers count cost of Spain quarantine change,"Many Britons have homes in Spain - and it is also popular with tourists Holidaymakers say they face losing work or cancelling holidays after new rules mean people returning from Spain must self-isolate for 14 days. The Welsh Government has removed Spain from the list of countries exempt from quarantine, following a decision to do the same by the UK government. In response, the UK's biggest tour operator, Tui, which flies from Cardiff Airport, hascancelled all mainland Spanish holidaysuntil 9 August. It follows aspike of cases in Spain. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising againstall but essential travel,externalto mainland Spain. Quarantine measures apply to those returning from mainland Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, such as Majorca and Ibiza. So how has it affected holidaymakers? Hairdresser Claire Moriarty had already seen her work badly affected by the pandemic Adrian Corbett, 55, of Caerphilly, is staying in a private villa just outside Valencia with his partner Claire Moriarty, 47, from Cardiff, and her two children. He is a self-employed plumber while she works in mental health services as well as being a part-time hairdresser. They are due back to south Wales tomorrow. ""We didn't cancel the holiday because Ryanair wouldn't have given us a refund for a flight that was still operating,"" said Mr Corbett. ""However we would never have come out had we known there was an inkling the rules were going to change. Where can I still take a foreign holiday this summer? What are the quarantine rules for Spain and its islands? What are my holiday travel and insurance rights? ""I was gobsmacked when I saw the news because it's really going to cause us problems. ""I've had to cancel jobs booked for next week and Claire has two jobs that will be affected. She's already had four months without hair clients and now is facing two more weeks. Financially this is really going to hit us hard. ""The irony is that we've actually felt safer out here than in the UK. We're in a private villa, we've had less contact with people than back home and here, everyone wears masks everywhere."" Sheren Pugh is frustrated at the lack of forewarning over a decision Sheren Pugh, 32, from Crynant, Neath, and her friend only booked a holiday to Ibiza on Thursday and feels there should have been more warning that a rule change was on the cards. ""I'm gutted. I was really looking forward to going. I was super excited,"" she said. ""I live on my own so it's been tough in lockdown but I was going for four days of partying. We were planning on seeing Craig David on Tuesday but that's out of the window now. ""I'd booked the transfers, flights, hotel, there's just so much to sort out. We seem to have lost a lot of money. ""I work at a small dental practice so it won't be easy at all to get two weeks off again with staffing. I can't see me getting a holiday this year now."" ""I am a little anxious but it feels safe,"" said Rachael Gillespie Rachael Gillespie, 48, of Llandough, Penarth, said she still intends to travel to Quesada, Murcia, on Monday morning, with her partner and two daughters, despite the warning. ""I'm not ignoring the potential risk but we're staying in a family villa, have a family car and both my partner and I are fortunate to be able to work from home when we return,"" she said. ""We'll also be staying a long way from Catalonia where the worst of the outbreak appears to be in Spain. ""I know there's a question over insurance and some people think I'm mad, but when you see the crowds in UK destinations like north Wales or the Lake District, where exactly is the safest place to holiday right now?"" Neil Payne had planned to celebrate his 50th birthday with family on the island of Majorca Neil Payne, from Conwy, and 12 members of his family were due to go to Majorca, Spain, at the end of August to celebrate his 50th birthday. This latest announcement has made up their minds following months of wrangling over whether or not to travel. ""My partner, Hannah, is a childminder and she can't afford to go and lose two more weeks' work when we get back and then there's the kids and school. ""My mum and dad are both over 70 and they have a wedding to go to just after they get back so my mum would be worrying about it. ""We have been anxious thinking 'do we, don't we go?' ""We are happier now we have made the decision to cancel the holiday but now we have to try and sort out the flights and the insurance company do anything they can to get out of paying."" The foreign secretary hasdefended the ""swift decision""to require travellers arriving in the UK from Spain to quarantine for 14 days. Dominic Raab said he knows it will cause disruption for holidaymakers but the government ""can't make apologies"". Labour's Jonathan Ashworth called the handling of the move ""shambolic"". The new coronavirus travel rule was announced on Saturday followinga spike in the number of new cases in Spain, with more than 900 reported on Friday. The Welsh Government followed suit by removing Spain from the list of countries exempt from the 14-day quarantine rules and has issued details onhow to self-isolate,external. It said it was up to the police to enforce the quarantine. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""I am amending our international travel regulations with effect from midnight [Saturday] due to the public health risk involved. This will reduce the risk of the transmission of the virus here in Wales.

"Travelex strikes rescue deal but 1,300 UK jobs go","Foreign exchange firm Travelex has struck a deal to stay afloat, but with the loss of more than 1,300 jobs in the UK. Administrators PwC said a cyber-attack followed by the Covid-19 crisis had ""acutely"" hit the firm. Travelex washeld to ransom by hackersin January after the cyber-attack forced it to turn off its systems. PwC said that a so-called ""pre-pack"" administration deal had been reached which had saved 1,800 UK Travelex jobs. This is where a firm sells all or some of its assets to a pre-determined buyer and appoints administrators to do so. PwC said parts of the firm had been bought by a newly created company controlled by its lenders. That includes the parts that deal with supermarkets and large corporate and banking customers, and some of its airport business. However, the High Street shops and airport branches that were closed during lockdown will not reopen. It said the deal had delivered Â£84m of new money and substantially reduced the business's debts. Toby Banfield, joint administrator at PwC, said it had enabled a core part of the business to continue operating under new ownership. He added: ""The completion of this transaction has safeguarded 1,802 jobs in the UK and a further 3,635 globally, and ensured the continuation of a globally recognised brand. ""Unfortunately, as the majority of the UK retail business is no longer able to continue trading, it has regrettably resulted in 1,309 UK employees being made redundant today. ""Our dedicated employee team will be providing support to all of the people impacted."" Travelex suffered more than a month of disruption to its operations at the start of this year, after it discovered on New Year's Eve that it had been hacked. The firm did not disclose full details, but a gang called Sodinokibi claimed to have accessed reams of sensitive customer data and demanded a ransom of $6m (Â£4.6m). At the height of the disruption, cashiers resorted to using pen and paper to keep money moving at bureaux de change in airports and on High Streets. Travelex is the latest firm to shed jobs as the coronavirus crisis continues to take its toll on the economy and the government's job retention scheme starts to wind down. So far this month,Dixons Carphone has said 800 jobs are to go,Hays Travel said 878 employees could lose their jobsandDW Sports said 1,700 jobs were at risk. In the hospitality sector,hotel giant LGH has said 1,500 jobs are at risk, while Pizza Express said on Tuesday that it could close 67 UK restaurants, with the loss of 1,100 jobs.

Bank of England boss backs end of furlough scheme,"This video can not be played Andrew Bailey says the UK economy has picked up as restrictions are lifted The Governor of the Bank of England has backed the government's decision to end its furlough scheme in October. Andrew Bailey told the BBC it was important that policymakers helped workers ""move forward"" and not keep them in unproductive jobs. He said coronavirus would inevitably mean that some jobs became redundant. The Bank also predicted the economic slump caused by Covid-19 will be less severe than expected, but warned the recovery will also take longer. More than nine million jobs have been furloughed under the government'sjob retention scheme,external, but the Bank expects most people to go back to work as the economy recovers. Trade unions have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the scheme, whichpays a share of workers' wages, to avoid mass job losses. However, Mr Bailey said it was right to focus on helping people to find new jobs. ""It's been a very successful scheme, but he's right to say we have to look forward now,"" he said. ""I don't think we should be locking the economy down in a state that it pre-existed in."" What happens when the furlough scheme ends? Is the UK in a recession? Coronavirus: How much will it cost the UK? Where do governments go when they need money? The Bank said a faster easing of lockdown measures and a ""more rapid"" pick-up in consumer spending had helped the economy rebound faster than it had assumed in May. Its latestMonetary Policy Report,externalshowed spending on clothing and household goods were back to pre-Covid levels. However, the Bank warned of a ""material"" rise in unemployment this year as it held interest rates at 0.1%. Mr Bailey said recent data suggested the recovery in consumer spending was gaining traction, while spending on food and energy bills remained above pre-Covid levels. He said: ""We have had a strong recovery in the last few months. The pace puts the economy ahead of where we thought it would be in May."" However, Mr Bailey cautioned against reading too much into recent figures: ""We don't think the recent past is necessarily a good guide to the immediate future,"" he said. The Bank said spending on leisure and entertainment, which accounts for a fifth of all consumer spending, remained subdued. Business investment was also weak, which would weigh on the recovery. The Bank expects the UK economy to shrink by 9.5% this year. While this would be the biggest annual decline in 100 years, it is not as steep as its initial estimate of a 14% contraction. The Bank said the UK still faced its sharpest recession on record, with the outlook for growth now ""unusually uncertain"". Mr Bailey said it was the ""largest quantum of uncertainty in a forecast"" that policymakers had ever published. The Bank expects the UK economy to grow by 9% in 2021, and 3.5% in 2022, with the economy forecast to get back to its pre-Covid size at the end of 2021. This compares with growth estimates of 15% and 3% respectively,in a scenario the Bank set out in May. Unemployment is expected to almost double from the current rate of 3.9% to 7.5% by the end of the year as government-funded support schemes come to an end. Average earnings are also expected to shrink for the first time since the financial crisis. The Bank said more workers faced a pay cut or freeze in 2020, adding: ""In many cases, bonuses have been scaled back or withdrawn altogether for this year."" Its latest forecasts are based on the assumption that there is no second wave of the virus and that there is a smooth transition to a new EU free trade agreement at the start of 2021. Meanwhile, a fall in energy prices and the temporary VAT cut for hotels, theme parks and other hospitality businesses means the cost of living is expected to barely rise this year. The Bank expects inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), to fall close to zero by the end of 2020, before gradually rising back to its target of 2%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would not even think about raising interest rates until there was ""clear evidence"" the recovery had taken hold. Mr Bailey also signalled that policymakers were against usingnegative interest ratesany time soon, adding that such a move may have unintended consequences. It could stop the UK's already fragile banks from lending, or lead to customers withdrawing their money and holding it in cash. Policymakers also noted that High Street banks would find it difficult to cut savings rates below zero. ""They are part of our toolbox,"" said Mr Bailey. ""But at the moment we do not have a plan to use them."" He said the public may find the policy difficult to understand. ""There would be a lot of explaining to do on what this means, why we're doing it, and what the benefits   would be."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank was likely to increase its money printing programme by a further Â£100bn later this year. She also expects the Bank to keep interest rates at 0.1% ""or below"" for ""at least five years"". Millions of households that already had a variable-rate mortgage have benefitted from recent interest rate cuts. However, the Bank said borrowing had become more expensive over the past six months for first-time buyers and others moving up the property ladder, particularly for people with small deposits. Banks also continued to reduce rates on savings accounts. The average instant-access savings account now pays 0.1% annual interest, compared with 0.4% in February. Lenders said they were restricting credit due to the uncertain economic outlook. One in six mortgages in the UK is currently subject to a payment holiday because of the pandemic. Stuart Paver, the managing director of Pavers Shoes says the pandemic is the ""worst shock"" the company's suffered since it was founded by his mother in 1971. The company which has always been profitable, has now lost Â£7m over the past five months. ""We went from having 170 stores to no stores, and 1500, 1600 people on furlough"", he says. ""It's about survival and how you come through and how you have a business that can continue to employ as many people as possible, so it was really batten down the hatches ..and really just sort of work hard to make sure we were secure"". The company is now gradually reducing the number of furloughed workers and turnover in the stores is picking up, but Stuart Paver says it's still down 40% from last year. Normally in a recession, he'd expect to lose between 5 and 8% of his turnover. Mr Paver thinks recovery for businesses like his depends on consumer confidence. ""There's still a lot of people that won't venture into town.. we just need those people to become confident and come back in"". What happens when furlough ends?

Lebanon needs 'deep change' after blast - Macron,"This video can not be played 'We are doing what we can': How Beirut is trying to pull together to help in the clean up after the blast France's President Emmanuel Macron has called for ""profound change"" from Lebanon's leadership following Tuesday's huge explosion in Beirut. Visiting the devastated city, he called for an international investigation. Many Lebanese say government corruption, neglect and mismanagement led to the explosion. It killed at least 137 people and injured about 5,000 others, while dozens are still missing. A two-week state of emergency has begun. Lebanese President Michel Aoun says it was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse. How ship's deadly cargo ended up at Beirut port The state news agency says 16 people have been taken into custody as part of the investigation. Judge Fadi Akiki, a government representative at the military court, said more than 18 port and customs officials and maintenance  workers at the warehouse had been questioned. The first world leader to visit since the explosion, Mr Macron described it as a ""metaphor for Lebanon's current crisis"" and said a ""new political order"" was needed. Funding was available for the country but its leaders had to implement reforms first, he said. He also called for an international investigation into the explosion ""to prevent things from remaining hidden and doubt from creeping in"". An aid conference for Lebanon would be announced in the coming days, he said. France would make sure aid was sent directly to relief organisations working on the ground. An audit of Lebanon's central bank was also needed - ""If there is no audit of the central bank, in a few months there will be no more imports and then there will be a lack of fuel and of food,"" Mr Macron said. Mr Macron was mobbed in the streets Earlier in the day the French president  was mobbed as he walked around the blast-hit city, with residents imploring him to help and denouncing their leaders. ""Help us, you are our only hope,"" one resident called out. ""Please don't give money to our corrupt government,"" said another, before adding: ""We can't take this any more."" France - the former colonial power in Lebanon - has sent three planes carrying rescuers and medical kit to Lebanon, with a fourth arriving later and a French navy helicopter carrier carrying French investigators and further supplies due to arrive next week. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows flattened buildings after an explosion in Beirut's port area By Quentin Sommerville, BBC News, Beirut This port was Lebanon's lifeline to the whole world. Something like 80% of the country's grain came through here. The grain silos, which were built way back when, are teetering. Just beyond there I can see a ship listing heavily. I've lived in Beirut for five years and it's almost unrecognisable - it's a city of sirens, of empty buildings, of empty streets. As I look at the neighbourhood of Gemmayze just behind the port, I can't see a single pane of glass left. Entire roofs have gone - I can see friends' apartments which are just open to the sky now. All of this area, which was really heavily populated, has been abandoned. No-one is coming back here any time soon. What's really noticeable as you walk the streets here is that every second person seems to have a broom in their hand. There are clear-up teams everywhere, but it's pretty low tech: tiny teams of people with pans and brushes to clean up an an entire city's devastation. The thing that really strikes me is how enormously stupid it was, what criminal negligence it took to leave this highly explosive material right in the very heart of this city, within yards of people, their homes, their businesses. And the authorities here knew - they had been warned that these chemicals were dangerous and that they were a great risk to Beirut and Lebanon. The ammonium nitrate - which is used as a fertiliser and as an explosive - had been in a warehouse in the port for six years after it was unloaded from a ship impounded in 2013. The head of the port and the head of the customs authority said that they had written to the judiciary several times asking that the chemical be exported or sold on to ensure port safety. Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV they had been aware that the material was dangerous when a court first ordered it stored in the warehouse, ""but not to this degree"". This video can not be played Rami Ruhayem has been to Gemmayze, the closest residential area to the port The ammonium nitrate arrived on a Moldovan-flagged ship, the Rhosus, which entered Beirut port after suffering technical problems during its voyage from Georgia to Mozambique, according to Shiparrested.com, which deals with shipping-related legal cases. The Rhosus was inspected, banned from leaving and was shortly afterwards abandoned by its owners, sparking several legal claims. Its cargo was stored in a port warehouse for safety reasons, the report said. IN PICTURES:Chaos and destruction AMMONIUM NITRATE:What is it? How dangerous is it? Q&A:What we know THE CONTEXT:Why Lebanon is in crisis A French rescue team working in the city said there was still a good chance of finding survivors, two days after the explosion. One unnamed rescuer told Mr Macron that they hoped to find a group of seven or eight people believed to be trapped in a ""control room"" under the rubble. Earlier media reports that a father-of-two, Amin Zahid, had been rescued from the sea on Thursday morning have been thrown into doubt after comments under an Instagram account set up to help families locate missing people suggested that the man pulled from the sea was not him. A new account appealing for information about Mr Zahid has been set up. Security forces have sealed off a wide area around the blast site. Public Health Minister Hamad Hassan said Lebanon's health sector was short of beds and lacked the equipment necessary to treat the injured and care for patients in critical condition. As many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the blast, said Beirut's governor Marwan Aboud. He told the BBC: ""Beirut needs food, Beirut needs clothes, houses, materials to rebuild houses. Beirut needs a place for the refugees, for its people."" The explosion destroyed the surrounding area Economy Minister Raoul Nehme meanwhile said the country would have to rely at least partly on foreign aid to rebuild. ""We're not swimming in dollars,"" he told Sky News Arabia. The explosion comes at a sensitive time for Lebanon. Covid-19 infections were on the rise and hospitals were already struggling to cope. The country is also going through the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, and tensions were already high with street demonstrations against the government. People have to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare. Lebanon imports most of its food and large quantities of grain stored in the port have been destroyed causing fears of widespread food insecurity to come. The future of the port itself is in doubt.

New York attorney general sues to dissolve NRA,"This video can not be played WATCH: 'Nobody is above the law, not even the NRA' New York's attorney general has announced a lawsuit aimed at dissolving the powerful National Rifle Association over alleged financial mismanagement. Letitia James said the NRA had diverted millions of dollars to leaders including its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, for their personal use. ""For these years of misconduct we are seeking an order to dissolve the NRA in its entirety,"" she said. The NRA described the lawsuit as a ""baseless, premeditated attack"". America's gun culture in charts NRA declared 'domestic terrorist organisation' Why is US gun lobby NRA so controversial? Ms James said that the four named defendants - Mr LaPierre, Wilson Phillips, Joshua Powell and John Frazer - ""instituted a culture of self-dealing, mismanagement and negligent oversight at the NRA that was illegal, oppressive and fraudulent"". The attorney general outlined a litany of charges against the defendants, but accused Mr LaPierre, long the face of the powerful gun lobby group, of being the ""central figure"" behind the organisation's wrongdoings. One example of misconduct alleged in the lawsuit states that Mr LaPierre visited the Bahamas more than eight times by private plane using funds intended for the NRA, for a total cost of $500,000 (Â£380,000). The corruption ""is so broad"", Ms James said, that total dissolution of the organisation is necessary. Wayne LaPierre nearly three decades as executive vice-president of the NRA Responding to questions, Ms James, a Democrat, rejected the notion that the charges against the NRA - closely tied to the Republican party - were at all influenced by her own politics. ""We followed the facts and the law,"" she said. ""We've come to the conclusion that the NRA unfortunately was serving as a personal piggy bank to four individual defendants."" The case filed by Ms James' office alleges more than $64m (Â£48.7m) was lost in just three years as a result of the defendants' abuse. Also on Thursday, the District Attorney for Washington, DC filed a separate lawsuit against the organisation ""for misusing charitable funds to support wasteful spending by the NRA and its executives"". The New York lawsuit will almost certainly be contested in court by the NRA. The suit will add another strain to an already beleaguered organisation, facing congressional inquiries, investigations in multiple states and internal complaints. Founded in 1871 as a recreational group designed to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting"", the National Rifle Association has grown into one of the most powerful political organisations in the US. The NRA now lobbies heavily against all forms of gun control and argues aggressively that more guns make the country safer. It relies on, and staunchly defends, a disputed interpretation of the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which it argues gives US citizens the rights to bear arms. The NRA spends about $250m per year, far more than all the country's gun control advocacy groups put together. The NRA is at the centre of the country's deep political divide on gun control The organisation has boasted some high-profile members over the years, including former President George HW Bush. Mr Bush resigned from the group in 1995 after Mr La Pierre referred to federal agents in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing as ""jack-booted thugs"". Members have included former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, and actors Tom Selleck and Whoopi Goldberg. The organisation strongly backed Donald Trump in the 2016 election, but has faced scrutiny over its accounting practices in recent years and backlash from gun control advocates following high profile school shootings. In a statement, NRA President Carolyn Meadows decried the lawsuit as ""a transparent attempt to score political points"". ""As evidenced by the lawsuit filed by the NRA today against the [New York Attorney General] we not only will not shrink from this fight - we will confront it and prevail,"" she said Speaking to reporters outside the White House, President Donald Trump called the suit a ""very terrible thing"". The Republican president - a vocal defender of the Second Amendment - has been allied with the NRA since he launched his campaign for president. ""I think the NRA should move to Texas and lead a very good and beautiful life,"" Mr Trump said on Thursday. ""Texas would be a great place, or to another state of their choosing."" The move against the NRA was celebrated by several prominent Democrats. ""The NRA bought the president and promotes members of Congress that turn a blind eye to the gun violence epidemic,"" wrote Senator Kamala Harris on Twitter. ""It's time to end the violence and recklessness. End the NRA,"" wrote long-time Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter The attorney general of New York has had it with the NRA, but the president has not. Ms James alleges that the gun lobby is rife with corruption and no longer has the right to call itself a non-profit charity. In contrast the president sees a beleaguered organisation, one that is in search of a new home where it will be appreciated, and recommends Texas, a place famous for its gun lovers. The president's affection for the NRA goes back to his previous presidential campaign, a time when the NRA supported his efforts to get elected. The NRA reportedly donated $30m to his 2016 campaign, making them one of his biggest supporters - if not the biggest. The president has softened on some of his positions regarding the rights of gun owners while he has been in office. But now that his colleagues at the NRA are really in trouble, he has shown his support and said they should move their offices. In Texas, he told me and other reporters on the South Lawn today, the NRA can have a ""beautiful"" life. Spoken like a true friend.

"Breaking|Breaking newsBelgium and Bahamas arrivals in UK must quarantineTravellers returning to UK from Belgium, the Bahamas and Andorra will have to quarantine from 04:00 BST on SaturdayUK","People arriving into the UK from Belgium, the Bahamas and Andorra will have to quarantine for 14 days. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes start at 04:00 BST on Saturday except in Wales, where it started midnight on Thursday.

The Foreign Office is also warning against ""all but essential travel"" to the three countries.

The transport secretary has previously said he ""cannot rule out"" other countries being included on the list as the travel advice is kept under review. People who do not self-isolate when required can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland and those returning to Scotland could be fined Â£480, with fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders.

"Beirut residents rage at leaders over explosionPeople in Lebanon call for justice after a blast that left at least 137 dead and about 5,000 injured.Middle East","This video can not be played 'We are doing what we can': How Beirut is trying to pull together to help in the clean up after the blast People in Beirut have expressed anger at the government over what they say was negligence that led to Tuesday's huge explosion. President Michel Aoun said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse. Many have accused the authorities of corruption, neglect and mismanagement. The blast killed at least 137 people and injured about 5,000 others, while dozens are still missing. A two-week state of emergency has begun. How ship's deadly cargo ended up at Beirut port Beirut port explosion 'feels like a dream' French architect Jean-Marc Bonfils, involved in rebuilding the city after the civil war, and firefighter Sahar Fares, one of the first responders at the scene, were among the first fatalities to be named. A German diplomat was also among the dead. French President Emmanuel Macron - the first world leader to visit since the tragedy - was mobbed as he walked through the city on Thursday, with residents imploring him to help and denouncing their leaders. ""Help us, you are our only hope,"" one resident called out. ""Please don't give money to our corrupt government,"" said another, before adding: ""We can't take this any more."" At a press conference, Mr Macron said a new political order was needed in Lebanon. ""The anger I saw in Beirut today also showed signs of hope for the future,"" he said. He said France would help organise international aid to Lebanon. Funding was available, he said, but political reforms had to take place before it could be sent. He vowed that there would be no blank cheques for Lebanon's leaders, but cautioned that he could not tell the Lebanese government what to do. France is the former colonial power in Lebanon. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows flattened buildings after an explosion in Beirut's port area Filmmaker Jude Chehab told the BBC: ""Beirut is crying, Beirut is screaming, people are hysterical and people are tired."" Chadia Elmeouchi Noun, a resident currently in hospital, said: ""I've known all the time that we are led by incompetent people, incompetent government... But I tell you something - what they have done now is absolutely criminal."" On Wednesday, the government announced that a number of port officials were placed under house arrest pending an investigation into the explosion. France's President Macron was mobbed in the streets The country's Supreme Defence Council insisted that those found responsible would face the ""maximum punishment"". Meanwhile, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) have called for an independent investigation into the blast. In a statement, HRW said it had ""serious concerns about the ability of the Lebanese judiciary to conduct a credible and transparent investigation on its own"". By Quentin Sommerville, BBC News, Beirut This port was Lebanon's lifeline to the whole world. Something like 80% of the county's grain came through here. I can see the grain silos, which were built way back when, and they're teetering really. They no longer look like they're going to survive. Just beyond there I can see a ship listing heavily. I've lived in Beirut for five years and it's almost unrecognisable - it's a city of sirens, of empty buildings, of empty streets. As I look at the neighbourhood of Gemmayze just behind the port, I don't think I can see a single pane of glass left. Entire roofs have gone - I can see friends' apartments which are just open to the sky now. All of this area, which was really heavily populated, has been abandoned. No one is coming back here anytime soon. What's really noticeable as you walk the streets here is that every second person seems to have a broom in their hand. There are clear-up teams everywhere, but it's pretty low tech: tiny teams of people with pans and brushes to clean up an an entire city's devastation. The thing that really strikes me is how enormously stupid it was, what criminal negligence it took to leave this highly explosive material right in the very heart of this city, within yards of people, their homes, their businesses. And the authorities here knew - they had been warned that these chemicals were dangerous and that they were a great risk to Beirut and Lebanon. The ammonium nitrate - which is used as a fertiliser and as an explosive - had been in a warehouse in the port for six years after it was unloaded from a ship impounded in 2013. The head of the port and the head of the customs authority said that they had written to the judiciary several times asking that the chemical be exported or sold on to ensure port safety. Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV they had been aware that the material was dangerous when a court first ordered it stored in the warehouse, ""but not to this degree"". This video can not be played Rami Ruhayem has been to Gemmayze, the closest residential area to the port House arrest would apply for all port officials ""who have handled the affairs of storing [the] ammonium nitrate, guarding it and handling its paperwork"" since June 2014, said Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad. The ammonium nitrate arrived on a Moldovan-flagged ship, the Rhosus, which entered Beirut port after suffering technical problems during its voyage from Georgia to Mozambique, according to Shiparrested.com, which deals with shipping-related legal cases. The Rhosus was inspected, banned from leaving and was shortly afterwards abandoned by its owners, sparking several legal claims. Its cargo was stored in a port warehouse for safety reasons, the report said. IN PICTURES:Chaos and destruction AMMONIUM NITRATE:What is it? How dangerous is it? Q&A:What we know THE CONTEXT:Why Lebanon is in crisis A French rescue team working in the city said there was still a good chance of finding survivors, two days after the explosion. One unnamed rescuer told Mr Macron that they hoped to find a group of seven or eight people believed to be trapped in a ""control room"" under the rubble. Security forces have sealed off a wide area around the blast site. Flights carrying medical aid, rescuers and mobile clinics have been arriving from France and other countries since Wednesday.The UK is sending up to Â£5m ($6.6m) in medical aid, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. Public Health Minister Hamad Hassan said Lebanon's health sector was short of beds and lacked the equipment necessary to treat the injured and care for patients in critical condition. As many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the blast, said Beirut's governor Marwan Aboud. He told the BBC: ""Beirut needs food, Beirut needs clothes, houses, materials to rebuild houses. Beirut needs a place for the refugees, for its people."" The explosion destroyed the surrounding area Economy Minister Raoul Nehme meanwhile said the country would have to rely at least partly on foreign aid to rebuild. ""We're not swimming in dollars,"" he told Sky News Arabia. The explosion comes at a sensitive time for Lebanon. With Covid-19 infections on the rise, hospitals were already struggling to cope. Now, they are faced with treating thousands of injured people. The country is also going through the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, and tensions were already high with street demonstrations against the government. People have to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare. Lebanon imports most of its food and large quantities of grain stored in the port have been destroyed causing fears of widespread food insecurity to come. The future of the port itself is in doubt. The government says it will release 100bn lira (Â£50.5m; $66m) of emergency funds but the impact of the blast on the economy is expected to be long-lasting. The explosion happened close to the scene of a huge car bombing which killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005. A verdict in the trial of four men accused of orchestrating the attack was due on Friday at a special court in the Netherlands, but this has been postponed until 18 August out of respect for the victims of Tuesday's blast.

Lebanon needs 'deep change' after blast - MacronThe French president says funding is available but reforms must take place before it is sent.Middle East,"This video can not be played 'We are doing what we can': How Beirut is trying to pull together to help in the clean up after the blast France's President Emmanuel Macron has called for ""profound change"" from Lebanon's leadership following Tuesday's huge explosion in Beirut. Visiting the devastated city, he called for an international investigation. Many Lebanese say government corruption, neglect and mismanagement led to the explosion. It killed at least 137 people and injured about 5,000 others, while dozens are still missing. A two-week state of emergency has begun. Lebanese President Michel Aoun says it was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse. How ship's deadly cargo ended up at Beirut port The state news agency says 16 people have been taken into custody as part of the investigation. Judge Fadi Akiki, a government representative at the military court, said more than 18 port and customs officials and maintenance  workers at the warehouse had been questioned. The first world leader to visit since the explosion, Mr Macron described it as a ""metaphor for Lebanon's current crisis"" and said a ""new political order"" was needed. Funding was available for the country but its leaders had to implement reforms first, he said. He also called for an international investigation into the explosion ""to prevent things from remaining hidden and doubt from creeping in"". An aid conference for Lebanon would be announced in the coming days, he said. France would make sure aid was sent directly to relief organisations working on the ground. An audit of Lebanon's central bank was also needed - ""If there is no audit of the central bank, in a few months there will be no more imports and then there will be a lack of fuel and of food,"" Mr Macron said. Mr Macron was mobbed in the streets Earlier in the day the French president  was mobbed as he walked around the blast-hit city, with residents imploring him to help and denouncing their leaders. ""Help us, you are our only hope,"" one resident called out. ""Please don't give money to our corrupt government,"" said another, before adding: ""We can't take this any more."" France - the former colonial power in Lebanon - has sent three planes carrying rescuers and medical kit to Lebanon, with a fourth arriving later and a French navy helicopter carrier carrying French investigators and further supplies due to arrive next week.

'Living in a glass box was soul-destroying',"Lockdown made Joanna Coghlan realise she wanted to move away from her flat near Battersea Power Station When the coronavirus lockdown began, asset manager Joanna Coghlan knew she just had to get out of London and move to the countryside. She had bought a flat in a new development at Battersea Power Station only last year. The complex included restaurants, spas and bars. But when all those closed down because of the pandemic, the reality of her environment dawned on her. ""I spent seven weeks isolated there and realised that I absolutely hated it,"" she told the BBC. ""When you take away all the amenities that these developments advertise, then you realise you're just living in a glass box. ""It was a ghost town. It was just very soul-destroying living in this enormous development with no life going on."" Joanna took swift action to remedy her plight. She moved to the village of Datchworth Green in Hertfordshire, where she now has a five-bedroom house with a garden and a view overlooking a cricket pitch. ""I've got lots of space and it's fantastic,"" she says. Although she and her boyfriend are currently working from home, she is still close enough to be able to go back to the office. ""I can still commute to London, so it makes it more viable if I had to go back to the daily commute, which I don't think I will any time soon,"" she says. There has been a surge of interest in moving to the country due to city dwellers' priorities changing during the coronavirus lockdown, estate agents have said. Across the UK, inquiries about buying a home in a village jumped by 126% in June and July compared with the same period last year, said Rightmove. Estate agent chain Knight Frank reported similar trends. Virtual house hunting gets a pandemic boost House prices 'bounced back in July' In some cities, such as Liverpool and Edinburgh, searches more than doubled, Rightmove said. ""The lure of a new lifestyle, one that is quieter and has an abundance of beautiful countryside and more outdoor space, has led to more city dwellers choosing to become rural residents,"" said Miles Shipside of Rightmove. ""The most popular village moves are still within the same region the home hunters are currently in, as it's likely they'll keep their current job but may have the flexibility to commute less often and set up their working space at home."" Rightmove said the number of inquiries from Liverpool residents looking for a village lifestyle had almost tripled (275%) compared with a year earlier. In Edinburgh, village inquiries are up 205% and in Birmingham they have increased by 186%. The website said some urban home owners may have benefited from strong house price growth over the years, making it possible to now trade up and out to the country. But money does not appear to be the main motive for moving, as average asking prices in villages are often more expensive than in cities. In many cases, the searches show house hunters are looking at villages within commuting distance to their current city, suggesting people are being drawn to the appeal of a quieter way of life. Mark Rimell, director in Strutt & Parker's country house department, said: ""A slower pace of life, outdoor space and tight knit communities come hand in hand with village living - something many have come to appreciate in recent months - and have enduring appeal."" Rightmove's research was released as a separate survey from Barclays Mortgages found that the South West of England, with its rural and coastal communities, is a particularly desirable location for those currently in Birmingham, Nottingham, London, and Manchester. Barclays Mortgages found popular reasons for people wanting to relocate include a bigger garden, being closer to essential services, living where they can exercise easily, being nearer to relatives, and a stronger local community. Dr Peter Brooks, chief behavioural scientist at Barclays, said: ""More outside space and the benefits of being closer to friends and family are high on the 'must have' list for many movers. ""As working from home becomes more commonplace moving cross-country looks to be more achievable for many as there is less of a need to be within a short commute to the office.""

NI public told to wear masks in shops,"Face coverings in shops are not currently mandatory in Northern Ireland's shops Wearing masks in shops and other enclosed public spaces will be compulsory from Monday, Northern Ireland's first minister has said. Arlene Foster added indoor pubs which do not serve food will not be allowed to reopen on Monday, as planned. Ministers have been discussing the health minister's proposal to bring forward the original review date. Meanwhile,all schools will reopen full-time to all pupils from the start of term, the education minister said. It was also announced on Thursday that theatres and concert halls will allow audiences to return from 1 September. Health Minister Robin Swann said earlier he was concerned about mixed messaging from the executive. The NI Executive has said it would base its lockdown-easing decisionson rate of the spread of the virus in the community. That R-number (the average number of people an infected person passes Covid-19 on to after contracting the disease) is now estimated to be between 0.8 - 1.8, and infections have risen three-fold since early July, said the health department earlier. Internationally viewed as an important measure in tracking the spread of the virus, the goal is to keep R below one. Confirming that face coverings would be mandatory from Monday, First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""It's really about trying to give confidence to people who feel vulnerable and maybe have been shielding. ""We're asking the public of Northern Ireland to work again with us around all of these issues and to listen to what we're asking them to do."" She added: ""If people get to the position where we're issuing fixed penalty tickets then we will have failed in telling people why it is important to do this."" Asked if there was a ""trade-off"" between keeping alcohol-only pubs closed and the plan to fully reopen schools, Mrs Foster said: ""I make no apology for the fact that we're prioritising schools, I think it's important for our young people that we get them back into schools."" The decisions come days after the Irish government decided to push back its reopening date for pubsto 31 August at the earliest. At present, pubs and hotel bars in Northern Ireland can only open fully if they serve food At present, pubs and hotel bars in Northern Ireland can only open fully if they serve food. Those that only sell alcohol are restricted to serving customers outdoors. The NI Executive had been due to review the pubs policy on 20 August and could have then made it law; Mrs Foster said the opening date for pubs would be pushed back to the start of September. It is understood soft play areas that were due to reopen on Friday 7 August have also had their date postponed. Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said the decision on pubs was ""a catastrophic blow"" that ""removes the right to earn a living for people who work in our traditional pubs"". The opening of indoor bars in the Republic of Ireland has been pushed back to the end of the month ""This will result in business failures and job losses immediately,"" he said. ""This decision now comes with a moral responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive to step in and put in an emergency funding package to help save these jobs and save these businesses. ""We respect totally that the health of the nation comes first, but we have to protect livelihoods, we have to protect small businesses who, once lost, will never be back."" Face masks in shops in Northern Ireland are currently encouraged, but not mandatory The Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland, Eddie Lynch, has said that the current level of mask wearing by the public is causing ""great concern among older people"" and is preventing many of them emerging from lockdown. The shielding period for vulnerable people ended on 31 July in Northern Ireland. A public information campaign encouraging the take-up of face coverings is due to begin later this week. In a statement on Thursday, the Department for Communities said theatres and and concert halls can reopen from 8 August, to allow staff to prepare ahead of 1 September, when audience will be allowed to return. A manual has been published by the Arts Council on the safe reopening of concert venues. ""Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on all those who work in the creative industries,"" said Communities Minister CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n. ""It is hoped that some venues can return to hosting live performances at the beginning of September, although we remain mindful of the ongoing challenges we face in dealing with the restrictions of Covid-19,"" she said.Â ""The final decision to reopen will be dependent upon the safety of our theatre staff and the public."" The health department said that when community transmission of the virus was very low, the R number ""will show a high degree of volatility and be heavily influenced by small local clusters"". It added that the number of positive tests per day was ""likely to be a more important parameter"" in determining public health policy decisions. On Thursday, 43 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 were confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed positive cases in Northern Ireland to 6,049. Twenty-three clusters have been identified in Northern Ireland since contact tracing began in last May. Nine clusters have had five or more cases associated with them.  Fourteen across Northern Ireland have had fewer than five people. Smaller clusters may be associated with a larger cluster - for example, a common geographic location or common social setting. Five have been identified in the past week, with 35 cases involved and 239 close contacts. Clusters are defined as two or more cases among individuals associated by a key setting - a workplace, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings and sporting settings - with illness onset dates within a 14 day period. In the Republic of Ireland, the Department of Health has been notified of five additional Covid-linked deaths and 69 new cases. However, Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn said four of the deaths are late notifications, relating to April and June.

Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks,"FFP2 respirator masks such as these are used by healthcare workers Fifty million face masks bought by the UK government in April will not be used in the NHS  because of safety concerns. The government says the masks, which use ear-loop fastenings rather than head loops, may not fit tightly enough. They were bought for NHS England healthcare workers from supplier Ayanda Capital as part of a Â£252m contract. Ayanda says the masks met the specifications No 10 had set out. The PM said he was ""disappointed"" that any protective kit should be unfit for use. An earlier government statement said its safety standards process is ""robust"". Tim Horlick, chief executive of Ayanda Capital, insisted the masks were ""not unusable or unsafe"" and had met all government standards, adding that No 10 had ""not wasted any money"" in buying them. It has emerged that the person who originally approached the government about the deal was a government trade adviser who also advises the board of Ayanda. But the adviser told the BBC his position played no part in the awarding of the contract. Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? PPE failings identified by National Audit Office Asked about the masks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very disappointed"" that ""any consignment"" of personal protective equipment (PPE) ""should turn out not to be fit for purpose"". Mr Johnson insisted the government had ""achieved a colossal race against time"" to produce ""billions of items"" of PPE and source them from abroad, adding that supplies are now being stockpiled in the event of a second wave later in the year. In the early weeks of the pandemic the NHS experienced severe shortages of PPE. The government says it had to find new suppliers quickly to meet demand and to compete with rising global competition. The procurement of PPE is devolved across the four nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Welsh and Scottish governments said they have not used Ayanda as a supplier. On 29 April the Department of Health and Social Care signed the Â£252m contract with Ayanda Capital Limited to supply two types of face masks. The most expensive part of the order consisted of 50 million FFP2 respirator masks, which are designed to protect healthcare workers from inhaling harmful particles. The government bought 50 million masks like these with ear loops According to legal papers seen by the BBC, the government says these masks will now not be used in the NHS because of a safety concern about whether they would fit adequately. To be effective these types of face mask need to fit tightly to create a seal between the mask and the wearer's face. Anyone who wears them for work is required to undergo a face-fit test. Alan Murray, chief executive of the British Safety Industry Federation, said products with ear loops fail this test more often than those with head harnesses. It is not clear what will happen now to the 50 million masks. Ayanda Capital also supplied 150 million Type IIR masks, which the government says are unaffected. Most have now been delivered but they have not yet been released for use in the NHS and are awaiting further testing. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""For months, we were told that the government was purchasing the right equipment for the front line. Yet again it hasn't happened. Calling for an inquiry into ""what went wrong"", Sir Keir said the situation was ""just not good enough"" for the NHS workers who needed the protective kit. The information was disclosed in a legal response to the Good Law Project, which is seeking to challenge the government in the courts over three PPE contracts it awarded, including Ayanda Capital's. The campaign group argues the government's awarding of contracts directly to companies during the pandemic, rather than opening them to competition, may have been unlawful. Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project's director, said it was ""important"" for a court to examine the contracts to ensure ""full transparency of how these staggering amounts of public money have been spent"". One procurement expert described the scramble for PPE at the height of the supply crisis as ""like the wild west"". Every leading healthcare system was pressing to secure scarce supplies in the global market as coronavirus infections soared. With fears that PPE might run out at some hospitals, the UK authorities looked everywhere for readily available masks, gowns and visors. A Turkish consignment was found wanting in May and now details of contracts with little known companies signed by the Department of Health in England have emerged. It is understandable that officials facing an unprecedented shortage of vital equipment followed up any offer that looked credible. But the government has to be held accountable for the spending of taxpayers' money and the Good Law project has highlighted deals that raise questions about due process and transparency. The government has also disclosed that the original approach to sell the masks came not from Ayanda Capital but from a businessman called Andrew Mills. His company, Prospermill, had secured the rights to the full production capacity of a large factory in China to produce masks and was able to offer a large quantity almost immediately. But the legal document seen by the BBC notes that Mr Mills requested the government instead sign the contract for the masks with Ayanda Capital, whose board he advises, because it could arrange overseas payment more quickly. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate MAPS AND CHARTS:Is the pandemic getting worse in the US? VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr Mills is also an adviser to the UK Board of Trade. He told the BBC his position played no part in the award of the contract, which was subject to the same evaluation as all offers made in response to the government's request for help. A statement from Ayanda Capital Limited said the masks went through a ""rigorous technical assurance programme"" and could have been rejected through provisions in its contract had they not met government specifications - but those provisions were not activated. Another government contract the Good Law Project is seeking to challenge in the courts is a Â£32m deal with Crisp Websites Limited, trading as Pestfix, to supply isolation suits. In July, No 10 disclosed that none of the suits Pestfix supplied had yet been delivered into the NHS - and instead they were being stored in a Department of Health facility in Daventry awaiting tests. Now the BBC has discovered the pest control company has separately sold respirator masks to commercial clients using certificates from ECM, a test house in Italy which says it is not a notified body for PPE. The British Safety Industry Federation said some companies had been presenting so-called 'voluntary certificates of compliance' from ECM but they added these had ""no value and no standing"" in demonstrating an item of PPE complied with legislation. Pestfix told the BBC they ""unreservedly apologise"" for the compliance issue with certain PPE face masks they had supplied to commercial and private clients. It said it is conducting a ""thorough investigation"" and talking to regulators and affected customers. The government said in its legal response to the Good law Project that Pestfix provided certificates confirming the suits conformed to the technical standards and they were approved accordingly.

Lenders using 'exotic holidays' to encourage debt,"High-cost lenders are using pictures of holidays and ""nudge"" tactics to encourage vulnerable people to take on more debt, the finance watchdog says. The Financial Conduct Authority found borrowers were getting into financial trouble after taking on extra credit. Lenders are accused of poor practice by using online accounts and apps to encourage consumers to borrow more. ""Repeat borrowing could be a strong indicator of levels of debt that are harmful to the customer,"" the FCA said. It reported firms using images of exotic locations to suggest consumers take on extra borrowing to have a holiday. Some use ""nudge"" techniques such as appealing to social norms by suggesting that relending is common practice and normal behaviour. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, said: ""As a large chunk of the population has been forced into debt by the current Covid-19 crisis, the regulator is clearly worried about debt companies using misleading marketing and pushy tactics to keep customers in high-cost debt."" Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes the Debt Camel blog, said it was good that the FCA had recognised the harm caused by repeat lending. ""If you have had to take a high-cost loan, you are often left short of money and are then vulnerable to marketing offering you another loan as being 'easy' and 'convenient', but this traps people in expensive debt for much longer,"" she said. High-cost credit customers are more likely to be vulnerable, have low financial resilience and poor credit histories,the watchdog said in its review,external. They often have several debts forcing them to juggle repayments, sometimes having to prioritise which debts to pay when they do not have enough money for all. But lenders target vulnerable borrowers with marketing messages which emphasise the ease, convenience and benefits of taking more credit. Coronavirus: How the financial shockwave is affecting jobs and money Coronavirus crisis could spark 'personal debt time bomb' 'I was Â£32,000 in debt, it consumed every moment' The FCA said it was concerned that lenders were not balancing their marketing messages with warnings about the risks of people taking on more debt than they could afford. ""Before the pandemic we saw increasing numbers of complaints about high-cost lenders' relending practices, which showed that firms had failed to adequately assess affordability, and they were not relending in a way that was sustainable for customers,"" said Jonathan Davidson, executive director of supervision, retail and authorisations at the FCA. The watchdog said lenders should assess whether further borrowing is in the customer's best interests. ""Rigorous affordability assessments are key to avoiding harm in this area, and firms should ensure they are making proportionate and responsible assessments of the sustainability of borrowing,"" it said. Looking ahead, the FCA said it had been forced to act to help consumers who were under additional financial pressure due to the impact of coronavirus. It has encouraged firms to offer payment deferrals to help struggling borrowers. ""We are closely engaged with firms to understand the impacts of the pandemic on consumers,"" said Mr Davidson. ""Where consumers are experiencing payment difficulties, we encourage them to contact their credit provider as soon as possible and explain their situation and get the help that lenders have agreed to provide."" Laura Suter warned that during the pandemic more people had been using payday loans or doorstep lending either to pay their normal bills or to pay off other debt. ""That becomes a very slippery slope that's tough to get out of,"" she said. ""Any crackdown on these practices would be good news for consumers at a time when many find themselves in spiralling debt. ""This is particularly the case as the Covid-19 measures introduced by the regulator to ease the burden of debt, such as payment holidays or reductions in interest rates, start to be unwound and people face hefty bills for their borrowing.""

Breaking|Breaking newsNew York attorney general sues to dissolve NRANew York attorney general announces lawsuit aimed at dissolving powerful National Rifle Association over alleged financial mismanagementUS & Canada,"This video can not be played WATCH: 'Nobody is above the law, not even the NRA' New York's attorney general has announced a lawsuit aimed at dissolving the powerful National Rifle Association over alleged financial mismanagement. Letitia James said the NRA had diverted millions of dollars to leaders including its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, for their personal use. ""For these years of misconduct we are seeking an order to dissolve the NRA in its entirety,"" she said. The NRA described the lawsuit as a ""baseless, premeditated attack"". America's gun culture in charts NRA declared 'domestic terrorist organisation' Why is US gun lobby NRA so controversial? Ms James said that the four named defendants - Mr LaPierre, Wilson Phillips, Joshua Powell and John Frazer - ""instituted a culture of self-dealing, mismanagement and negligent oversight at the NRA that was illegal, oppressive and fraudulent"". The attorney general outlined a litany of charges against the defendants, but accused Mr LaPierre, long the face of the powerful gun lobby group, of being the ""central figure"" behind the organisation's wrongdoings. One example of misconduct alleged in the lawsuit states that Mr LaPierre visited the Bahamas more than eight times by private plane using funds intended for the NRA, for a total cost of $500,000 (Â£380,000). The corruption ""is so broad"", Ms James said, that total dissolution of the organisation is necessary. Wayne LaPierre nearly three decades as executive vice-president of the NRA Responding to questions, Ms James, a Democrat, rejected the notion that the charges against the NRA - closely tied to the Republican party - were at all influenced by her own politics. ""We followed the facts and the law,"" she said. ""We've come to the conclusion that the NRA unfortunately was serving as a personal piggy bank to four individual defendants."" The case filed by Ms James' office alleges more than $64m (Â£48.7m) was lost in just three years as a result of the defendants' abuse. Also on Thursday, the District Attorney for Washington, DC filed a separate lawsuit against the organisation ""for misusing charitable funds to support wasteful spending by the NRA and its executives"". The New York lawsuit will almost certainly be contested in court by the NRA. The suit will add another strain to an already beleaguered organisation, facing congressional inquiries, investigations in multiple states and internal complaints. Founded in 1871 as a recreational group designed to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting"", the National Rifle Association has grown into one of the most powerful political organisations in the US. The NRA now lobbies heavily against all forms of gun control and argues aggressively that more guns make the country safer. It relies on, and staunchly defends, a disputed interpretation of the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which it argues gives US citizens the rights to bear arms. The NRA spends about $250m per year, far more than all the country's gun control advocacy groups put together. The NRA is at the centre of the country's deep political divide on gun control The organisation has boasted some high-profile members over the years, including former President George HW Bush. Mr Bush resigned from the group in 1995 after Mr La Pierre referred to federal agents in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing as ""jack-booted thugs"". Members have included former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, and actors Tom Selleck and Whoopi Goldberg. The organisation strongly backed Donald Trump in the 2016 election, but has faced scrutiny over its accounting practices in recent years and backlash from gun control advocates following high profile school shootings. In a statement, NRA President Carolyn Meadows decried the lawsuit as ""a transparent attempt to score political points"". ""As evidenced by the lawsuit filed by the NRA today against the [New York Attorney General] we not only will not shrink from this fight - we will confront it and prevail,"" she said Speaking to reporters outside the White House, President Donald Trump called the suit a ""very terrible thing"". The Republican president - a vocal defender of the Second Amendment - has been allied with the NRA since he launched his campaign for president. ""I think the NRA should move to Texas and lead a very good and beautiful life,"" Mr Trump said on Thursday. ""Texas would be a great place, or to another state of their choosing."" The move against the NRA was celebrated by several prominent Democrats. ""The NRA bought the president and promotes members of Congress that turn a blind eye to the gun violence epidemic,"" wrote Senator Kamala Harris on Twitter. ""It's time to end the violence and recklessness. End the NRA,"" wrote long-time Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter The attorney general of New York has had it with the NRA, but the president has not. Ms James alleges that the gun lobby is rife with corruption and no longer has the right to call itself a non-profit charity. In contrast the president sees a beleaguered organisation, one that is in search of a new home where it will be appreciated, and recommends Texas, a place famous for its gun lovers. The president's affection for the NRA goes back to his previous presidential campaign, a time when the NRA supported his efforts to get elected. The NRA reportedly donated $30m to his 2016 campaign, making them one of his biggest supporters - if not the biggest. The president has softened on some of his positions regarding the rights of gun owners while he has been in office. But now that his colleagues at the NRA are really in trouble, he has shown his support and said they should move their offices. In Texas, he told me and other reporters on the South Lawn today, the NRA can have a ""beautiful"" life. Spoken like a true friend.

Why Lebanon was already in crisis,"Lebanon is in the throes of its worst crisis for many years The Lebanese government has resigned amid growing public anger following a devastating explosion in Beirut on 4 August that killed at least 200 people and injured about 5,000 others. The blast came at a difficult time for Lebanon, which is not only trying to curb the spread of the coronavirus but is also mired in an unprecedented economic crisis. The economic situation has pushed tens of thousands people into poverty and triggered large anti-government protests. Announcing the move on Monday, outgoing Prime Minister Hassan Diab said his government was taking ""a step back... to stand with the people, in order to wage the battle of change with them"". Discontent in Lebanon has been brewing for years. In late 2019, a plan to tax Whatsapp calls spilled over into mass protests against economic turmoil and corruption, which eventually led to the then government's resignation. Coronavirus had curbed the protests, but the financial situation continued to worsen and last week's deadly explosion was seen by many as the deadly result of years of corruption and mismanagement. People have taken to the streets again, and there have been clashes between protesters and police. The government's plans to investigate the cause of the explosion were not enough for most people, who have lost all faith in the political elite. Before the cabinet's resignation, a number of ministers had offered to step down. But the end of this government does not necessarily mean an end to the anger. Last year's protests led to the formation of the government which has now been forced to step down over the same accusations of corruption. In his strongly worded speech on Monday, Mr Diab blamed ""a system of corruption... deeply-rooted in all the functions of the state"". ""One of the many examples of corruption exploded in the port of Beirut, and the calamity befell Lebanon,"" he said. ""But corruption cases are widespread in the country's political and administrative landscape; other calamities hiding in many minds and warehouses, and which pose a great threat, are protected by the class that controls the fate of the country."" Even before the coronavirus pandemic at the start of this year, Lebanon seemed to be headed for a crash. Its public debt-to-gross domestic product (what a country owes compared to what it produces) was the third highest in the world; unemployment stood at 25%; and nearly a third of the population was living below the poverty line. The Lebanese pound has lost about 80% of its value over the past 10 months Late last year also saw the unravelling ofwhat analysts said was effectively a state-sponsored pyramid, or Ponzi, scheme,externalrun by the central bank, which was borrowing from commercial banks at above-market interest rates to pay back its debts and maintain the Lebanese pound's fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. At the same time, people were getting increasingly angry and frustrated about the government's failure to provide even basic services. They were having to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water, limited public healthcare, and some of the world's worst internet connections. 'Now there is nothing' - Lebanon pushed to brink How did Lebanon get into such a deep crisis? How Lebanon became the third most indebted nation Many blamed the ruling elite who have dominated politics for years and amassed their own wealth while failing to carry out the sweeping reforms necessary to solve the country's problems. At the start of October 2019, a shortage of foreign currency led to the Lebanese pound losing value against the dollar on a newly emerged black market for the first time in two decades. When importers of wheat and fuel demanded to be paid in dollars, unions called strikes. Then, unprecedented wildfires in the country's western mountains highlighted how underfunded and underequipped the fire service was. Saad Hariri resigned as prime minister in response to the protests In mid-October, the government proposed new taxes on tobacco, petrol, andvoice calls via messaging services such as WhatsAppto drum up more revenue, but a backlash forced it to cancel the plans. However, the debacle unleashed a surge of discontent that had been simmering in Lebanon for years. Tens of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets, leading to the resignation of Western-backed Prime Minister Saad Hariri and his unity government. The protests have cut across sectarian lines and involved people from all sections of society Protests cut across sectarian lines - a rare phenomenon since the country's devastating 1975-1989 civil war ended - and brought the country to a virtual standstill. Newly appointed Prime Minister Hassan Diab subsequently announced that Lebanon would default on its foreign debt for the first time in its history, saying its foreign currency reserves had hit a ""critical and dangerous"" level and that those remaining were needed to pay for vital imports. In the wake of the first Covid-19 deaths and a surge in infections, a lockdown was imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of the disease. On the one hand, it forced anti-government protesters off the streets, but on the other, it made the economic crisis much worse and exposed the inadequacies of Lebanon's social welfare system. The prime minister has warned that Lebanon is at ""risk of a major food crisis"" Many business were forced to lay off staff or put them on furlough without pay; the gap between the Lebanese pound's value on the official and black-market exchange rates widened; and banks tightened capital controls. As prices rose further, many families were unable to buy even basic necessities. Growing economic hardship triggered fresh unrest. In Aprila young man was shot dead by soldiers during a violent protest in Tripoliand several banks were set ablaze. The government, meanwhile, finally approved a recovery plan that it hoped would end the economic crisis and win support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout package worth $10bn. Banks have been attacked and set on fire by protesters By the time the coronavirus restrictions began to be lifted in May, the prices of some foodstuffs had doubled and Mr Diab warned that Lebanon was at risk of a ""major food crisis"". ""Many Lebanese have already stopped buying meat, fruits and vegetables, and may soon find it difficult to afford even bread,"" he wrote in the Washington Post. Most analysts point to one key factor: political sectarianism, or groups looking after their own interests. Lebanon officially recognises 18 religious communities - four Muslim, 12 Christian, the Druze sect and Judaism. The three main political offices - president, speaker of parliament and prime minister - are divided among the three biggest communities (Maronite Christian; Shia Muslim; and Sunni Muslim, respectively) under an agreement dating back to 1943. Parliament's 128 seats are also divided evenly between Christians and Muslims (including Druze). The seats in parliament are divided between religious communities It is this religious diversity that makes the country an easy target for interference by external powers, as seen with Iran's backing of the Shia Hezbollah movement, widely seen as the most powerful military and political group in Lebanon Since the end of the civil war, political leaders from each sect have maintained their power and influence through a system of patronage networks - protecting the interests of the religious communities they represent, and offering - both legal and illegal - financial incentives. Lebanon ranked 137th out of 180 countries,external(180 being the worst) on Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index. The watchdog says corruption ""permeates all levels of society"" in Lebanon, with political parties, parliament and the police perceived as ""the most corrupt institutions of the country"". It says it is the very system of sectarian power-sharing which is fuelling these patronage networks and hindering Lebanon's system of governance.

How conspiracy theories spread after explosion,"The huge explosion caused widespread destruction in Beirut port Early reports of the explosion in Beirut's port began circulating on social media moments after the blast. Whilst most of the videos appeared authentic, filmed by residents from their homes, rumours about the cause of the blast were also quickly shared on platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp. So, what misinformation spread online? The videos circulating showed smaller explosions and an initial fire followed by the huge blast, which led to tweets suggesting it had happened at a firework factory. Claims about fireworks seemed plausible at the time, but other viral tweets suggested the event was caused by a nuclear bomb because of the white mushroom-like cloud seen rising in some of the footage. A now-deleted tweet suggesting the explosion was ""atomic"" was shared by a verified Twitter account with over 100,000 followers and racked up thousands of shares and likes. A tweet falsely claims that the explosion in Beirut was ""atomic"" Weapons experts have been quick to point out that had the explosion been caused by a nuclear device, it would have been accompanied by a blinding white flash and a surge of heat that would have severely burned people. Also, mushroom clouds are not unique to nuclear bombs. According to experts, they are a result of the compression of humid air, which condenses water and creates the cloud. In pictures:  Chaos and destruction in Beirut after blast What is ammonium nitrate and how dangerous is it? Lebanon: Why the country is in crisis Unfounded claims continued to spread, blaming the ""nuclear bomb"" on the US, Israel or Hezbollah. These were shared by partisan news sites as well as public figures. Conspiracy theories promoted by far-right groups have also been shared on Facebook, 4chan, Reddit and messaging apps like Telegram, according to research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Messages have mainly focused on false claims that this was an Israeli attack, either a bomb or a missile strike on a Hezbollah weapons depot. False claims circulated online suggesting a missile caused the explosion in Beirut Chloe Colliver, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told BBC News: ""We have seen known disinformation sources, including far-right extremist networks online, spreading unfounded claims about the nature and motivations behind the blast. ""This has included theories trying to tie the explosion to Israel or other nation states."" The authorities in Lebanon and Israel have dismissed suggestions that Israel had anything to do with the incident. Far-right conspiracy theorists, including QAnon supporters, have also started sharing false claims about the explosion on Facebook. They suggest that the attack is related to a ""war between the government and the central banking system"". QAnon is a wide-ranging, unfounded conspiracy theorythat says US President Donald Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media. Photographs of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressing the UN General Assembly in 2018 have been posted on social media amid claims that he is pointing at the site of Tuesday's Beirut explosion. Some social media users are using the images as ""proof"" that Israel had a hand in the blast. The Israeli prime minister at the United Nations in 2018 The images are genuine and not manipulated, but have been taken out of context. Mr Netanyahu is actually pointing to a completely different district in the city of Beirut where he claimed Hezbollah was hiding weapons. The blast site is several kilometres to the north of ""Site 1"" on Mr Netanyahu's map. Rumours about a possible attack picked up steam after President Trump described the event as ""a terrible attack"" at a White House press conference. Research from the Institute for Strategic dialogue has identified his comments being shared and edited by far-right groups on social media to suggest that the blast was a terror attack or bomb. One post on Telegram claimed that Trump said ""it looks like a terrible terrorist attack"". Instead, he actually said it looks like a ""terrible attack"". Posts on social media attributed false quotes to President Trump ""We have also seen claims building off President Trump's statement about the explosion as an 'attack', which has provided fuel to conspiracy and disinformation communities over the past 24 hours, demonstrating the risks of inaccurate language and communications during crisis moments,"" Ms Colliver says. Other posts on social media make unfounded claims that Mr Trump's comments suggested the US was forewarned of the explosion.

Angry Beirut residents demand answers after blast,"This video can not be played 'We are doing what we can': How Beirut is trying to pull together to help in the clean up after the blast People in Beirut have expressed anger at the government over what they say was negligence that led to Tuesday's huge explosion. President Michel Aoun said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse. Many have accused the authorities of corruption, neglect and mismanagement. The blast killed at least 137 people and injured about 5,000 others, while dozens are still missing. A two-week state of emergency has begun. How ship's deadly cargo ended up at Beirut port Beirut port explosion 'feels like a dream' French architect Jean-Marc Bonfils, involved in rebuilding the city after the civil war, and firefighter Sahar Fares, one of the first responders at the scene, were among the first fatalities to be named. A German diplomat was also among the dead. French President Emmanuel Macron - the first world leader to visit since the tragedy - was mobbed as he walked through the city on Thursday, with residents imploring him to help and denouncing their leaders.

At a press conference, Mr Macron said a new political order was needed in Lebanon. ""The anger I saw in Beirut today also showed signs of hope for the future,"" he said.

He vowed that there would be no blank cheques for Lebanon's leaders, but cautioned that he could not tell the Lebanese government what to do. France is the former colonial power in Lebanon.

By Quentin Sommerville, BBC News, Beirut This port was Lebanon's lifeline to the whole world. Something like 80% of the county's grain came through here. I can see the grain silos, which were built way back when, and they're teetering really. They no longer look like they're going to survive. Just beyond there I can see a ship listing heavily. I've lived in Beirut for five years and it's almost unrecognisable - it's a city of sirens, of empty buildings, of empty streets. As I look at the neighbourhood of Gemmayze just behind the port, I don't think I can see a single pane of glass left. Entire roofs have gone - I can see friends' apartments which are just open to the sky now. All of this area, which was really heavily populated, has been abandoned. No one is coming back here anytime soon. What's really noticeable as you walk the streets here is that every second person seems to have a broom in their hand. There are clear-up teams everywhere, but it's pretty low tech: tiny teams of people with pans and brushes to clean up an an entire city's devastation. The thing that really strikes me is how enormously stupid it was, what criminal negligence it took to leave this highly explosive material right in the very heart of this city, within yards of people, their homes, their businesses. And the authorities here knew - they had been warned that these chemicals were dangerous and that they were a great risk to Beirut and Lebanon. The ammonium nitrate - which is used as a fertiliser and as an explosive - had been in a warehouse in the port for six years after it was unloaded from a ship impounded in 2013. The head of the port and the head of the customs authority said that they had written to the judiciary several times asking that the chemical be exported or sold on to ensure port safety. Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV they had been aware that the material was dangerous when a court first ordered it stored in the warehouse, ""but not to this degree"". This video can not be played Rami Ruhayem has been to Gemmayze, the closest residential area to the port House arrest would apply for all port officials ""who have handled the affairs of storing [the] ammonium nitrate, guarding it and handling its paperwork"" since June 2014, said Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad. The ammonium nitrate arrived on a Moldovan-flagged ship, the Rhosus, which entered Beirut port after suffering technical problems during its voyage from Georgia to Mozambique, according to Shiparrested.com, which deals with shipping-related legal cases. The Rhosus was inspected, banned from leaving and was shortly afterwards abandoned by its owners, sparking several legal claims. Its cargo was stored in a port warehouse for safety reasons, the report said. IN PICTURES:Chaos and destruction AMMONIUM NITRATE:What is it? How dangerous is it? Q&A:What we know THE CONTEXT:Why Lebanon is in crisis A French rescue team working in the city said there was still a good chance of finding survivors, two days after the explosion. One unnamed rescuer told Mr Macron that they hoped to find a group of seven or eight people believed to be trapped in a ""control room"" under the rubble. Security forces have sealed off a wide area around the blast site. Flights carrying medical aid, rescuers and mobile clinics have been arriving from France and other countries since Wednesday.The UK is sending up to Â£5m ($6.6m) in medical aid, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. Public Health Minister Hamad Hassan said Lebanon's health sector was short of beds and lacked the equipment necessary to treat the injured and care for patients in critical condition. As many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the blast, said Beirut's governor Marwan Aboud. He told the BBC: ""Beirut needs food, Beirut needs clothes, houses, materials to rebuild houses. Beirut needs a place for the refugees, for its people."" The explosion destroyed the surrounding area Economy Minister Raoul Nehme meanwhile said the country would have to rely at least partly on foreign aid to rebuild. ""We're not swimming in dollars,"" he told Sky News Arabia. The explosion comes at a sensitive time for Lebanon. With Covid-19 infections on the rise, hospitals were already struggling to cope. Now, they are faced with treating thousands of injured people. The country is also going through the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, and tensions were already high with street demonstrations against the government. People have to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare. Lebanon imports most of its food and large quantities of grain stored in the port have been destroyed causing fears of widespread food insecurity to come. The future of the port itself is in doubt. The government says it will release 100bn lira (Â£50.5m; $66m) of emergency funds but the impact of the blast on the economy is expected to be long-lasting. The explosion happened close to the scene of a huge car bombing which killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005. A verdict in the trial of four men accused of orchestrating the attack was due on Friday at a special court in the Netherlands, but this has been postponed until 18 August out of respect for the victims of Tuesday's blast.

"Angry Beirut residents demand answers after blastPeople in Lebanon call for justice after a blast that left at least 137 dead and about 5,000 injured.Middle East","This video can not be played 'We are doing what we can': How Beirut is trying to pull together to help in the clean up after the blast People in Beirut have expressed anger at the government over what they say was negligence that led to Tuesday's huge explosion. President Michel Aoun said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse. Many have accused the authorities of corruption, neglect and mismanagement. The blast killed at least 137 people and injured about 5,000 others, while dozens are still missing. A two-week state of emergency has begun. How ship's deadly cargo ended up at Beirut port Beirut port explosion 'feels like a dream' French architect Jean-Marc Bonfils, involved in rebuilding the city after the civil war, and firefighter Sahar Fares, one of the first responders at the scene, were among the first fatalities to be named. A German diplomat was also among the dead. French President Emmanuel Macron - the first world leader to visit since the tragedy - was mobbed as he walked through the city on Thursday, with residents imploring him to help and denouncing their leaders. ""Help us, you are our only hope,"" one resident called out. ""Please don't give money to our corrupt government,"" said another, before adding: ""We can't take this any more.""

Bank of England boss backs end of furlough schemeUK economy is still set for worst performance in 100 years according to the UK's central bank.BusinessComments,"This video can not be played Andrew Bailey says the UK economy has picked up as restrictions are lifted The Governor of the Bank of England has backed the government's decision to end its furlough scheme in October. Andrew Bailey told the BBC it was important that policymakers helped workers ""move forward"" and not keep them in unproductive jobs. He said coronavirus would inevitably mean that some jobs became redundant. The Bank also predicted the economic slump caused by Covid-19 will be less severe than expected, but warned the recovery will also take longer. More than nine million jobs have been furloughed under the government'sjob retention scheme,external, but the Bank expects most people to go back to work as the economy recovers. Trade unions have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the scheme, whichpays a share of workers' wages, to avoid mass job losses. However, Mr Bailey said it was right to focus on helping people to find new jobs. ""It's been a very successful scheme, but he's right to say we have to look forward now,"" he said. ""I don't think we should be locking the economy down in a state that it pre-existed in."" What happens when the furlough scheme ends? Is the UK in a recession? Coronavirus: How much will it cost the UK? Where do governments go when they need money? The Bank said a faster easing of lockdown measures and a ""more rapid"" pick-up in consumer spending had helped the economy rebound faster than it had assumed in May. Its latestMonetary Policy Report,externalshowed spending on clothing and household goods were back to pre-Covid levels. However, the Bank warned of a ""material"" rise in unemployment this year as it held interest rates at 0.1%. Mr Bailey said recent data suggested the recovery in consumer spending was gaining traction, while spending on food and energy bills remained above pre-Covid levels. He said: ""We have had a strong recovery in the last few months. The pace puts the economy ahead of where we thought it would be in May."" However, Mr Bailey cautioned against reading too much into recent figures: ""We don't think the recent past is necessarily a good guide to the immediate future,"" he said. The Bank said spending on leisure and entertainment, which accounts for a fifth of all consumer spending, remained subdued. Business investment was also weak, which would weigh on the recovery. The Bank expects the UK economy to shrink by 9.5% this year. While this would be the biggest annual decline in 100 years, it is not as steep as its initial estimate of a 14% contraction. The Bank said the UK still faced its sharpest recession on record, with the outlook for growth now ""unusually uncertain"". Mr Bailey said it was the ""largest quantum of uncertainty in a forecast"" that policymakers had ever published. The Bank expects the UK economy to grow by 9% in 2021, and 3.5% in 2022, with the economy forecast to get back to its pre-Covid size at the end of 2021. This compares with growth estimates of 15% and 3% respectively,in a scenario the Bank set out in May. Unemployment is expected to almost double from the current rate of 3.9% to 7.5% by the end of the year as government-funded support schemes come to an end. Average earnings are also expected to shrink for the first time since the financial crisis. The Bank said more workers faced a pay cut or freeze in 2020, adding: ""In many cases, bonuses have been scaled back or withdrawn altogether for this year."" Its latest forecasts are based on the assumption that there is no second wave of the virus and that there is a smooth transition to a new EU free trade agreement at the start of 2021. Meanwhile, a fall in energy prices and the temporary VAT cut for hotels, theme parks and other hospitality businesses means the cost of living is expected to barely rise this year. The Bank expects inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), to fall close to zero by the end of 2020, before gradually rising back to its target of 2%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would not even think about raising interest rates until there was ""clear evidence"" the recovery had taken hold. Mr Bailey also signalled that policymakers were against usingnegative interest ratesany time soon, adding that such a move may have unintended consequences. It could stop the UK's already fragile banks from lending, or lead to customers withdrawing their money and holding it in cash. Policymakers also noted that High Street banks would find it difficult to cut savings rates below zero. ""They are part of our toolbox,"" said Mr Bailey. ""But at the moment we do not have a plan to use them."" He said the public may find the policy difficult to understand. ""There would be a lot of explaining to do on what this means, why we're doing it, and what the benefits   would be."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank was likely to increase its money printing programme by a further Â£100bn later this year. She also expects the Bank to keep interest rates at 0.1% ""or below"" for ""at least five years"". Millions of households that already had a variable-rate mortgage have benefitted from recent interest rate cuts. However, the Bank said borrowing had become more expensive over the past six months for first-time buyers and others moving up the property ladder, particularly for people with small deposits. Banks also continued to reduce rates on savings accounts. The average instant-access savings account now pays 0.1% annual interest, compared with 0.4% in February. Lenders said they were restricting credit due to the uncertain economic outlook. One in six mortgages in the UK is currently subject to a payment holiday because of the pandemic. Stuart Paver, the managing director of Pavers Shoes says the pandemic is the ""worst shock"" the company's suffered since it was founded by his mother in 1971. The company which has always been profitable, has now lost Â£7m over the past five months. ""We went from having 170 stores to no stores, and 1500, 1600 people on furlough"", he says. ""It's about survival and how you come through and how you have a business that can continue to employ as many people as possible, so it was really batten down the hatches ..and really just sort of work hard to make sure we were secure"". The company is now gradually reducing the number of furloughed workers and turnover in the stores is picking up, but Stuart Paver says it's still down 40% from last year. Normally in a recession, he'd expect to lose between 5 and 8% of his turnover. Mr Paver thinks recovery for businesses like his depends on consumer confidence. ""There's still a lot of people that won't venture into town.. we just need those people to become confident and come back in"". What happens when furlough ends?

Conspiracy theories spread,"The huge explosion caused widespread destruction in Beirut port Early reports of the explosion in Beirut's port began circulating on social media moments after the blast. Whilst most of the videos appeared authentic, filmed by residents from their homes, rumours about the cause of the blast were also quickly shared on platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp. So, what misinformation spread online? The videos circulating showed smaller explosions and an initial fire followed by the huge blast, which led to tweets suggesting it had happened at a firework factory. Claims about fireworks seemed plausible at the time, but other viral tweets suggested the event was caused by a nuclear bomb because of the white mushroom-like cloud seen rising in some of the footage. A now-deleted tweet suggesting the explosion was ""atomic"" was shared by a verified Twitter account with over 100,000 followers and racked up thousands of shares and likes. A tweet falsely claims that the explosion in Beirut was ""atomic"" Weapons experts have been quick to point out that had the explosion been caused by a nuclear device, it would have been accompanied by a blinding white flash and a surge of heat that would have severely burned people. Also, mushroom clouds are not unique to nuclear bombs. According to experts, they are a result of the compression of humid air, which condenses water and creates the cloud. In pictures:  Chaos and destruction in Beirut after blast What is ammonium nitrate and how dangerous is it? Lebanon: Why the country is in crisis Unfounded claims continued to spread, blaming the ""nuclear bomb"" on the US, Israel or Hezbollah. These were shared by partisan news sites as well as public figures. Conspiracy theories promoted by far-right groups have also been shared on Facebook, 4chan, Reddit and messaging apps like Telegram, according to research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Messages have mainly focused on false claims that this was an Israeli attack, either a bomb or a missile strike on a Hezbollah weapons depot. False claims circulated online suggesting a missile caused the explosion in Beirut Chloe Colliver, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told BBC News: ""We have seen known disinformation sources, including far-right extremist networks online, spreading unfounded claims about the nature and motivations behind the blast. ""This has included theories trying to tie the explosion to Israel or other nation states."" The authorities in Lebanon and Israel have dismissed suggestions that Israel had anything to do with the incident. Far-right conspiracy theorists, including QAnon supporters, have also started sharing false claims about the explosion on Facebook. They suggest that the attack is related to a ""war between the government and the central banking system"". QAnon is a wide-ranging, unfounded conspiracy theorythat says US President Donald Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media. Photographs of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressing the UN General Assembly in 2018 have been posted on social media amid claims that he is pointing at the site of Tuesday's Beirut explosion. Some social media users are using the images as ""proof"" that Israel had a hand in the blast. The Israeli prime minister at the United Nations in 2018 The images are genuine and not manipulated, but have been taken out of context. Mr Netanyahu is actually pointing to a completely different district in the city of Beirut where he claimed Hezbollah was hiding weapons. The blast site is several kilometres to the north of ""Site 1"" on Mr Netanyahu's map. Rumours about a possible attack picked up steam after President Trump described the event as ""a terrible attack"" at a White House press conference. Research from the Institute for Strategic dialogue has identified his comments being shared and edited by far-right groups on social media to suggest that the blast was a terror attack or bomb. One post on Telegram claimed that Trump said ""it looks like a terrible terrorist attack"". Instead, he actually said it looks like a ""terrible attack"". Posts on social media attributed false quotes to President Trump ""We have also seen claims building off President Trump's statement about the explosion as an 'attack', which has provided fuel to conspiracy and disinformation communities over the past 24 hours, demonstrating the risks of inaccurate language and communications during crisis moments,"" Ms Colliver says. Other posts on social media make unfounded claims that Mr Trump's comments suggested the US was forewarned of the explosion. It's an important reminder that breaking news events are a fertile time for misinformation and speculation online. Think before you share. Additional reporting by Alistair Coleman.

However, the Bank warned of a ""material"" rise in unemployment this year as it held interest rates at 0.1%. Mr Bailey said recent data suggested the recovery in consumer spending was gaining traction, while spending on food and energy bills remained above pre-Covid levels. He said: ""We have had a strong recovery in the last few months. The pace puts the economy ahead of where we thought it would be in May."" However, Mr Bailey cautioned against reading too much into recent figures: ""We don't think the recent past is necessarily a good guide to the immediate future,"" he said. The Bank said spending on leisure and entertainment, which accounts for a fifth of all consumer spending, remained subdued. Business investment was also weak, which would weigh on the recovery. The Bank expects the UK economy to shrink by 9.5% this year. While this would be the biggest annual decline in 100 years, it is not as steep as its initial estimate of a 14% contraction. The Bank said the UK still faced its sharpest recession on record, with the outlook for growth now ""unusually uncertain"". Mr Bailey said it was the ""largest quantum of uncertainty in a forecast"" that policymakers had ever published. The Bank expects the UK economy to grow by 9% in 2021, and 3.5% in 2022, with the economy forecast to get back to its pre-Covid size at the end of 2021. This compares with growth estimates of 15% and 3% respectively,in a scenario the Bank set out in May. Unemployment is expected to almost double from the current rate of 3.9% to 7.5% by the end of the year as government-funded support schemes come to an end. Average earnings are also expected to shrink for the first time since the financial crisis. The Bank said more workers faced a pay cut or freeze in 2020, adding: ""In many cases, bonuses have been scaled back or withdrawn altogether for this year."" Its latest forecasts are based on the assumption that there is no second wave of the virus and that there is a smooth transition to a new EU free trade agreement at the start of 2021. Meanwhile, a fall in energy prices and the temporary VAT cut for hotels, theme parks and other hospitality businesses means the cost of living is expected to barely rise this year. The Bank expects inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), to fall close to zero by the end of 2020, before gradually rising back to its target of 2%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would not even think about raising interest rates until there was ""clear evidence"" the recovery had taken hold. Mr Bailey also signalled that policymakers were against usingnegative interest ratesany time soon, adding that such a move may have unintended consequences. It could stop the UK's already fragile banks from lending, or lead to customers withdrawing their money and holding it in cash. Policymakers also noted that High Street banks would find it difficult to cut savings rates below zero. ""They are part of our toolbox,"" said Mr Bailey. ""But at the moment we do not have a plan to use them."" He said the public may find the policy difficult to understand. ""There would be a lot of explaining to do on what this means, why we're doing it, and what the benefits   would be."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank was likely to increase its money printing programme by a further Â£100bn later this year. She also expects the Bank to keep interest rates at 0.1% ""or below"" for ""at least five years"". Millions of households that already had a variable-rate mortgage have benefitted from recent interest rate cuts. However, the Bank said borrowing had become more expensive over the past six months for first-time buyers and others moving up the property ladder, particularly for people with small deposits. Banks also continued to reduce rates on savings accounts. The average instant-access savings account now pays 0.1% annual interest, compared with 0.4% in February. Lenders said they were restricting credit due to the uncertain economic outlook. One in six mortgages in the UK is currently subject to a payment holiday because of the pandemic. Stuart Paver, the managing director of Pavers Shoes says the pandemic is the ""worst shock"" the company's suffered since it was founded by his mother in 1971. The company which has always been profitable, has now lost Â£7m over the past five months. ""We went from having 170 stores to no stores, and 1500, 1600 people on furlough"", he says. ""It's about survival and how you come through and how you have a business that can continue to employ as many people as possible, so it was really batten down the hatches ..and really just sort of work hard to make sure we were secure"". The company is now gradually reducing the number of furloughed workers and turnover in the stores is picking up, but Stuart Paver says it's still down 40% from last year. Normally in a recession, he'd expect to lose between 5 and 8% of his turnover. Mr Paver thinks recovery for businesses like his depends on consumer confidence. ""There's still a lot of people that won't venture into town.. we just need those people to become confident and come back in"". What happens when furlough ends?

Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masksMillions of respirators will not be used by health workers because they may not fit adequately.UKFrance reaches two-month high in virus casesSpain has also recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus cases in months.EuropeBank of England: Downturn less severe than fearedUK economy is still set for worst performance in 100 years according to the UK's central bank.BusinessComments,"FFP2 respirator masks such as these are used by healthcare workers Fifty million face masks bought by the UK government in April will not be used in the NHS  because of safety concerns. The government says the masks, which use ear-loop fastenings rather than head loops, may not fit tightly enough. They were bought for NHS England healthcare workers from supplier Ayanda Capital as part of a Â£252m contract. Ayanda says the masks met the specifications No 10 had set out. The PM said he was ""disappointed"" that any protective kit should be unfit for use. An earlier government statement said its safety standards process is ""robust"". Tim Horlick, chief executive of Ayanda Capital, insisted the masks were ""not unusable or unsafe"" and had met all government standards, adding that No 10 had ""not wasted any money"" in buying them. It has emerged that the person who originally approached the government about the deal was a government trade adviser who also advises the board of Ayanda. But the adviser told the BBC his position played no part in the awarding of the contract. Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? PPE failings identified by National Audit Office Asked about the masks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very disappointed"" that ""any consignment"" of personal protective equipment (PPE) ""should turn out not to be fit for purpose"". Mr Johnson insisted the government had ""achieved a colossal race against time"" to produce ""billions of items"" of PPE and source them from abroad, adding that supplies are now being stockpiled in the event of a second wave later in the year. In the early weeks of the pandemic the NHS experienced severe shortages of PPE. The government says it had to find new suppliers quickly to meet demand and to compete with rising global competition. The procurement of PPE is devolved across the four nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Welsh and Scottish governments said they have not used Ayanda as a supplier. On 29 April the Department of Health and Social Care signed the Â£252m contract with Ayanda Capital Limited to supply two types of face masks. The most expensive part of the order consisted of 50 million FFP2 respirator masks, which are designed to protect healthcare workers from inhaling harmful particles. The government bought 50 million masks like these with ear loops According to legal papers seen by the BBC, the government says these masks will now not be used in the NHS because of a safety concern about whether they would fit adequately. To be effective these types of face mask need to fit tightly to create a seal between the mask and the wearer's face. Anyone who wears them for work is required to undergo a face-fit test. Alan Murray, chief executive of the British Safety Industry Federation, said products with ear loops fail this test more often than those with head harnesses. It is not clear what will happen now to the 50 million masks. Ayanda Capital also supplied 150 million Type IIR masks, which the government says are unaffected. Most have now been delivered but they have not yet been released for use in the NHS and are awaiting further testing. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""For months, we were told that the government was purchasing the right equipment for the front line. Yet again it hasn't happened. Calling for an inquiry into ""what went wrong"", Sir Keir said the situation was ""just not good enough"" for the NHS workers who needed the protective kit. The information was disclosed in a legal response to the Good Law Project, which is seeking to challenge the government in the courts over three PPE contracts it awarded, including Ayanda Capital's. The campaign group argues the government's awarding of contracts directly to companies during the pandemic, rather than opening them to competition, may have been unlawful. Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project's director, said it was ""important"" for a court to examine the contracts to ensure ""full transparency of how these staggering amounts of public money have been spent"". One procurement expert described the scramble for PPE at the height of the supply crisis as ""like the wild west"". Every leading healthcare system was pressing to secure scarce supplies in the global market as coronavirus infections soared. With fears that PPE might run out at some hospitals, the UK authorities looked everywhere for readily available masks, gowns and visors. A Turkish consignment was found wanting in May and now details of contracts with little known companies signed by the Department of Health in England have emerged. It is understandable that officials facing an unprecedented shortage of vital equipment followed up any offer that looked credible. But the government has to be held accountable for the spending of taxpayers' money and the Good Law project has highlighted deals that raise questions about due process and transparency. The government has also disclosed that the original approach to sell the masks came not from Ayanda Capital but from a businessman called Andrew Mills. His company, Prospermill, had secured the rights to the full production capacity of a large factory in China to produce masks and was able to offer a large quantity almost immediately. But the legal document seen by the BBC notes that Mr Mills requested the government instead sign the contract for the masks with Ayanda Capital, whose board he advises, because it could arrange overseas payment more quickly. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate MAPS AND CHARTS:Is the pandemic getting worse in the US? VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr Mills is also an adviser to the UK Board of Trade. He told the BBC his position played no part in the award of the contract, which was subject to the same evaluation as all offers made in response to the government's request for help. A statement from Ayanda Capital Limited said the masks went through a ""rigorous technical assurance programme"" and could have been rejected through provisions in its contract had they not met government specifications - but those provisions were not activated. Another government contract the Good Law Project is seeking to challenge in the courts is a Â£32m deal with Crisp Websites Limited, trading as Pestfix, to supply isolation suits. In July, No 10 disclosed that none of the suits Pestfix supplied had yet been delivered into the NHS - and instead they were being stored in a Department of Health facility in Daventry awaiting tests. Now the BBC has discovered the pest control company has separately sold respirator masks to commercial clients using certificates from ECM, a test house in Italy which says it is not a notified body for PPE. The British Safety Industry Federation said some companies had been presenting so-called 'voluntary certificates of compliance' from ECM but they added these had ""no value and no standing"" in demonstrating an item of PPE complied with legislation. Pestfix told the BBC they ""unreservedly apologise"" for the compliance issue with certain PPE face masks they had supplied to commercial and private clients. It said it is conducting a ""thorough investigation"" and talking to regulators and affected customers. The government said in its legal response to the Good law Project that Pestfix provided certificates confirming the suits conformed to the technical standards and they were approved accordingly.

Bank of England: Downturn less severe than fearedUK economy is still set for worst performance in 100 years according to the UK's central bank.BusinessComments,"This video can not be played Andrew Bailey says the UK economy has picked up as restrictions are lifted The Governor of the Bank of England has backed the government's decision to end its furlough scheme in October. Andrew Bailey told the BBC it was important that policymakers helped workers ""move forward"" and not keep them in unproductive jobs. He said coronavirus would inevitably mean that some jobs became redundant. The Bank also predicted the economic slump caused by Covid-19 will be less severe than expected, but warned the recovery will also take longer. More than nine million jobs have been furloughed under the government'sjob retention scheme,external, but the Bank expects most people to go back to work as the economy recovers. Trade unions have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the scheme, whichpays a share of workers' wages, to avoid mass job losses. However, Mr Bailey said it was right to focus on helping people to find new jobs. ""It's been a very successful scheme, but he's right to say we have to look forward now,"" he said. ""I don't think we should be locking the economy down in a state that it pre-existed in."" What happens when the furlough scheme ends? Is the UK in a recession?

Facebook and Twitter penalise Trump for virus claim,"A clip from President Trump's Fox News interview was posted to his Facebook page Facebook and Twitter have penalised Donald Trump and his campaign for posts in which the president claimed children were ""almost immune"" to coronavirus. Facebook deleted the post - a clip from an interview Mr Trump gave to Fox News - saying it contained ""harmful Covid misinformation"". Twitter followed by saying it had frozen a Trump campaign account until a tweet of the same clip was removed. US public health advice makes clear children have no immunity to Covid-19. A Facebook spokesperson said on Wednesday evening: ""This video includes false claims that a group of people is immune from COVID-19 which is a violation of our policies around harmful COVID misinformation."" It was the first time the social giant had taken action to remove content posted by the president based on its coronavirus-misinformation policy, but not the first time it has penalised Mr Trump over content on his page. Later on Wednesday, Twitter said it had frozen the @TeamTrump account because it posted the same interview excerpt, which President Trump's account shared. A Twitter spokesman said the @TeamTrump tweet ""is in violation of the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation"". ""The account owner will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again."" It later appeared to have been deleted. Twitter last month temporarily suspended Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, for sharing a clip it said promoted ""misinformation"" about coronavirus and hydroxychloroquine. But in March, Twitter said a tweet by entrepreneur Elon Musk suggesting children are ""essentially immune"" to coronavirus did not break its rules. Elon Musk coronavirus misinformation stays online Speaking by telephone to morning show Fox and Friends on Wednesday, Mr Trump argued it was time for all schools nationwide to reopen. He said: ""If you look at children, children are almost - and I would almost say definitely - almost immune from this disease. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls?

It will go away like things go away.""

Adults - and particularly older adults - are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? The largest study done so far, involving more than 55,000 hospital patients, found that only 0.8% were under the age of 19. Half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were 60 or older as of 31 July,according to a research charity.,external A recent US study of coronavirus cases among 7,780 children from 26 countries found almost one in five patients had no symptoms. Another one in five developed lesions on their lungs during the infection. Some 3.3% were admitted to intensive care units and seven deaths were reported,according to the research from the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio,external. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,externalfound that people under 20 were about half as susceptible to coronavirus infection as those over 20. There have been some extremely rare cases of children developingan inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease, and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus. In June, Facebook said it had removed adverts for President Trump's re-election campaign that featured a symbol used in Nazi Germany. The company said the offending ad contained an inverted red triangle similar to that used by the Nazis to label opponents such as communists. Mr Trump's campaign team said the far-left activist group antifa uses the symbol and it was a reference to them. The ads, which were posted on the site on pages belonging to President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, were online for about 24 hours and had received hundreds of thousands of views before they were taken down. Hundreds of school districts around the country have scrapped plans to reopen as coronavirus infections have spiked in a number of US states. Some 20 of the nation's largest 25 school districts have announced they will start remotely. Among the schools that are not reopening is one attended by the president's son, Barron Trump, in suburban Maryland. St Andrew's Episcopal School said in a letter to parents it would opt instead for virtual learning to protect the health of students, families and staff. Last week Georgia's largest school district, Gwinnett County, returned to school campuses to start planning for autumn reopening. A day later, 260 employees had been told to stay away from their schools because they tested positive for coronavirus, or had been exposed to someone else who had the infection. One of the first school districts in the nation to reopen, near Indianapolis, Indiana, had a student test positive on the first day. The child's parents had sent him to campus, knowing that his test result was pending, schools officials said. Other students who had come within 6ft of the patient for more than 15 minutes were sent home to self-isolate for 14 days. EASY STEPS:What can I do?

Virus drives city dwellers to seek country life,"Lockdown made Joanna Coghlan realise she wanted to move away from her flat near Battersea Power Station When the coronavirus lockdown began, asset manager Joanna Coghlan knew she just had to get out of London and move to the countryside. She had bought a flat in a new development at Battersea Power Station only last year. The complex included restaurants, spas and bars. But when all those closed down because of the pandemic, the reality of her environment dawned on her. ""I spent seven weeks isolated there and realised that I absolutely hated it,"" she told the BBC. ""When you take away all the amenities that these developments advertise, then you realise you're just living in a glass box. ""It was a ghost town. It was just very soul-destroying living in this enormous development with no life going on."" Joanna took swift action to remedy her plight. She moved to the village of Datchworth Green in Hertfordshire, where she now has a five-bedroom house with a garden and a view overlooking a cricket pitch. ""I've got lots of space and it's fantastic,"" she says. Although she and her boyfriend are currently working from home, she is still close enough to be able to go back to the office. ""I can still commute to London, so it makes it more viable if I had to go back to the daily commute, which I don't think I will any time soon,"" she says. There has been a surge of interest in moving to the country due to city dwellers' priorities changing during the coronavirus lockdown, estate agents have said. Across the UK, inquiries about buying a home in a village jumped by 126% in June and July compared with the same period last year, said Rightmove. Estate agent chain Knight Frank reported similar trends. Virtual house hunting gets a pandemic boost House prices 'bounced back in July' In some cities, such as Liverpool and Edinburgh, searches more than doubled, Rightmove said. ""The lure of a new lifestyle, one that is quieter and has an abundance of beautiful countryside and more outdoor space, has led to more city dwellers choosing to become rural residents,"" said Miles Shipside of Rightmove. ""The most popular village moves are still within the same region the home hunters are currently in, as it's likely they'll keep their current job but may have the flexibility to commute less often and set up their working space at home."" Rightmove said the number of inquiries from Liverpool residents looking for a village lifestyle had almost tripled (275%) compared with a year earlier. In Edinburgh, village inquiries are up 205% and in Birmingham they have increased by 186%. The website said some urban home owners may have benefited from strong house price growth over the years, making it possible to now trade up and out to the country. But money does not appear to be the main motive for moving, as average asking prices in villages are often more expensive than in cities. In many cases, the searches show house hunters are looking at villages within commuting distance to their current city, suggesting people are being drawn to the appeal of a quieter way of life. Mark Rimell, director in Strutt & Parker's country house department, said: ""A slower pace of life, outdoor space and tight knit communities come hand in hand with village living - something many have come to appreciate in recent months - and have enduring appeal."" Rightmove's research was released as a separate survey from Barclays Mortgages found that the South West of England, with its rural and coastal communities, is a particularly desirable location for those currently in Birmingham, Nottingham, London, and Manchester. Barclays Mortgages found popular reasons for people wanting to relocate include a bigger garden, being closer to essential services, living where they can exercise easily, being nearer to relatives, and a stronger local community. Dr Peter Brooks, chief behavioural scientist at Barclays, said: ""More outside space and the benefits of being closer to friends and family are high on the 'must have' list for many movers. ""As working from home becomes more commonplace moving cross-country looks to be more achievable for many as there is less of a need to be within a short commute to the office.""

"Facebook and Twitter penalise Trump for virus claimThe social networks say a post of a TV interview Mr Trump gave contained Covid-19 ""misinformation"".US Election 2020Coronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Thursday morning.UK","A clip from President Trump's Fox News interview was posted to his Facebook page Facebook and Twitter have penalised Donald Trump and his campaign for posts in which the president claimed children were ""almost immune"" to coronavirus. Facebook deleted the post - a clip from an interview Mr Trump gave to Fox News - saying it contained ""harmful Covid misinformation"". Twitter followed by saying it had frozen a Trump campaign account until a tweet of the same clip was removed. US public health advice makes clear children have no immunity to Covid-19. A Facebook spokesperson said on Wednesday evening: ""This video includes false claims that a group of people is immune from COVID-19 which is a violation of our policies around harmful COVID misinformation."" It was the first time the social giant had taken action to remove content posted by the president based on its coronavirus-misinformation policy, but not the first time it has penalised Mr Trump over content on his page. Later on Wednesday, Twitter said it had frozen the @TeamTrump account because it posted the same interview excerpt, which President Trump's account shared. A Twitter spokesman said the @TeamTrump tweet ""is in violation of the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation"". ""The account owner will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again."" It later appeared to have been deleted. Twitter last month temporarily suspended Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, for sharing a clip it said promoted ""misinformation"" about coronavirus and hydroxychloroquine.

Mr Trump's campaign team said the far-left activist group antifa uses the symbol and it was a reference to them.

Dancing on Ice pro warns of 'lost generation',"Mark Hanretty partnered Paralympian Libby Clegg in this year's season of Dancing on Ice ITV's Dancing on Ice skater Mark Hanretty has warned the UK risks losing a generation of talent if it does not reopen ice rinks to elite skaters. A plan to open rinks on 1 August waspostponed the day beforehandafter a rise in coronavirus infections. Hanretty said there were ""big concerns"" the sport could lose people, as most professionals train at public rinks. Boris Johnson postponed the reopening of ice rinks for two weeks, and listed them among ""higher risk settings"". ""Until 15 August at the earliest casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and the remaining close contact services must remain closed,"" he said. But while none of those other closures is harming Team GB's future Olympic hopes, the ongoing closure of ice rinks potentially does. Because ice rinks are not something that even the richest athletes can feasibly have at home, many skaters - including those at the top of the sport - routinely train at public rinks. In some cases, they make special arrangements to use the rinks before or after they are open to the public. But these sessions are not available when the rinks are closed to everyone, with no exceptions. Hanretty said this meant the UK was at risk of falling behind other countries at an elite level, and that any further delay could jeopardise the country's chances at next year's World Championships. Hanretty himself won two bronze medals as a pairs skater in the British Championships, and competed at the European and World Championships, before being selected to join the Dancing On Ice team as one of the show's professional skaters. He and his wife Kathy are also ice skating coaches and he said: ""Like many coaches around the country, we're trying to scramble to keep skaters going, We've been without ice rinks now for five months. ""For the competitive elite skaters, it really separates us from the rest of the world now. If we're waiting until September until we can train, it's going to be hard for any British elite competitors to compete. We're losing a generation."" The feeling has been echoed on social media, with the hashtag #OverlookedOlympicSport being shared by figure skaters online. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

British Ice Skating, the national governing body for ice skating in the UK,said the postponement,external""disappointed not only British Ice Skating, but all those that were due to reopen this weekend"". Zoe Briggs is one such competitor who is struggling with being unable to skate. ""I get up at 4am to train every morning, and train after school from 4pm to 8pm,"" the 14-year-old told the BBC. ""It's what I've grown up for years on end doing. It's been so different not doing that, it's so hard."" Coronavirus wedding delay 'heartbreaking' Coronavirus: 'Mum died while we were at dad's funeral' Anime fans 'sobbing' at Olympic ice skating Zoe said she has been continuing her training via Zoom, but it is limited in how much it can help at her level. ""It's worrying because skating is all about muscle memory, letting you jump and glide across the ice. I'm worried not doing that will make the muscle memory disappear."" Zoe was training at the Bracknell Ice Rink before the pandemic ""I've been working a lot on my fitness and my stamina and my flexibility, and we've been doing Zoom meetings with our coaches for hours every day to try and keep it up. ""But it's really affected me mentally. We were told we were able to go back in July but that was pushed back and now we don't know. When I found out the news, I was crying for hours because I just want to get on with skating."" John Hamer is a three-time British national champion figure skater and a skating coach in London. He explained that rinks remaining closed have had a lasting impact on more than just the students. ""Most coaches are self-employed,"" he said. ""And financially it's not been easy, to say the least. I had to ask my dad for money. ""I've lost five or six people for sure that I know aren't coming back - one of them was very competitive. They were there two, three, four times a week having multiple lessons. That probably accounts for a good 20-25% of my competitive business that I know isn't coming back."" Allow Instagram content?

He said there was ""no reason"" ice rinks should remain shut for athletes, particularly when other venues such asswimming pools have been reopened. ""I don't think the government realises how big a deal ice skating is to the nation,"" he said. ""It's like the unsung sport of the country."" He added: ""I honestly don't think you can find a safer sporting venue. If they don't get us back fast, there will be a generation of potential Olympic kids that we have missed out on.""

Rise in care children 'deprived of liberty'BBC News finds a sharp rise in the number of children in care with restrictions placed on their freedom.,"The number of children in care in England and Wales who have restrictions placed on their freedom has tripled in the last two years, BBC News has found. Deprivation of liberty orders are increasingly being used to detain children in homes when suitable accommodation cannot be found. Campaigners say it shows a ""wilful neglect"" of young people at risk of exploitation. The government said supporting vulnerable children ""is a priority"". Deprivation of liberty orders are often used for adults who lack the mental capacity to consent to changes in their care, such as elderly people with Alzheimer's. But BBC News has learned they are increasingly being used for children and young people on safeguarding grounds. The orders can cover a range of restrictions from detention in a house to taking away a mobile phone - and are commonly secured from the High Court or Court of Protection by a local authority in charge of the care of the child. Do you know someone placed on a Deprivation of Liberty order? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Freedom of information responses from 91 of 170 local authorities in England and Wales show the number of deprivation of liberty orders for children and young people went from 43 in 2016-17 to 134 in 2018-19. The vast majority of these will be for children in care. More than a quarter of orders granted over the last five years were made primarily because of concerns about the child or young person going missing, without relating to mental capacity. One recent hearing,externalgranted a deprivation of liberty order for a 13-year-old child to be detained in a rented council house while being cared for by four local authority staff. The order meant the child could be locked in a bedroom at night, stripped of all loose items and restrained if attempting to self-harm, hurt staff or escape. The judgement acknowledged the restrictions were ""draconian"" but said 30 applications for a place in a secure unit or alternative settings had been declined. At another hearing,external, a High Court judge complained of being ""almost drowned out"" by applications at that time and said he was increasingly concerned they were ""operating to bypass"" safeguards provided by secure accommodation. BBC News has learned a 14-year-old victim of so-called modern day slavery had been placed on a deprivation of liberty order and was moved to an unregulated home. This video can not be played BBC News revealed that 14 council investigations have been launched into ""organised and complex abuse"" in unregulated homes Despite being banned from having a mobile phone because of her vulnerability, the girl told a social worker she was given an iPhone and moved between residences across the UK by a company, sometimes without the local authority being informed. The number of children waiting for placements in secure accommodation - residences children are prevented from leaving - hit a peak of 54 open referrals in England, according to records released by the Department for Education following a freedom of information request. BBC News has learned three children have spent more than six months waiting for a secure accommodation placement, and one child had 27 individual referrals declined. The lack of appropriate placements for such children and young people is an ""absolute disgrace"", according to Carolyne Willow, director of the charity Article 39, which campaigns for the rights of children in institutional settings. ""It demonstrates wilful neglect at the highest level and a readiness to permit the decaying of children's services. ""You don't have to be a child welfare expert to be able to imagine the risks of putting an individual child into accommodation where there's no other childrenâ¦ where everything you do is monitored and supervised, where every aspect of ordinary childhood experiences are taken from you."" Such orders ""are meant to be last resort measures, they're not meant to be regular, routine ways of protecting children"", she said. Children as young as 11 placed in unregulated care homes Teens in unregulated homes face 'organised abuse' Investment is needed, not only in secure accommodation, but a range of specialised placements that cater to the dangers now faced by vulnerable children, said Jenny Coles, the President of the Association of Directors of Children's Services. ""The children, young people, that are coming into care over the last three or four years, their needs and their experiences have changed"", she said. ""[These range] from sexual exploitation, criminal exploitation, gangs, county lines. ""If we had that broader range [of placements], that was meeting complexity, we wouldn't have to potentially use those orders as we have been using them."" In a statement, a government spokesperson said: ""Supporting the most vulnerable children in the country is a priority for this government, and every young person in care deserves appropriate, safe accommodation that supports them in the best way possible. ""Local authorities have a duty to make sure there are sufficient places, including secure care, for their looked-after children. ""We have invested Â£40m in supporting councils in England to improve and expand the secure provision available, and we have consulted on radical reforms to the quality of independent and semi-independent placements to make sure the right checks and balances are in place.""

That's all from us on today's coverage of the latest on coronavirus in Scotland. Aberdeen had its first full day of local lockdown, as the
number of coronavirus cases linked to theoutbreak has increased to 79- with more expected in the coming days. An Aberdeen footballer isamong those to have tested positive. Meanwhile... We'll be back tomorrow. Stay safe and have a good evening. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The family of a woman receiving palliative care in a Glasgow
hospice is appealing to the Scottish government to change the rules on
visiting. During lockdown, only two named family members can spend an
hour a day with patients. Kathryn Freedman, whose sister Pauline has an inoperable
brain tumour, says only Paulineâs daughter and mother have seen her since she
was admitted in June. âWe get Covid, we get thereâs precautions theyâve got to take,"" Kathryn said. ""Sheâs on her own all the time.â But now Pauline may only have days left. Kathryn said it is
""inhumane"" to prevent people from saying goodbye. ""It's really frustrating. I feel like it's never ending."" The tightening of lockdown restrictions in Aberdeen has caused disappointment for lots of hospitality workers. Poppy Chisholm-White, who works at the Siberia Bar and Hotel in the city, says she is ""gutted"". ""It's really hard to get your head around when the rest of the country is kind of normal but we're not allowed to see each other,"" the 20-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Read more. Katie HunterBBC Scotland reporter Until recently, a short walk with her daughters would leave
Lucy Van Der Ven short of breath. She developed symptoms consistent with Covid at the end of
March and hasn't fully recovered, and each day can be different. She
describes feeling fine some days, but others being âabsolutely flooredâ. ""I just want to get on with my life,â she added. Campaigners say people across the UK are reporting longer term problems linked to coronavirus. The Long Covid SOS group is calling for recognition, research and rehabilitation. Dr Tom Fardon, a respiratory consultant for NHS Tayside, said: âWhat seems to be the main problem is a post viral syndrome of fatigue, breathlessness, pain."" He calls for investment in physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychology services. Some people not admitted to hospital say they have struggled to get medical help. The Scottish government said it is developing a rehabilitation framework, clinical guidelines and directly funding research. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: âThere is rehab for those who develop longer term conditionsâ¦ They will be able to access that either through a referral from their hospital team or from their GP.â Jemma Reekie (left) and Laura Muir (right) are both aiming for Olympic selection Laura Muir says becoming housemates with Jemma Reekie during lockdown has benefited them both - despite losing to her training partner in Italy. Reekie, 22, edged out Muir over 800m on Sunday having already done so in setting a British best in February. Both are coached by Andy Young and Reekie moving into Muir's Glasgow home has allowed them to train side-by-side. ""We knew we'd train really well together and motivate each other,"" European 1500m champion Muir said. Read more. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said any ""genuine individual injustices"" over exam results will be ""rectified"" through the appeals process. There was criticism after thousands of students received lower grades than had been estimated by their teachers. Ms Sturgeon said she understood the ""anger and upset"" felt by young people. She encouraged those feeling aggrieved to lodge appeals, which would be based on ""individual merit"" rather than ""statistical moderation"". Scottish students received the results for their Nationals, Highers and Advanced Higher courses on Tuesday. Read more here. The Scottish government says there are now 79 coronavirus caseslinked to the Aberdeen cluster. Aberdeen City's latest population estimate is 228,670, giving an infection rate of 34.5 per 100,000 people. This compares to a rate of 78.6 in Blackburn with Darwen, which is at the top of theUK government's local authority Covid-19 watchlist,external. The population of Blackburn with Darwen is just under 150,000. Aberdeen's infection rate is similar to Pendle (38.3) and Trafford (32.6) and would come in at number eight if it were included in the UK government's England watchlist. There are 27 local authorities on the list. The positive cases rate for the whole of Scotland over the last week was 4.6 per 100,000 people. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland A leading scientist has said a second wave is likely to happen - but several outbreaks might. Prof Hugh Pennington warned on Drivetime that coming out of lockdown too early and if people ""don't behave themselves"", repeats of the situation in Aberdeen could keep happening. He warned a pattern of repeated outbreaks may go one for ""quite a long time"". A patient described as one of the sickest ever to survive Covid-19 has left hospital. Prof Grant McIntyre, who is clinical director of Dundee Dental Hospital, spent a total of 128 days in hospital - at Ninewells in Dundee and Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where he received specialist ECMO treatment - to sustain blood oxygenation levels, like an
artificial lung. Prof Grant had been the last remaining
patient in the intensive care unit at Ninewells. âWhen I fell ill at the end of March, I
did not know that Covid-19 would leave me fighting for life over a period of 50
days on ECMO life support in Aberdeen and that I would lose 26kg in weight,"" he said. ""Iâm
told that I am the âsickest survivorâ of Covid-19 in Tayside."" Across Scotland, a further 67 positive tests were announced. However, no new deaths were recorded for the 21st consecutive day. A further five people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, according to NHS England. In Wales, another three people have died after testing positive, and 15 more cases were recorded. There were 43 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. No new deaths were reported.

A recovery plan for tourism businesses drawn up by researchers at Edinburgh University suggests targeting visitors from Germany - and from other parts of the UK. The team at the university's business school tried to identify who would be most interested in seeing Scotland, and who could afford a trip here. The project was carried out in association with the Edinburgh Tourism Action Group (ETAG). Team leader Dr Ewelina Lacka said: ""We used data from internet search engines, consumer confidence indexes, web traffic and information from members of the ETAG to help build a strong picture of where marketing is best targeted in the weeks and months ahead."" SQA chief Fiona Robertson defended the emergency arrangements to MSPs in May The chief of Scotland's exams body will be grilled by MSPs after it downgraded the results of thousands of pupils. SQA chief executive Fiona Robertson will answer questions at Holyrood's education committee next Wednesday. Many pupils have spoken of their disappointment at being given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams, with some claiming they have suffered because they are from less affluent areas. Opposition politicians have warned that there will now be a ""deluge"" of appeals, and accused the SQA of treating the professional judgement of teachers with ""contempt"" by changing so many grades. The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system. The UK economy faces a less severe downturn than feared, according to the Bank of England. Initial estimates suggested the UK economy would contract by 14% in 2020 - now, in its first official forecasts since the pandemic hit, the Bank expects the economy to shrink by 9.5%. While the new forecast is less severe, this would still be the biggest annual decline in 100 years. Read our full storyhere. NHS Grampian has apologised to some pub owners in Aberdeen after a list of venues potentially affected by Covid-19 was published before they had been contacted. The health board says names of the premises, which had been visited by individuals with the virus, was shared in the interests of openness and transparency and was not meant to assign blame. It admitted the mistake has led to ""a great deal of anxiety for those businesses, their staff and their customers"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

About 200 coaches have been driven through Edinburgh with their horns honking to raise awareness of the struggling coach industry. The ""Honk for Hope"" procession was set up by coach operators to call for more support from the Scottish government in light of coronavirus lockdown measures. The procession left from Portobello, went through the city centre and ended with a rally in Kirknewton. Three similar events have taken place elsewhere in the UK. About 20 coaches in the procession drove past the Scottish Parliament building where a piper played a lament. Â© 2025 BBC.

Virus drives spike in demand for village lifeEstate agents have seen a surge in interest in moving to the country from people in cities.Business,"Lockdown made Joanna Coghlan realise she wanted to move away from her flat near Battersea Power Station When the coronavirus lockdown began, asset manager Joanna Coghlan knew she just had to get out of London and move to the countryside. She had bought a flat in a new development at Battersea Power Station only last year. The complex included restaurants, spas and bars. But when all those closed down because of the pandemic, the reality of her environment dawned on her. ""I spent seven weeks isolated there and realised that I absolutely hated it,"" she told the BBC. ""When you take away all the amenities that these developments advertise, then you realise you're just living in a glass box. ""It was a ghost town. It was just very soul-destroying living in this enormous development with no life going on."" Joanna took swift action to remedy her plight. She moved to the village of Datchworth Green in Hertfordshire, where she now has a five-bedroom house with a garden and a view overlooking a cricket pitch. ""I've got lots of space and it's fantastic,"" she says. Although she and her boyfriend are currently working from home, she is still close enough to be able to go back to the office. ""I can still commute to London, so it makes it more viable if I had to go back to the daily commute, which I don't think I will any time soon,"" she says. There has been a surge of interest in moving to the country due to city dwellers' priorities changing during the coronavirus lockdown, estate agents have said. Across the UK, inquiries about buying a home in a village jumped by 126% in June and July compared with the same period last year, said Rightmove. Estate agent chain Knight Frank reported similar trends. Virtual house hunting gets a pandemic boost House prices 'bounced back in July' In some cities, such as Liverpool and Edinburgh, searches more than doubled, Rightmove said. ""The lure of a new lifestyle, one that is quieter and has an abundance of beautiful countryside and more outdoor space, has led to more city dwellers choosing to become rural residents,"" said Miles Shipside of Rightmove. ""The most popular village moves are still within the same region the home hunters are currently in, as it's likely they'll keep their current job but may have the flexibility to commute less often and set up their working space at home."" Rightmove said the number of inquiries from Liverpool residents looking for a village lifestyle had almost tripled (275%) compared with a year earlier. In Edinburgh, village inquiries are up 205% and in Birmingham they have increased by 186%. The website said some urban home owners may have benefited from strong house price growth over the years, making it possible to now trade up and out to the country. But money does not appear to be the main motive for moving, as average asking prices in villages are often more expensive than in cities. In many cases, the searches show house hunters are looking at villages within commuting distance to their current city, suggesting people are being drawn to the appeal of a quieter way of life. Mark Rimell, director in Strutt & Parker's country house department, said: ""A slower pace of life, outdoor space and tight knit communities come hand in hand with village living - something many have come to appreciate in recent months - and have enduring appeal."" Rightmove's research was released as a separate survey from Barclays Mortgages found that the South West of England, with its rural and coastal communities, is a particularly desirable location for those currently in Birmingham, Nottingham, London, and Manchester. Barclays Mortgages found popular reasons for people wanting to relocate include a bigger garden, being closer to essential services, living where they can exercise easily, being nearer to relatives, and a stronger local community. Dr Peter Brooks, chief behavioural scientist at Barclays, said: ""More outside space and the benefits of being closer to friends and family are high on the 'must have' list for many movers. ""As working from home becomes more commonplace moving cross-country looks to be more achievable for many as there is less of a need to be within a short commute to the office.""

Facebook and Twitter target Trump over virus claim,"A clip from President Trump's Fox News interview was posted to his Facebook page Facebook and Twitter have penalised Donald Trump and his campaign for posts in which the president claimed children were ""almost immune"" to coronavirus. Facebook deleted the post - a clip from an interview Mr Trump gave to Fox News - saying it contained ""harmful Covid misinformation"". Twitter followed by saying it had frozen a Trump campaign account until a tweet of the same clip was removed. US public health advice makes clear children have no immunity to Covid-19. A Facebook spokesperson said on Wednesday evening: ""This video includes false claims that a group of people is immune from COVID-19 which is a violation of our policies around harmful COVID misinformation."" It was the first time the social giant had taken action to remove content posted by the president based on its coronavirus-misinformation policy, but not the first time it has penalised Mr Trump over content on his page. Later on Wednesday, Twitter said it had frozen the @TeamTrump account because it posted the same interview excerpt, which President Trump's account shared. A Twitter spokesman said the @TeamTrump tweet ""is in violation of the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation"". ""The account owner will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again."" It later appeared to have been deleted. Twitter last month temporarily suspended Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, for sharing a clip it said promoted ""misinformation"" about coronavirus and hydroxychloroquine. But in March, Twitter said a tweet by entrepreneur Elon Musk suggesting children are ""essentially immune"" to coronavirus did not break its rules. Elon Musk coronavirus misinformation stays online Speaking by telephone to morning show Fox and Friends on Wednesday, Mr Trump argued it was time for all schools nationwide to reopen. He said: ""If you look at children, children are almost - and I would almost say definitely - almost immune from this disease. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How pods and zutors are changing home-schooling Coronanomics: 'I'm just looking for whatever I can get' ""So few, they've got stronger, hard to believe, I don't know how you feel about it, but they've got much stronger immune systems than we do somehow for this. ""And they don't have a problem, they just don't have a problem."" Mr Trump, who is running for re-election in November, also said of coronavirus: ""This thing's going away. It will go away like things go away."" This video can not be played Reopening US schools ""makes our kids guinea pigs"" Children can catch and transmit the virus, but they run an extremely low risk of becoming ill from it. Adults - and particularly older adults - are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? The largest study done so far, involving more than 55,000 hospital patients, found that only 0.8% were under the age of 19. Half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were 60 or older as of 31 July,according to a research charity.,external A recent US study of coronavirus cases among 7,780 children from 26 countries found almost one in five patients had no symptoms. Another one in five developed lesions on their lungs during the infection. Some 3.3% were admitted to intensive care units and seven deaths were reported,according to the research from the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio,external. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,externalfound that people under 20 were about half as susceptible to coronavirus infection as those over 20. There have been some extremely rare cases of children developingan inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease, and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus. In June, Facebook said it had removed adverts for President Trump's re-election campaign that featured a symbol used in Nazi Germany. The company said the offending ad contained an inverted red triangle similar to that used by the Nazis to label opponents such as communists. Mr Trump's campaign team said the far-left activist group antifa uses the symbol and it was a reference to them. The ads, which were posted on the site on pages belonging to President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, were online for about 24 hours and had received hundreds of thousands of views before they were taken down. Hundreds of school districts around the country have scrapped plans to reopen as coronavirus infections have spiked in a number of US states. Some 20 of the nation's largest 25 school districts have announced they will start remotely. Among the schools that are not reopening is one attended by the president's son, Barron Trump, in suburban Maryland. St Andrew's Episcopal School said in a letter to parents it would opt instead for virtual learning to protect the health of students, families and staff. Last week Georgia's largest school district, Gwinnett County, returned to school campuses to start planning for autumn reopening. A day later, 260 employees had been told to stay away from their schools because they tested positive for coronavirus, or had been exposed to someone else who had the infection. One of the first school districts in the nation to reopen, near Indianapolis, Indiana, had a student test positive on the first day. The child's parents had sent him to campus, knowing that his test result was pending, schools officials said. Other students who had come within 6ft of the patient for more than 15 minutes were sent home to self-isolate for 14 days. EASY STEPS:What can I do?

Beirut officials under house arrest after blast,"This video can not be played ""Now I'm shaking, all the way from up to down"" A number of Beirut port officials are being placed under house arrest pending an investigation into Tuesday's huge explosion, Lebanon's government says. The blast killed at least 135 people and injured more than 4,000 others. A two-week state of emergency has begun. President Michel Aoun said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse. Customs chief Badri Daher said his agency called for the chemical to be removed, but ""this did not happen"". ""We leave it to the experts to determine the reasons,"" he said. Ammonium nitrate is used as a fertiliser in agriculture and as an explosive. Opening an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday, President Aoun said: ""No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city"". Specialists at the University of Sheffield in the UK estimate that the blast had about one tenth of the explosive power ofthe atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshimaduring World War Two and was ""unquestionably one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in history"". The ammonium nitrate had reportedly been in a warehouse in Beirut port for six years after it was unloaded from a ship impounded in 2013. The head of Beirut port and the head of the customs authority both told local media that they had written to the judiciary several times asking that the chemical be exported or sold on to ensure port safety. Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV that they had been aware that the material was dangerous when a court first ordered it stored in the warehouse, ""but not to this degree"". This video can not be played Mother in labour during Beirut blast Lebanon's Supreme Defence Council has vowed that those found responsible will face the ""maximum punishment"" possible. Economy Minister Raoul Nehme told the BBC: ""I think it is incompetence and really bad management and there are a lot of responsibilities from management and probably previous governments. We do not intend after such an explosion to stay silent on who is responsible for what."" House arrest would apply for all port officials ""who have handled the affairs of storing [the] ammonium nitrate, guarding it and handling its paperwork"" since June 2014, Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad said. This video can not be played Rami Ruhayem has been to Gemmayze, the closest residential area to the port The ammonium nitrate arrived on a Moldovan-flagged ship, the Rhosus, which entered Beirut port after suffering technical problems during its voyage from Georgia to Mozambique, according to Shiparrested.com, which deals with shipping-related legal cases. The Rhosus was inspected, banned from leaving and was shortly afterwards abandoned by its owners, sparking several legal claims. Its cargo was stored in a port warehouse for safety reasons, the report said. By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor Volunteers have poured onto the streets of Beirut to help clear up the devastation while others have been visiting the worst affected areas in a state of shock. The government has been promising a full and transparent investigation and told the military to put those responsible for storing the vast quantity of ammonium nitrate under house arrest. But Beirutis have been unimpressed, seeing it as another attempt by the political elite to dodge the blame for disaster. Instead, they are demanding full accountability. Many on social media have welcomed the generosity of those offering help from around the world, but have asked people to avoid making any donations through the government, which they now regard as terminally corrupt and incompetent. IN PICTURES:Chaos and destruction AMMONIUM NITRATE:What is it? How dangerous is it? Q&A:What we know THE CONTEXT:Why Lebanon is in crisis Security forces have sealed off a wide area around the blast site, and rescuers have been looking for bodies and survivors under rubble while boats searched the waters off the coast. Tens of people are still missing. Public Health Minister Hamad Hassan said Lebanon's health sector was short of beds and lacked the equipment necessary to treat the injured and care for patients in critical condition. He said a ""large number of children"" had been rescued but added that he feared that the number of dead would rise further. The Saint Georges hospital near the site of the explosion was badly damaged and several members of staff were killed. Three Beirut hospitals were closed with two others only partially operational, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. The body said it would airlift medical supplies to Lebanon on Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, many buildings and homes have been reduced to an uninhabitable mess of glass and as many as 300,000 people have been left homeless, Beirut's governor Marwan Aboud said. He told the BBC: ""Beirut needs food, Beirut needs clothes, houses, materials to rebuild houses. Beirut needs a place for the refugees, for its people."" The explosion devastated Beirut's port area A number of countries have offered humanitarian assistance. Three French planes are due to arrive carrying 55 rescuers, medical equipment and a mobile clinic equipped to treat 500 people, and President Emmanuel Macron will visit on Thursday. The EU, Russia, Tunisia, Turkey, Iran and Qatar are all sending relief supplies.The UK is also ready to send medical experts and humanitarian aid, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. Common industrial chemical used mainly as fertiliser in agriculture Also one of the main components in explosives used in mining Not explosive on its own, ignites only under the right circumstances When it explodes, it can release toxic gases including nitrogen oxides and ammonia gas Strict rules on how to store it safely: site has to be fire-proofed, and not have any drains, pipes or other channels in which ammonium nitrate could build up The explosion comes at a sensitive time for Lebanon. With Covid-19 infections on the rise, hospitals were already struggling to cope. Now, they are faced with treating thousands of injured people. The country is also going through the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, and tensions were already high with street demonstrations against the government. People have to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare. About 300,000 people have had to leave damaged homes Lebanon imports most of its food and large quantities of grain stored in the port have been destroyed causing fears of widespread food insecurity to come. The future of the port itself is in doubt due to the destruction caused. President Aoun announced that the government would release 100 billion lira (Â£50.5m; $66m) of emergency funds but the impact of the blast on the economy is expected to be long-lasting. The explosion happened close to the scene of a huge car bombing which killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005. A verdict in the trial of four men accused of orchestrating the attack was due on Friday at a special court in the Netherlands, but this has been postponed until 18 August out of respect for the victims of Tuesday's blast.

But when all those closed down because of the pandemic, the reality of her environment dawned on her. ""I spent seven weeks isolated there and realised that I absolutely hated it,"" she told the BBC. ""When you take away all the amenities that these developments advertise, then you realise you're just living in a glass box. ""It was a ghost town. It was just very soul-destroying living in this enormous development with no life going on."" Joanna took swift action to remedy her plight. She moved to the village of Datchworth Green in Hertfordshire, where she now has a five-bedroom house with a garden and a view overlooking a cricket pitch. ""I've got lots of space and it's fantastic,"" she says. Although she and her boyfriend are currently working from home, she is still close enough to be able to go back to the office. ""I can still commute to London, so it makes it more viable if I had to go back to the daily commute, which I don't think I will any time soon,"" she says. There has been a surge of interest in moving to the country due to city dwellers' priorities changing during the coronavirus lockdown, estate agents have said. Across the UK, inquiries about buying a home in a village jumped by 126% in June and July compared with the same period last year, said Rightmove. Estate agent chain Knight Frank reported similar trends. Virtual house hunting gets a pandemic boost House prices 'bounced back in July' In some cities, such as Liverpool and Edinburgh, searches more than doubled, Rightmove said. ""The lure of a new lifestyle, one that is quieter and has an abundance of beautiful countryside and more outdoor space, has led to more city dwellers choosing to become rural residents,"" said Miles Shipside of Rightmove. ""The most popular village moves are still within the same region the home hunters are currently in, as it's likely they'll keep their current job but may have the flexibility to commute less often and set up their working space at home."" Rightmove said the number of inquiries from Liverpool residents looking for a village lifestyle had almost tripled (275%) compared with a year earlier. In Edinburgh, village inquiries are up 205% and in Birmingham they have increased by 186%. The website said some urban home owners may have benefited from strong house price growth over the years, making it possible to now trade up and out to the country. But money does not appear to be the main motive for moving, as average asking prices in villages are often more expensive than in cities. In many cases, the searches show house hunters are looking at villages within commuting distance to their current city, suggesting people are being drawn to the appeal of a quieter way of life. Mark Rimell, director in Strutt & Parker's country house department, said: ""A slower pace of life, outdoor space and tight knit communities come hand in hand with village living - something many have come to appreciate in recent months - and have enduring appeal."" Rightmove's research was released as a separate survey from Barclays Mortgages found that the South West of England, with its rural and coastal communities, is a particularly desirable location for those currently in Birmingham, Nottingham, London, and Manchester. Barclays Mortgages found popular reasons for people wanting to relocate include a bigger garden, being closer to essential services, living where they can exercise easily, being nearer to relatives, and a stronger local community. Dr Peter Brooks, chief behavioural scientist at Barclays, said: ""More outside space and the benefits of being closer to friends and family are high on the 'must have' list for many movers. ""As working from home becomes more commonplace moving cross-country looks to be more achievable for many as there is less of a need to be within a short commute to the office.""

TikTok to open $500m data centre in Ireland,"TikTok has said it plans to build a $500m (Â£375m) data centre in Ireland. It will store videos, messages and other data generated by European users from the short-form video-sharing app. Until now all of its users' records were stored in the US, with a back-up copy held in Singapore. The announcement comes at a time when President Trump has threatened to ban the app in the US on the grounds its Chinese ownership makes it a national security risk. TikTok's Beijing-based parent company Bytedance denies the charge. However, it is in talks to sell its US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand operations to Microsoft. Like many social media apps, TikTok gathers a wide range of information about its users.Its privacy statement says this covers,external: users' ages, passwords, email addresses and phone numbers phone numbers in their address books and social network contacts geo-location logs including GPS coordinates and internet protocol (IP) addresses - although the app says it does not collect the GPS coordinates of EU-based users details about their devices including the operating system used, handset model and other unique identifiers comments, photos and videos they have posted or at least part-prepared browsing and search histories within the app web browsing data that takes place outside the app and is gathered via cookies and other technologies payment information data obtained from third-party services and publicly available sources keystroke patterns and screen tap rhythms exhibited while using a computer and/or smartphone that are particular to each user The data is collected to target advertisements, and help tailor its powerful algorithm. But critics say that the Chinese Communist Party could demand access under its National Intelligence Law. While the Chinese version of the app, Douyin, holds its records within mainland China, TikTok says it keeps all its user data separate and does not give the Chinese government access. Given the Trump administration's recent actions, the existing company is unlikely to carry on storing the information within the US. But the firm said that the decision to set up a European centre was something it had been thinking about ""for a long time"". ""It's a significant investment,"" Theo Bertram, the app's director of public policy for Europe, told the BBC. ""It's a symbol of our long-term commitment to Europe, and I think that's an important message for our users and our creators at this time."" The firm said it should create hundreds of new jobs when it goes into operation at an undisclosed location in between 18 to 24 months time. Microsoft's TikTok grab: Inspired or naive? Call for TikTok security check before HQ decision What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat The decision to base it in Ireland does not, however, mean London is out of the running to host the app's global HQ. There has been speculation as to why TikTok is in talks to sell parts of its business outside of the US. On the one hand, it had seemed odd that the deal covered all members of the Five Eyes security alliance except the UK. On the other, Australia's Prime Minister has said a review by its security agencies found that TikTok did not pose serious national security concerns, and therefore no case for a local ban. TikTok says that the reason it is in talks to sell its operations in Australia, Canada and New Zealand is because they were currently managed along with the US as a single region under the same executive. Mr Bertram also acknowledged there had been calls for the UK's security services to review the app, and said TikTok would be willing to let its source code and algorithm be inspected if requested. ""We welcome scrutiny,"" he said. ""If the way that we're judged is for the security services to carry out a factual review of what we are doing, we're happy with that. We don't have anything to hide."" Microsoft's TikTok grab: Inspired or naive?

Blondie duo's song rights sold in 'Atomic' deal,"Hit songwriting duo Debbie Harry and Chris Stein, the musical partnership behind Blondie's biggest successes, have sold their future royalties to a fast-growing investment fund. That means their income from 197 Blondie songs, including Heart of Glass and Rapture, now goes to the Hipgnosis Songs Fund. They received an undisclosed lump sum. Founded by music industry veteran Merck Mercuriadis, the fund allows investors to see an income from music royalties. It has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since July 2018. Before setting up the fund, which now controls about 13,000 songs, Mr Mercuriadis managed artists including BeyoncÃ©, Elton John, Iron Maiden and Guns N' Roses. In his view, songs are ""as investible as gold or oil"". ""I have followed every move that Debbie and Chris have made since day one,"" he said. ""Their singles have been not only massively successful but era and genre-defining."" Debbie Harry and Chris Stein said they were ""happy to be working with a progressive company"". Ina BBC interview last year, Mr Mercuriadis explained how his fund turns songs into investment vehicles. ""We don't speculate on new songs. The proven hit songs that we buy have predictable and reliable income streams and a track record that goes back many years,"" he said. ""We actively manage the songs better than they've been managed previously,"" he added. ""We treat each song as if it was a business in its own right."" That means maximising the opportunities for that song to generate income, whether in TV commercials and video games or in cover versions by new artists. Hipgnosis has repeatedly captivated the music industry by snapping up works by songwriters old and new. Earlier this week, it announced that it had acquired the worldwide royalties from more than 900 Barry Manilow songs. Giventhe trend for songs to have multiple authors, the fund often does not own a song outright, but merely has a stake in it. However, that has not stopped it from amassing more than $1bn worth of song rights. Can hit songs be worth more than gold?
