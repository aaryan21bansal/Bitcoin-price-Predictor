Probe into Bulger killer's ID 'breach',"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger A potential breach of a court order which prevents the identification of one of James Bulger's killers is being investigated, the Attorney General's Office has confirmed. Jon Venables, now 35, was convicted of killing two-year-old James in Merseyside in 1993, along with Robert Thompson. The pair were released in 2001. There is a worldwide ban on publishing anything revealing their current identities. A spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said: ""We have received a complaint that the anonymity order has been breached and we are investigating."" A High Court injunction prohibits the publication of any images or information claiming to identify or locate the pair- even if it is not actually them. The order also covers material published on the internet. In 2013 two men who published photographs on Twitter and Facebook said to show the killers of James Bulgerreceived suspended jail sentencesfor being in contempt of court. Venables wasrecalled to prisonlast month after being suspected of having child abuse images on his computer. It is the second time he has been sent back to jail for the same suspected offence. He was first recalled in 2010, following his release in 2001 after serving eight years for the murder of James, aged two, in 1993. James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 On 12 February 1993, James - just a few weeks before his third birthday - was reported missing by his mother from outside a butcher's shop in the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle, Merseyside. CCTV images revealed he had been lured away by Venables and Thompson, both then aged 10. His body was found two days later on a railway line. Thompson and Venables were arrested and charged within days. They were both convicted at Preston Crown Court of James's murder, in November 1993. In 2001, the pair were released - with new identities - from secure children's homes on life licence, meaning they can be recalled at any time.

Although his father - a flight lieutenant in the RAF - was a trumpeter in his spare time, it was his mother who ignited his love of pop music. An avid record collector, she brought home music by artists such as Elvis Presley and Bill Haley and supported Sir Elton throughout his career. But they fell out over a ""petty"" argument in 2008, when Sir Elton asked her to sever ties with two old friends, Bob Halley and John Reid. Mr Halley had worked for Sir Elton for three decades, first as a driver then later as a personal assistant, before he resigned as part of a series of changes Sir Elton was making to his team. Mr Reid, who had been Sir Elton's manager and briefly his lover, helped the musician become one of the world's most famous - and richest - performers, but they too fell out. Sir Elton and David Furnish, pictured here last month, have two children together ""I told him: 'I'm not about to do that and drop them,'""Ms Farebrother told the Daily Mail,external. ""Then to my utter amazement, he told me he hated me. And he then banged the phone down. Imagine! To me, his mother!"" Ms Farebrother told the newspaper at the time that she had never met her grandsons Zachary and Elijah, who Sir Elton and his partner David Furnish fathered through IVF with an American surrogate mother. For her 90th birthday, Ms Farebrother hired an Elton John tribute act to perform. Her son got in touch soon after, sending her white orchids to celebrate the milestone. Allow Instagram content?

Reprieve for 'death row' army dogs,"One of the dogs, Dazz, was featured in MoD publicity shots at the Defence Animal Centre Two retired army dogs which faced being destroyed because they were too aggressive to rehome have been saved, the BBC understands. Kevin and Dazz, both Belgian shepherds, were deployed in Afghanistan and were retired from frontline service in 2013. The dogs are based at the Defence Animal Centre in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Foreign Office MinisterSir Alan Duncan wrote to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) on Friday to call for a reprieve. The MoD has assured their dog handlers that they could be saved. A third animal, a police dog named Driver, who was also at risk, could also be rehomed. More stories from across the East Midlands Sir Alan, the MP for Melton and Rutland and Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, said: ""It is very good news, as long as they have a good home, which also guarantees safety for people. ""We are all happy for Kevin and Dazz and also good luck to Driver."" He said they were ""hero dogs who have fought fearlessly alongside our soldiers"" and any danger to people ""must be proven"". The dogs have been trained to show aggression which makes rehoming difficult Former soldier turned author Andy McNab launched an online petition, which has more than 370,000 signatures and will be delivered to the centre in Melton Mowbray. ""Service dogs have saved my life on numerous occasions,"" he said. ""Dogs like Kevin, Dazz, and Driver are an asset when they are serving but they are even more of an asset when they are retired."" The Belgian shepherds went on patrol with troops in Afghanistan and were used for their aggression. The MoD had said: ""Wherever possible, we endeavour to re-home them [dogs] at the end of their service life. ""Sadly, there are some occasions where this is not possible.""

'Millions misspent' during Mandela funeral,"Four years have passed since South African hero Nelson Mandela died South Africa's corruption watchdog has found officials misused millions of dollars during Nelson Mandela's funeral four years ago. According to the report, 300m rand ($22m; Â£16m) was redirected from a development fund to help with costs. It had been earmarked for things like ""sanitation, the replacement of mud schools and the refurbishment of hospitals,"" the report stated. Instead, the authorities allegedly spent it on items like $24 T-shirts. The man who destroyed apartheid Nelson Mandela's state funeral: In pictures Allegations of misuse first emerged in 2014, months after Mr Mandela's funeral in Qunu, Eastern Cape, in December 2013, which was attended by heads of state from around the world. Now, nearly four years after Mr Mandela's death at the age of 95, the country's public protector, Busi Mkhwebane, has asked President Jacob Zuma to pursue the allegations further using the special investigations unit. The 300-page report describes how officials in the Eastern Cape pocketed funds, ignored basic rules, and inflated costs. Mr Mandela spent 27 years in prison after being charged with trying to overthrow the apartheid government Ms Mkhwebane described the failure to follow regulations on the spending of public money as ""very scary"" and ""appalling"",according to South Africa's Mail&Guardian newspaper.,external ""It is very concerning that we can use a funeral to do such things,"" she told a press conference. ""How do you charge or escalate prices or even send an invoice for something you have not delivered?"" Ms Mkhwebane said disorganisation had a role to play in the misuse, but also hit out at how South Africa's ruling ANC party had apparently issued instructions to officials on how the money should be spent. ""There are invoices we are showing with letterheads from the ANC. And monies were paid but again services were not rendered,"" she was quoted as saying bySouth Africa's EyeWitness News.,external She added: ""We are hopeful whoever has committed these acts will be taken to task."" This is not the first scandal to surround official events commemorating the apartheid struggle hero's life. The man tasked with providing a sign language interpretation at the memorial servicewas accused of making up gestures, whilea fight for control over Mandela's legacy within his own familymired the last months of his life.

Anger as Trump shrinks Utah monuments,"President Donald Trump has dramatically scaled back two public outdoor parks, or national monuments, in Utah. He declared an 85% cut to the state's 1.3m acre Bears Ears National Monument and a 50% cut to its 1.9m acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Native American tribes and environmental groups say they will file lawsuits against the policy. But it will be welcomed by ranchers and business interests who view such monuments as federal land grabs. Speaking in the capitol building in Salt Lake City, Mr Trump said: ""Some people think the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington. ""And guess what, they're wrong,"" Mr Trump said. The fight for Utah's national monuments He said former presidents had ""severely abused"" the law by declaring swathes of territory off limits to drilling, mining, grazing, road traffic and other activities. This video can not be played Is Trump threatening the US wilderness? Mr Trump said: ""I've come to Utah to take a very historic action, to reverse federal over-reach and to restore the rights of this land to your citizens."" During his visit to Utah, the president does not plan to visit either scenic area, White House officials say. Environmental groups reacted angrily to Mr Trump's announcement. ""This is a shameful and illegal attack on our nation's protected lands"", said Jamie Clark, the chief executive of Defenders of Wildlife, a non-profit organisation. ""It's not surprising that the Trump administration moved to sell out our national monuments. What is surprising is that they seem to think they can get away with it. We'll be seeing President Trump in court"", he said. Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said: ""Public lands are to be managed for the public, not plundered by private interests that want to make billions off public resources. This action is unprecedented and will end up in court."" Outdoor clothing company Patagonia have also said they will take legal action. On Monday night, a message on their website said: ""The President Stole Your Land. This is the largest elimination of protected land in American history."" Native American tribes people who consider Bears Ears sacred are also planning to sue the administration. ""We will be fighting back immediately,"" said Natalie Landreth, a lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund. ""All five tribes will be standing together united to defend Bears Ears."" The Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo of Zuni, Ute Mountain and Ute Indians form a commission that administrates the territory, which is rich in cultural antiquities and Native American ruins. Jonathan Nez, Vice-President of the Navajo Nation, said: ""This is a sad day for indigenous people and for America. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""However, we are resilient and refuse to allow President Trump's unlawful decision to discourage us. ""We will continue to fight in honour of our ancestral warriors who fought for our way of life, for our culture and for our land, too."" On Saturday thousands of protesters - including Native Americans dressed in ceremonial headdresses - rallied in Salt Lake City against Mr Trump's action. Mr Trump's Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, said earlier that the president's aim in reversing the park's federally protected status was ""about giving rural America a voice"". He added that ""public land is for the public to use and not special interests"". Bear Ears National Monument was declared by President Barack Obama in December 2016, near to the end of his presidency. Unlike a national park, which requires an act of Congress, a national monument can be designated by any sitting president under the 1906 Antiquities Act. Analysis by James Cook, BBC News, Salt Lake City In the United States, the struggle for control between Washington and the West is not quite as old as the hills but it goes back a long, long way. Resentment of the federal government runs deep in many states, not least in Utah, with its majority Mormon population. Tens of thousands of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints settled here after being driven out of Ohio, Missouri and Illinois. The land was not empty. Archaeologists estimate that Native Americans had been living here for perhaps 12,000 years. And what a place to live. This is some of the most stunning scenery in the world, with towering red rock formations and dramatic canyons, juniper forests and pungent sage brush. No wonder it stirs the emotions and provokes debate. Should the Mormons who settled here be able to farm on this land? Should corporations be allowed to drill and mine? Should it remain a sacred site for the exclusive use of Native Americans? Or should it be a common treasury for everyone to share? Should the federal government steward this land or should states take the lead? Far from solving these controversies, President Trump's announcement has stirred them anew.

Yemen powerbroker dies in Sanaa fighting,"Ali Abdullah Saleh became an ally of the Houthis after Yemen's civil war began in 2015 Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been killed amid fighting between his supporters and their former allies, the Houthi rebel movement. Officials from Mr Saleh's General People's Congress party said he died in an attack south of the capital, Sanaa. The Houthis' leader hailed the news as a ""great and significant occasion"". Abdul Malik al-Houthi said they had foiled a ""conspiracy"" by a Saudi-led coalition backing the government, to whom Mr Saleh had made peace overtures. Meanwhilethe United Nations said air strikes on Sanaa had intensified,externaland the fighting was spreading to other governorates such as Hajjah. The report, by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said roads had been blocked and tanks were on the streets. Some of the fiercest fighting was in the diplomatic area near the UN compound. Yemen's future looks grim after Saleh's killing The Red Cross estimates that at least 125 people have been killed and more than 230 people injured since clashes broke out on Friday. The UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, called for a humanitarian pause on 5 December to allow civilians to leave their homes and seek assistance, and for aid workers to continue life-saving programmes. ""They don't know what's coming next...  Children and young people - it's terribly sad,"" he told the BBC. ""And for us we're in the situation we can't help them because we're equally locked down and we have not got the ability to address their needs the way we should."" Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's dominant force Yemen conflict: Who is fighting whom? Until recently, Saleh loyalists had been fighting alongside the Houthis in a war against the current president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. But a dispute over control of Sanaa's biggest mosque on Wednesday triggered armed clashes that have left more than 125 people dead. On Saturday, Mr Saleh offered to ""turn a new page"" with the Saudi-led coalition if it stopped attacking Yemen and ended its crippling blockade of the country. The Houthis accused him of a ""coup"" against ""an alliance he never believed in"". By Sunday, Houthi fighters had taken control of much of the capital and fierce battles were taking place around the homes of Mr Saleh's family and their allies. Saudi-led coalition air strikes overnight failed to stop the Houthis and on Monday morning Mr Saleh's own home was overrun. Soon afterwards, reports began to emerge that he had been killed. Houthi fighters attacked and took control of Mr Saleh's home in central Sanaa on Monday A video circulated on social media showing the body of a man resembling Mr Saleh with a severe head wound. It was being carried on a blanket by armed men shouting ""Praise be to God!"" and ""Hey Ali Affash!"" - the name of Mr Saleh's clan. Later, officials in the General People's Congress confirmed Mr Saleh's death. They said a convoy that he and other party officials were in came under fire from Houthi fighters as they fled south towards the former leader's hometown of Sanhan. Some reports say that he was taken out of his vehicle after it was stopped by an RPG rocket and summarily killed. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi celebrated what he called ""the day of the fall of the treasonous conspiracy"".  He also insisted the Houthis had ""no problem"" with the GPC or its members. However, an unnamed GPC official told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV that the Yemeni people should ""take to the street and rise up against the Houthi militias"". Dozens of people reportedly died in clashes over the weekend Mr Hadi offered his condolences to the families of ""honourable men"" killed in the last few days in Sanaa, ""most notably former President Ali Abdullah Saleh"". He also called for an ""uprising"" against the Houthis, denouncing them as ""criminal gangs"". The UN meanwhile called for a humanitarian pause in the fighting on Tuesday,external. It said civilians were trapped in their homes, supplies of food and fuel were running low, and that hospitals were unable to treat the wounded. Yemen: Finding near-famine - and lots of food Civilians pay price of blockade By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The death of Ali Abdullah Saleh at the hands of the Houthis now makes any immediate prospect of peace even less likely. Together, Mr Saleh's forces and the Houthis were strong enough to hold on to Sanaa and repel the forces of Yemen's internationally-recognised government and its Gulf Arab allies from much of the mountainous north. Cracks had recently been showing in that alliance, with Mr Saleh turning his back on the Houthis and hinting at a deal with the Saudis. He appears to have paid for it with his life, meeting a similarly ignominious end as that suffered by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Mr Saleh's supporters, who are well-armed, will now seek revenge, probably supported by the very Saudi air strikes that had previously been targeting them. Mr Saleh, who was 77, came to power as president of North Yemen in 1978. When it united with South Yemen in 1990 he became president of the new republic. The Houthis, who champion Yemen's Zaidi Shia minority, fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh between 2004 and 2010. They also supported an uprising in 2011 that forced Mr Saleh to hand over power to his deputy, Mr Hadi. Tensions with the Houthis rose after Mr Saleh's party held a rally in Sanaa in August Mr Saleh formed an alliance with the Houthis in 2014, when they seized Sanaa amid widespread disillusionment at the political transition. In early 2015, the allies ousted Mr Hadi and forced him to flee abroad, prompting the Saudi-led campaign. Since then, more than 8,670 people have been killed and 49,960 injured. The conflict and a blockade by the coalition have also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,211 people since April.

No 'natural causes' to Poppi's death,"Poppi Worthington was blue and not breathing when she was brought to hospital There were no natural causes to account for the death of 13-month-old Poppi Worthington at her Cumbria home, a pathologist has told an inquest. The toddler died suddenly at a house in Barrow, early on 12 December 2012. No-one has ever been prosecuted. In evidence to an inquest into Poppi's death, Dr Alison Armour said she believed Poppi was sexually assaulted. Dr Armour also said she had suspected Poppi had been physically abused before she started to examine her body. Dr Armour said: ""I think it is very important to state in this case the autopsy revealed no natural causes to account for Poppi Worthington's death."" She said her conclusions were based on all of her findings which were ""in keeping"" with Poppi suffering a penetrative injury. When asked if there was anything she had seen that contradicted her conclusion. Dr Armour replied: ""No."" However, she maintained the ""mechanism"" of Poppi's death remained ""unascertained"". She said it would be wrong to say that a penetrative injury alone caused the death, but she believed it happened and it may have been a contributing factor. Gillian Irving QC asked Dr Armour: ""Is the reality five years on that we really are never going to know the cause of death of Poppi Worthington?"" Dr Armour said: ""I do appreciate the mother wants a cause of death, but there are some times when we cannot give a cause of death. ""We have to to be sure, we cannot speculate. ""I know it would bring closure to your client, but I cannot give it, not even on the balance of probabilities. ""There isn't enough for me to sure."" The double bed where Poppi was placed at the time of her collapse The inquest had heard a detailed account of the various tests done on Poppi during the post-mortem examination carried out by Dr Armour. The Home Office pathologist said she did find evidence of an ""upper respiratory tract infection"" which was consistent with Poppi's parents claims she was ""a bit snuffly"" and had a cold. She also said she found a ""tiny focus"" of pneumonia in Poppi's lungs, but it would not account for Poppi's death. Dr Armour, who has been a Home Office pathologist for 30 years, was asked about bright red blood, known as frank blood, found in Poppi's nose. She said a cause could not be given for certain, but it can be found in cases of smothering or suffocation. Earlier, Dr Armour told the inquest in Kendal, that an X-ray revealed the child had leg fractures. Both of Poppi's parents have said they could not explain the fractures and did not believe they were causing her pain. Counsel for the coroner, Alison Hewitt, asked Dr Armour if she had expressed concern about child abuse before carrying out her post-mortem examination - a comment Det Sgt John Carton claimed he had heard the Home Office pathologist make. Dr Armour confirmed she made the remark having been ""very concerned"" by the fractures revealed by a full body X-ray and skeletal survey. The sofa on the ground floor of the family home where Poppi Worthington was resuscitated She added: ""I think the phrase might have been: 'In cases where there are fractures with no history of accidental trauma and it is picked up at the time of the death of a child, this is strongly suspicious of child abuse'. Dr Armour carried out the post-mortem examination at the Royal Children's Hospital in Manchester. Poppi weighed 10.7kg and was 81cm tall. The Cumbria force has been criticised for its handling of the investigation by the police watchdog. The new inquest was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was ""unascertained"". In 2016, High Court family judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled Poppi was probably sexually assaulted by her father shortly before she died. Paul Worthington has denied any wrongdoing.

Reprieve for 'death row' army dogsThe Ministry of Defence planned to destroy the dogs because it said they were too aggressive to rehome.9m9 minutes agoLeicester,"One of the dogs, Dazz, was featured in MoD publicity shots at the Defence Animal Centre Two retired army dogs which faced being destroyed because they were too aggressive to rehome have been saved, the BBC understands. Kevin and Dazz, both Belgian shepherds, were deployed in Afghanistan and were retired from frontline service in 2013. The dogs are based at the Defence Animal Centre in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Foreign Office MinisterSir Alan Duncan wrote to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) on Friday to call for a reprieve. The MoD has assured their dog handlers that they could be saved. A third animal, a police dog named Driver, who was also at risk, could also be rehomed. More stories from across the East Midlands Sir Alan, the MP for Melton and Rutland and Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, said: ""It is very good news, as long as they have a good home, which also guarantees safety for people. ""We are all happy for Kevin and Dazz and also good luck to Driver."" He said they were ""hero dogs who have fought fearlessly alongside our soldiers"" and any danger to people ""must be proven"". The dogs have been trained to show aggression which makes rehoming difficult Former soldier turned author Andy McNab launched an online petition, which has more than 370,000 signatures and will be delivered to the centre in Melton Mowbray. ""Service dogs have saved my life on numerous occasions,"" he said. ""Dogs like Kevin, Dazz, and Driver are an asset when they are serving but they are even more of an asset when they are retired."" The Belgian shepherds went on patrol with troops in Afghanistan and were used for their aggression. The MoD had said: ""Wherever possible, we endeavour to re-home them [dogs] at the end of their service life. ""Sadly, there are some occasions where this is not possible.""

'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution,"Wandering albatrosses scour the oceans for food to bring back to their chicks Scientists who advised theBlue Planet IIdocumentary team say they feel ""shame and anger"" at the âplague of plasticâ impacting the natural world. Even in the remote waters of Antarctica, they have found evidence of plastic killing and harming seabirds. Wandering albatrosses â which have the longest wingspan of any birds alive today â are thought to be especially vulnerable. Nesting on the barren islands of South Georgia, they feed their young by scouring thousands of miles of ocean for squid and fish but often bring back plastic instead. The final episode of what has become the most-watched TV programme of the year explores how the oceans are threatened by human activities including overfishing and pollution. It will be broadcaston Sunday 10 December. Albatrosses hit by fishing and climate Albatrosses counted from space Map traces Shackleton's footsteps The final programme in the series will look at some of the threats facing the oceans In a particularly moving scene, Dr Lucy Quinn, a zoologist, is seen checking albatross chicks on Bird Island where she was the British Antarctic Surveyâs winter manager for more than two years. One chick that Dr Quinn found dead and later dissected was killed because a plastic toothpick that it swallowed had pierced its stomach. Others had regurgitated plastic items including cling film, food packaging, cutlery and parts of bottles. Dr Quinn told me: âI feel real shame and anger that itâs humans who have caused this problem. ""Itâs really sad because you get to know the birds and how long it takes the parents, away for ten days at a time, to collect food for their chicks and what they bring back is plastic. ""And whatâs sad is that the plague of plastic is as far-reaching as these seemingly pristine environments."" Lucy Quinn seen checking albatrosses on Bird Island, part of South Georgia It's not known how many albatross chicks in Antarctica die from plastic pollution every year â it's thought to be fewer than the losses suffered by Laysan albatrosses on Midway Atoll in the Pacific . But on Bird Island, predators often eat dead chicks before the researchers can reach them â and the suspicion is that the effect of the plastic goes beyond the direct killing of seabirds. According to Dr Quinn, the threat is more insidious, weakening birds as they waste energy trying to digest plastic, which has no nutritional value, and potentially poisoning them as chemicals are released when the plastic breaks down in their stomachs. Research at the other end of the world into a smaller relative of the albatross â the fulmars of the North Sea â shows that while plastics may directly kill seabirds, it is the debilitating effects of the waste that could be more serious. If a human had ingested the equivalent plastic volume as the average fulmar does (L), it would fill a lunchbox (R) Studies of fulmars,externalfound dead on beaches or caught accidentally by fishermen â which Dr Quinn has also been involved in â show that from 2010-2014, UK fulmars were found to contain on average 39 particles of plastic weighing a total of 0.32 grams. In an unsettling image, the volume of space taken up by that plastic in a fulmarâs belly is the equivalent in a human stomach of the contents of a typical lunchbox, and usually the plastic is made up of consumer items used just once and then thrown away. Most shocking is the effect of party balloons, released in a moment of celebration, but then catching the eye of a fulmar searching for food. Dr Quinn remembers one occasion when she dissected one of the birds. ""I couldnât believe my eyes, seeing a balloon in the birdâs oesophagus, which would have killed it, along with cling film, toothbrushes and packaging â I feel extremely sad for the birds and impatient to do something,"" she said. The plastic may be undermining the fulmarsâ health, which could affect their ability to breed - with long-term implications for the population as a whole. Cayman Trough: Plastic debris has descended to the deepest parts of the world's oceans The threat from plastic waste is not limited to pieces that are visible â bottles, bags and other items break down into minute fragments, or ""micro-plastics"", which enter the food chain in every corner of the ocean. Scientists from the University of Newcastle even identified tiny fibres in the smallest creatures living in the deepest part of the Pacific, the Mariana Trench. Dr Jon Copley, of the University of Southampton, who joined the Blue Planet submarine filming in Antarctica, says that although he did not spot any plastic in the polar waters, he has been shocked by its presence elsewhere. ""When I've seen plastic in the deep ocean - such as a bin liner we found near deep-sea vents in the Cayman Trough - there's an initial shock and disappointment that our rubbish has got here before us as explorers. ""But then there's the realisation that our everyday lives are more connected to the deep ocean than we perhaps think. ""Every piece of plastic rubbish has a story, so it also makes me wonder about the chain of events that led to that particular item ending up in the deep ocean, and whether any of those events could have been prevented.""

Priest 'tried to control' abuse inquiry,"Allegations of sex abuse at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire are being probed by the independent child sex abuse inquiry Police raised concerns that the head of a Roman Catholic boarding school tried to ""control"" a child sex abuse investigation, an inquiry has heard. A former North Yorkshire detective said officers were ""excluded"" from inquiries at Ampleforth College in 1995 and 2002. But former head teacher Father Leo Chamberlain denied influencing a boy's parents during a phone call in 1995. He told theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abusethere had been ""no skulduggery"". The Catholic Church is one of 13 public organisations being scrutinised by the inquiry, which is being headed by Prof Alexis Jay. Det Supt Barry Honeysett said he had told Fr Chamberlain in 2003 that he did not trust the private school, because alleged victims of abuse had been spoken to by staff before police were called in. Mr Honeysett, who led an inquiry into abuse at Ampleforth College, said: ""The issue was largely around the delay in the police becoming involved. ""A direct approach had been made to the victim which I felt was inappropriate."" Earlier in the hearing, the priest was questioned about another policy officer, Det Sgt Hartnett, who was involved investigating allegations at Ampleforth. Lead counsel to the inquiry Riel Karmy-Jones put it to Fr Chamberlain that Det Sgt Hartnett believed the priest was trying to ""control the investigation"". Fr Chamberlain, who began working at the school in 1961, said the suggestion was ""completely subjective"". He said he had to spoken to the boy's parents to inform them of the situation and in doing so, had ""made no obstruction"" to the police inquiry. Father Leo Chamberlain taught at Ampleforth College from 1961 to 2003 Evidence was heard that the Abbott of Ampleforth, Fr Timothy Wright, went to visit a complainant of child sex abuse, causing mistrust between the Church and North Yorkshire Police. Speaking via video link, Fr Chamberlain - head teacher at Ampleforth between 1992 and 2003 - said police thought there was a conspiracy between him and Fr Wright ""to close the matter down"", which he said was not the case. Fr Chamberlain told the inquiry that during the 1980s, a teacher who had abused pupils would ""be got rid of and it was thought wrongly that to keep it all very quiet was in the best interests of the victim"". An earlier hearing was told the former head teacher was warned about employing Fr Piers Grant-Ferris - who was later jailed for abusing boys. Grant-Ferris, who the pupils had nicknamed ""Pervy Piers"", was convicted of 20 counts of indecent assault in 2006. The inquiry was shown a letter by a psychologist employed by the school, Elizabeth Mann, who wrote in 2003 that Grant-Ferris and a second monk posed a risk to pupils. At the time, Fr Chamberlain said he thought it was safe to employ Grant-Ferris in the abbey's shop, which he had described as ""something of a goldfish bowl"", regularly visited by guests and students. He told the inquiry: ""Because it was a very visible place I thought well, we could probably make it work. But I think I could have been wrong about that.""

Men sought over gay apology attack,"British Transport Police have released images of two men they want to speak to over the attack Police are searching for two men after a teenager was attacked on a Tube train and forced to apologise for being gay. The 19-year-old had been travelling with friends on the Jubilee line in south-east London on 21 October when he was verbally abused by two men. One of them put him in a headlock while the other took his phone and threatened to stab him. He was then strangled until he said sorry for being gay. The British Transport Police (BTP) said ""hate crime would not be tolerated"". The group that included the victim were dressed in fancy dress and had been travelling between West Ham and North Greenwich when the attack occurred. After the men released the teenager they gave him back his phone but got into a fight with the rest of the group, police said. A 25-year-old woman suffered bruising after she was punched and pushed to the ground. In a statement, the BTP said: ""We won't tolerate behaviour where someone is targeted because they are perceived to be different, or made to feel uncomfortable on their journey.""

Trump ends federal protection for US parks,"President Donald Trump has dramatically scaled back two public outdoor parks, or national monuments, in Utah. He declared an 85% cut to the state's 1.3m acre Bears Ears National Monument and a 50% cut to its 1.9m acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Native American tribes and environmental groups say they will file lawsuits against the policy. But it will be welcomed by ranchers and business interests who view such monuments as federal land grabs. Speaking in the capitol building in Salt Lake City, Mr Trump said: ""Some people think the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington. ""And guess what, they're wrong,"" Mr Trump said. The fight for Utah's national monuments He said former presidents had ""severely abused"" the law by declaring swathes of territory off limits to drilling, mining, grazing, road traffic and other activities. This video can not be played Is Trump threatening the US wilderness? Mr Trump said: ""I've come to Utah to take a very historic action, to reverse federal over-reach and to restore the rights of this land to your citizens."" During his visit to Utah, the president does not plan to visit either scenic area, White House officials say. Environmental groups reacted angrily to Mr Trump's announcement. ""This is a shameful and illegal attack on our nation's protected lands"", said Jamie Clark, the chief executive of Defenders of Wildlife, a non-profit organisation. ""It's not surprising that the Trump administration moved to sell out our national monuments. What is surprising is that they seem to think they can get away with it. We'll be seeing President Trump in court"", he said. Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said: ""Public lands are to be managed for the public, not plundered by private interests that want to make billions off public resources. This action is unprecedented and will end up in court."" Outdoor clothing company Patagonia have also said they will take legal action. On Monday night, a message on their website said: ""The President Stole Your Land. This is the largest elimination of protected land in American history."" Native American tribes people who consider Bears Ears sacred are also planning to sue the administration. ""We will be fighting back immediately,"" said Natalie Landreth, a lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund. ""All five tribes will be standing together united to defend Bears Ears.""

""However, we are resilient and refuse to allow President Trump's unlawful decision to discourage us. ""We will continue to fight in honour of our ancestral warriors who fought for our way of life, for our culture and for our land, too."" On Saturday thousands of protesters - including Native Americans dressed in ceremonial headdresses - rallied in Salt Lake City against Mr Trump's action. Mr Trump's Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, said earlier that the president's aim in reversing the park's federally protected status was ""about giving rural America a voice"". He added that ""public land is for the public to use and not special interests"".

Unlike a national park, which requires an act of Congress, a national monument can be designated by any sitting president under the 1906 Antiquities Act. Analysis by James Cook, BBC News, Salt Lake City In the United States, the struggle for control between Washington and the West is not quite as old as the hills but it goes back a long, long way. Resentment of the federal government runs deep in many states, not least in Utah, with its majority Mormon population. Tens of thousands of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints settled here after being driven out of Ohio, Missouri and Illinois. The land was not empty. Archaeologists estimate that Native Americans had been living here for perhaps 12,000 years. And what a place to live. This is some of the most stunning scenery in the world, with towering red rock formations and dramatic canyons, juniper forests and pungent sage brush. No wonder it stirs the emotions and provokes debate. Should the Mormons who settled here be able to farm on this land? Should corporations be allowed to drill and mine? Should it remain a sacred site for the exclusive use of Native Americans? Or should it be a common treasury for everyone to share? Should the federal government steward this land or should states take the lead? Far from solving these controversies, President Trump's announcement has stirred them anew.

Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told reporters that police operations were under way in the town of Marsa, and the Bugibba and Zebbug areas. Caruana Galizia was killed close to her home on 16 October in an attack which shocked the country. The 53-year-old was known for her blog accusing top politicians of corruption. Malta's anti-corruption warrior Malta country profile The government offered a â¬1m (Â£890,000; $1.2m) reward for information about her murder. International experts, including from the FBI, were called in to help in the investigation. Police and troops are being used in the security operation, with roads blocked and a patrol boat deployed. Mr Muscat said some of the detainees were already known to the police while others had criminal records. When asked if the eight arrested had participated in the murder, or if they also included the mastermind, Mr Muscat would not comment,Malta Today reports,external.

'No desire' in Ireland to delay,"This video can not be played Ireland's need for more detail ""not an unreasonable ask"" Ireland's deputy prime minister has said his country has ""no desire"" to delay the UK's Brexit talks. But Simon Coveney also warned that not enough progress had been made on the border with Northern Ireland. While Ireland was not looking for ""full detail"", it was seeking the parameters within which a solution could be found. His comments came ahead of a week of crucial decisions on whether the UK and EU would move ahead to the next phase of Brexit negotiations. UK Prime Minister Theresa May is due to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday to assess whether sufficient progress has been made on three core issues of citizens' rights, the ""divorce bill"" and the future of the Irish border with Northern Ireland. The 27 other member states will then meet on Wednesday to make a decision on going to a second phase of talks. Mr Coveney has been heavily involved with Ireland's stance on Brexit since becoming the foreign minister during the summer. He was also appointed as tÃ¡naiste - deputy prime minister -following the resignation of his colleague, Frances Fitzgerald, over a political rowthat threatened to bring down the government. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said Ireland did not want to exercise its veto on the issue. ""There is no desire, I can tell you, in Ireland, to delay this process,"" he said. The hardest border - BBC News ""But at the same time, we have a responsibility as a government to represent the interests on the island of Ireland. ""We believe that, as an island, Ireland is uniquely vulnerable and exposed to a potential bad outcome from Brexit. ""That is why we are looking for more progress than we have."" On Friday, EC President Donald Tusk (R) said Europe would stand by Ireland He also denied suggestions, made by some UK politicians, that the issue was being used to pave the way for Irish unity. ""That's simply not true,"" he said, adding that the government had maintained a consistent position for months. He said he was very keen to avoid ""a green versus orange debate"" between unionism and nationalism. ""Instead we're trying to protect the status quo."" Irish PM 'understands unionist concerns' Brexit offer 'must be acceptable to Ireland' ""We cannot allow some kind of collateral damage or unintended consequence of Brexit to have the recreation of a border."" In June,the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) signed a confidence-and-supply dealwith the UK's minority Conservative government. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the BBC there had been a much more aggressive stance on Brexit from the Irish government since Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney had taken office. He argued they wanted to dismiss technological solutions, which would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. ""They say none of that is acceptable. It has to be a political solution which involves the UK staying inside the single market or the customs union, or failing that Northern Ireland doing so,"" he added. Meanwhile, former UK prime ministerTony Blair told the BBC that a hard border would ""obviously"" cause tensions that could put the Good Friday Agreement- a landmark in the Northern Ireland peace process - at risk. Mrs May's scheduled lunch with the head of the European Commission is widely seen as her chance to persuade the EU to move negotiations forward. Along with the Irish border, other issues that the EU says must be agreed are the size of the UK's payment to the EU - the so-called divorce bill - and the status of EU nationals living in the UK. Mr Juncker will also meet European lawmakers before his lunch with Mrs May, possibly to discuss the UK's offer on citizens' rights. Progress on the ""divorce bill"" was made last week whenit emerged that the UK had offered the EU a sum of up â¬50bn (Â£44bn). Some Brexit supporters have complained that the sum is too high. TheLeave Means Leave campaign group on Sunday issued an open letter to Mrs May, urging her not to settle the divorce billwithout a series of agreed conditions. Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said on Friday the EU was ""fully behind"" Ireland's demand for no hard border on the island. ""The Irish request is the EU's request,"" he said, adding that he would consult the Irish prime minister before the next stage of Brexit talks.

Ireland 'disappointed' at no deal on Brexit,"This video can not be played Irish PM Leo Varadkar ""surprised and disappointed"" Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" that an anticipated deal on Brexit was not reached on Monday. He said Ireland could not go into a second phase of Brexit talks without ""firm guarantees that there will not be a hard border in Ireland"". Mr Varadkar said the UK had agreed a text that met Irish concerns. However, he was then later told that the British government was not in a position to conclude ""what was agreed"". Why is the Northern Ireland border question so hard? Brexit: All you need to know Long read: The hardest border Reality check: How much trade is there between UK and Ireland The taoiseach told a press conference in Dublin that earlier on Monday, he had been in touch with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU Council President Donald Tusk and confirmed to both Ireland's agreement on the form of words about the Irish border. But the deal did not go ahead. The BBC's Laura Kuenssbergsaid the deal broke down after the DUP refused to acceptUK concessions on the Irish border issue. Irish ministers say the border is ""more than a customs issue"" and must be handled sensitively Prime Minister Theresa May is understood to have broken off from talks with Mr Junker to speak to DUP leader Arlene Foster. It happened after the DUP leader had held a press conference saying her party would ""not accept any form of regulatory divergence"" that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. However, Downing Street sources insist it was not only the intervention by the DUP that meant a deal was not concluded. The DUP insists NI must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK It is understood that there are still differences of opinion over citizens' rights, the role of the European Courts after the implementation period and also over the technicalities of the Irish border. The UK was reportedly prepared to accept that Northern Ireland may remain in the EU's customs union and single market in all but name. At her press conference on Monday afternoon, Mrs Foster accused Dublin of trying to change the 1998 Belfast Agreement without unionists' consent. ""We will not stand for that,"" she said. ""The prime minister has told the House of Commons that there will be no border in the Irish Sea and the prime minister has been clear that the UK is leaving the EU as a whole and that the territorial and economic integrity of the UK will be protected,"" said the DUP leader. This is the latest in a series of meetings between Theresa May and EU officials The Irish prime minister told a news conference that it ""would not be helpful"" for him to attribute blame for the breakdown in agreement. When asked about the DUP's influence with the UK government, Mr Varadkar said that although they are the largest party in Northern Ireland, and their views have to be taken into account, they ""don't represent the majority of people in Northern Ireland"". He added that the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU during the Brexit referendum. The Irish government had been seeking guarantees from the UK that there would be no customs checks on the border with Northern Ireland after Brexit and movements of goods and people would remain seamless. John O'Dowd, Sinn FÃ©in, accused the DUP leader, Mrs Foster, of putting party political needs ahead of border issues. ""It appears from the leaks of the paper that were presented today - and we will examine the paper in its totality - that there is certainly a significant section of the UK government who are prepared to treat us different because they either understand the unique circumstances of this island or they accept that these talks are going nowhere until this matter is dealt with,"" he said. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has been meeting key EU figures in an attempt to hammer out a deal ahead of a summit in 10 days time. Mr Tusk represents the leaders of the other 27 EU members, who all need to agree for there to be a move to the next phase of talks. The UK voted for Brexit last year and is due to leave in March 2019, but negotiations have been deadlocked over three so-called separation issues: the status of expat citizens, the ""divorce"" bill and the Northern Ireland border. The Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement was reached on 10 April 1998 by the British and Irish governments and most of the political parties in Northern Ireland about how NI should be governed. The agreement aimed to set up a nationalist and unionist power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.

It's been a frenetic few hours in Brussels and it is not clear we are any the wiser as to whether an agreement to move the Brexit process onto the next phase will be reached in time for next week's summit. Here is a summary of what has happened. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been talking to the BBC about today's Brexit developments. She says no-one wants to see a hard border on the island of Ireland and suggests the ""unhealthy influence"" of the DUP at Westminster was a major factor in the apparent failure to finalise an agreement. If the concept of a distinct status for Northern Ireland is borne out in the final phase one agreement, she says ""this will change everything"". The bottom line is the UK government appears to be accepting parts of the UK can effectively stay within the single market, so if that's good enough and possible enough for Northern Ireland there's no reason why it can't be the case for Scotland.""  The Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn says Theresa May is planning to return to Brussels on Wednesday following Prime Minister's Questions.

While he acknowledges that Theresa May is negotiating in ""good faith"" and has a lot on her plate, he says he is committed to securing an agreement and moving onto the second phase of negotiations. Speaking now, Irish PM Leo Varadkar says there has been substantial progress in recent intensive negotiations, including on the continuation of the Good Friday Agreement, the Commons Travel Area and Ireland's membership of the EU.

He's referring to the idea, floated earlier, of Northern Ireland having the same regulations as the Republic of Ireland.

Earlier we referred to a meeting Theresa May was having with European Council President Donald Tusk. Here we have the evidence that it is happening. Like the earlier encounter with Jean-Claude Juncker, I think it is fair to say that the body language is a little bit strained although maybe it is the increasing frequencies of these encounters rather than the personal dynamics that are to blame. BBC News Channel Tory Brexiteer Peter Bone says media speculation about a likely deal earlier today had got ""totally out of hand"". Mr Bone, who has just come out of a briefing of MPs, said the prospect of the whole of Ireland remaining in the customs union was ""nonsense"" and ""just not right"", suggesting, contrary to what it appeared, that it was never seriously on the table. ""It has caused a lot of unnecessary alarm,"" he tells BBC News, insisting any Irish border deal had to have the backing of the people of Northern Ireland. The MP says it is fine if no overall deal is reached - he's sanguine about the prospect of the UK falling back onto World Trade Organisation rules - but he says the UK has to decide what it wants to do soon, by the Spring at the latest. Both UKIP and the Lib Dems are unhappy about Theresa May's handling of negotiations but for different reasons. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who has campaigned for 20 years for the UK to leave the EU, said talk of Northern Ireland having the same customs and trade regulations as the Republic of Ireland was a ""concession too far"" from the government and would ""damage the integrity of the UK"". Mr Farage, who is also calling on Mrs May to step aside, was speaking before the DUP objected to such an idea and apparently vetoed a deal on these grounds. And, for the anti-Brexit Lib Dems, Tom Brake says the current situation could have been avoided by keeping the whole of the UK in the EU's customs union. Theresa May has cowered in front of her backbenchers and driven forward a reckless Brexit which risks destabilising the whole UK. Tom Brake, Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor The BBC

Juncker after the Democratic Unionist Party leader, Arlene Foster, held a press conference
saying the party could not accept anything that led to divergence
between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The prime minister then phoned Ms Foster. During the call it was made
plain to the PM that the DUP, whose support is vital to the government being
able to pass their Brexit legislation, had significant concerns about the deal
being discussed that gave concessions to the Dublin
government. I understand Ms Foster told Theresa May that
she would not be able to support such a deal. Itâs been suggested too there are twenty or so Conservative MPs who had serious misgivings

Theresa May has cowered in front of her backbenchers and driven forward a reckless Brexit which risks destabilising the whole UK. Tom Brake, Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor The BBC
understands that Theresa May broke off her talks with Jean-Claude
Juncker after the Democratic Unionist Party leader, Arlene Foster, held a press conference
saying the party could not accept anything that led to divergence
between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The prime minister then phoned Ms Foster. During the call it was made
plain to the PM that the DUP, whose support is vital to the government being
able to pass their Brexit legislation, had significant concerns about the deal
being discussed that gave concessions to the Dublin
government. I understand Ms Foster told Theresa May that
she would not be able to support such a deal. Itâs been suggested too there are twenty or so Conservative MPs who had serious misgivings
about the compromises that were understood to be on the table.

"'Millions misspent' during Mandela funeralMoney earmarked for schools and hospitals was used for commemorative T-shirts, a report says.15m15 minutes agoAfrica","Four years have passed since South African hero Nelson Mandela died South Africa's corruption watchdog has found officials misused millions of dollars during Nelson Mandela's funeral four years ago. According to the report, 300m rand ($22m; Â£16m) was redirected from a development fund to help with costs. It had been earmarked for things like ""sanitation, the replacement of mud schools and the refurbishment of hospitals,"" the report stated. Instead, the authorities allegedly spent it on items like $24 T-shirts. The man who destroyed apartheid Nelson Mandela's state funeral: In pictures Allegations of misuse first emerged in 2014, months after Mr Mandela's funeral in Qunu, Eastern Cape, in December 2013, which was attended by heads of state from around the world. Now, nearly four years after Mr Mandela's death at the age of 95, the country's public protector, Busi Mkhwebane, has asked President Jacob Zuma to pursue the allegations further using the special investigations unit. The 300-page report describes how officials in the Eastern Cape pocketed funds, ignored basic rules, and inflated costs. Mr Mandela spent 27 years in prison after being charged with trying to overthrow the apartheid government Ms Mkhwebane described the failure to follow regulations on the spending of public money as ""very scary"" and ""appalling"",according to South Africa's Mail&Guardian newspaper.,external ""It is very concerning that we can use a funeral to do such things,"" she told a press conference. ""How do you charge or escalate prices or even send an invoice for something you have not delivered?"" Ms Mkhwebane said disorganisation had a role to play in the misuse, but also hit out at how South Africa's ruling ANC party had apparently issued instructions to officials on how the money should be spent. ""There are invoices we are showing with letterheads from the ANC. And monies were paid but again services were not rendered,"" she was quoted as saying bySouth Africa's EyeWitness News.,external She added: ""We are hopeful whoever has committed these acts will be taken to task."" This is not the first scandal to surround official events commemorating the apartheid struggle hero's life. The man tasked with providing a sign language interpretation at the memorial servicewas accused of making up gestures, whilea fight for control over Mandela's legacy within his own familymired the last months of his life.

UK aid 'diverted to Syria extremists',"The Free Syrian Police project is run from Gaziantep in Turkey, just across the border from Syria The government has suspended a foreign aid project after a BBC Panorama investigation found taxpayers' cash was being diverted to extremists in Syria. Officers from a UK-backed police force in Syria have also been working with courts carrying out brutal sentences. A UK government spokesman said it takes allegations of co-operation with terrorist groups ""extremely seriously"". Adam Smith International, the British company running the project, said it strongly denies the allegations. The Free Syrian Police (FSP) was set up following the uprising in Syria, to bring law and order to parts of the country that were controlled by opposition forces. Adam Smith International (ASI) has been running the project since October 2014. Britain was one of six donor countries paying for the project, which provides community policing to the rebel-held areas of Aleppo, Idlib and Daraa provinces. It is intended to be an unarmed civilian police force, and not co-operate with extremist groups, but Panorama has found examples where that was not the case. Some of Panorama's allegations against the project include: Police cooperating with courts that carry out summary executions  - including a case where two women were stoned to death Police being paid in cash and then being forced to hand over funds to an extremist group controlling the area Police officers being handpicked by an extremist group Dead and fictitious people are on the police payroll Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson announced in April that the UK would commit a further Â£4 million to the UK-funded Access to Justice and Community Security (AJACS)  scheme that supports the FSP. ASI says the FSP is an unarmed community police force that brings the rule of law and safety to millions of people in a war-torn country. An ASI spokesman said it ""strongly refutes Panorama's allegations"". ""We have managed taxpayers' money effectively to confront terrorism, bring security to Syrian communities and mitigate the considerable risks of operating in a war zone,"" he said. ""ASI has managed the project successfully alongside our partner in an extremely challenging, high-risk environment under the close supervision of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and five other governments."" The company says it uses cash to fund the police because there is no practical alternative - and that the British government is aware of the payments. A police station in Koknaya was supposed to be the base for 57 officers - but ASI staff could not find any police officers during a visit in 2016 Panorama has obtained ASI documents that show dead and fictitious people were on the police payroll. One police station in Koknaya in Idlib province was supposed to be the base for 57 police officers. But the documents show that when ASI's staff visited in September 2016, they couldn't find a single officer. ASI said officers were accounted for on subsequent visits. The company has now suspended the payment of all salaries at the Koknaya police station. It said it had identified very few examples across Syria where deceased officers had remained on the salary list. The documents also show how some police officers in Aleppo province were forced to hand over cash to the extremist group - Nour al-Din al-Zinki - in control of the area. The Nour al-Din al-Zinki Movement has been linked to atrocities including the beheading of a young prisoner in 2016. An ASI report from July 2016 warned that 20% of all police salaries were being handed over ""to pay for the military and security support that Zinki provides to the five FSP stations located areas under its control"". As well as handing over a cut of British aid money to Zinki, the police had also worked with a Zinki court ""by writing up warrants, delivering notices, and turning criminals over to the court"". The police cooperation has continued despite allegations of torture and summary executions involving the court at al-Qasimiyeh. Tory MP Crispin Blunt, former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the FSP should not be supporting extremist courts. He said: ""You've got people being sentenced to death for homosexuality. ""Clearly that is completely and utterly unacceptable by any standard and the idea that British taxpayers' money was associated with that would of course be wholly abhorrent."" ASI says it has strict guidelines in place to ensure detainees are treated fairly and humanely, and that payments to the police stations which were paying Zinki were stopped in August 2016. It says donor governments were kept fully informed. A road near Sarmin - where two women were stoned to death in the presence of FSP officers Panorama also discovered that the Free Syrian Police provided support for courts run by the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda - Jabhat al-Nusra - which handed out extreme punishments. Police officers were present when two women were stoned to death near Sarmin in December 2014. Sources have told Panorama the officers closed the road so that the execution could take place. ASI says the police officers who attended the stoning were not formally under FSP control and have since been removed. Panorama has also seen evidence that al-Nusra handpicked police officers in two stations in Idlib province. ASI says that the officers imposed by al-Nusra were detected in under two months and that payments to the station were then stopped. The company says the payments in question only amounted to $1,800 (Â£1,340) and did not come from British government funds. But ASI didn't explain how they could be sure when the whole project is funded by cash. A UK government spokesman said: ""We take any allegations of co-operation with terrorist groups and of human rights abuses extremely seriously and the Foreign Office has suspended this programme while we investigate these allegations. ""We believe that such work in Syria is important to protect our national security interest but of course we reach this judgment carefully given that in such a challenging environment no activity is without risk. ""That's why all our programmes are designed carefully and subject to robust monitoring.""

Fewer teenagers have part-time jobs,"Rachel, 13, says she manages to balance her part-time job and school work A Saturday job used to be a rite of passage for many children, but pressure to succeed at school and other factors means that's no longer the case. The number of schoolchildren with a part-time job has fallen by a fifth in the past five years, new figures show. The findings come from a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to all local authorities across the UK responsible for issuing child employment permits. Employers need to apply for a licence to hire staff under the age of 16. More than 140 authorities responded to the FOI with the numbers of permits issued in 2012 up to 2016, which showed a steady decline over that period. The number of permits fell by more than 20 percentage points between 2012 and 2016 - from 29,498 to 23,071. Dr Angus Holford from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex said he believed young people in compulsory education are fearful that a part-time job could hinder their performance at school. ""Teens are being told evermore that you need to get good GCSEs and A-levels to get a good job in the long term,"" he said. ""Passing the exams you need now is looming larger in people's concerns."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Properly regulated part-time work is a good way of helping young people learn skills that they will need in their working lives. ""It is vital that young people, and their parents, ensure that any part-time work they are undertaking leaves them with sufficient time for study and rest."" Krishan started a part-time job at age 15, working in a cafe at weekends But the drop in children working part-time isn't just about academic pressures, it's also due to changing consumer habits. One of the biggest drops in employment permits being issued was in Middlesbrough. In 2011, 101 permits were issued to 13 to 15-year-old children there, but in 2016 the number was just seven. The council said the ""massive drop"" was due to a decline in the number of people in the area who had a newspaper delivered to their door. Gareth Lewis, the chair of the National Network for Children in Employment and Entertainment, which sets guidelines and good practice for employers, said it was beneficial for children to have some form of part-time work. ""(This decline) is not something we have been made aware of â¦ it is hard to see why there may be a trend."" Middlesbrough Council said the decline in the number of permits being issued for employing children was down to a drop in demand for newspaper deliveries Rachel, 13, works in a discount shop in Manchester. She said: ""I enjoy my job because I'm earning money and it helps my confidence speaking to people and socialising with people I work with. ""I have to be quite organised with my homework, so I'll often do some at lunchtimes and then do the rest as soon as I get home from work."" Krishan started his first job at 15 working in a cafe in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. He has just turned 16. ""I really wanted to gain my own sense of independence and I thought that getting a job would be a good way to do that. ""I enjoy the sense of freedom it gives me because I'm able to make money as well as have free time to meet my friends."" Norfolk County Council issued 1,376 permits in 2016. This was equivalent to just over one in every 20 children (5.2%) aged 13 to 15. Dudley in the West Midlands had 471 permits, equivalent to 4.4% of 13 to 15-year-olds. Sir Martin Sorrell's dad gave him a part-time job while he was at school Is having a part-time job early on in life a marker for future professional success? Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising and public relations firm WPP, told the BBC: ""I was very lucky. My dad gave me a part-time job whilst at school. I was a salesman in one of his stores in Harlesden, selling radios, TVs, radiograms, fridges and vacuum cleaners, amongst other electrical accessories. ""I also spent several weeks reviewing credit analyses for hire-purchase agreements ... business was an inherent part of our lives, perhaps to an unusual degree. There weren't many other kids who read the Financial Times on the bus to school."" Has your Saturday job led to a full-time position? emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Some research has even shown that not taking on a Saturday or holiday job could be detrimental to a person later on. A 2015 study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that not participating in part-time work at school age had been blamed by employers' organisations for young adults being ill-prepared for full-time employment. It also said this had negative implications for workforce productivity. Employment regulations state that work for 13 to 15 year-olds must be light duties only and between the hours of 7am and 7pm (including holidays). Jobs that need a permit include retail work, newspaper rounds, waiting on tables, office or clerical work, and leaflet delivery. The rules are different for baby-sitting or the odd job for families and individuals. Data on the number of permits issued by local authorities was gathered by the BBC using the Freedom of Information Act. Daniel Wainwright of the BBC England Data Unit then used the official population estimates published by theOffice for National Statistics,externalto calculate the rate of employment of 13 to 15-year-olds in each area in 2016.

Co-op calls time on 'best before' dates,"East of England Co-op will become the first major retailer to sell food beyond its ""best before"" dates. The chain's 125 stores in East Anglia will sell dried foods and tinned products for just 10p in a bid to cut food waste. Wrap, the waste and recycling advisory body, said the Co-op's ""bold"" move complied with food safety standards. The UK throws away 7.3 million tonnes of food every year, according to the Food Standards Agency. East of England Co-op, which is independent of the Co-operative Group, will sell tinned goods and dried food such as pasta, crisps and rice for 10p once they reach their best before date. Last week national waste agency Wrap, supported by the government,launched a new initiativeto help prevent edible food going to waste. Wrap said the Co-op move had ""implications.... for a wider roll out"". Clearer label plan in bid to cut food waste The firms being creative with food destined for the bin How one woman is winning the fight against food waste However, the offer will not apply to perishable foods, which carry a ""use by"" date indicating when a product is safe to eat. The ""Don't be a Binner, have it for dinner"" campaign follows a successful three-month trial in 14 stores. This video can not be played What's causing Britain's food waste? Roger Grosvenor, East of England Co-op's joint chief executive, said the 10p items were sold within hours of being reduced. ""The vast majority of our customers understand they are fine to eat and appreciate the opportunity to make a significant saving on some of their favourite products,"" he said. ""This is not a money making exercise, but a sensible move to reduce food waste and keep edible food in the food chain."" The retailer estimates the initiative will stop at least 50,000 items a year being thrown away. Other chains have not indicated any plans as yet to follow the initiative. The UK's largest grocery chain Tesco said it didn't sell food after it had gone past its ""best before"" date, but that they then donated any unsold food to local charities through a national scheme. Meanwhile Waitrose said food that was beyond its ""best before"" day but within its ""use by"" date was offered by Waitrose shops to local charities and good causes. Each shop also has schemes for staff to buy food ""on its last day of shelf life, or beyond its best before date"", at reduced price. Iceland said it had no similar policy in place and had no immediate plans to do so Use By- Cannot be sold, redistributed or consumed after this date. Applied to foods which are highly perishable - such as fresh fish, meat and poultry - and therefore constitute an immediate danger to human health Best Before- Can be sold, redistributed and consumed after this date. Applied to all other kinds of food Some products aren't legally required to carry a date label Only one date label is recommended for each food item Source: Wrap By Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent Wrap estimates that Â£13bn worth of edible food is thrown out in Britain every year - the majority of which is discarded needlessly. Consumers are often unaware of the difference between a ""use by"" and a ""best before"" date. This move by a national retailer to continue to sell non-perishable food after it has exceeded its best before date could start to tackle the UK's burgeoning food waste mountain. By selling rice, pasta, confectionery etc for a flat rate of 10p in some of its stores, the Co-op cannot be accused of trying to profit on such products. It may spark similar or even wider initiatives by larger rivals, which aim to eliminate food waste entirely. Whether this idea works depends entirely on consumers, many of whom are used to observing best before dates. Will they continue to eat by the rules? Wrap,externalhoped the Co-op's initiative would result in both less waste and cheaper food. ""While 'use by' date labels indicate when a product is safe to eat, 'best before' date labels only refer to when food is at its best. As such it is perfectly safe to sell food at or after its ""best before"" date,"" a spokesperson said. As long as discounted items were not damaged, Wrap said the move met the latest guidelines from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Food Standards Agency. The FSA said products past their best before date were safe to consume but may not be at the optimum quality intended by the producer. Are Saturday jobs less popular among teenagers now?

Former Yemen leader Saleh 'killed',"Ali Abdullah Saleh became an ally of the Houthis after Yemen's civil war began in 2015 Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been killed amid fighting between his supporters and their former allies, the Houthi rebel movement. Officials from Mr Saleh's General People's Congress party said he died in an attack south of the capital, Sanaa. The Houthis' leader hailed the news as a ""great and significant occasion"". Abdul Malik al-Houthi said they had foiled a ""conspiracy"" by a Saudi-led coalition backing the government, to whom Mr Saleh had made peace overtures. Meanwhilethe United Nations said air strikes on Sanaa had intensified,externaland the fighting was spreading to other governorates such as Hajjah. The report, by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said roads had been blocked and tanks were on the streets. Some of the fiercest fighting was in the diplomatic area near the UN compound. Yemen's future looks grim after Saleh's killing The Red Cross estimates that at least 125 people have been killed and more than 230 people injured since clashes broke out on Friday. The UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, called for a humanitarian pause on 5 December to allow civilians to leave their homes and seek assistance, and for aid workers to continue life-saving programmes. ""They don't know what's coming next...  Children and young people - it's terribly sad,"" he told the BBC. ""And for us we're in the situation we can't help them because we're equally locked down and we have not got the ability to address their needs the way we should."" Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's dominant force Yemen conflict: Who is fighting whom? Until recently, Saleh loyalists had been fighting alongside the Houthis in a war against the current president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. But a dispute over control of Sanaa's biggest mosque on Wednesday triggered armed clashes that have left more than 125 people dead. On Saturday, Mr Saleh offered to ""turn a new page"" with the Saudi-led coalition if it stopped attacking Yemen and ended its crippling blockade of the country. The Houthis accused him of a ""coup"" against ""an alliance he never believed in"". By Sunday, Houthi fighters had taken control of much of the capital and fierce battles were taking place around the homes of Mr Saleh's family and their allies. Saudi-led coalition air strikes overnight failed to stop the Houthis and on Monday morning Mr Saleh's own home was overrun. Soon afterwards, reports began to emerge that he had been killed. Houthi fighters attacked and took control of Mr Saleh's home in central Sanaa on Monday A video circulated on social media showing the body of a man resembling Mr Saleh with a severe head wound. It was being carried on a blanket by armed men shouting ""Praise be to God!"" and ""Hey Ali Affash!"" - the name of Mr Saleh's clan. Later, officials in the General People's Congress confirmed Mr Saleh's death. They said a convoy that he and other party officials were in came under fire from Houthi fighters as they fled south towards the former leader's hometown of Sanhan. Some reports say that he was taken out of his vehicle after it was stopped by an RPG rocket and summarily killed. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi celebrated what he called ""the day of the fall of the treasonous conspiracy"".  He also insisted the Houthis had ""no problem"" with the GPC or its members. However, an unnamed GPC official told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV that the Yemeni people should ""take to the street and rise up against the Houthi militias"". Dozens of people reportedly died in clashes over the weekend Mr Hadi offered his condolences to the families of ""honourable men"" killed in the last few days in Sanaa, ""most notably former President Ali Abdullah Saleh"". He also called for an ""uprising"" against the Houthis, denouncing them as ""criminal gangs"". The UN meanwhile called for a humanitarian pause in the fighting on Tuesday,external. It said civilians were trapped in their homes, supplies of food and fuel were running low, and that hospitals were unable to treat the wounded. Yemen: Finding near-famine - and lots of food Civilians pay price of blockade By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The death of Ali Abdullah Saleh at the hands of the Houthis now makes any immediate prospect of peace even less likely. Together, Mr Saleh's forces and the Houthis were strong enough to hold on to Sanaa and repel the forces of Yemen's internationally-recognised government and its Gulf Arab allies from much of the mountainous north. Cracks had recently been showing in that alliance, with Mr Saleh turning his back on the Houthis and hinting at a deal with the Saudis. He appears to have paid for it with his life, meeting a similarly ignominious end as that suffered by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Mr Saleh's supporters, who are well-armed, will now seek revenge, probably supported by the very Saudi air strikes that had previously been targeting them. Mr Saleh, who was 77, came to power as president of North Yemen in 1978. When it united with South Yemen in 1990 he became president of the new republic. The Houthis, who champion Yemen's Zaidi Shia minority, fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh between 2004 and 2010. They also supported an uprising in 2011 that forced Mr Saleh to hand over power to his deputy, Mr Hadi. Tensions with the Houthis rose after Mr Saleh's party held a rally in Sanaa in August Mr Saleh formed an alliance with the Houthis in 2014, when they seized Sanaa amid widespread disillusionment at the political transition. In early 2015, the allies ousted Mr Hadi and forced him to flee abroad, prompting the Saudi-led campaign. Since then, more than 8,670 people have been killed and 49,960 injured. The conflict and a blockade by the coalition have also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,211 people since April.

Poppi's X-ray 'raised suspicion of abuse',"Poppi Worthington was blue and not breathing when she was brought to hospital There were no natural causes to account for the death of 13-month-old Poppi Worthington at her Cumbria home, a pathologist has told an inquest. The toddler died suddenly at a house in Barrow, early on 12 December 2012. No-one has ever been prosecuted. In evidence to an inquest into Poppi's death, Dr Alison Armour said she believed Poppi was sexually assaulted. Dr Armour also said she had suspected Poppi had been physically abused before she started to examine her body. Dr Armour said: ""I think it is very important to state in this case the autopsy revealed no natural causes to account for Poppi Worthington's death."" She said her conclusions were based on all of her findings which were ""in keeping"" with Poppi suffering a penetrative injury. When asked if there was anything she had seen that contradicted her conclusion. Dr Armour replied: ""No."" However, she maintained the ""mechanism"" of Poppi's death remained ""unascertained"". She said it would be wrong to say that a penetrative injury alone caused the death, but she believed it happened and it may have been a contributing factor. Gillian Irving QC asked Dr Armour: ""Is the reality five years on that we really are never going to know the cause of death of Poppi Worthington?"" Dr Armour said: ""I do appreciate the mother wants a cause of death, but there are some times when we cannot give a cause of death. ""We have to to be sure, we cannot speculate. ""I know it would bring closure to your client, but I cannot give it, not even on the balance of probabilities. ""There isn't enough for me to sure."" The double bed where Poppi was placed at the time of her collapse The inquest had heard a detailed account of the various tests done on Poppi during the post-mortem examination carried out by Dr Armour. The Home Office pathologist said she did find evidence of an ""upper respiratory tract infection"" which was consistent with Poppi's parents claims she was ""a bit snuffly"" and had a cold. She also said she found a ""tiny focus"" of pneumonia in Poppi's lungs, but it would not account for Poppi's death. Dr Armour, who has been a Home Office pathologist for 30 years, was asked about bright red blood, known as frank blood, found in Poppi's nose. She said a cause could not be given for certain, but it can be found in cases of smothering or suffocation. Earlier, Dr Armour told the inquest in Kendal, that an X-ray revealed the child had leg fractures. Both of Poppi's parents have said they could not explain the fractures and did not believe they were causing her pain. Counsel for the coroner, Alison Hewitt, asked Dr Armour if she had expressed concern about child abuse before carrying out her post-mortem examination - a comment Det Sgt John Carton claimed he had heard the Home Office pathologist make. Dr Armour confirmed she made the remark having been ""very concerned"" by the fractures revealed by a full body X-ray and skeletal survey. The sofa on the ground floor of the family home where Poppi Worthington was resuscitated She added: ""I think the phrase might have been: 'In cases where there are fractures with no history of accidental trauma and it is picked up at the time of the death of a child, this is strongly suspicious of child abuse'. Dr Armour carried out the post-mortem examination at the Royal Children's Hospital in Manchester. Poppi weighed 10.7kg and was 81cm tall. The Cumbria force has been criticised for its handling of the investigation by the police watchdog. The new inquest was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was ""unascertained"". In 2016, High Court family judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled Poppi was probably sexually assaulted by her father shortly before she died. Paul Worthington has denied any wrongdoing.

Watchdog warns MPs over shared passwords,"The MP Nadine Dorries wrote on Twitter that all her staff had her login details The UK's data privacy regulator has cautioned MPs about sharing work computer passwords. It follows tweets by three Conservative Party MPs over the weekend claiming that they had provided their staff with access to their login details. Sharing passwords is not a breach of the UK's Data Protection Act. But the law says that ""appropriate"" security measures concerning personal data must be in place and that those with access must be properly vetted. ""We're aware of reports that MPs share logins and passwords and are making enquiries of the relevant parliamentary authorities,"" the Information Commissioner's Office said in a tweet of its own. ""We would remind MPs and others of their obligations under the Data Protection Act to keep personal data secure.""

Katya Adler: Brussels 'optimistic',"Theresa May will hold talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Brussels is in an upbeat mood. Which is rather rare when it comes to Brexit. In fact, I've been taken aback by the positive tone of my many conversations. Suddenly, after hearing endless EU complaints about perceived foot-dragging by London during these grey and grumpy months of Brexit negotiations, EU diplomats spoke to me this weekend of ""movement"", ""traction"" and a ""lack of negativity"" in the frantic last-minute talks ahead of Monday's visit by Theresa May. Of course, this might all be misplaced optimism. After all, as both the UK and EU love to point out, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that won't be until autumn next year but... What's at stake here is not a final Brexit deal but whether Brexit negotiations can now widen to include talk of a transition deal and the future shape of EU/UK relations (in or out of the single market and customs union etc). Reality Check: What's happening with the divorce bill? That depends on whether the EU deems that ""sufficient progress"" has been made on citizens' rights, Ireland and the financial settlement. Diplomats reached broad agreement on money and citizens over the weekend. There is strong opposition to a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland I understand some sovereignty issues are still outstanding on citizens' rights but one EU source told me: ""The Brits gave us pretty much everything we asked for."" Ireland remains the outstanding issue. Dublin wants written assurances from Downing Street that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected and that there will be no re-introduction of a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The search for political wording acceptable to all sides continued throughout the night. Brussels deemed it a good omen on Sunday when Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP - a unionist party in Northern Ireland that supports Theresa May's government in Westminster - said she was in favour of a ""sensible Brexit"". UK divorce bill offer worth up to 50bn euros The EU has told member state Ireland that it has the final say in any part of the Brexit agreement that pertains to the Irish border but Prime Minister Leo Varadkar seems loath to use his veto. In trade terms alone, Ireland believes it has more to lose than any other EU country, if there is a no-deal scenario post-Brexit. This is why so much is riding on Monday on Theresa May's lunch with EU Commission chief Jean Claude Juncker. Jean-Claude Juncker will meet European Parliament representatives ahead of Theresa May's arrival Blood, sweat and tears of negotiating teams aside, the prime minister's personal assurances will be sought in Brussels, on Ireland and other matters. If all goes smoothly, a joint UK-EU report is being drawn up for publication later in the day to lock in all Brexit understandings agreed to date. A sure sign that the commission is feeling confident is Jean-Claude Juncker's invitation to European Parliament representatives to meet ahead of Theresa May's arrival. The parliament is particularly exacting when it comes to citizens' rights and it has a Brexit deal veto. The European Commission president clearly feels he has enough in his pocket to get them on board. All EU sources I have spoken to described themselves at the very least as ""cautiously optimistic"" ahead of the prime minister's arrival. Why is the Northern Ireland border question so hard? Irish demand post-Brexit border promise So much so, that EU diplomats tell me they're already debating the ""what next?"" What mandate should the lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier be given by Europe's leaders at their mid-December summit if there is a green light to proceed to Brexit Phase 2? There is heated debate right now as to whether Mr Barnier will first be instructed to talk transition deals with the UK and only later - in March next year - have his mandate widened to include negotiations on the future shape of EU-UK relations, which would touch on trade, of course. Brussels may be feeling Brexit-buoyant at the start of the day but if all goes according to their plan - and that, I stress, is by no means a fait accompli - there will be pockets of disgruntlement amongst those in the UK who view the government as caving in to EU demands and amongst EU countries like Germany that are more cautious than the EU Commission about leaping in to the realms of Brexit Phase 2.

MPs are discussing amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill proposed by the Welsh and Scottish governments. It's been a frenetic few hours in Brussels and it is not clear we are any the wiser as to whether an agreement to move the Brexit process onto the next phase will be reached in time for next week's summit. Here is a summary of what has happened. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been talking to the BBC about today's Brexit developments. She says no-one wants to see a hard border on the island of Ireland and suggests the ""unhealthy influence"" of the DUP at Westminster was a major factor in the apparent failure to finalise an agreement. If the concept of a distinct status for Northern Ireland is borne out in the final phase one agreement, she says ""this will change everything"". The bottom line is the UK government appears to be accepting parts of the UK can effectively stay within the single market, so if that's good enough and possible enough for Northern Ireland there's no reason why it can't be the case for Scotland.""  The Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn says Theresa May is planning to return to Brussels on Wednesday following Prime Minister's Questions. The trip probably wasn't scheduled in her diary but with the crunch summit less than 10 days away, it is probably impossible for her to stay away. Allow Twitter content?

At his press conference a moment ago, the Irish PM was quizzed about his sartorial choices when he arrived for this morning's special cabinet meeting. I think this is what the journalist was talking about when she asked him whether tank tops were back in. Asked whether he has spoken to the Democratic Unionists - reported to have vetoed an outline agreement on the Irish border - Mr Varadkar said he had not done so personally although there were links between the parties. The DUP has an important role to play but it is not the only party in Northern Ireland and it is not his job to ensure the DUP were ""on side"". He again insists that he only has the welfare of his people at heart and he is ""not looking to pick a row with anyone or advance a hidden agenda"". And he says he believes Theresa May is negotiating in good faith. I do trust the PM and I am happy to allow her more time if that is what is needed. And there is more time.  Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Factory workers Julie and Mandy explain how life has changed for them in the city of Hull Speaking in Dublin, Mr Varadkar says his government agreed to a draft text on the Irish border drawn up by the UK and EU. He expresses ""surprise and disappointment"" that the UK could not agree to the text. While he acknowledges that Theresa May is negotiating in ""good faith"" and has a lot on her plate, he says he is committed to securing an agreement and moving onto the second phase of negotiations. Speaking now, Irish PM Leo Varadkar says there has been substantial progress in recent intensive negotiations, including on the continuation of the Good Friday Agreement, the Commons Travel Area and Ireland's membership of the EU. But he says the most difficult issue was Ireland's desire for a cast-iron guarantee and written assurance that there will be no hard border with Northern Ireland. He insists that Dublin has ""no hidden agenda"" insisting it no more wanted to see a border in the Irish Sea as it would a ""border between Newry and Dundalk"". Speaking on a trip to India, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said Theresa May has accepted the principle of different parts of the UK getting a bespoke Brexit deal. He's referring to the idea, floated earlier, of Northern Ireland having the same regulations as the Republic of Ireland. London voted to remain in the EU...Given the importance of protecting tens of thousands of jobs, the government should be saying to London 'membership of the single market, customs union and the cast-iron guarantee for EU citizens'.""  Earlier we referred to a meeting Theresa May was having with European Council President Donald Tusk. Here we have the evidence that it is happening. Like the earlier encounter with Jean-Claude Juncker, I think it is fair to say that the body language is a little bit strained although maybe it is the increasing frequencies of these encounters rather than the personal dynamics that are to blame. BBC News Channel Tory Brexiteer Peter Bone says media speculation about a likely deal earlier today had got ""totally out of hand"". Mr Bone, who has just come out of a briefing of MPs, said the prospect of the whole of Ireland remaining in the customs union was ""nonsense"" and ""just not right"", suggesting, contrary to what it appeared, that it was never seriously on the table. ""It has caused a lot of unnecessary alarm,"" he tells BBC News, insisting any Irish border deal had to have the backing of the people of Northern Ireland. The MP says it is fine if no overall deal is reached - he's sanguine about the prospect of the UK falling back onto World Trade Organisation rules - but he says the UK has to decide what it wants to do soon, by the Spring at the latest. Both UKIP and the Lib Dems are unhappy about Theresa May's handling of negotiations but for different reasons. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who has campaigned for 20 years for the UK to leave the EU, said talk of Northern Ireland having the same customs and trade regulations as the Republic of Ireland was a ""concession too far"" from the government and would ""damage the integrity of the UK"". Mr Farage, who is also calling on Mrs May to step aside, was speaking before the DUP objected to such an idea and apparently vetoed a deal on these grounds. And, for the anti-Brexit Lib Dems, Tom Brake says the current situation could have been avoided by keeping the whole of the UK in the EU's customs union. Theresa May has cowered in front of her backbenchers and driven forward a reckless Brexit which risks destabilising the whole UK. Tom Brake, Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor The BBC
understands that Theresa May broke off her talks with Jean-Claude
Juncker after the Democratic Unionist Party leader, Arlene Foster, held a press conference
saying the party could not accept anything that led to divergence
between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The prime minister then phoned Ms Foster. During the call it was made
plain to the PM that the DUP, whose support is vital to the government being
able to pass their Brexit legislation, had significant concerns about the deal
being discussed that gave concessions to the Dublin
government. I understand Ms Foster told Theresa May that
she would not be able to support such a deal. Itâs been suggested too there are twenty or so Conservative MPs who had serious misgivings
about the compromises that were understood to be on the table. This video can not be played Jean Claude-Juncker says it was not possible to reach ""complete agreement"" in the Brexit talks, but ""significant progressâ has been made. Â© 2025 BBC.

Met chief condemns officers over Green,"The head of the Metropolitan Police has condemned retired officers over their claims about finding pornography on Conservative Damian Green's computer. Commissioner Cressida Dick said all officers had a duty to protect sensitive information they discovered. She said the Met was investigating whether an offence had been committed and that there could be a prosecution. First Secretary of State Mr Green denies watching or downloading pornography on his computer. Police 'in dangerous territory' with Green claims 'Thousands' of images viewed, ex-detective claims The allegations were first made last month by former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick, who led a 2008 inquiry into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched. Mr Quick made his claims after the Cabinet Office launched an investigation into accusations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby, which the MP has described as ""completely false"". And then on Friday, retired Met detective Neil Lewis said ""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Mr Green's parliamentary computer in 2008. Speaking on BBC Radio London, Ms Dick said: ""All police officers know very well that they have a duty of confidentiality, a duty to protect personal information. ""That duty in my view clearly endures after you leave the service. ""And so it is my view that what they have done based on my understanding of what they're saying... what they have done is wrong, and I condemn it."" Officers come across sensitive information every day, the commissioner said, and ""know full well"" it is their duty to protect it. She declined to give a ""running commentary"" on the Met's investigation - which is running parallel to the Cabinet Office probe - into whether confidential information has been disclosed. She added: ""I can say that we are reviewing...to see whether any offences have been committed."" Ms Dick told LBC there ""could be a prosecution"" but that this would be for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said a prosecution under the Data Protection Act - which includes a public interest defence - was a possibility, although he added that things were at a very early stage. The Met is currently reviewing the circumstances of the case and has not launched a full investigation, he added.

Airline crew 'saw North Korea missile',"The rocket is thought to have exploded on re-entry into the atmosphere Crew on board a Cathay Pacific plane flying over Japan reported a suspected sighting of last week's North Korean missile test, the airline said. The company confirmed to the BBC that crew witnessed ""what is suspected to be the re-entry"" of the missile into the earth's atmosphere. It added that as things stand no flight routes were being modified. On 29 November North Koreatested a new intercontinental ballistic missileit said could reach anywhere in the US. The test-launch raised tension further with South Korea and the US, who on Monday began their largest ever joint air exercise, which the North has branded an ""all-out provocation"". Described by Pyongyang as its ""most powerful"" missile, the 29 November launch ended up in Japanese waters but flew higher than any other the North had previously tested. According to the South China Morning Post, Cathay's general manager of operations Mark Hoey told staff in a message that ""today the crew of CX893 reported, 'Be advised, we witnessed the DPRK missile blow up and fall apart near our current location'"". The launch was reportedly also witnessed by two South Korean aircraft en route to Seoul from the US. Are Pyongyang's missiles a risk to planes? What could tip the balance into full conflict? North Korean missile pictures and what they tell us Though planes are thought to be safe from missile tests, a small risk remains Unlike other countries, North Korea usually does not announce its missile tests which means they come without warning or known flight path,posing a potential risk to planes. Pyongyang does have access to international civil aviation data so it can study the airspace before any launch. While the risk of an incident remains very low, it is something that airlines are taking into consideration. In early August, Air France expanded their no-fly zone around North Korea after it transpired one of its planes flew close to a North Korean missile path. Monday's air exercise between the US and South Korea, called Vigilant Ace, will last for five days. A US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth jet flies over the air base at Gwangju as joint military exercises get under way It will involve some 230 aircraft, including two dozen stealth jets, and tens of thousands of military personnel. The North has condemned the drills, saying over the weekend that the US was ""begging for nuclear war"" and that it would ""seriously consider"" counter-measures to the exercises.

Rise in children and pensioners facing poverty,"This video can not be played Pensioner poverty: 'It's heat or eat' Thousands of people are struggling to make ends meet in the UK every day, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has said. An additional 700,000 UK children and pensioners have fallen into relative poverty - households with less than 60% the median income - over the past four years. The charity said it was the first time in 20 years that poverty in these groups had seen sustained rises. Ministers say their support is helping pensioners and families out of poverty. According to theJRF report,,externalsince 2013 an extra 300,000 pensioners and 400,000 children are now living in poverty and the ""prospects for solving"" the problem ""currently look worrying"". ""It is a real struggle for thousands and thousands of people every day to make ends meets,"" Campbell Robb, chief executive of the JRF, told Radio 4's Today programme. Despite the government protecting the value of the basic state pension since 2010, the foundation says Pension Credit, a benefit paid to the poorest pensioners, has not kept pace with rising costs. Researchers say the rise in child poverty has been driven by stagnant wages for low income families and a freeze on benefits and changes to tax credits, which many families, both in and out of work, rely on. Karla McDonagh describes herself as ""on the bread line"". The 31-year-old from Cheshire is a single mother to son, Cameron. ""I go without as long as he's eating and happy,"" she said.  This can mean not having things like milk, sugar or butter. ""Sometimes it can be three days before I can afford to make something decent for tea. ""It's quite stressful. I have to sit back and reflect and think of options to make things better, re-budget my money - sometimes not pay my TV licence, just so I can go out and pay Â£25 on food at the end of the month. But I always get through it,"" she said. Some people are having to make a choice between heating and eating For Flo Singleton, she struggles to get by with her pension from a part-time job. ""I have worked, I have not scrounged all my life,"" she said. ""[But it has been] part-time only, because you have to fit it around the kids, don't you?"" She has resorted to spending time travelling on buses to keep warm, rather than turning on the heating at home. Ms Singleton added: ""It's heat or eat isn't it? If you go out, you don't have to have your heating on, do you? If you go on the buses, it doesn't cost you."" The charity says ending the benefits freeze is the single biggest change the government could do to help the 14m people - 4m children and 1.9m pensioners - now living in poverty. New threats to the poorest households include rising housing costs, higher food and energy bills, debts and not being able to contribute to a pension, said the foundation. The latest figures represent a ""real warning sign that our hard-fought progress is in peril,"" Mr Robb added. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams said the figures were ""totally unacceptable"" and  ""a truly terrifying prospect for millions trying to make ends meet"". A government spokesman said since 2010, the number of people in absolute poverty - an assessment of basic living needs which takes into account a household's access to services as well as income - had fallen by more than 500,000. He said: ""We are spending an extra Â£4.2bn on pensioners, carers and disabled people next year, and continue to spend around Â£90bn a year supporting people of working age, including those who are out of work or on a low income."" The report's reference to relative poverty,externalmeans that a family has an income of less than 60% of median income for their family type, after housing costs. For couples with no children, this is an income anything less than Â£248 a week. For a single person with no children, it is anything less than Â£144. For a couple with two children, aged five and 14, an income of less than Â£401 a week is considered relative poverty, whilst a single parent with children of the same age would be in poverty if they had less than Â£297 per week.

Regulator warns MPs over shared passwords,"The MP Nadine Dorries wrote on Twitter that all her staff had her login details The UK's data privacy regulator has cautioned MPs about sharing work computer passwords. It follows tweets by three Conservative Party MPs over the weekend claiming that they had provided their staff with access to their login details. Sharing passwords is not a breach of the UK's Data Protection Act. But the law says that ""appropriate"" security measures concerning personal data must be in place and that those with access must be properly vetted. ""We're aware of reports that MPs share logins and passwords and are making enquiries of the relevant parliamentary authorities,"" the Information Commissioner's Office said in a tweet of its own. ""We would remind MPs and others of their obligations under the Data Protection Act to keep personal data secure."" It added a link to a guide outlining the types of safetymeasures that should be enforced,external. The issue was raised by Nadine Dorries - the member of parliament for mid-Bedfordshire - who posted on Saturday evening that her team logged into her computer using her login details ""everyday"".

Driving examiners strike as new test begins,"Most people due to take a driving test on Monday did so despite a strike by examiners, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) said. The examiners' strike coincided with a new type of driving test introduced this week. The action, taken in conjunction with vehicle inspectors, was in protest at changes to terms and conditions and some aspects of the new test. However, the DVSA said 92% of tests were taken as planned. The action was organised by the Public and Commercial Service (PCS) union, which warned that thousands of tests could have been be cancelled. The agency employs about 1,800 driving examiners and conducts some 7,000 car driving tests a day on average. DVSA chief driving examiner, Lesley Young, said: ""Today's launch of the new driving test marks a significant milestone in its history, helping prepare new drivers for a lifetime of safe driving. ""Thank you to our customers for their patience and understanding during this unsettling time and to our driving examiners whose commitment and dedication made the launch of the new test a resounding success."" The agency said just under a quarter of the driving examiner workforce went on strike in England, Wales and Scotland on Monday. A second day of action is planned for Tuesday. The new test is being introduced along with changes to working conditions, which the union says means that employees will have to work longer and harder. The PCS union said the new tests were being accompanied by a ""flexible working"" regime, which gives managers the ability to deploy driving test examiners anywhere they choose without notice. It said this could mean staff working six days a week, but only being paid for five. The DVSA said this was ""simply not true"", adding that it had recruited at least 320 extra driving examiners in the past year. It said the new test offered a more realistic assessment of driving skills. There are four main changes: The independent driving part of the test will increase from 10 minutes to 20 During the independent driving part of the test, most candidates will be asked to follow directions from a sat nav The reverse around a corner and turn-in-the-road (three-point turn) manoeuvres will no longer be tested. Candidates will be asked to do one of three possible reversing manoeuvres - either parallel parking at the side of the road, parking in a bay, or pulling up on the right-hand side of the road, reversing for two car lengths and rejoining the traffic Candidates will have to answer two vehicle safety questions while driving PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said his union had tried to negotiate: ""No one takes strike action lightly and we acknowledge the disruption to the driving tests for learner drivers keen to pass their test."" The strike also involves vehicle inspectors employed by the DVSA, who are also facing changes to their working conditions. The PCS union said about 1,500 members across the two categories were taking part in the strike action. PCS union members voted by 84% in favour of striking, on a 70% turnout.

Ms Dugdale said she expected criticism but would be coming home ""with my head held high"". She faced a backlash after it emerged she joined the reality showwithout permission from the Labour Party. The MSP lasted 11 days in the camp. The Edinburgh and Lothians MSP had asked for three weeks off from Holyrood business but did not reveal her plans to go on the show. New leader Richard Leonard initially had said he was ""not persuaded"" that his predecessor should be punished, despite his own ""personal disappointment"" andstrong criticism from others in the party. Scottish Labour later announced that Ms Dugdaleshe would not be suspended from the party. However, she will be interviewed on her return to parliament and will ""have the opportunity to present her account of events."" Ms Dugdale was expected to be paid tens of thousands of pounds, part of which she said she would be donating to charity, along with her MSP's salary for the time she is away. In an interview with ITV's Lorraine, she said: ""I always knew it was going to be a big gamble for me politically. ""I know I'm going back to a good deal of criticism and I will take that face on. I've got to have a lot of conversations with people but I'm going back with my head held high. ""I came out here to do what I wanted to do. I love my job, it's a great privilege to be a Labour politician and I fully intend on continuing to do it for a very long time."" The 36-year-old said she appeared on the programme to show young viewers that not all politicians were like fellow camper Stanley Johnson, who is Boris Johnson's father. In her exit interview she told presenters Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly she wanted to use the appearance to talk about the things she cared about. She added: ""And to take on the myth that every politician looks like Stanley - old, white, male, pale and stale. I wanted to show that there is a variety of people out there.""

"Rise in children and pensioners facing povertyPension changes, stagnant wages and a freeze on benefits have been blamed for rising poverty.1han hour agoUKComments","This video can not be played Pensioner poverty: 'It's heat or eat' Thousands of people are struggling to make ends meet in the UK every day, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has said. An additional 700,000 UK children and pensioners have fallen into relative poverty - households with less than 60% the median income - over the past four years. The charity said it was the first time in 20 years that poverty in these groups had seen sustained rises. Ministers say their support is helping pensioners and families out of poverty. According to theJRF report,,externalsince 2013 an extra 300,000 pensioners and 400,000 children are now living in poverty and the ""prospects for solving"" the problem ""currently look worrying"". ""It is a real struggle for thousands and thousands of people every day to make ends meets,"" Campbell Robb, chief executive of the JRF, told Radio 4's Today programme. Despite the government protecting the value of the basic state pension since 2010, the foundation says Pension Credit, a benefit paid to the poorest pensioners, has not kept pace with rising costs. Researchers say the rise in child poverty has been driven by stagnant wages for low income families and a freeze on benefits and changes to tax credits, which many families, both in and out of work, rely on. Karla McDonagh describes herself as ""on the bread line"". The 31-year-old from Cheshire is a single mother to son, Cameron. ""I go without as long as he's eating and happy,"" she said.  This can mean not having things like milk, sugar or butter. ""Sometimes it can be three days before I can afford to make something decent for tea. ""It's quite stressful. I have to sit back and reflect and think of options to make things better, re-budget my money - sometimes not pay my TV licence, just so I can go out and pay Â£25 on food at the end of the month. But I always get through it,"" she said. Some people are having to make a choice between heating and eating For Flo Singleton, she struggles to get by with her pension from a part-time job. ""I have worked, I have not scrounged all my life,"" she said. ""[But it has been] part-time only, because you have to fit it around the kids, don't you?"" She has resorted to spending time travelling on buses to keep warm, rather than turning on the heating at home. Ms Singleton added: ""It's heat or eat isn't it? If you go out, you don't have to have your heating on, do you? If you go on the buses, it doesn't cost you."" The charity says ending the benefits freeze is the single biggest change the government could do to help the 14m people - 4m children and 1.9m pensioners - now living in poverty. New threats to the poorest households include rising housing costs, higher food and energy bills, debts and not being able to contribute to a pension, said the foundation. The latest figures represent a ""real warning sign that our hard-fought progress is in peril,"" Mr Robb added. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams said the figures were ""totally unacceptable"" and  ""a truly terrifying prospect for millions trying to make ends meet"". A government spokesman said since 2010, the number of people in absolute poverty - an assessment of basic living needs which takes into account a household's access to services as well as income - had fallen by more than 500,000. He said: ""We are spending an extra Â£4.2bn on pensioners, carers and disabled people next year, and continue to spend around Â£90bn a year supporting people of working age, including those who are out of work or on a low income."" The report's reference to relative poverty,externalmeans that a family has an income of less than 60% of median income for their family type, after housing costs. For couples with no children, this is an income anything less than Â£248 a week. For a single person with no children, it is anything less than Â£144. For a couple with two children, aged five and 14, an income of less than Â£401 a week is considered relative poverty, whilst a single parent with children of the same age would be in poverty if they had less than Â£297 per week.

By the end of next year about 2,300 people will work for the social media company in the UK. The office will be Facebook's biggest engineering hub outside the US, and opens during its tenth year in the UK. Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's Europe, Middle East and Asia vice-president, said the company was ""more committed than ever to the UK"".

It will accommodate engineers and developers as well as marketing and sales teams. The building will also house a dedicated incubator space for start-ups, called LDN-LAB. UK-based start-ups will be invited to take part in three month programmes designed to help kickstart their businesses. Facebook experts from disciplines including engineering, product and partnerships will work with the companies as part of the initiative. Julian David of techUK, which represents 950 technology firms in the UK, welcomed a world-leading company such as Facebook investing in London despite the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.

Met Opera suspends Levine amid abuse claims,"James Levine was also a conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra New York's Metropolitan Opera says it has suspended the renowned conductor James Levine following allegations of sexual misconduct. The Met said Mr Levine, 74, would not appear this season and it had appointed a law firm to investigate his actions. Three men have now accused Mr Levine of abusing them decades ago when they were teenagers. Mr Levine, who was music director at the Met for 40 years, has not commented publicly on the accusations. He retired for health reasons in 2016 but has continued to work with the opera as music director emeritus. The Met announced on Saturday it was investigating a claim based on a 2016 police report in which a man accused Mr Levine of abusing him as a teenager in the 1980s. Peter Gelb, general manager of the Met, told the New York Times,externalon Sunday that it had decided to suspend its relationship with the conductor and cancel his forthcoming engagements after learning of the accounts of two other men who described similar sexual encounters beginning in the late 1960s. ""While we await the results of the investigation, based on these news reports, the Met has made the decision to act now,"" Mr Gelb said in a statement on Twitter, adding: ""This is a tragedy for anyone whose life has been affected."" The Times said the Met had been aware of the police report since last year. However, Mr Levine had denied the accusations and the Met had heard nothing further from police, the newspaper added. The accusations follow a series of sexual abuse and harassment claims made against high-profile figures in the entertainment industry. Allow Twitter content?

He said: ""We are spending an extra Â£4.2bn on pensioners, carers and disabled people next year, and continue to spend around Â£90bn a year supporting people of working age, including those who are out of work or on a low income."" The report's reference to relative poverty,externalmeans that a family has an income of less than 60% of median income for their family type, after housing costs. For couples with no children, this is an income anything less than Â£248 a week. For a single person with no children, it is anything less than Â£144. For a couple with two children, aged five and 14, an income of less than Â£401 a week is considered relative poverty, whilst a single parent with children of the same age would be in poverty if they had less than Â£297 per week.

'Wear a scarf' to stop asthma attacks,"Covering the mouth and nose can help to warm up air being breathed in by those with asthma Asthma sufferers are being encouraged to wear a scarf over their nose and mouth to prevent asthma attacks this winter. Breathing in cold, damp air can make the airways tighten and trigger an attack in three out of four people, charity Asthma UK says. This can leave people coughing, wheezing and gasping for breath. The charity's#Scarfie campaign,externalsays ""a scarf can save a life"" but it's not a replacement for asthma medicines. Four million people with asthma in the UK say that breathing in cold winter air makes their asthma symptoms worse. Ethan Jennings, who is nearly four, and from Lancashire, has had severe asthma symptoms since he was a baby. In one year, he was rushed to hospital 17 times for treatment. His dad, Trevor, says winter is always a bad time for him. Ethan was 11 months old when he first started gasping for breath ""When it gets cold, it's bedlam, he's more prone to colds and that brings out his symptoms."" The winter when he turned one was particularly awful - ""we nearly lost him"", Trevor says. Ethan spent a week in hospital fighting for his life having been given all available treatments. Since then, he has responded better but his parents know that they have to be particularly vigilant in winter. ""I'm just waiting to hear a cough. He hasn't yet got the vocabulary to tell me his chest is tight, but that is coming. ""In the meantime, anything we can do to protect him when he's outdoors - we do it."" Dr Andy Whittamore, clinical lead at Asthma UK and a practising GP, said just going outside on a cold day could be life-threatening for many people with asthma. ""Living in the UK means that cold weather is impossible to avoid over winter, but if people have asthma, simply wrapping a scarf around their nose and mouth can warm up the air before they breathe it in, reducing their risk of having an asthma attack. ""We are urging everyone - whether they have asthma or know someone that does - to share the message that something as simple as a scarf could save a life."" In the UK, 5.4 million people have asthma and just over one million of them are children. Last year, 1,410 people died from asthma - 14 were children.

"Trump lashes out at FBI over Russia probeIn a Twitter tirade, the president issues a fresh denial that he tried to obstruct an FBI investigation.14h14 hours agoUS & Canada","Donald Trump's presidency has been overshadowed by the inquiry into collusion with Russia Donald Trump lashed out at the FBI on Sunday, issuing a fresh denial that he asked former director James Comey to drop an investigation into the conduct of one of his top aides, Michael Flynn. In a Twitter tirade, Mr Trump said the FBI's reputation was ""in tatters"". His attack came amid a flurry of developments in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the US election. Mr Trump denies that his team colluded with Russia to get him elected. Reports emerged over the weekend that Mr Mueller, a former FBI director, had dismissed an FBI officer from the investigation during the summer after he was discovered to have made anti-Trump remarks in text messages. The president seized on the officer's dismissal, tweeting: ""Report: 'ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE' Now it all starts to make sense!"" Allow Twitter content?

A spokesman for Mr Mueller said the officer was dismissed from the investigating team as soon as the messages were discovered. Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser, announced on Friday that he was co-operating with Mr Mueller's investigation, in return for pleading guilty to a lesser charge. The former general admitted lying to the FBI and has been offered a reduced sentence of six months. Analysts say the deal indicates that Mr Flynn has incriminating information about one or more senior members of the Trump administration. Six big takeaways from the Flynn deal Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words In a series of tweets posted on Sunday morning, Mr Trump again attacked his former rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, who was investigated by the FBI ahead of the election after it emerged she had used a private email server to conduct state department business. No charges were brought against Mrs Clinton or her team. This video can not be played After Flynn's guilty plea, what next for the Russia investigation? In another tweet, the president accused ABC News of ""horrendously inaccurate and dishonest reporting"", after one of the network's reportersacknowledged making an errorin a story about the president. Chief investigative reporter Brian Ross reported that Mr Trump was a candidate when he directed Michael Flynn to make contact with Moscow. He later corrected his report to say Mr Trump was president-elect when he gave the order to Mr Flynn. Mr Ross has been suspended by the network for four weeks. The Comey-Flynncontroversy The president fired Mr Flynn in February for misrepresenting the nature of his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak to Vice-President Mike Pence. Then-FBI director James Comey alleges that in a private meeting the day after Mr Flynn was fired, the president asked him to show leniency to the dismissed aide, saying, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go."" Michael Flynn was sacked in February, just 25 days after taking the job Mr Comey took notes immediately after the meeting and shared copies with senior FBI officials. President Trump fired Mr Comey in May. Tweeting on Sunday, Mr Trump issued a fresh denial that he had pushed Mr Comey to drop the investigation into Mr Flynn. ""I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Legal experts say Mr Trump could theoretically have obstructed justice if he had attempted to have the FBI investigation into Mr Flynn squashed. The president's surprising admission in a tweet on Saturday - that he knew Mr Flynn had lied to the FBI when he fired him - contradicted his own account from the time, and may have added weight to accusations that he obstructed justice. White House lawyer John Dowd later told the Axios news website that he had drafted the controversial tweet and sent the text to White House social media director Dan Scavino. The revelations soured what should have been a celebratory weekend for the president, after his sweepingtax reform bill scraped through the Senateearly on Saturday morning.

'Supermoon' brightening up skies,"The ""supermoon"" rising above Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire. Skywatchers have enjoyed spectacular views of this month's ""supermoon"" - when the Moon appears larger and brighter in the sky. The supermoon phenomenon happens when the Moon reaches its closest point to Earth, known as a perigee Moon. The Moon circuits the Earth in an elliptical or oval orbit - a supermoon occurs when the perigee Moon is also a full Moon. The supermoon was the last opportunity to see one in 2017. The moon loomed above Yeadon, in Leeds To observers, the Moon appears about 7% larger and 15% brighter, although the difference is barely noticeable to the human eye. Last year the Moon made its closest approach to Earth since 1948- it will not be that close again until 25 November 2034. Nasa has called this weekend's sighting the first in a ""supermoon trilogy"",externalover the next two months, with others to come on 1 January and 31 January. Top tips to photograph a supermoon December's full Moon is traditionally known as the cold Moon. The full Moon on Sunday afternoon - when it sits opposite the sun in the sky - was 222,761 miles from Earth, closer than its average 238,900 miles. The supermoon over the Christmas light trail at Blenheim Palace The supermoon has also been seen over a lighthouse in South Shields, South Tyneside. This Moon's elliptical orbit means that its distance from Earth is not constant but varies across a full orbit. But within this uneven orbit there are further variations caused by the Earth's movements around the Sun. These mean that the perigee - the closest approach - and full moon are not always in sync. But occasions when the perigee and full moon coincide have become known as supermoons.

Venezuela unveils new virtual currency,"President Maduro made the announcement during his weekly TV and radio programme Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has announced the creation of a new virtual currency in a bid to ease the country's economic crisis. He said the Petro would be backed by Venezuela's oil, gas, gold and diamond wealth. Opposition lawmakers, however, poured scorn on the plan. Venezuela's economy has been hit by falling oil revenue and the plummeting value of its existing currency, the bolivar. President Maduro has also railed against US sanctions which he describes as a ""blockade"". In a televised announcement on Sunday, Mr Maduro said the new crypto-currency would allow Venezuela ""to advance in issues of monetary sovereignty, to make financial transactions and overcome the financial blockade"". ""The 21st Century has arrived!"" he added to cheers from supporters. Venezuela: To default or to pay Venezuela in crisis He gave no details on how, or when, the new currency would be launched. Oil has long been the mainstay of the Venezuelan economy The move follows increasing global interest in the crypto-currency Bitcoin. A US regulator recently said it would let two traditional exchanges begin trading in Bitcoin-related financial contracts, although the digital currency continues to prove volatile. Venezuela owes an estimated $140bn (Â£103bn) to foreign creditors and economists suggest Mr Maduro is looking to try to pay them with Petros as he seeks to restructure the country's debt. Opposition lawmakers insisted the proposed currency would need the backing of the National Assembly, and some doubted it would ever happen. ""It's Maduro being a clown. This has no credibility,"" opposition lawmaker and economist Ãngel Alvarado told Reuters news agency. Venezuela has historically relied on its oil wealth to support its economy but a decline in oil prices has sent the country into economic and political crisis. The US and European Union have imposed sanctions, citing repressive policies by the government. Last month,Russia agreed to restructure $3.15bn (Â£2.4bn) in debt owed by Venezuela. The deal allows Venezuela to make ""minimal"" repayments on its Russian obligations over the next six years.

Inmate injured in jail disturbance,"The violence was contained in one wing, the Prison Service said An inmate has been injured during a disturbance at a jail that led to riot officers being called in. Specialist ""Tornado"" squad officers were brought in at HMP Swaleside, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, on Sunday. A small number of inmates on one wing were involved in the violence, which has since been ""successfully resolved"", the Prison Service (PS) said. Almost a year ago, up to 60 inmatestook over part of the prisonfor 12 hours. On the latest incident, the PS said: ""We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those responsible will be referred to police and could spend longer behind bars."" In September, a report revealed there had been an""unacceptable escalation of instability""at the jail. The HM Inspectorate of Prisons said there had been too many assaults on both staff and prisoners and the smuggling of weapons was an issue.

PM in Brussels for key Brexit talks,"The UK and EU have failed to reach an agreement to move to the next stage of Brexit talks, Theresa May has said. The prime minister said talks would reconvene ""before the end of the week"" and she was ""confident we will conclude this positively"". The talks are understood to have broken down after the Democratic Unionist Party refused to accept concessions on the Irish border issue. Downing Street said that was not the only outstanding problem. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a deal had been done, but the UK appeared to change its mind over the Irish border question after pressure from the DUP. ""I am surprised and disappointed that the British government now appears not to be in a position to conclude what was agreed earlier today,"" he told a press conference in Dublin. Ireland 'disappointed' at no deal on Brexit Kuenssberg: What on earth happened? What will happen to EU citizens in the UK? Sturgeon calls for 'special' Brexit deals BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""Is it a complete disaster? No. Does it mean this whole process is totally doomed? No, it does not. Is it a pretty significant disappointment? Yes, it is. ""Officially, the line out of government tonight is that Number 10 was not taking a deal for granted... but a government source has actually told me that as recently as this morning the prime minister was told that the DUP had been squared off."" Northern Ireland's DUP has 10 MPs at Westminster, and their support is vital to the government. This is because the Conservatives are without a Commons majority since June's general election, and rely on a deal with the DUP to ensure they can survive key votes. How the talks broke down Mrs May is understood to have broken off from talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker to speak to DUP leader Arlene Foster. The UK had reportedly been prepared to accept that Northern Ireland may remain in the EU's customs union and single market in all but name. But Mrs Foster then said her party ""will not accept any form of regulatory divergence"" that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. ""During the call it was made plain to the PM that the DUP had significant concerns about the deal being discussed that gave concessions to the Dublin government,"" said the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. ""I understand Mrs Foster told Theresa May that she would not be able to support such a deal. ""It's been suggested too that there are 20 or so Conservative MPs who had serious misgivings about the compromises that were understood to be on the table."" This video can not be played DUP accuses Dublin of trying to change the Good Friday agreement unilaterally DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party would not accept any Brexit deal that ""separates"" Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Her party's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson claimed Brussels has been trying to ""bounce the prime minister into acceding to the shape of a deal they want"" and many of her own backbenchers would not accept it. He said the DUP objected to the form of words used in a draft document, which he said referred to ""regulatory alignment"" and ""no regulatory divergence"" between Northern Ireland and the EU. Both phrases were ""simply EU speak for keeping Northern Ireland in the European market"" and ""in effect, part of the United Kingdom would be kept within the single market,"" he said. Asked if the DUP would pull out of the confidence and supply agreement they have with the Conservative government in Westminster over this issue, he said: ""I think that her (Theresa May) problem isn't going to be just with the DUP"". This video can not be played Irish PM Leo Varadkar ""surprised and disappointed"" Leo Varadkar says he wants a written guarantee that there will be no return to a ""hard border"" between the Republic and Northern Ireland - and this is what he thought he had got. ""I am surprised and disappointed that the British government now appears not to be in a position to conclude what was agreed earlier today,"" he said. ""I accept that the prime minister has asked for more time and I know that she faces many challenges, and I acknowledge that she is negotiating in good faith. ""But my position and that of the Irish government is unequivocal: Ireland wants to proceed to phase two. ""However, we cannot agree to do this unless we have firm guarantees that there will not be a hard border in Ireland under any circumstances."" He said it was important to listen to the DUP, but also to bear in mind the position of other parties in Northern Ireland - and it should not be forgotten that the majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU. This video can not be played Theresa May is ""confident we will conclude this positively"" Speaking at a joint press conference in Brussels with Mr Juncker, Mrs May said: ""We have been negotiating hard. And a lot of progress has been made. And on many of the issues there is a common understanding. ""And it is clear, crucially, that we want to move forward together. ""But on a couple of issues some differences do remain which require further negotiation and consultation."" This video can not be played Jean Claude-Juncker says it was not possible to reach complete agreement in the Brexit talks, but ""significant progressâ was ma The European Commission President said ""it was not possible to reach complete agreement today"" despite their ""best efforts"". But he added: ""I have to say that we were narrowing our positions to a huge extent today, thanks to the British prime minister, thanks to the willingness of the European Commission to have a fair deal with Britain. ""I'm still confident that we can reach sufficient progress before the European Council of 15 December. ""This is not a failure, this is the start of the very last round. ""I'm very confident that we will reach an agreement in the course of this week."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The real reason for today's failure is the grubby deal the government did with the DUP after the election."" He added that ""Labour has been clear from the outset that we need a jobs-first Brexit deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom"". Conservative MPs emerging from a Downing Street briefing on the talks said they had been told Mrs May had not agreed the proposal on regulatory alignment put forward by the Irish government. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said that the Conservatives were ""as one"" with the DUP on the importance of keeping the United Kingdom together, and the mood among Tory MPs in the meeting was ""contented, not divisive or unhappy"". Backbench Remain supporter Anna Soubry said no Conservative MP wanted Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK, which she said would be ""a gift"" to the Scottish National Party. The ""simple solution"" would be for the whole of the UK to remain in the single market and customs union, she added. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""As each day goes by, it becomes clearer that the best deal for everyone is to stay in Europe. The people of the UK must be given a vote on the deal and an opportunity to exit from Brexit."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that if Northern Ireland was allowed to operate under different rules there was ""surely no good practical reason"" why other parts of the UK could not do the same - a message echoed by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and London Mayor Sadiq Khan. The EU says it will only recommend the start of talks about future trade arrangements when it deems ""sufficient progress"" has been made on three issues - the status of expat citizens, the ""divorce"" bill and the Northern Ireland border. The UK has been set a deadline of this week to come forward with an improved offer on them, and hopes that the go-ahead for future talks will then be given at an EU leaders' summit on 14-15 December. On the ""divorce bill"", the UK is understood to have recently increased its offer, which could be worth up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). Reality Check: How do you work out the Brexit bill? On the issue of rights for the three million EU citizens in Britain, the UK has agreed that those who already have permanent residence will not have to pay to apply for settled status. Those making a first time application for the right to stay after Brexit, however, will face a charge - reportedly similar to the cost of applying for a passport. Settled status will grant those who have spent five years in the UK equal rights on healthcare, education, benefits and pensions to British citizens. Ministers have already suggested people legally resident in the UK before an as yet unspecified cut-off date will be allowed to stay and they want to make the process ""as easy as renewing a driving licence"".

Katya Adler: Brussels 'unusually optimistic',"Theresa May will hold talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Brussels is in an upbeat mood. Which is rather rare when it comes to Brexit. In fact, I've been taken aback by the positive tone of my many conversations. Suddenly, after hearing endless EU complaints about perceived foot-dragging by London during these grey and grumpy months of Brexit negotiations, EU diplomats spoke to me this weekend of ""movement"", ""traction"" and a ""lack of negativity"" in the frantic last-minute talks ahead of Monday's visit by Theresa May. Of course, this might all be misplaced optimism. After all, as both the UK and EU love to point out, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that won't be until autumn next year but... What's at stake here is not a final Brexit deal but whether Brexit negotiations can now widen to include talk of a transition deal and the future shape of EU/UK relations (in or out of the single market and customs union etc). Reality Check: What's happening with the divorce bill? That depends on whether the EU deems that ""sufficient progress"" has been made on citizens' rights, Ireland and the financial settlement. Diplomats reached broad agreement on money and citizens over the weekend. There is strong opposition to a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland I understand some sovereignty issues are still outstanding on citizens' rights but one EU source told me: ""The Brits gave us pretty much everything we asked for."" Ireland remains the outstanding issue. Dublin wants written assurances from Downing Street that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected and that there will be no re-introduction of a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The search for political wording acceptable to all sides continued throughout the night. Brussels deemed it a good omen on Sunday when Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP - a unionist party in Northern Ireland that supports Theresa May's government in Westminster - said she was in favour of a ""sensible Brexit"". UK divorce bill offer worth up to 50bn euros The EU has told member state Ireland that it has the final say in any part of the Brexit agreement that pertains to the Irish border but Prime Minister Leo Varadkar seems loath to use his veto. In trade terms alone, Ireland believes it has more to lose than any other EU country, if there is a no-deal scenario post-Brexit. This is why so much is riding on Monday on Theresa May's lunch with EU Commission chief Jean Claude Juncker. Jean-Claude Juncker will meet European Parliament representatives ahead of Theresa May's arrival Blood, sweat and tears of negotiating teams aside, the prime minister's personal assurances will be sought in Brussels, on Ireland and other matters. If all goes smoothly, a joint UK-EU report is being drawn up for publication later in the day to lock in all Brexit understandings agreed to date. A sure sign that the commission is feeling confident is Jean-Claude Juncker's invitation to European Parliament representatives to meet ahead of Theresa May's arrival. The parliament is particularly exacting when it comes to citizens' rights and it has a Brexit deal veto. The European Commission president clearly feels he has enough in his pocket to get them on board. All EU sources I have spoken to described themselves at the very least as ""cautiously optimistic"" ahead of the prime minister's arrival. Why is the Northern Ireland border question so hard? Irish demand post-Brexit border promise So much so, that EU diplomats tell me they're already debating the ""what next?"" What mandate should the lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier be given by Europe's leaders at their mid-December summit if there is a green light to proceed to Brexit Phase 2? There is heated debate right now as to whether Mr Barnier will first be instructed to talk transition deals with the UK and only later - in March next year - have his mandate widened to include negotiations on the future shape of EU-UK relations, which would touch on trade, of course. Brussels may be feeling Brexit-buoyant at the start of the day but if all goes according to their plan - and that, I stress, is by no means a fait accompli - there will be pockets of disgruntlement amongst those in the UK who view the government as caving in to EU demands and amongst EU countries like Germany that are more cautious than the EU Commission about leaping in to the realms of Brexit Phase 2.

'No desire' in Ireland to delay Brexit,"This video can not be played Ireland's need for more detail ""not an unreasonable ask"" Ireland's deputy prime minister has said his country has ""no desire"" to delay the UK's Brexit talks. But Simon Coveney also warned that not enough progress had been made on the border with Northern Ireland. While Ireland was not looking for ""full detail"", it was seeking the parameters within which a solution could be found. His comments came ahead of a week of crucial decisions on whether the UK and EU would move ahead to the next phase of Brexit negotiations. UK Prime Minister Theresa May is due to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday to assess whether sufficient progress has been made on three core issues of citizens' rights, the ""divorce bill"" and the future of the Irish border with Northern Ireland. The 27 other member states will then meet on Wednesday to make a decision on going to a second phase of talks. Mr Coveney has been heavily involved with Ireland's stance on Brexit since becoming the foreign minister during the summer. He was also appointed as tÃ¡naiste - deputy prime minister -following the resignation of his colleague, Frances Fitzgerald, over a political rowthat threatened to bring down the government. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said Ireland did not want to exercise its veto on the issue. ""There is no desire, I can tell you, in Ireland, to delay this process,"" he said. The hardest border - BBC News ""But at the same time, we have a responsibility as a government to represent the interests on the island of Ireland. ""We believe that, as an island, Ireland is uniquely vulnerable and exposed to a potential bad outcome from Brexit. ""That is why we are looking for more progress than we have."" On Friday, EC President Donald Tusk (R) said Europe would stand by Ireland He also denied suggestions, made by some UK politicians, that the issue was being used to pave the way for Irish unity. ""That's simply not true,"" he said, adding that the government had maintained a consistent position for months. He said he was very keen to avoid ""a green versus orange debate"" between unionism and nationalism. ""Instead we're trying to protect the status quo."" Irish PM 'understands unionist concerns' Brexit offer 'must be acceptable to Ireland' ""We cannot allow some kind of collateral damage or unintended consequence of Brexit to have the recreation of a border."" In June,the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) signed a confidence-and-supply dealwith the UK's minority Conservative government. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the BBC there had been a much more aggressive stance on Brexit from the Irish government since Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney had taken office. He argued they wanted to dismiss technological solutions, which would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. ""They say none of that is acceptable. It has to be a political solution which involves the UK staying inside the single market or the customs union, or failing that Northern Ireland doing so,"" he added. Meanwhile, former UK prime ministerTony Blair told the BBC that a hard border would ""obviously"" cause tensions that could put the Good Friday Agreement- a landmark in the Northern Ireland peace process - at risk. Mrs May's scheduled lunch with the head of the European Commission is widely seen as her chance to persuade the EU to move negotiations forward. Along with the Irish border, other issues that the EU says must be agreed are the size of the UK's payment to the EU - the so-called divorce bill - and the status of EU nationals living in the UK. Mr Juncker will also meet European lawmakers before his lunch with Mrs May, possibly to discuss the UK's offer on citizens' rights. Progress on the ""divorce bill"" was made last week whenit emerged that the UK had offered the EU a sum of up â¬50bn (Â£44bn). Some Brexit supporters have complained that the sum is too high. TheLeave Means Leave campaign group on Sunday issued an open letter to Mrs May, urging her not to settle the divorce billwithout a series of agreed conditions. Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said on Friday the EU was ""fully behind"" Ireland's demand for no hard border on the island. ""The Irish request is the EU's request,"" he said, adding that he would consult the Irish prime minister before the next stage of Brexit talks.

Hunt: Back the PM or there's no Brexit,"Theresa May will hold talks with Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday There will be no Brexit at all unless Theresa May is supported, a cabinet minister has warned. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was not about a choice between ""this Brexit and that Brexit"". He was speaking as leading Brexit campaigners issued demands for Mrs May before agreeing any payments to the EU, including ending the European court's jurisdiction the moment the UK leaves. The UK voted for Brexit last year and is due to leave in March 2019. But negotiations between the EU and the UK have not yet reached a breakthrough. Brexit: All you need to know Farage: I'd take my EU pension What will the EU say at the summit? Reality Check: What's happening with Brexit divorce bill? Mr Hunt's remark, in an ITV interview, came as he defended the PM and sought to reassure critics that UK courts would be supreme after Brexit. He added: ""I think there's an even bigger point here, that the choice we face now is not between this Brexit and that Brexit; if we don't back Theresa May we will have no Brexit - and she is doing an unbelievably challenging job amazingly well."" Mrs May is due to travel to Brussels on Monday for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, hoping the EU will agree that ""sufficient progress"" has been made so far to begin trade talks. The BBC's Katya Adler says the mood in Brussels is positive, with diplomats working through the night to get details right. Our Europe editor said the status of the Irish border remains an ""outstanding issue"" but there was ""cautious optimism"" that enough progress has been made to widen the discussions.

The amount of money the UK will pay as part of Brexit has been one of the main sticking points so far The talks so far have focused on what happens to citizens' rights after Brexit, the amount of money the UK will pay, and the future of the Irish border. On the ""divorce bill"", the UK is understood to have recently increased its offer, which could be worth up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). There has also been lots of focus on the Ireland question in recent weeks, with the Irish government seeking more information on the ""frictionless border"" the UK wants to establish so customs checks are not needed. Will Ireland's demands delay Brexit? The EU will only move on to talk about future issues like trade when ""sufficient progress"" has been made on these subjects - and is due to decide whether this has happened at a summit on 14 and 15 December. The campaign group describes itself as the ""campaign for a clean Brexit"". Signatories of itsletter,externalto the prime minister include former Tory cabinet ministers Owen Paterson, John Redwood and Lord Lawson and ex-Brexit minister David Jones. Backbench MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg (Conservative) and Labour's Graham Stringer have signed it, as have several economists and business leaders. Former Conservative leader Lord Howard - who hasn't signed the letter - told the BBC's Sunday Politics he shared the ""aspirations"" it contains. The letter says the EU has not matched the ""patience and goodwill"" Theresa May has shown so far, and says the UK should make no ""further financial commitment"" until it agrees to certain conditions. From March 2019, they say: There should be an ""in principle"" agreement for a free trade deal to be in place The current free movement of EU citizens into the UK should end No new EU regulations should apply in the UK The European Court of Justice should ""cease to have any jurisdiction whatsoever"" in the UK Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Rees-Mogg said if the UK remains subject to European court rulings after March 2019 ""we will have stayed in the European Union"". Theresa May has promised that Brexit will end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. But she has suggested its remit might continue during an ""implementation period"" after March 2019, which would not satisfy the Leave Means Leave demands. On immigration, ministers have said free movement must end with the UK's EU membership but have promised businesses a ""cliff edge"" will be avoided in terms of employing foreign workers. Meanwhile, there have been more warnings on the subject of the EU court from former Court of Appeal judge Sir Richard Aitkens and ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. TheSunday Telegraph reports,externalthat Sir Richard, the president of the Lawyers for Britain group, has written to Mrs May saying that giving the ECJ the exclusive jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights would be ""tantamount to reversing the result of the 2016 referendum"". Speaking to BBC News, Mr Duncan Smith said that while the UK's courts would be able to take into account the European Court of Justice's decisions, it would be ""unacceptable"" for them to be bound by those decisions.

"Facebook to create 800 jobs in UKUS social media giant says 2,300 people will work for the company in the UK by the end of 2018.","This video can not be played Tech giant opens its biggest engineering hub outside the US Facebook is opening a new London office that will allow it to create 800 new UK jobs in 2018. By the end of next year about 2,300 people will work for the social media company in the UK. The office will be Facebook's biggest engineering hub outside the US, and opens during its tenth year in the UK. Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's Europe, Middle East and Asia vice-president, said the company was ""more committed than ever to the UK"".

Rail disruption sparked no-travel warning,"Passengers at London Euston had faced lengthy delays Rail passengers travelling to or from London Euston faced major disruption for hours on Sunday. National Rail had advised West Coast main line users not to travel as engineers worked to fix damaged wiring. At about 22:30 GMT, the company tweeted that""trains to and from London Euston are no longer being disrupted"",external. In separate disruption however, it said trains from London Paddington were being delayed by up to 90 minutes after a freight train broke down. The train was blocking the line between Hayes and Harlington and Paddington, affecting services between Oxford, Reading and London. Network Rail later tweeted that the delayshad been reduced to 30 minutes,external, but would affect trains until the end of Sunday as work to remove the freight train was carried out. Network Rail said the disruption to services had been resolved, by 22:30 GMT Services from Euston to a range of stations, including Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central and Liverpool Lime Street, had been affected. Many passengers took to Twitter, using #WatfordJunction to ask train operators about travel arrangements. Others shared details of their journeys. Allow Twitter content?

I was slightly shocked and surprised, given the guidance on their website was not to travel and to contact them for a refund."" Network Rail had advised passengers not to travel unless it was necessary. Tickets valid for travel on Sunday would be accepted on Monday, it added. Virgin Trains customers who chose not to travel can apply for a full refund at the point of purchase. Rail companies will give compensation for journeys delayed by 30 minutes or more.

"Inmate injured in jail disturbanceRiot-trained ""Tornado"" squad officers were called in to deal with violence among inmates on one wing.1han hour agoKent","The violence was contained in one wing, the Prison Service said An inmate has been injured during a disturbance at a jail that led to riot officers being called in. Specialist ""Tornado"" squad officers were brought in at HMP Swaleside, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, on Sunday. A small number of inmates on one wing were involved in the violence, which has since been ""successfully resolved"", the Prison Service (PS) said. Almost a year ago, up to 60 inmatestook over part of the prisonfor 12 hours. On the latest incident, the PS said: ""We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those responsible will be referred to police and could spend longer behind bars."" In September, a report revealed there had been an""unacceptable escalation of instability""at the jail.

Fewer children have part-time jobs,"Rachel, 13, says she manages to balance her part-time job and school work A Saturday job used to be a rite of passage for many children, but pressure to succeed at school and other factors means that's no longer the case. The number of schoolchildren with a part-time job has fallen by a fifth in the past five years, new figures show. The findings come from a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to all local authorities across the UK responsible for issuing child employment permits. Employers need to apply for a licence to hire staff under the age of 16. More than 140 authorities responded to the FOI with the numbers of permits issued in 2012 up to 2016, which showed a steady decline over that period. The number of permits fell by more than 20 percentage points between 2012 and 2016 - from 29,498 to 23,071. Dr Angus Holford from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex said he believed young people in compulsory education are fearful that a part-time job could hinder their performance at school. ""Teens are being told evermore that you need to get good GCSEs and A-levels to get a good job in the long term,"" he said. ""Passing the exams you need now is looming larger in people's concerns."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Properly regulated part-time work is a good way of helping young people learn skills that they will need in their working lives. ""It is vital that young people, and their parents, ensure that any part-time work they are undertaking leaves them with sufficient time for study and rest."" Krishan started a part-time job at age 15, working in a cafe at weekends But the drop in children working part-time isn't just about academic pressures, it's also due to changing consumer habits. One of the biggest drops in employment permits being issued was in Middlesbrough. In 2011, 101 permits were issued to 13 to 15-year-old children there, but in 2016 the number was just seven. The council said the ""massive drop"" was due to a decline in the number of people in the area who had a newspaper delivered to their door. Gareth Lewis, the chair of the National Network for Children in Employment and Entertainment, which sets guidelines and good practice for employers, said it was beneficial for children to have some form of part-time work. ""(This decline) is not something we have been made aware of â¦ it is hard to see why there may be a trend."" Middlesbrough Council said the decline in the number of permits being issued for employing children was down to a drop in demand for newspaper deliveries Rachel, 13, works in a discount shop in Manchester. She said: ""I enjoy my job because I'm earning money and it helps my confidence speaking to people and socialising with people I work with. ""I have to be quite organised with my homework, so I'll often do some at lunchtimes and then do the rest as soon as I get home from work."" Krishan started his first job at 15 working in a cafe in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. He has just turned 16. ""I really wanted to gain my own sense of independence and I thought that getting a job would be a good way to do that. ""I enjoy the sense of freedom it gives me because I'm able to make money as well as have free time to meet my friends."" Norfolk County Council issued 1,376 permits in 2016. This was equivalent to just over one in every 20 children (5.2%) aged 13 to 15. Dudley in the West Midlands had 471 permits, equivalent to 4.4% of 13 to 15-year-olds. Sir Martin Sorrell's dad gave him a part-time job while he was at school Is having a part-time job early on in life a marker for future professional success? Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising and public relations firm WPP, told the BBC: ""I was very lucky. My dad gave me a part-time job whilst at school. I was a salesman in one of his stores in Harlesden, selling radios, TVs, radiograms, fridges and vacuum cleaners, amongst other electrical accessories. ""I also spent several weeks reviewing credit analyses for hire-purchase agreements ... business was an inherent part of our lives, perhaps to an unusual degree. There weren't many other kids who read the Financial Times on the bus to school."" Has your Saturday job led to a full-time position? emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Some research has even shown that not taking on a Saturday or holiday job could be detrimental to a person later on. A 2015 study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that not participating in part-time work at school age had been blamed by employers' organisations for young adults being ill-prepared for full-time employment. It also said this had negative implications for workforce productivity. Employment regulations state that work for 13 to 15 year-olds must be light duties only and between the hours of 7am and 7pm (including holidays). Jobs that need a permit include retail work, newspaper rounds, waiting on tables, office or clerical work, and leaflet delivery. The rules are different for baby-sitting or the odd job for families and individuals. Data on the number of permits issued by local authorities was gathered by the BBC using the Freedom of Information Act. Daniel Wainwright of the BBC England Data Unit then used the official population estimates published by theOffice for National Statistics,externalto calculate the rate of employment of 13 to 15-year-olds in each area in 2016.
