Labour to redraft Euro election leaflets,"Labour is redrafting European election leaflets after accusations of ignoring a pledge to hold a further Brexit referendum, the BBC has been told. They will now refer to the party's preparations for a general election, with a referendum if necessary to avoid what it calls a ""bad Tory deal"". Jeremy Corbyn says Labour's ruling body will make a decision on Tuesday about backing a public vote on any deal. About 100 Labour MPs and MEPs want such a promise in the party manifesto. They wrote to members of the national executive committee before it meets on Tuesday to decide on the manifesto. Will Labour push for a public vote option? European elections: Lib Dems stand on 'stop Brexit' message Shadow Treasury ministers Clive Lewis and Anneliese Dodds and the shadow minister for disabled people Marsha de Cordova are among the frontbenchers backing the call for a confirmatory vote in any eventuality - not just to avoid a ""bad deal"". Some Labour MPs are opposed to holding another EU referendum, however, with nine shadow cabinet members thought to be sceptical about such a move. It had previously beenreported,externalthat Labour's leaflets for the 23 May European Parliament elections do not mention pushing for another referendum. Senior Labour backbencher Hilary Benn had questioned why no mention was made of a ""confirmatory referendum"" - despite the party twice supporting one in Commons votes. The party's deputy leaderTom Watson has also argued for Labour to promise another referendum, if it is to counter the electoral challenge posed by Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.

Labour agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's deal or talks end in no deal, there should be a general election. But if it cannot force one, it added, the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". The Labour leader was speaking in Peterborough on Saturday Mr Corbyn said on Saturday: ""The national executive will decide on Tuesday what will be in the European election manifesto and we will reflect the decisions made (at) last year's Labour Party conference - which were for a customs union, market access and rights protection within, with, the European Union. ""We would prefer to have a general election, but failing that if we get that agreement we are prepared to consider putting it to a confirmatory vote. That is a decision the national executive of the party will make."" Asked if the promise of a public confirmatory vote would be in election material, he added: ""It's important that the party, which is a democratic party structure, makes those decisions. Sadly, or perhaps it's a good thing, I'm not a dictator of the Labour Party."" Analysis by Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent When some of Labour's early European election literature was leaked, it provoked an internal row at a senior level. Why? Because it made no mention of another referendum. A letter from almost 100 MPs and MEPs calling for one has put additional pressure on the leadership. With the agreement of a senior official in Jeremy Corbyn's office, the campaign literature is now to be rewritten. There will be a mention of a confirmatory ballot/public vote (translation: a referendum) but only to avoid ""a bad Tory deal"". This won't go far enough for those MPs calling for a referendum on any deal. That is, even if Mr Corbyn reaches agreement on a ""soft"" Brexit with Theresa May, a chunk of his Parliamentary party still want another referendum. The issue will be hammered out when the ruling national executive meets on Tuesday to decide the manifesto for the European elections. Some members will argue for no referendum, some will argue for one but with caveats, and others will press for a public vote under all circumstances. Maybe the printing presses should be mothballed until Wednesday. A letter, signed by some Labour MPs and MEPs, said: ""Our members need to feel supported on doorsteps by a clear manifesto that marks us out as the only viable alternative to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. ""We need a message of hope and solidarity, and we need to campaign for it without caveats. To motivate our supporters, and to do the right thing by our members and our policy, a clear commitment to a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal must be part of our European election manifesto. ""We understand the many different pressures and views within our movement, but without this clear commitment, we fear that our electoral coalition could fall apart."" Richard Corbett, leader of Labour's MEPs and a member of the NEC, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The problem we face now is that Brexit is turning out to be so different from what was promised three years ago. ""Remember they said it would be easy - it's turning out to be rather complex. They said it would save loads of money that would all go to the NHS - it's turning out to be costly. ""They said it would not damage the economy - we are seeing firms move abroad, jobs lost, especially in manufacturing. ""Because it's so different, it's right that it should go back to the people for a final sign-off."" Labour Euro manifesto 'must back referendum' What happens after Brexit?

Obesity and depression linked in children,"Obese seven-year-olds are at greater risk of suffering emotional problems, such as anxiety and low mood, when they reach 11, a large UK study suggests. The Liverpool researchers found obesity and mental health were closely linked, and gradually increased throughout childhood. Girls tended to have higher BMIs and more emotional problems than boys. Although the study didn't look at causes, it said poverty was likely to increase the risk of both problems. The findings, to be presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Glasgow, strengthen the case for early prevention in overweight children, the researchers said. The researchers analysed information on more than 17,000 children born in the UK between 2000 and 2002, using statistical modelling to measure the link between obesity and emotional problems. They had information on children's height and weight (BMI) as well as reports on their emotional problems, provided by their parents, at ages three, five, seven, 11 and 14 years old. From the age of seven, the study found obesity and emotional problems were closely linked. But the link wasn't apparent in younger children. Dr Charlotte Hardman, senior psychology lecturer at the University of Liverpool, said the findings showed obesity and emotional problems were likely to develop hand-in-hand in childhood. She said that was important for those who treat children with obesity. ""People think it's as simple as eating less and exercising more - but it's much more complex than that. ""Obesity and emotional problems are intertwined."" She said it was already known that obesity and mental health problems were interlinked in adulthood, and the same could be true in childhood. ""From the age of seven, mental health and obesity appear to be entwined and exacerbate each other."" Dr Hardman said that meant children ""being stuck in vicious cycles"". ""As both rates of obesity and emotional problems in childhood are increasing, understanding their co-occurrence is an important public health concern, as both are linked with poor health in adulthood,"" she said. The study is published in JAMA Psychiatry. Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Pope donates $500,000 for Mexico migrants","Thousands of people from Central America are using any means necessary to reach the US Pope Francis has donated $500,000 (Â£387,000) to help migrants stranded in Mexico as they try to reach the US border, the Vatican said. The money comes from the Catholic Church's Peter's Pence fund, from church collections around the world. A statement said vital aid for the migrants was falling,externalas global media coverage of the crisis decreased. The Pope has previously criticised US President Donald Trump's aim of building a wall to keep migrants out. The US has put pressure on Mexico's government to stem the so-called caravans of people from Central America heading north. ""In 2018, six migrant caravans entered Mexico, for a total of 75,000 people. The arrival of other groups was announced,"" the Peter's Pence office said. ""All these people were stranded, unable to enter the United States, without a home or livelihood. The Catholic Church hosts thousands of them in the hotels within dioceses or religious congregations, providing basic necessities, from housing to clothing."" 'I pray to my dead daughter' Migrant teenager: 'I left without telling my mum' Pope Francis has encouraged governments to help those fleeing poverty and violence Many of the migrants say they are fleeing persecution, violence and poverty in their home countries. Last weekofficials detained nearly 400 migrantstravelling through Mexico's southern Chiapas state trying to reach the US. ""Media coverage of this emergency has been decreasing and as a result, aid to migrants by the government and private individuals has also decreased,"" the fund added. Six charts on the immigrants who call the US home The agony over an American dream ""In this context, Pope Francis donated US $500,000 to assist migrants in Mexico. This amount will be distributed among 27 projects in 16 dioceses and among Mexican religious congregations that have asked for help in order to continue providing housing, food and basic necessities to these our brothers and sisters."" In March, the Pope criticised political leaders who tried to erect barriers to keep migrants out. ""Builders of walls, be they made of razor wire or bricks, will end up becoming prisoners of the walls they build,"" he said.

Fracking tsar resigns after six months,"This video can not be played Natascha Engel says she has quit over ""ridiculously low' tremor limits The UK's shale gas commissioner is resigning after just six months, saying fracking is being throttled by rules preventing mini earthquakes. Current government rules,externalmean fracking must be suspended every time a 0.5 magnitude tremor is detected. But Natascha Engel, a former Labour MP, said the cautious approach to tremors had created a de facto ban on fracking. She claimed campaign groups ""were driving policy"" - but the groups say fracking damages the environment. In her resignation letter, Ms Engel - who was MP for North East Derbyshire from 2005 to 2017 - said government was ""pandering to what we know to be myths and scare stories"" about shale gas extraction. She told BBC News that when she took up the post, there had been an understanding that fracking would struggle to develop if the ""really ridiculously low"" limits on tremors had not been increased. Ms Engel said the role had been her ideal job but that ""where you've got government in such terrible paralysis, you do have to do something as dramatic as this"" in order to have your voice heard. She added: ""The profile of environmentalism has really been raised and I think the need to reduce our carbon emissions is absolutely urgent and fracking is absolutely one way we can do that."" A spokesperson for the government said it was confident that current regulations ""strike the right balance in ensuring the industry can develop, while ensuring any operations are carried out safely and responsibly"". What is fracking and why is it controversial? Ex-Labour MP is first fracking commissioner Ministers created the commissioner role to give confidence in regulation to local communities, the industry and regulators. In January, the government told shale firm Cuadrilla it had ""no intention of altering"" the regulations after the rulesrepeatedly halted work in Fylde, in Lancashire. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hascalled for a ban on frackingwhich he has said is ""not compatible with climate change prevention"". On Wednesday, the party is expected to call for a dramatic cut in the UK's carbon emissions and to press the government to declare a national ""climate emergency"". Ms Engel's departure will be welcomed by green groups who said her pro-fracking views precluded her from being an honest broker. A spokeswoman for the environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion said Ms Engel's resignation meant the government should ""rethink"" its energy policy and move away from fossil fuels. Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, which is in charge of shale gas extraction at sites in Lancashire, said: ""Natascha Engel has accurately assessed the current situation with regard to shale gas extraction in the UK. UK shale explorers have spent hundreds of millions of pounds proving that we have enough gas beneath our feet to supply homes across the country for the next 50 years."" He added: ""We remain wedded to a miniscule micro-seismic threshold which has no scientific basis and is without parallel anywhere else in the world. Meanwhile other industries - including key Government projects like Crossrail, quarrying operations and geothermal - produce ground vibrations far in excess every working day. The situation is beyond ridiculous, it's embarrassing."" The key issue is a government rule that forces the industry to stop fracking every time there is a micro-tremor of 0.5 magnitude. Miss Engel said: ""This amounts to a de facto ban. The paralysis we are seeing in Parliament (on fracking policy) is made worse by social media and a powerful environmental lobby making impossible demands on CO2 emissions."" The government said it wanted to support fracking because gas produces fewer carbon emissions than coal. Ms Engel said the result of the over-strict regulations would be difficulty in making those CO2 reductions, lower economic growth, and less energy security - as the UK would need to import gas rather than produce its own. She continued: ""These points have been made repeatedly but ministers ignore them and instead allow campaign groups to drive policy. ""So many local businesses face collapse. They have invested vast amounts to 'get ready for shale' as the government had told them to. There is, therefore, no purpose in this role."" She pointed out that 49 geoscientists had recently called on the government to relax what they called the over-zealous regulations. The Lancashire for Shale group said her departure was ""a damning indictment of government dithering"", calling for ministers to take another look at ""overly cautious rules on mini earth tremors"". A spokeswoman said: ""Instead of listening to the science and expert opinion, politicians appear to be taking their steer from a vocal minority, aided and abetted by well-funded international campaign groups and their slick PR machines."" Campaigners say fracking is environmentally damaging Environmentalists will be delighted with Ms Engel's decision to quit. They argued that fracking rules on the crowded land of the UK must be far more rigorous than in the open spaces of the USA. More fundamentally, they said it was madness for the UK to be seeking more gas when firms have already discovered far more fossil fuel than scientists say can be burned without wrecking the climate. Greenpeace UK head of politics Rebecca Newsom said the fracking industry had been ""stuck in a time warp"" and that ""it's not surprising some of its backers are getting tired of waiting"", adding: ""What's bad news for frackers is good news for everyone else."" Environmental charity Friends of the Earth said Ms Engel's suggestion that fracking could help reduce carbon emissions was ""outrageous"". It added the government had already ""bent over backwards to help the fracking industry"", despite it being ""bad news for our climate and environment"" and ""deeply unpopular with the public"". Earlier this week, the former CBI head Adair Turner said there was no place for fracking if the UK was to play its part in holding global temperature rise down to 1.5C. The government's policy has also been influenced by its own backbenchers. This week, the Teesside MP Simon Clark said in Parliament that the time for fracking had come and gone.

Mum found CCTV of daughter's hit-and-run,"Amber Carter-Thompson will be in a full leg cast for three months and may require surgery A woman whose leg was broken in a hit-and-run says her mother turned detective and tracked down CCTV of the crash after waiting a week for police to act. Amber Carter-Thompson was crossing a road in Northampton last Friday when she was struck. After leaving voicemails with police, her mother rang local businesses, one of which had footage of the incident. A police spokesman said it was investigating. Ms Carter-Thompson, from Sevenoaks, Kent, said her mother took matters into her own hands and ""within the space of six hours we got CCTV of it happening"". She said it was ""fairly disheartening"" police had not contacted the shops as they said they would. Ms Carter-Thompson said she had been crossing Wellingborough Road at the time of the hit-and-run The 28-year-old said she was crossing Wellingborough Road at about 23:00 BST with a friend when her leg was hit by the vehicle. Police spoke to her in the ambulance and the following day she was told to expect a call on Monday or Tuesday, but it never came. GMP: 43% of crimes not fully investigated Toddler death lorry driver jailed Huge 'concreteberg' blocks London sewers After leaving voicemail messages to get updates, she said her mother, Gail Thompson, ""decided to ring the shops, and all of the places said the police hadn't been around"". ""You want answers but you don't want to hinder any investigation, but to hear that they hadn't contacted the shops for CCTV in over a week, as I was told they would, was fairly disheartening,"" she said. ""A lot of people tape over CCTV if they don't need it,"" she said. ""If that had gone there would have been no evidence what had happened.""

Student visa cheat claims investigated,"This video can not be played Students deny claims they cheated on English tests The government is being investigated over its decision to cancel 36,000 student visas due to accusations of cheating on English language tests. The Home Office has also deported more than 1,000 people after its own probe into exam fraud began in 2014. Spending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO) said the Home Office's response would be reviewed after its decisions came under ""public scrutiny"". The Home Office says it is ""supporting"" the investigation. Fraud in student visa system exposed Visa cheat claims 'putting lives on hold' Bid to clear names over visa test cheat claims In a statement the NAO said: ""The Home Office revoked student visas where there was evidence of cheating, but its decisions have come under renewed public and parliamentary scrutiny in the wake of the Windrush scandal. ""The NAO is looking at the information held by the Home Office on the number of people alleged to have cheated and the action the Home Office has taken to date."" The cheating scandal came to light in anundercover BBC Panorama investigationinto fraud at two centres administering the mandatory language tests. The then government-approved Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) involves a written and oral section and a separate multiple-choice question paper. Following the report, Theresa May, then home secretary,  said the evidence was ""very shocking"". This video can not be played Undercover footage filmed by Panorama uncovered systematic fraud in the student visa system As a result, the Home Office ordered the US firm providing the exams, Educational Testing Service (ETS), to check more than 58,000 tests taken between 2011 and 2014. It said voice-recognition software suggested that proxy test-takers were used in more than 30,000 cases. The technology extracts biometric features from an individual's speech to create a voice print, the vocal equivalent of a fingerprint. It then looked for possible matches which indicated the same individual took multiple tests, before auditors verified suspected matches. So far, the Home Office says, 25 people have been convicted over ""facilitating"" the exam fraud. But Labour MP Stephen Timms has said many students were falsely accused, and had been given no opportunity to clear their name. On Thursday, Mr Timms, MP for East Ham,told Victoria Derbyshirethe treatment of the students had been ""a disgrace"". ""They trusted Britain to provide them with a decent education. Instead, they've been falsely accused of cheating and been given no chance to appeal."" Foreign students accused of cheating by officials havetold the BBC they have been left in limbo for years. Fatema Chowdhury came to the UK from Bangladesh in 2010 and finished her law degree in 2014 at the University of London. Speaking onThursday's Victoria Derbyshire programme, she said at one stage she was detained for a week after being accused of cheating. She denies the accusation. Nidhin Chand denies using a stand-in to sit an English language test for her visa application Ms Chowdury has not been told to leave the UK, but while she remains in the country she is prevented from working and cannot use the NHS for free. ""During my delivery last year they charged me Â£14,000 just to have a baby,"" she said. .Nine guilty over student visa plot Concern over 'crass' student visa plans Home Office under fire over student visa fraud She said her ""dreams and hopes"" were now gone, and she was ""desperate"" to speak to someone at the Home Office to prove her innocence. But after four years of trying she said ""there is no hope"". Nidhin Chand, an Indian woman living in Scotland,spoke to BBC Scotland earlier this monthabout her fight to clear her name over fraud allegations. She has been accused of using a stand-in to sit an English language test for her visa application. She said: ""I have been crying every dayâ¦ It is painful when someone calls you a fraud and arrests you in front of the public and humiliates you."" The Home Office has said it welcomes ""genuine international students"" and that there is no limit on the number who study in the UK. In response to the new watchdog investigation, a spokesman said: ""We have been supporting the National Audit Office in its work on this investigation since the start of the year.

SNP members change leadership's currency plan,"The SNP has backed proposals for a new currency in an independent Scotland - although the leadership was defeated over the timing. The party's conference voted to replace the pound with a separate Scottish currency ""as soon as practicable"". This went against the wishes of leader Nicola Sturgeon, who had wanted a more gradual transition to a new currency. Ms Sturgeon played down the result of the vote, and said the party could ""move forward with confidence"". Party members also backed the leadership over six economic tests that will ""guide"" the exact timescale for a new currency - which some left-wing activists had wanted scrapped. It means that the SNP's official policy is, for the first time, to replace sterling with a new Scottish currency after independence. Allow Twitter content?

It comes just days after Ms Sturgeon announced that she wants a second independence referendum within the next two years, if Brexit happens. However the UK government has ruled out granting the Scottish Parliament the consent that would ensure any referendum was legal. Delegates in Edinburgh were asked to back proposals put forward by deputy leader Keith Brown and Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, which were largely based on the SNP's Growth Commission report. Their motion said that the currency of an independent Scotland ""should continue to be the pound sterling"" until a separate currency ""can be safely and securely established"". The aim should then have been for the Scottish Parliament to take a decision on whether to establish a new currency ""by the end of the first term of an independent Parliament"". Pleas from the leadership not to amend the motion were ignored by a majority of party members, who voted by 781 to 729 for a new currency to instead be introduced ""as soon as practicable"". A narrow majority of delegates at the conference voted to amend proposals put forward by the SNP leadership However the amendment, by the SNP's Dalkeith and District Branch, kept the vast majority of the leadership's proposals - including the use of six key economic tests that will ""guide"" the precise timescale for a new currency. These were set out by the party's Growth Commission, and include an independent Scotland having a ""sufficiently strong and credible fiscal position in relation to budget deficit and overall debt"" before a separate currency is introduced. And there would need to be evidence that the new currency would ""meet the ongoing needs of Scottish residents and businesses"". The tests were kept despite activist Timothy Rideout, who spoke for the amendment, describing them as ""rubbish"". Mr Rideout also argued that the use of Sterling would mean monetary policy such as interest rates would all be set in London, and that ""we would not have real independence"". Mr Brown and Ms Sturgeon had urged party members not to amend the original proposals Ms Sturgeon, who will address the conference on Sunday afternoon, tweeted after the vote that: ""We can move forward now with confidence to make the case for Scotland's future in Scotland's hands."" Her deputy, Keith Brown, insisted that the SNP now has a ""clear platform on which to campaign and win the case for independence"". He added: ""Our party now sees the balance of advantage in a careful, managed and responsible transition to an independent currency. ""It is our ambition to move to a new currency - this is a significant and important policy choice. Until this can be achieved, safely and securely, our currency will remain the pound sterling."" Mr Brown predicted: ""This is a winning economic plan to take to the doorsteps - one which will achieve independence for Scotland."" Then-UK Chancellor George Osborne ruled out a formal currency union ahead of the 2014 referendum The policy shift marks a major change from the SNP's stance ahead of the 2014 independence referendum, when then-first minister Alex Salmond said Scotland would continue to use the pound in a formal UK-wide currency union. This was immediately ruled out by the UK government - with the resulting uncertainty over what currency an independent Scotland would use widely seen as being a factor in independence being rejected by 55% to 45%. The new plan would see Scotland keep the pound, at least in the short term, but without a currency union - and with a new currency being introduced ""as soon as practicable"" afterwards. Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the vote was an ""embarrassing snub"" for Ms Sturgeon, who he claimed was ""now at the beck and call of an extreme economic agenda within the SNP which would rip the pound from our pockets as soon as possible"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was ""imposing a decade of austerity on the most vulnerable, tax cuts for big business and fewer rights for workers is now official SNP policy."" Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was ""no great surprise that SNP members felt the need to defeat their leadership's uninspiring Growth Commission proposals"", and that the case for independence needed a ""new economic direction"" than the ""centrist agenda"". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon has ""lost control of her party"", with the leadership ""now committed to a policy they oppose and that will affect pensions and mortgages"".

Cyclone Kenneth 'wiped out villages',"This video can not be played Eyewitness captures moment Kenneth hits northern Mozambique A powerful cyclone has ""entirely wiped out"" villages in Mozambique, according to a UN official. Gemma Connell, the head of the regional Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), said it looked from the air like areas had been ""run over by a bulldozer"". Cyclone Kenneth struck on Thursday with winds of 220km/h (140mph). It came barely a month after Cyclone Idai killed more than 900 people across three countries. In a video posted on Twitter after flying over the affected area, Ms Connell pledged to work with local authorities ""to get people the supplies they need"". ""The weather is still bad, it is still raining,"" she said. ""But thankfully the winds have died down."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports that damage to power lines in parts of northern Mozambique is making communication difficult. Almost 20,000 people have taken shelter in makeshift displacement centres, including schools and churches, our correspondent adds. Cyclone Idai: What the aftermath looks like How prepared was southern Africa for Idai? A UN spokesman said a total of five people have now died, quoting Mozambique's government, according to reports. One person was earlier reported to have been killed when Cyclone Kenneth struck after being crushed by a falling tree. The storm also killed three people on the island nation of Comoros. UN weather experts say it is unprecedented for two cyclones of such intensity to hit Mozambique in the same season. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also said that no previous records show a cyclone striking the region as far north as Kenneth. It said a fact-finding mission would examine the ""impact of climate change and sea-level rise on Mozambique's resilience"" to extreme weather. Families have been left displaced by the cyclones Amnesty International's secretary general Kumi Naidoo said the two storms were ""exactly what climate scientists warned would happen if we continue to warm our planet beyond its limits"". ""There is one inescapable and burning injustice we cannot stress enough,"" he said, adding: ""The people of Mozambique are paying the price for dangerous climate change when they have done next to nothing to cause this crisis."" Kenneth made landfall on the northern province of Cabo Delgado on Thursday evening, with wind speeds equivalent to a category four hurricane. Winds eased on Friday, but France's meteorological agency said up to 800mm of rain was expected to land on Mozambique over the coming days - nearly double the 10-day accumulated rainfall that flooded the port city of Beira during Cyclone Idai. The UN's World Food Programme said it was working on an ""emergency preparedness plan"" with the Mozambican government and other humanitarian groups. ""The most difficult thing is transportation - we don't have helicopters yet,"" Capt Kleber Castro from a Brazilian rescue team said. ""We need a lot of support."" Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) said 30,000 people had been evacuated from affected areas. Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai, and there is apparently more high ground there. But reports said many thousands of homes had been flattened by the winds, and the area has been hit by militant Islamist violence in recent months, which could complicate humanitarian operations. Thousands of people had already fled their homes to seek shelter from violence in camps for displaced people. How ruby smugglers nurtured jihadists in Mozambique Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones explained Comoros is still reeling from damage caused by the cyclone, and in some southern areas of neighbouring Tanzania, authorities have ordered schools and businesses to close. Cyclone Kenneth has already devastated areas of the island nation of Comoros The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies shared images of the damage on social media. In a tweet, the group confirmed it had volunteers on the ground assisting communities. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Racism row over Trieste half-marathon,"Critics said the exploitation of African athletes was being used as a fig leaf by the Trieste race organisers Organisers of the Trieste half-marathon have reversed a ban on professional African athletes after an outcry in Italy and the launch of an inquiry. Event manager Fabio Carini had originally defended the ban by saying it was to highlight that African runners were underpaid by their agents. However, the controversial decision was described by critics as racist. Mr Carini later apologised for causing offence but said a ""fundamental issue of ethics"" had been highlighted. The issue of racism in sport made headlines earlier this month when Juventus' teenage forward Moise Kean was the target of racist abuse in a Serie A match. Anti-racism campaigners in Italy say the government promotes fear and hatred to spread division. Italy government backs 'anti-migrant' bill Migration to Europe in charts A decree issued in September makes it easier to deport migrants and take away their citizenship if they commit serious crimes. Under the new governing coalition, Italy has tried to close its ports to boats with migrants travelling across the Mediterranean. The Trieste Running Festival is to be held on 5 May. Mr Carini, president of Apd Miramar, the company organising the event, told Italian newspaper La Repubblica on Friday: ""This yearwe have decided only to take European athletes,externalto make the point that measures must be taken to regulate what is currently a trade in high-value African athletes, who are purely and simply exploited, which is something we can no longer accept."" Organisers of such events in Italy, he said, were ""under pressure from unscrupulous managers who exploited these athletes offering them very low fees... often not giving them anything"". Some organisers pay top athletes an attendance fee to take part in major marathons ""The race is open to all,"" he added. ""Organisers barred only the top runners, the African professionals, from taking part to denounce unequal treatment. ""African athletes are not paid according to their real value."" Mr Carini went on to mention an instance where an African marathon runner had been abandoned in Italy previously without a return ticket home. In response,the Italian Athletics Federation (Fidal) opened an investigation,externalto establish the facts and ascertain whether its rules and regulations had been broken. Later on Saturday, Mr Carini issued a statement to Italian media wherehe said African athletes would be invited after all,external. ""I accept we should have raised the issue differently and with a different timing and that's what we will do,"" he said. ""I regret the reactions to this decision and apologise to those people who felt offended."" However, he still insisted that he had raised an issue of exploitation that ""does exist and is often ignored by organisers of running events"". Among the first to react to the original ban was Isabella De Monte, an MEP with the centre-left Democratic Party. ""The exploitation of athletes is being used as a fig leaf - regarding such questions, there are places and appropriate bodies to turn to,"" she said. ""The situation is getting really out of hand and we're in the danger of returning to the dark times."" Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio described the decision as ""folly"". ""It is right to fight against the exploitation of African runners... but it is not done like this; the issue is not addressed by excluding them from the race. In fact, the issue becomes more serious."" Massimiliano Fedriga, president of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region that includes Trieste, however, defended the organisers. ""It is a real problem and turning your back on it is not human, but opportunistic."" It is not clear who pays top contenders taking part in events like the Trieste half-marathon. Top athletes are courted for months by organisers of the biggest events to secure their participation Mr Carini suggested they were not paid by his organisation. Apd Miramar have not yet responded to a BBC request for clarification. Top world athletes taking part in full marathons - like the one being held in London on 28 April - are usually paid an attendance fee by organisers, in addition to extra payment for their performance on the day, as well as sponsorship money.

Description of double rapist released,"The victims, both in their 20s, managed to escape their captor following a struggle in Osborne Road, Watford Detectives investigating the rape of two women who were abducted and attacked are looking for a white man with a bald head or shaved blonde hair. The first victim was abducted in Chingford, north London, early on Thursday while the second was taken 12 hours later in Edgware. Both women managed to escape their captor following a struggle in Osborne Road, Watford, the Met Police said. The suspect is described as aged in his late 20s to early 30s. He has a short beard, tattoos and drove a silver or grey-coloured Ford S-Max people carrier. Detectives said the women were ""randomly selected"" by the same attacker. ""We are continuing to speak to both women to obtain a complete picture of what happened after they were abducted,"" Det Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin said. ""At this stage we believe that the suspect travelled around north London and Hertfordshire in his car from the early hours of Thursday 25 April and he may have come into contact with other members of the public. ""If you were in these areas on Thursday and were approached by a stranger in similar circumstances, or saw anything that roused your suspicion or made you feel uncomfortable, get in touch now.""

Knives found at Japan prince's desk,"Prince Hisahito is often guarded by police officers Police in Japan have launched an investigation after two knives were found near the school desk of Emperor Akihito's 12-year-old grandson, local media report. The knives were discovered on Friday in a classroom at a junior high school attended by Prince Hisahito. Police are probing CCTV footage of a man trespassing on the school grounds. Prince Hisahito is set to become second in line to the throne after Emperor Akihito's abdication next week. Police believe the unidentified man caught on camera, who was dressed in blue and wearing a helmet, posed as a construction worker to access the building at Ochanomizu University.

'Creativity peaks in your 20s and 50s',"If you've ever wondered why your mind is a hotspot for new ideas in your 20s, it could be that you're experiencing the first of two creative peaks. New research from Ohio State University found that our mid-20s is when our brains first become fertile ground for innovation. The study looked at previous winners of the Nobel Prize in economics. It found that those who did their most groundbreaking work in their 20s tended to be ""conceptual"" innovators. So basically they had a light bulb moment and acted upon it. But don't panic if you've gone past your mid-20s without a flicker of an idea - some of us won't hit our inspirational stride until our mid-50s. Nana Jones Darko, 24, runs a mobile barbers. He says he's always had loads of ideas for businesses but as he approaches his mid-20s he feels he's at his most creative. ""I'm learning more about technology and networking. ""I think people take you more seriously too when you're a bit older - and barriers break down - so that helps your creative brain flow and pump out ideas."" Just as well - because Nana feels there's loads of pressure from parents and peers to succeed by your mid-20s, especially if you don't follow the ""normal"" career path. He says that pressure also comes from ""what you see on the TV and footballers who are 20 and earning Â£200k a week"". ""I really do believe there's a big pressure to succeed in business by your mid-20s. ""It's your environment that literally pushes you to financially succeed - and have it all by 25. ""But I now believe you're supposed to build in your mid-20s but I don't believe it's meant to be your peak."" If you haven't quite achieved what you wanted to earlier on in life, then you can look forward to your second creative peak, in your 50s. ""This work really does point to the fact that there are very important innovators who do their best work much later in their lives,"" the study's author Professor Weinberg says. ""And if that isn't what's happening to you, that you're not one of the people who's revolutionising things in your 20s that doesn't mean that you can't do really important things later on. Your second creative peak will happen in your 50s Professor Weinberg says that young people who feel they've got more to accomplish should keep going. ""Someone who is experimental and is accumulating knowledge gradually over time is someone who really, really should not give up. ""I mean we don't necessarily know how eminent they will get and how their achievements will be. ""But for that type of person they will do their best work - at least their best innovative work - later in their careers and they should be aware of that and keep going."" Nana says his mum is one them. Now in her 50s, she's setting up her own business - starting up fashion schools.

China dismantles '$30m fake Lego gang',"Police seized what appeared to be a counterfeit Star Wars Lego set Police in China have uncovered a gang accused of manufacturing and selling $30m (Â£23m) worth of counterfeit Lego. Officers raided a Chinese toymaker which was allegedly manufacturing fake Lego products in the southern city of Shenzhen, arresting four people, reports quoting police said. The toys - including an imitation Star Wars set - were copied from Lego blueprints, a police statement said. More than 630,000 finished products were seized, the statement added. ""In October 2018, the Shanghai police found that Lepin building blocks available on the market were extremely similar to that of Lego,"" police said. ""Across more than 10 assembly lines, over 90 moulds had been produced... [police seized] some 630,000 completed pieces worth more than 200 million yuan ($30m)."" US to review China intellectual property policies How a Chinese firm fell victim to intellectual property theft 'Everything awesome' at Lego as it grows again Images posted by Chinese authorities following the raid showed products that appeared to be almost identical to those produced by the Danish toy giant. Along with the apparent Star Wars imitation, products were released in conjunction with the new ""Lego Movie 2"" and sold under the name ""The Lepin Bricks 2"", police said. The fakes were reportedly being sold at a fraction of the price, with a small city-themed Lepin set on the market for $3 a box, whereas similar Lego sets start at $15. The police investigation is ongoing. Robin Smith, vice president and general counsel for Lego China and Asia Pacific, told the official Xinhua news agency that the safety of the products could also be of concern. The raid comes as China seeks to strengthen intellectual property rights, with the number of trials hitting a record high last year. Meanwhile, Lego last year celebrated a return to growth following a first fall in sales and profits for 13 years in 2017.

"Review: Kubrick's luck, sweat and sheer talent Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ","Serendipity is the unsung hero of creativity. Any entrepreneur, scientist or artist will testify to that. As will most film-makers. Luck always has a part to play in the making of a movie, it just never gets a credit. Stanley Kubrick said as much in an interview back in the spring of 1958 shortly after he'd finished Paths of Glory. He was talking to the actor Jay Varela: Varela: ""Why not begin with how you found the story for the picture."" Kubrick: ""The way you find most stories."" Varela: ""Well, how is that?"" Kubrick: ""Sheer chance."" It was the same deal with A Clockwork Orange, which he only reluctantly read when his wife, an Anthony Burgess fan, pressed him to do so. Thank you, Mrs K. This video can not be played Malcolm McDowell played the role of the thug Alex in A Clockwork Orange There is an element of good fortune to the timing of the Design Museum's Stanley Kubrick Exhibition. The show has been travelling the world for a decade or more like a tried-and-tested circus act, but because this year marks the 20th anniversary of the great auteur's death, its London residency feels like a special occasion rather than yet another stop on a never-ending tour. Still, luck will only you get you so far. Chances have to be taken. Would the Design Museum, a lively institution that inexplicably does not benefit from statutory public funding, be able to put on a show worthy of Kubrick's remarkable body of work? The answer isâ¦ an emphatic, yes. The exhibition has been reconfigured and re-thought by the museum's curators with help from the designers, Pentagram. Elements have been thoughtfully added, such as Don McCullin's Vietnam War photographs, which Kubrick used as a reference source for scenes in Full Metal Jacket. Don McCullin's Vietnam War photographs (Citadel Wall, Hue, 1968) were an invaluable source of research for Full Metal Jacket Matthew Modine and Stanley Kubrick on the set of Full Metal Jacket And, with a welcome touch of theatricality, an experiential exhibition entrance has been created consisting of a multi-screen audio-visual display tunnelling towards a central Kubrickian single point of perspective. You enter the exhibition through a ""one-point perspective"" corridor, recreating the director's use of the ""one-point perspective"" technique It promises - the marketing blurb says - the chance to ""Step inside the world of Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest film-makers of the 20th Century"". And you do, sort of. Well, not exactly into his world, more inside his head. This is far more than a shallow theme-park-type exhibition with a smattering of celebrity objects and archive photographs that you can motor through in a few minutes. Yes, there are plenty of both, but they are contextualised with a wealth of other materials, from annotated scripts and meticulously prepared shooting schedules, to on-set film footage and correspondence with close collaborators. Kubrick's detailed notes on the scripts for The Shining (L) and Barry Lyndon (R) You don't really get a true sense of the man behind the camera. Like almost all exhibitions nowadays, this is a myth-making enterprise in which the only criticism of the subject (letters from censors and disapproving cinema-goers) are designed to elevate his status as a maverick genius. But what it lacks in the way of a serious examination of an idiosyncratic, complex artist, it makes up for with a deeply researched documentary account of his working process. In the first room, we meet a young Stanley making a living by winning a few dollars playing chess and taking photographs for Look magazine (there's an accompanying exhibition of this early photographic work in the gallery above). We see the Eyemo camera he used for the fight scenes in Killer's Kiss, an early film he considered ""amateurish"".  And in the corner is the cold-metal lumpen shape of his trusty Steenbeck editing table. Kubrick used this Steenbeck editing machine for Full Metal Jacket The scene is set. Kubrick is much more than a director, he is also a writer, producer, cinematographer and editor who saw his job as a ""â¦a kind of idea and taste machine"". What then follows is a room-by-room presentation of all his major films, starting with Paths of Glory and then Spartacus, which has a continuity breakdown sheet on display that reads: 5 Photo Doubles 3,600 Romans 100 Officers 30 Buglers 30 Standard Bearers 2,000 Slaves This costume was worn by Laurence Olivier (Marcus Licinius Crassus) in Spartacus Stanley Kubrick didn't do things by halves. And nor has this exhibition. If you were to read, watch and look at everything on display, I reckon it'd take you half a day - and that's with an empty gallery. Add a few thousand people and the ensuing queuing, you might have to think about breaking for lunch. But if you have even the slightest interest in film-making, regardless of your knowledge of Kubrick, this is a show worthy of your time. The exhibits (around 700), installations (including the grand-finale recreation of Space Station V from 2001: A Space Odyssey), and extended film clips are all immaculately and considerately presented.

Description of double rapist releasedTwo women were abducted and raped by a man in a car in north London.London,"The victims, both in their 20s, managed to escape their captor following a struggle in Osborne Road, Watford Detectives investigating the rape of two women who were abducted and attacked are looking for a white man with a bald head or shaved blonde hair. The first victim was abducted in Chingford, north London, early on Thursday while the second was taken 12 hours later in Edgware. Both women managed to escape their captor following a struggle in Osborne Road, Watford, the Met Police said. The suspect is described as aged in his late 20s to early 30s. He has a short beard, tattoos and drove a silver or grey-coloured Ford S-Max people carrier. Detectives said the women were ""randomly selected"" by the same attacker. ""We are continuing to speak to both women to obtain a complete picture of what happened after they were abducted,"" Det Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin said. ""At this stage we believe that the suspect travelled around north London and Hertfordshire in his car from the early hours of Thursday 25 April and he may have come into contact with other members of the public. ""If you were in these areas on Thursday and were approached by a stranger in similar circumstances, or saw anything that roused your suspicion or made you feel uncomfortable, get in touch now."" The detective added that her team was working closely with officers in Hertfordshire to establish potential links the suspect might have to the area.

NI politicians 'pressured by people power'The priest who criticised leaders at Lyra McKee's funeral says people want power-sharing talks to succeed.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Fr Martin Magill speaking to The Andrew Marr Show The priest who criticised politicians at Lyra McKee's funeral has said people in the church put ""pressure"" on them to join a standing ovation. Ms McKee was shot while observing a riot in Londonderry last week. Fr Martin Magill was applauded when he asked why it had taken the journalist's death to bring politicians together. In an interview recorded for this Sunday's Andrew Marr programme he said: ""People want our politicians to move, and they want them to move now."" New NI political talks process announced What next for Northern Ireland? McKee funeral priest confronts politicians During the funeral service, Fr Magill had commended Northern Ireland's political leaders for ""standing together"" in the Creggan area of Londonderry on Good Friday to attend a vigil for Ms McKee. However, he then added: ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" The British and Irish governments announced on Friday a new talks process, aimed at restoring devolution in Northern Ireland, would begin on 7 May. Sinn FÃ©in collapsed the coalition government in January 2017 in protest at the DUP's handling of a green energy scandal. Since then, several rounds of talks have failed, with the two parties failing to find a compromise on a number of outstanding issues including Irish language rights and the legalisation of same-sex marriage. This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" Fr Magill said politicians were slow to stand up when his words were applauded in Belfast's St Anne's Cathedral. ""The people, in a sense, really put the pressure on in the cathedral to stand,"" the priest said. ""Obviously the politicians realised; 'Oh goodness, everybody behind us is standing, we need to move,' and they literally moved because people had moved."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was ""a moment of great clarity during the service"", but acknowledged there were difficult issues to be discussed. Speaking on the Today programme, Mrs Foster repeated her call for a parallel talks process. ""We have been wanting an Assembly up and running since its collapse and we have said again this week that we want the Assembly set up immediately,"" she said. ""We haven't blocked anything. We have been engaging in talks but what I'm saying is that these are difficult issues - and they are for people in Northern Ireland."" Politicians from across the UK and Ireland, including Arlene Foster, Mary-Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill, attended the funeral of Lyra McKee Sinn FÃ©in MLA Conor Murphy said the British government had to come forward with ""rigorous impartiality, to try and get a process together which can address the outstanding issues"". He also said a parallel talks process was ""unlikely to work"". ""We had a 10-year parallel process, if you like, where issues like same sex marriage, Irish language and legacy rights were being presented and pressed and the DUP used various devices to block those,"" he said. The British and Irish governments are to review progress in the negotiations at the end of May. Fr Magill's interview will be broadcast as part ofThe Andrew Marr Showon BBC One at 09:00 BST on Sunday, 28 April. McKee priest says politicians had to listen.

Burrowing badgers cause road collapse,"Pedestrians are urged to avoid the area due to large holes being formed at the side of the road Burrowing badgers have removed so much earth from beneath a road it has been closed due to risk of collapse. Intensive structural repairs are needed to 150m of country lane between Kempsford and Hannington Wick in Gloucestershire. Gloucestershire County Council said ""tonnes"" of earth had been removed. Environmental laws mean officials have to wait three months before work can start to allow the badgers to vacate the area. The council said it had called in experts and requested a licence from Natural England to start work on the un-named C road, known as the 3/171 boundary to Kempsford High Street. The hope is to get the road re-opened in time for the annual Royal International Air Tattoo in nearby Fairford on 19-21 July. However, law dictates the sett cannot be disturbed until 1 July at the earliest. The diversion route will be in place for at least three months while explorations are made Liz Kirkham, the council's highways operations manager, said: ""We know long road closures are frustrating, however we must follow the restrictions from Natural England. ""We have already booked in crews to do the work needed to get the road open again, so I would like to reassure residents that we are doing all we can to plan ahead."" The road is currently closed to all traffic, including cyclists and pedestrians. A diversion is in place and Kempsford residents are required to access the village from the opposite direction by car. Pedestrians are also urged not to use the route due to large holes creating trip hazards at the side of the road.

"Review: Kubrick's luck, sweat and sheer talent âââââ","Serendipity is the unsung hero of creativity. Any entrepreneur, scientist or artist will testify to that. As will most film-makers. Luck always has a part to play in the making of a movie, it just never gets a credit. Stanley Kubrick said as much in an interview back in the spring of 1958 shortly after he'd finished Paths of Glory. He was talking to the actor Jay Varela: Varela: ""Why not begin with how you found the story for the picture."" Kubrick: ""The way you find most stories."" Varela: ""Well, how is that?"" Kubrick: ""Sheer chance."" It was the same deal with A Clockwork Orange, which he only reluctantly read when his wife, an Anthony Burgess fan, pressed him to do so. Thank you, Mrs K. This video can not be played Malcolm McDowell played the role of the thug Alex in A Clockwork Orange There is an element of good fortune to the timing of the Design Museum's Stanley Kubrick Exhibition. The show has been travelling the world for a decade or more like a tried-and-tested circus act, but because this year marks the 20th anniversary of the great auteur's death, its London residency feels like a special occasion rather than yet another stop on a never-ending tour. Still, luck will only you get you so far. Chances have to be taken. Would the Design Museum, a lively institution that inexplicably does not benefit from statutory public funding, be able to put on a show worthy of Kubrick's remarkable body of work? The answer isâ¦ an emphatic, yes. The exhibition has been reconfigured and re-thought by the museum's curators with help from the designers, Pentagram. Elements have been thoughtfully added, such as Don McCullin's Vietnam War photographs, which Kubrick used as a reference source for scenes in Full Metal Jacket. Don McCullin's Vietnam War photographs (Citadel Wall, Hue, 1968) were an invaluable source of research for Full Metal Jacket Matthew Modine and Stanley Kubrick on the set of Full Metal Jacket And, with a welcome touch of theatricality, an experiential exhibition entrance has been created consisting of a multi-screen audio-visual display tunnelling towards a central Kubrickian single point of perspective. You enter the exhibition through a ""one-point perspective"" corridor, recreating the director's use of the ""one-point perspective"" technique It promises - the marketing blurb says - the chance to ""Step inside the world of Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest film-makers of the 20th Century"". And you do, sort of. Well, not exactly into his world, more inside his head. This is far more than a shallow theme-park-type exhibition with a smattering of celebrity objects and archive photographs that you can motor through in a few minutes. Yes, there are plenty of both, but they are contextualised with a wealth of other materials, from annotated scripts and meticulously prepared shooting schedules, to on-set film footage and correspondence with close collaborators. Kubrick's detailed notes on the scripts for The Shining (L) and Barry Lyndon (R) You don't really get a true sense of the man behind the camera. Like almost all exhibitions nowadays, this is a myth-making enterprise in which the only criticism of the subject (letters from censors and disapproving cinema-goers) are designed to elevate his status as a maverick genius. But what it lacks in the way of a serious examination of an idiosyncratic, complex artist, it makes up for with a deeply researched documentary account of his working process. In the first room, we meet a young Stanley making a living by winning a few dollars playing chess and taking photographs for Look magazine (there's an accompanying exhibition of this early photographic work in the gallery above). We see the Eyemo camera he used for the fight scenes in Killer's Kiss, an early film he considered ""amateurish"".  And in the corner is the cold-metal lumpen shape of his trusty Steenbeck editing table. Kubrick used this Steenbeck editing machine for Full Metal Jacket The scene is set.

SNP leadership defeated over currency plan,"The SNP has backed proposals for a new currency in an independent Scotland - although the leadership was defeated over the timing. The party's conference voted to replace the pound with a separate Scottish currency ""as soon as practicable"". This went against the wishes of leader Nicola Sturgeon, who had wanted a more gradual transition to a new currency. Ms Sturgeon played down the result of the vote, and said the party could ""move forward with confidence"". Party members also backed the leadership over six economic tests that will ""guide"" the exact timescale for a new currency - which some left-wing activists had wanted scrapped. It means that the SNP's official policy is, for the first time, to replace sterling with a new Scottish currency after independence. Allow Twitter content?

It comes just days after Ms Sturgeon announced that she wants a second independence referendum within the next two years, if Brexit happens. However the UK government has ruled out granting the Scottish Parliament the consent that would ensure any referendum was legal. Delegates in Edinburgh were asked to back proposals put forward by deputy leader Keith Brown and Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, which were largely based on the SNP's Growth Commission report. Their motion said that the currency of an independent Scotland ""should continue to be the pound sterling"" until a separate currency ""can be safely and securely established"". The aim should then have been for the Scottish Parliament to take a decision on whether to establish a new currency ""by the end of the first term of an independent Parliament"". Pleas from the leadership not to amend the motion were ignored by a majority of party members, who voted by 781 to 729 for a new currency to instead be introduced ""as soon as practicable"". A narrow majority of delegates at the conference voted to amend proposals put forward by the SNP leadership However the amendment, by the SNP's Dalkeith and District Branch, kept the vast majority of the leadership's proposals - including the use of six key economic tests that will ""guide"" the precise timescale for a new currency. These were set out by the party's Growth Commission, and include an independent Scotland having a ""sufficiently strong and credible fiscal position in relation to budget deficit and overall debt"" before a separate currency is introduced. And there would need to be evidence that the new currency would ""meet the ongoing needs of Scottish residents and businesses"". The tests were kept despite activist Timothy Rideout, who spoke for the amendment, describing them as ""rubbish"". Mr Rideout also argued that the use of Sterling would mean monetary policy such as interest rates would all be set in London, and that ""we would not have real independence"". Mr Brown and Ms Sturgeon had urged party members not to amend the original proposals Ms Sturgeon, who will address the conference on Sunday afternoon, tweeted after the vote that: ""We can move forward now with confidence to make the case for Scotland's future in Scotland's hands."" Her deputy, Keith Brown, insisted that the SNP now has a ""clear platform on which to campaign and win the case for independence"". He added: ""Our party now sees the balance of advantage in a careful, managed and responsible transition to an independent currency. ""It is our ambition to move to a new currency - this is a significant and important policy choice. Until this can be achieved, safely and securely, our currency will remain the pound sterling."" Mr Brown predicted: ""This is a winning economic plan to take to the doorsteps - one which will achieve independence for Scotland."" Then-UK Chancellor George Osborne ruled out a formal currency union ahead of the 2014 referendum The policy shift marks a major change from the SNP's stance ahead of the 2014 independence referendum, when then-first minister Alex Salmond said Scotland would continue to use the pound in a formal UK-wide currency union. This was immediately ruled out by the UK government - with the resulting uncertainty over what currency an independent Scotland would use widely seen as being a factor in independence being rejected by 55% to 45%. The new plan would see Scotland keep the pound, at least in the short term, but without a currency union - and with a new currency being introduced ""as soon as practicable"" afterwards. Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the vote was an ""embarrassing snub"" for Ms Sturgeon, who he claimed was ""now at the beck and call of an extreme economic agenda within the SNP which would rip the pound from our pockets as soon as possible"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was ""imposing a decade of austerity on the most vulnerable, tax cuts for big business and fewer rights for workers is now official SNP policy."" Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was ""no great surprise that SNP members felt the need to defeat their leadership's uninspiring Growth Commission proposals"", and that the case for independence needed a ""new economic direction"" than the ""centrist agenda"". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon has ""lost control of her party"", with the leadership ""now committed to a policy they oppose and that will affect pensions and mortgages"".

Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the vote was an ""embarrassing snub"" for Ms Sturgeon, who he claimed was ""now at the beck and call of an extreme economic agenda within the SNP which would rip the pound from our pockets as soon as possible"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was ""imposing a decade of austerity on the most vulnerable, tax cuts for big business and fewer rights for workers is now official SNP policy."" Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was ""no great surprise that SNP members felt the need to defeat their leadership's uninspiring Growth Commission proposals"", and that the case for independence needed a ""new economic direction"" than the ""centrist agenda"". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon has ""lost control of her party"", with the leadership ""now committed to a policy they oppose and that will affect pensions and mortgages"".

Thousands feared trapped by Cyclone Kenneth,"This video can not be played Eyewitness captures moment Kenneth hits northern Mozambique A powerful cyclone has ""entirely wiped out"" villages in Mozambique, according to a UN official. Gemma Connell, the head of the regional Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), said it looked from the air like areas had been ""run over by a bulldozer"". Cyclone Kenneth struck on Thursday with winds of 220km/h (140mph). It came barely a month after Cyclone Idai killed more than 900 people across three countries. In a video posted on Twitter after flying over the affected area, Ms Connell pledged to work with local authorities ""to get people the supplies they need"". ""The weather is still bad, it is still raining,"" she said. ""But thankfully the winds have died down."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports that damage to power lines in parts of northern Mozambique is making communication difficult. Almost 20,000 people have taken shelter in makeshift displacement centres, including schools and churches, our correspondent adds. Cyclone Idai: What the aftermath looks like How prepared was southern Africa for Idai? A UN spokesman said a total of five people have now died, quoting Mozambique's government, according to reports. One person was earlier reported to have been killed when Cyclone Kenneth struck after being crushed by a falling tree. The storm also killed three people on the island nation of Comoros. UN weather experts say it is unprecedented for two cyclones of such intensity to hit Mozambique in the same season. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also said that no previous records show a cyclone striking the region as far north as Kenneth. It said a fact-finding mission would examine the ""impact of climate change and sea-level rise on Mozambique's resilience"" to extreme weather. Families have been left displaced by the cyclones Amnesty International's secretary general Kumi Naidoo said the two storms were ""exactly what climate scientists warned would happen if we continue to warm our planet beyond its limits"". ""There is one inescapable and burning injustice we cannot stress enough,"" he said, adding: ""The people of Mozambique are paying the price for dangerous climate change when they have done next to nothing to cause this crisis."" Kenneth made landfall on the northern province of Cabo Delgado on Thursday evening, with wind speeds equivalent to a category four hurricane. Winds eased on Friday, but France's meteorological agency said up to 800mm of rain was expected to land on Mozambique over the coming days - nearly double the 10-day accumulated rainfall that flooded the port city of Beira during Cyclone Idai. The UN's World Food Programme said it was working on an ""emergency preparedness plan"" with the Mozambican government and other humanitarian groups. ""The most difficult thing is transportation - we don't have helicopters yet,"" Capt Kleber Castro from a Brazilian rescue team said. ""We need a lot of support."" Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) said 30,000 people had been evacuated from affected areas. Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai, and there is apparently more high ground there. But reports said many thousands of homes had been flattened by the winds, and the area has been hit by militant Islamist violence in recent months, which could complicate humanitarian operations. Thousands of people had already fled their homes to seek shelter from violence in camps for displaced people. How ruby smugglers nurtured jihadists in Mozambique Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones explained Comoros is still reeling from damage caused by the cyclone, and in some southern areas of neighbouring Tanzania, authorities have ordered schools and businesses to close. Cyclone Kenneth has already devastated areas of the island nation of Comoros The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies shared images of the damage on social media. In a tweet, the group confirmed it had volunteers on the ground assisting communities. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Woman and boy found dead in house,"A car was parked across the pavement in the street where the bodies were found A woman aged 28 and a four-year-old boy have been found dead in a house in Suffolk. A member of the public reported finding the bodies at the property on Park Avenue, Newmarket, at 18:00 BST on Friday. An eyewitness told theNewmarket Journal,externala woman came out of a property ""in tears"". Detectives continue to investigate the circumstances of the deaths and said the next of kin had been informed. The force has appealed for anyone who may have seen or heard anything in the area during the day to contact them. Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths, a spokesman for Suffolk Constabulary added. Police were alerted when a member of the public found the bodies A semi-detached two-storey house was cordoned off and a Volkswagen Golf hatchback was left parked across the pavement behind police tape. One neighbour, who lives opposite, said: ""I came home last night about 20:00 BST and there were feds (police) everywhere. ""They were here all night, I think, and forensics were going in and out."" He said he knew the woman by sight but had only spoken to her once. ""She, like everyone I suppose, kept herself to herself,"" adding that the boy ""was always smiling every time I saw him."" Police carried out a forensic search after they were alerted about the deaths Another couple, who also live on Park Avenue, said they had seen the boy playing in the nearby park. ""There are a lot of rented houses on this street, so a lot of people come and go,"" they said. An elderly resident added: ""I've been here for 60 years and it's quite a quiet street. ""Very sad though, isn't it. Tragic."" The street remains cordoned off by police.

Labour to reprint Euro election leaflets,"Labour is redrafting European election leaflets after accusations of ignoring a pledge to hold a further Brexit referendum, the BBC has been told. They will now refer to the party's preparations for a general election, with a referendum if necessary to avoid what it calls a ""bad Tory deal"". Jeremy Corbyn says Labour's ruling body will make a decision on Tuesday about backing a public vote on any deal. About 100 Labour MPs and MEPs want such a promise in the party manifesto. They wrote to members of the national executive committee before it meets on Tuesday to decide on the manifesto. Will Labour push for a public vote option? European elections: Lib Dems stand on 'stop Brexit' message Shadow Treasury ministers Clive Lewis and Anneliese Dodds and the shadow minister for disabled people Marsha de Cordova are among the frontbenchers backing the call for a confirmatory vote in any eventuality - not just to avoid a ""bad deal"". Some Labour MPs are opposed to holding another EU referendum, however, with nine shadow cabinet members thought to be sceptical about such a move. It had previously beenreported,externalthat Labour's leaflets for the 23 May European Parliament elections do not mention pushing for another referendum. Senior Labour backbencher Hilary Benn had questioned why no mention was made of a ""confirmatory referendum"" - despite the party twice supporting one in Commons votes. The party's deputy leaderTom Watson has also argued for Labour to promise another referendum, if it is to counter the electoral challenge posed by Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.

Labour agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's deal or talks end in no deal, there should be a general election. But if it cannot force one, it added, the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". The Labour leader was speaking in Peterborough on Saturday Mr Corbyn said on Saturday: ""The national executive will decide on Tuesday what will be in the European election manifesto and we will reflect the decisions made (at) last year's Labour Party conference - which were for a customs union, market access and rights protection within, with, the European Union. ""We would prefer to have a general election, but failing that if we get that agreement we are prepared to consider putting it to a confirmatory vote. That is a decision the national executive of the party will make."" Asked if the promise of a public confirmatory vote would be in election material, he added: ""It's important that the party, which is a democratic party structure, makes those decisions. Sadly, or perhaps it's a good thing, I'm not a dictator of the Labour Party."" Analysis by Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent When some of Labour's early European election literature was leaked, it provoked an internal row at a senior level. Why? Because it made no mention of another referendum. A letter from almost 100 MPs and MEPs calling for one has put additional pressure on the leadership. With the agreement of a senior official in Jeremy Corbyn's office, the campaign literature is now to be rewritten. There will be a mention of a confirmatory ballot/public vote (translation: a referendum) but only to avoid ""a bad Tory deal"". This won't go far enough for those MPs calling for a referendum on any deal. That is, even if Mr Corbyn reaches agreement on a ""soft"" Brexit with Theresa May, a chunk of his Parliamentary party still want another referendum. The issue will be hammered out when the ruling national executive meets on Tuesday to decide the manifesto for the European elections. Some members will argue for no referendum, some will argue for one but with caveats, and others will press for a public vote under all circumstances. Maybe the printing presses should be mothballed until Wednesday. A letter, signed by some Labour MPs and MEPs, said: ""Our members need to feel supported on doorsteps by a clear manifesto that marks us out as the only viable alternative to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. ""We need a message of hope and solidarity, and we need to campaign for it without caveats. To motivate our supporters, and to do the right thing by our members and our policy, a clear commitment to a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal must be part of our European election manifesto. ""We understand the many different pressures and views within our movement, but without this clear commitment, we fear that our electoral coalition could fall apart."" Richard Corbett, leader of Labour's MEPs and a member of the NEC, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The problem we face now is that Brexit is turning out to be so different from what was promised three years ago. ""Remember they said it would be easy - it's turning out to be rather complex. They said it would save loads of money that would all go to the NHS - it's turning out to be costly. ""They said it would not damage the economy - we are seeing firms move abroad, jobs lost, especially in manufacturing. ""Because it's so different, it's right that it should go back to the people for a final sign-off."" Labour Euro manifesto 'must back referendum' What happens after Brexit?

Green for goal in Welsh rugby tech trial,"The technology was trialled in the Pro 14 Welsh derby showpiece in Cardiff New technology to light up rugby posts in different colours to show whether a kick is successful was trialled at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. Goal-light technology was used for the first time in the UK at the Welsh Rugby Union's annual Judgement Day event on Saturday. The Welsh company behind the technology hopes it could also revolutionise other sports such as American football. However some fans have branded it a ""waste of time"". Similar to howwickets light up in 20/20 cricket, some 500 LED lights on each rugby post are activated by remote control. This video can not be played How does the new technology work?

SNP to decide on independence currency planThe party leadership wants Scotland to keep the pound in the years after independence before moving to a new currency.Scotland politics,"The SNP has backed proposals for a new currency in an independent Scotland - although the leadership was defeated over the timing. The party's conference voted to replace the pound with a separate Scottish currency ""as soon as practicable"". This went against the wishes of leader Nicola Sturgeon, who had wanted a more gradual transition to a new currency. Ms Sturgeon played down the result of the vote, and said the party could ""move forward with confidence"". Party members also backed the leadership over six economic tests that will ""guide"" the exact timescale for a new currency - which some left-wing activists had wanted scrapped. It means that the SNP's official policy is, for the first time, to replace sterling with a new Scottish currency after independence. Allow Twitter content?

It comes just days after Ms Sturgeon announced that she wants a second independence referendum within the next two years, if Brexit happens. However the UK government has ruled out granting the Scottish Parliament the consent that would ensure any referendum was legal. Delegates in Edinburgh were asked to back proposals put forward by deputy leader Keith Brown and Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, which were largely based on the SNP's Growth Commission report. Their motion said that the currency of an independent Scotland ""should continue to be the pound sterling"" until a separate currency ""can be safely and securely established"". The aim should then have been for the Scottish Parliament to take a decision on whether to establish a new currency ""by the end of the first term of an independent Parliament"". Pleas from the leadership not to amend the motion were ignored by a majority of party members, who voted by 781 to 729 for a new currency to instead be introduced ""as soon as practicable"". A narrow majority of delegates at the conference voted to amend proposals put forward by the SNP leadership However the amendment, by the SNP's Dalkeith and District Branch, kept the vast majority of the leadership's proposals - including the use of six key economic tests that will ""guide"" the precise timescale for a new currency. These were set out by the party's Growth Commission, and include an independent Scotland having a ""sufficiently strong and credible fiscal position in relation to budget deficit and overall debt"" before a separate currency is introduced. And there would need to be evidence that the new currency would ""meet the ongoing needs of Scottish residents and businesses"". The tests were kept despite activist Timothy Rideout, who spoke for the amendment, describing them as ""rubbish"". Mr Rideout also argued that the use of Sterling would mean monetary policy such as interest rates would all be set in London, and that ""we would not have real independence"". Mr Brown and Ms Sturgeon had urged party members not to amend the original proposals Ms Sturgeon, who will address the conference on Sunday afternoon, tweeted after the vote that: ""We can move forward now with confidence to make the case for Scotland's future in Scotland's hands."" Her deputy, Keith Brown, insisted that the SNP now has a ""clear platform on which to campaign and win the case for independence"". He added: ""Our party now sees the balance of advantage in a careful, managed and responsible transition to an independent currency. ""It is our ambition to move to a new currency - this is a significant and important policy choice. Until this can be achieved, safely and securely, our currency will remain the pound sterling."" Mr Brown predicted: ""This is a winning economic plan to take to the doorsteps - one which will achieve independence for Scotland."" Then-UK Chancellor George Osborne ruled out a formal currency union ahead of the 2014 referendum The policy shift marks a major change from the SNP's stance ahead of the 2014 independence referendum, when then-first minister Alex Salmond said Scotland would continue to use the pound in a formal UK-wide currency union. This was immediately ruled out by the UK government - with the resulting uncertainty over what currency an independent Scotland would use widely seen as being a factor in independence being rejected by 55% to 45%. The new plan would see Scotland keep the pound, at least in the short term, but without a currency union - and with a new currency being introduced ""as soon as practicable"" afterwards. Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the vote was an ""embarrassing snub"" for Ms Sturgeon, who he claimed was ""now at the beck and call of an extreme economic agenda within the SNP which would rip the pound from our pockets as soon as possible"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was ""imposing a decade of austerity on the most vulnerable, tax cuts for big business and fewer rights for workers is now official SNP policy."" Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was ""no great surprise that SNP members felt the need to defeat their leadership's uninspiring Growth Commission proposals"", and that the case for independence needed a ""new economic direction"" than the ""centrist agenda"". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon has ""lost control of her party"", with the leadership ""now committed to a policy they oppose and that will affect pensions and mortgages"".

SNP to decide on independence currency planThe party leadership wants Scotland to keep the pound in the years after independence before moving to a new currency.,"The SNP has backed proposals for a new currency in an independent Scotland - although the leadership was defeated over the timing. The party's conference voted to replace the pound with a separate Scottish currency ""as soon as practicable"". This went against the wishes of leader Nicola Sturgeon, who had wanted a more gradual transition to a new currency. Ms Sturgeon played down the result of the vote, and said the party could ""move forward with confidence"". Party members also backed the leadership over six economic tests that will ""guide"" the exact timescale for a new currency - which some left-wing activists had wanted scrapped. It means that the SNP's official policy is, for the first time, to replace sterling with a new Scottish currency after independence. Allow Twitter content?

It comes just days after Ms Sturgeon announced that she wants a second independence referendum within the next two years, if Brexit happens. However the UK government has ruled out granting the Scottish Parliament the consent that would ensure any referendum was legal. Delegates in Edinburgh were asked to back proposals put forward by deputy leader Keith Brown and Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, which were largely based on the SNP's Growth Commission report. Their motion said that the currency of an independent Scotland ""should continue to be the pound sterling"" until a separate currency ""can be safely and securely established"". The aim should then have been for the Scottish Parliament to take a decision on whether to establish a new currency ""by the end of the first term of an independent Parliament"". Pleas from the leadership not to amend the motion were ignored by a majority of party members, who voted by 781 to 729 for a new currency to instead be introduced ""as soon as practicable"". A narrow majority of delegates at the conference voted to amend proposals put forward by the SNP leadership However the amendment, by the SNP's Dalkeith and District Branch, kept the vast majority of the leadership's proposals - including the use of six key economic tests that will ""guide"" the precise timescale for a new currency. These were set out by the party's Growth Commission, and include an independent Scotland having a ""sufficiently strong and credible fiscal position in relation to budget deficit and overall debt"" before a separate currency is introduced. And there would need to be evidence that the new currency would ""meet the ongoing needs of Scottish residents and businesses"". The tests were kept despite activist Timothy Rideout, who spoke for the amendment, describing them as ""rubbish"". Mr Rideout also argued that the use of Sterling would mean monetary policy such as interest rates would all be set in London, and that ""we would not have real independence"". Mr Brown and Ms Sturgeon had urged party members not to amend the original proposals Ms Sturgeon, who will address the conference on Sunday afternoon, tweeted after the vote that: ""We can move forward now with confidence to make the case for Scotland's future in Scotland's hands."" Her deputy, Keith Brown, insisted that the SNP now has a ""clear platform on which to campaign and win the case for independence"". He added: ""Our party now sees the balance of advantage in a careful, managed and responsible transition to an independent currency. ""It is our ambition to move to a new currency - this is a significant and important policy choice. Until this can be achieved, safely and securely, our currency will remain the pound sterling."" Mr Brown predicted: ""This is a winning economic plan to take to the doorsteps - one which will achieve independence for Scotland."" Then-UK Chancellor George Osborne ruled out a formal currency union ahead of the 2014 referendum The policy shift marks a major change from the SNP's stance ahead of the 2014 independence referendum, when then-first minister Alex Salmond said Scotland would continue to use the pound in a formal UK-wide currency union. This was immediately ruled out by the UK government - with the resulting uncertainty over what currency an independent Scotland would use widely seen as being a factor in independence being rejected by 55% to 45%. The new plan would see Scotland keep the pound, at least in the short term, but without a currency union - and with a new currency being introduced ""as soon as practicable"" afterwards. Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the vote was an ""embarrassing snub"" for Ms Sturgeon, who he claimed was ""now at the beck and call of an extreme economic agenda within the SNP which would rip the pound from our pockets as soon as possible"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was ""imposing a decade of austerity on the most vulnerable, tax cuts for big business and fewer rights for workers is now official SNP policy."" Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was ""no great surprise that SNP members felt the need to defeat their leadership's uninspiring Growth Commission proposals"", and that the case for independence needed a ""new economic direction"" than the ""centrist agenda"". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon has ""lost control of her party"", with the leadership ""now committed to a policy they oppose and that will affect pensions and mortgages"".

Bolton game off after player strike,"Bolton Wanderers were relegated from the Championship on 19 April Bolton's game against Brentford on Saturday has been called off by the English Football League after Bolton's players said they would not play until they receive the wages they are owed. The match was called off 16 hours before it was scheduled to kick off. None of the March wages owed to the Wanderers' players have been paid. ""As a result of these disappointing developments, the league has been forced to suspend Saturday's fixture,"" an EFL statement said. ""The club [Bolton] is now deemed to be guilty of misconduct and will be referred to an Independent Disciplinary Commission. ""The EFL Board will now consider the matter of determining whether the fixture will be played or not."" In a club statement, Bolton said they ""would like to apologise for the inconvenience this will cause"". Brentford's squad travelled north from London on Friday in preparation for the Championship game, which was due to be played at the University of Bolton Stadium. Bolton's relegation to League One was confirmed on 19 April when they lost to Aston Villa. Earlier on Friday, Wanderers' squad had issued a joint statement, saying the financial situation was ""creating mental, emotional and financial burdens for people through no fault of their own"". They added that it was ""placing great strain on ourselves and our families"". The players also apologised to supporters for what ""may be seen as drastic action"" but stressed the decision had ""not been taken lightly"" and that they had taken the stance ""with deep regret"". The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said on Friday afternoon that it supported the players' actions, adding they had shown ""great patience and loyalty"" to the club, but had ""reached a point where action is necessary"". ""The PFA has been working with the club since the beginning of the season and we have done all we can to resolve this issue, including giving Bolton Wanderers a substantial loan to cover players' salaries in December,"" the statement added. Earlier this month, Bolton's players refused to train for 48 hours in support of club staff after March wages went unpaid. Full-time non-playing staff eventually received their March wages after a delay. On Friday night - before the EFL called the game off -prospective new owner Laurence Bassinihad said he would work to ensure Saturday's fixture went ahead. He told Sky Sports News that the players' wages would be paid and that he would speak to the EFL in an attempt to find a resolution.

Rural communities 'ignored and underrated',"Rural communities have been ""ignored"" and had ""inappropriate"" policies forced upon them, a report says. A group of peers said a new agenda for the countryside was needed similar to the government's industrial strategy. Priorities included improving mobile and broadband connections, replacing lost bank and bus services and tackling social isolation, the House of Lords Rural Economy Committee said. The government said it was committed to ""rural proofing"" policies. Ministers plan to spend Â£3.5bn on supporting economic development in the countryside by the end of 2020 through the Rural Development Programme. The cross-party committee of peers said policies suitable for urban and suburban areas had too often been foisted upon the countryside. Rural areas stuck in data slow lanes Poverty in the English countryside As well as improving communications, it is calling for action to address the supply and cost of housing and a lack of training for people working in rural industries. ""Successive governments have underrated the contribution rural economies can make to the nation's prosperity and wellbeing,"" it said. ""They have applied policies which are often inappropriate for rural England. This must change. With rural England at a point of major transition, a different approach is needed."" Lord Foster, the Lib Dem peer and former MP who chairs the committee, said the ""clear inequalities"" between urban and rural areas could not be allowed to continue. He called for a policy blueprint of equal ambition to the government's industrial strategy to realise the potential of struggling and under-performing areas. Access to high-speed broadband is a major issue for rural communities The Campaign to Protect Rural England said too few politicians had a real understanding of the needs of the countryside, despite the fact one in five of the population lived there. It said investment was needed in housing and other infrastructure to make market towns and villages attractive places to live and work. ""A failure to address the unique and specific needs of these communities has put them at risk of being left behind,"" said its chief executive Crispin Truman. Telecoms regulator Ofcom warned last year of a widening urban-rural divide in broadband provision. Only 41% of rural premises received a mobile data link of of 2Mbps or higher, it found, compared with 83% in urban areas. The government has set aside Â£200m to fund full fibre broadband connections in rural and hard-to-reach areas across the UK by 2033. ""We will continue to champion the countryside, driving forward high-speed broadband in hard-to-reach places, increasing housing availability in rural areas and supporting the creation of more than 6,000 jobs through our dedicated fund for rural businesses,"" it said.

"Review: Kubrick's luck, sweat and sheer talent Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ""You won't find out what Kubrick was like, but you will discover what it takes to make a great work of art.""","Serendipity is the unsung hero of creativity. Any entrepreneur, scientist or artist will testify to that. As will most film-makers. Luck always has a part to play in the making of a movie, it just never gets a credit. Stanley Kubrick said as much in an interview back in the spring of 1958 shortly after he'd finished Paths of Glory. He was talking to the actor Jay Varela: Varela: ""Why not begin with how you found the story for the picture."" Kubrick: ""The way you find most stories."" Varela: ""Well, how is that?"" Kubrick: ""Sheer chance."" It was the same deal with A Clockwork Orange, which he only reluctantly read when his wife, an Anthony Burgess fan, pressed him to do so. Thank you, Mrs K. This video can not be played Malcolm McDowell played the role of the thug Alex in A Clockwork Orange There is an element of good fortune to the timing of the Design Museum's Stanley Kubrick Exhibition. The show has been travelling the world for a decade or more like a tried-and-tested circus act, but because this year marks the 20th anniversary of the great auteur's death, its London residency feels like a special occasion rather than yet another stop on a never-ending tour. Still, luck will only you get you so far. Chances have to be taken. Would the Design Museum, a lively institution that inexplicably does not benefit from statutory public funding, be able to put on a show worthy of Kubrick's remarkable body of work? The answer isâ¦ an emphatic, yes. The exhibition has been reconfigured and re-thought by the museum's curators with help from the designers, Pentagram. Elements have been thoughtfully added, such as Don McCullin's Vietnam War photographs, which Kubrick used as a reference source for scenes in Full Metal Jacket. Don McCullin's Vietnam War photographs (Citadel Wall, Hue, 1968) were an invaluable source of research for Full Metal Jacket Matthew Modine and Stanley Kubrick on the set of Full Metal Jacket And, with a welcome touch of theatricality, an experiential exhibition entrance has been created consisting of a multi-screen audio-visual display tunnelling towards a central Kubrickian single point of perspective. You enter the exhibition through a ""one-point perspective"" corridor, recreating the director's use of the ""one-point perspective"" technique It promises - the marketing blurb says - the chance to ""Step inside the world of Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest film-makers of the 20th Century"". And you do, sort of. Well, not exactly into his world, more inside his head. This is far more than a shallow theme-park-type exhibition with a smattering of celebrity objects and archive photographs that you can motor through in a few minutes. Yes, there are plenty of both, but they are contextualised with a wealth of other materials, from annotated scripts and meticulously prepared shooting schedules, to on-set film footage and correspondence with close collaborators. Kubrick's detailed notes on the scripts for The Shining (L) and Barry Lyndon (R) You don't really get a true sense of the man behind the camera. Like almost all exhibitions nowadays, this is a myth-making enterprise in which the only criticism of the subject (letters from censors and disapproving cinema-goers) are designed to elevate his status as a maverick genius. But what it lacks in the way of a serious examination of an idiosyncratic, complex artist, it makes up for with a deeply researched documentary account of his working process. In the first room, we meet a young Stanley making a living by winning a few dollars playing chess and taking photographs for Look magazine (there's an accompanying exhibition of this early photographic work in the gallery above). We see the Eyemo camera he used for the fight scenes in Killer's Kiss, an early film he considered ""amateurish"".  And in the corner is the cold-metal lumpen shape of his trusty Steenbeck editing table. Kubrick used this Steenbeck editing machine for Full Metal Jacket The scene is set. Kubrick is much more than a director, he is also a writer, producer, cinematographer and editor who saw his job as a ""â¦a kind of idea and taste machine"". What then follows is a room-by-room presentation of all his major films, starting with Paths of Glory and then Spartacus, which has a continuity breakdown sheet on display that reads: 5 Photo Doubles 3,600 Romans 100 Officers 30 Buglers 30 Standard Bearers 2,000 Slaves This costume was worn by Laurence Olivier (Marcus Licinius Crassus) in Spartacus Stanley Kubrick didn't do things by halves. And nor has this exhibition. If you were to read, watch and look at everything on display, I reckon it'd take you half a day - and that's with an empty gallery.

WRU to trial goal-light technology,"The technology was trialled in the Pro 14 Welsh derby showpiece in Cardiff New technology to light up rugby posts in different colours to show whether a kick is successful was trialled at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. Goal-light technology was used for the first time in the UK at the Welsh Rugby Union's annual Judgement Day event on Saturday. The Welsh company behind the technology hopes it could also revolutionise other sports such as American football. However some fans have branded it a ""waste of time"". Similar to howwickets light up in 20/20 cricket, some 500 LED lights on each rugby post are activated by remote control. This video can not be played How does the new technology work? The lights show green if the penalty, conversion or drop goal is successful - or red if not. It was successfully trialled earlier this month byWorld Rugby at the Hong Kong Sevens,external. Inventor Michael Press, 33, said he believes the technology adds to the match-day experience of fans as well as aiding visually impaired spectators. Will VAR be good for Premier League?

Bolton game cancelled after player strike,"Bolton Wanderers were relegated from the Championship on 19 April Bolton's game against Brentford on Saturday has been called off by the English Football League after Bolton's players said they would not play until they receive the wages they are owed. The match was called off 16 hours before it was scheduled to kick off. None of the March wages owed to the Wanderers' players have been paid. ""As a result of these disappointing developments, the league has been forced to suspend Saturday's fixture,"" an EFL statement said. ""The club [Bolton] is now deemed to be guilty of misconduct and will be referred to an Independent Disciplinary Commission. ""The EFL Board will now consider the matter of determining whether the fixture will be played or not."" In a club statement, Bolton said they ""would like to apologise for the inconvenience this will cause"". Brentford's squad travelled north from London on Friday in preparation for the Championship game, which was due to be played at the University of Bolton Stadium. Bolton's relegation to League One was confirmed on 19 April when they lost to Aston Villa. Earlier on Friday, Wanderers' squad had issued a joint statement, saying the financial situation was ""creating mental, emotional and financial burdens for people through no fault of their own"". They added that it was ""placing great strain on ourselves and our families"". The players also apologised to supporters for what ""may be seen as drastic action"" but stressed the decision had ""not been taken lightly"" and that they had taken the stance ""with deep regret"". The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said on Friday afternoon that it supported the players' actions, adding they had shown ""great patience and loyalty"" to the club, but had ""reached a point where action is necessary"". ""The PFA has been working with the club since the beginning of the season and we have done all we can to resolve this issue, including giving Bolton Wanderers a substantial loan to cover players' salaries in December,"" the statement added. Earlier this month, Bolton's players refused to train for 48 hours in support of club staff after March wages went unpaid. Full-time non-playing staff eventually received their March wages after a delay. On Friday night - before the EFL called the game off -prospective new owner Laurence Bassinihad said he would work to ensure Saturday's fixture went ahead. He told Sky Sports News that the players' wages would be paid and that he would speak to the EFL in an attempt to find a resolution.

Nigeria police die as Shell workers seized,"Shell is involved in oil and gas production in the Niger Delta Two senior employees of the oil company Shell have been kidnapped and their police escorts killed in Nigeria's restive Delta region, police said. The attack took place as the workers were returning from a business trip on Thursday on a road in Rivers state. Gunmen killed the guards, one of whom was driving the vehicle, and seized the two workers, officials said. A police spokesman said efforts were under way to rescue the Shell employees. Their names and nationalities have not been released.

Shootout as Sri Lanka police step up raids,"This video can not be played Brother Stanley recalls coming face-to-face with one of the Sri Lanka bombing suspects Fifteen people including six children were killed in Sri Lanka on Friday when suspected Islamist militants blew themselves up in a raid, police said. The raid occurred in Sainthamaruthu, near the hometown of the suspected ringleader of the Easter Sunday attacks that killed at least 250 people. Gunmen opened fire as troops attempted to raid a house, police said. Three men set off explosives, they added, killing the children and three women. Three others died in gunfire. One civilian was caught in the crossfire and died, according to police, while a wounded woman and child were taken to hospital. Footage shown on state television showed charred bodies inside the house, one cradling a rifle. Explosives, a generator, a drone, and batteries were also visible. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? Children of the Easter Sunday carnage US woman wrongly identified as suspect Around the same time, security forces raided another building in a nearby town where they said they found explosives and a drone. Some 600 Muslims fled the area as the raid unfolded and took shelter in a school, residents said. By Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Sainthamaruthu There's an eerie silence in the street where security forces carried out the raid. Three armed policemen stand outside the house, which has suffered damage to its roof.  Steel gates and glass windows have been shattered. There are bloodstains on the ground. A van damaged during the shooting is still there. There were suspicions that the van could have been booby-trapped but police have not found anything inside the van so far. Police found charred remains of several people inside the building. All the neighbours in the street have moved out of the area because of fears for their safety. Police  say a woman and a child were rescued from the house. Both of them were injured. They believe they could be the wife and daughter of radical cleric Zahran Hashim, the suspected mastermind of the Easter Sunday attacks. Sainthamaruthu is a predominantly Muslim town overlooking the Indian Ocean. It is about 360km (240 miles) from the capital, Colombo. Residents here are still in disbelief that hardcore militants were hiding in a middle-class locality. It is still not clear how many suspected Islamists are still in hiding. Sri Lanka has been on high alert since a co-ordinated wave of bombings last Sunday, which also wounded more than 500 people. The bombings targeted churches that were packed full for the Easter holiday, as well as hotels popular with tourists. Sri Lankan authorities blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Tawheed Jamath, for the attacks, although the Islamic State group (IS) has also claimed it played a role. President Maithripala Sirisena outlawed the extremists under new emergency laws, as well as the militant group Jamathei Millathu - whose members are also thought to have been involved. Sri Lankan soldiers inspect a car at a checkpoint in the capital, Colombo Security forces have carried out raids across the country since the attacks, but officials say there are dozens of IS sympathisers still at large in the country. Police said the raid on Friday followed a tip-off about a location in the Muslim-majority town of Ampara Sainthamaruthu, near Batticaloa. The area is not far from the hometown of Zahran Hashim, who is said to have died in one of the bombings on Sunday. St Anthony's shrine in Colombo was one of the churches targeted by bombers In another raid in the same town, IS flags, 150 sticks of gelignite explosive, thousands of steel pellets and a drone camera were found, a military spokesman said. According to local media reports, 10 arrests were made across the country on Friday, bringing the total number detained since last Sunday to 80. President Sirisena has told reporters that intelligence services believed about 130 suspects linked to IS were in the country and that police were hunting 70 still at large. The manager of one of the Colombo hotels targeted by a suicide bomber last Sunday described to the BBC the moments leading up to the attack. Rohan Karr said the suspected bomber checked into the Cinnamon Grand hotel the evening before, was served a welcome drink and then went up to his room. This video can not be played CCTV footage from the Cinnamon Grand breakfast room ""He came down in the morning with the rucksack on his back and he went into the restaurant. He made sure he got a table right in the middle of the restaurant and he was walking around with the rucksack on his back. ""We never thought this was the man who [was] going to kill us. ""He sat, he ate, he waited for people to gather towards the buffet. When he saw a bigger crowd that was the time he decided, this is the time for me to create maximum damage."" The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka has cancelled all Sunday Masses until further notice. Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Ranjith said he had seen a leaked security document warning of further attacks. Cardinal Ranjith said that the Church had not been told about intelligence warnings of possible attacks. ""We didn't know anything. It came as a thunderbolt for us,"" he told reporters. Asked about the warnings, he said: ""I felt betrayed a little bit. I felt sad. It's a very serious lapse on the part of the security agencies that they didn't tell us about it."" Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, fears further attacks are possible He said the church would halt all services until further notice, and urged parishioners to instead ""stay indoors and do their prayers"". Security was stepped up around mosques for Friday prayers, while some Muslims stayed away, fearing revenge attacks. Sri Lanka's police chief and top defence ministry official both resigned over the bombings. But Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that crucial intelligence warnings had not been passed on to him. He argued that as he had not been aware of the warnings, he did not need to step down from his position. ""If we had any inkling, and we had not taken action, I would have handed in my resignation immediately,"" he said, adding: ""But what do you do when you are out of the loop?"" This video can not be played Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke to the BBC The breakdown in communication has refocused attention on the infighting between the country's two most powerful men - Mr Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena. Relations between the two deteriorated to such an extent that last October,Mr Sirisena sacked Mr Wickremesinghe. He was reinstated in December following rulings by Sri Lanka's highest courts. This video can not be played Zahran Hashim's sister condemns his actions Nine people are suspected of carrying out the attacks. President Sirisena confirmed that the alleged ringleader, Zahran Hashim, died in the attack at the Shangri-La hotel in the capital, Colombo. Two of the bombers are said to have been the sons of spice trader Mohammad Yusuf Ibrahim, one of Sri Lanka's richest men. Mr Ibrahim was detained and questioned after the attacks. One of his sons was reportedly the second bomber at the Shangri-La hotel alongside Zahran Hashim. The other son reportedly targeted the restaurant at the high-end Cinnamon Grand hotel, a short distance away. Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack Sri Lanka attacks: Who were the bombers?

"Cosmetic firms warned over 'duty of care'Too many providers are ""operating as a law unto themselves"", England's top doctor says.Health","England's top doctor says practitioners offering cosmetic procedures should have training to help them protect vulnerable clients from ""quick fixes"". Prof Stephen Powis believes providers should be officially registered and trained to spot people with body-image or other mental-health issues. NHS England says only 100 out of 1,000 practitioners are currently registered. And a charity says procedures such as Botox can have a damaging effect on the mental health of young people. Prof Powis, medical director at NHS England, wants professionals who provide procedures such as fillers and injections to join the newJoint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners,external. He says too many providers are ""operating as a law unto themselves"". He welcomed the move by some practitioners to undertake training on how suitable their customers are for cosmetic anti-aging treatments, calling it a ""major step forward"". But he said the numbers were still too low. And he warned clients that they still needed to vet firms properly before havingcosmetic procedures,external, which include botulinum toxin injections - such as Botox - fillers, skin peels, lasers and hair restoration surgery. Prof Powis said: ""We know that appearance is the one of the things that matters most to young people, and the bombardment of idealised images and availability of quick-fix procedures is helping fuel a mental-health and anxiety epidemic."" But the NHS could not be ""left to pick up the pieces"", he added. ""We need all parts of society to show a duty of care and take action to prevent avoidable harm.""

"Failed airline FlyBMI 'owed ÃÂ£37m'The airline collapsed in February, owing millions to suppliers and passengers.","Flybmi had a fleet of Embraer jets The regional airline FlyBMI owed Â£37m when it collapsed. Most creditors, including passengers and suppliers who have lost out, may receive only 1%  of their claims, say administrators. The airline cancelled all flights and filed for administration in February, blaming spikes in fuel and carbon costs and uncertainty over Brexit. Many of the airline's routes, aircraft and former staff have been taken on by its sister airline company, LoganAir. When FlyBMI filed for administration, passengers were due Â£3.8m under EU compensation rules, according to a statement of affairs from the company's directors. Passengers whose flights were cancelled were told to contact their travel agents or insurance or credit card companies for a refund. Rolls Royce was owed Â£2.25m for a servicing contract, the statement of affairs says. FlyBMI ran services for mainly business passengers between UK regional airports and continental European cities, including Munich, Frankfurt and Brussels. Stansted Airport and Bristol Airport were owed money by FlyBMI, according to a list of unsecured creditors to the airline. The carrier operated 17 aircraft, 14 of which were ""detained"" after the administration ""due to unpaid navigation service charges,"" according to the administrators. Parent company Airline Investments Limited (AIL) said the company made a loss of Â£6.8m in the year to 31 March 2018 and losses deepened during the rest of 2018. ""The company was also becoming increasingly concerned about the potential impact of Brexit and the ability to conduct intra-European flying whilst operating under a UK Operators Certificate,"" say the administrators BDO. BDO said FlyBMI's trading was worse than forecast at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019 when FlyBMI's ultimate owners, the aviation entrepreneurs Peter and Stephen Bond, said they would stop funding FlyBMI. AIL said more than Â£40m had been invested in FlyBMI in the six years before its collapse. Many of FlyBMI's former routes, including those from Newcastle and Aberdeen, are now operated by LoganAir. The Scottish airline has also taken over several ""key"" contracts that FlyBMI used to operate, including one for Airbus and the route between Derry and London Stansted. ""Any airline is free to start routes as they see fit, and indeed one other airline has already announced services on a former BMI route too"", LoganAir's managing director Jonathan Hinkles told the BBC in February. Fifteen aircraft which carried FlyBMI livery are currently, or will soon be, operated by LoganAir. About 130 former FlyBMI pilots and cabin crew now work for LoganAir. Airport landing slots controlled by FlyBMI were ""transferred"" to LoganAir before administrators were appointed ""preventing the airports seeking to cancel them"", BDO says, adding that LoganAir is trying to sell the slots. The two airlines used to ""trade as sister airlines with their own management teams and brand identities but taking advantage of commercial, operational and procurement synergies"", according to AIL.
