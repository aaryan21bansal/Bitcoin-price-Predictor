MPs give final backing to Brexit bill,"MPs have given their final backing to the bill that will implement the UK government's Brexit deal. The Commons voted 330 to 231 in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and it will now pass to the House of Lords for further scrutiny next week. If peers choose to amend it will it come back before MPs. The bill covers ""divorce"" payments to the EU, citizens' rights, customs arrangements for Northern Ireland and the planned 11-month transition period. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January. The bill comfortably cleared its third reading in the House of Commons, as expected, with a majority of 99. All 330 votes in favour were Conservative. It took just three days for the bill to pass the remaining stages in the Commons, after MPs gave their initial approval to the legislation before the Christmas recess. Theresa May - Boris Johnson's predecessor in Downing Street - repeatedly failed to get her Brexit agreement passed by MPs, which led to her resignation as prime minister. Kuenssberg: What a difference a majority makes Adler: Why Brexit Stage Two may turn into a rocky ride What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? What is the transition period? The latest vote gives approval to the11-month transition periodafter 31 January, in which the UK will cease to be an EU member but will continue to follow its rules and contribute to its budget. The purpose of the transition period is to give time for the UK and EU to negotiate their future relationship, including a trade deal. Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael said his party would continue to oppose the ""dangerous"" bill. ""They have voted for a bill that will slash the rights of future generations to live and work across 27 other countries,"" he said. ""They have voted for a bill that strips away our guaranteed environmental protections, despite the fact that we are facing a climate emergency."" And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Scotland would ""remain an independent European country"". ""This is a constitutional crisis, because we will not and we cannot accept what is being done to us,"" he told MPs. But Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay has said the bill will deliver on the ""overwhelming mandate"" his party was given at the general election to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January. He has also said he is ""confident"" the UK will be able to negotiate a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year, despite critics saying that the deadline is too tight. Mr Johnson has also insisted a deal is possible by December 2020 and has said the transition period will not be extended. He has said the UK is ready to start negotiations ""as soon as possible"" after 31 January. On Wednesday, new European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned it would be ""impossible""to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020.

Epstein jail CCTV erased by 'technical errors',"Jeffrey Epstein was charged with sexually abusing dozens of girls Surveillance video from disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's first suspected suicide attempt was destroyed by accident, prosecutors say. US prosecutors say the jail mistakenly saved footage from the wrong cell. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, first tried to kill himself in July last year, then hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty to abusing dozens of girls, some as young as 14. Soon after Epstein's death, in August, two of the CCTV cameras outside his cell had malfunctioned and were being examined by the FBI, US media reported. The case of Jeffrey Epstein - in 300 words How conspiracy theories spread after Epstein's death Epstein was found semi-conscious in his prison cell with injuries to his neck on 25 July. After this incident, he was placed on suicide watch. Eventually, Epstein was moved to a different cell, where he died on 10 August. Two prison guards have since been accused of failing to check on him during this time and falsifying records to say that they had. There have been ongoing questions over the July recording, which was initially deemed missing and then was said to have been located by jail staff. A letter filed by Assistant US Attorneys Jason Swergold and Maurene Comey said ""the footage contained on the preserved video was for the correct date and time, but captured a different tier than the one where Cell-1 was located"", New York City media report. This video can not be played Prince Andrew spoke to the BBC in November about his links to Epstein ""The requested video no longer exists on the backup system and has not since at least August 2019 as a result of technical errors."" The request for the video was made by a lawyer for Nicholas Tartaglione, a former New York police officer who shared a cell with Epstein in July and is charged with homicide in an unrelated case. The attorney argued the video could show his client had acted ""admirably"", possibly helping Epstein. The Federal Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? 'Screw-ups' led to Epstein death, says US official New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections. He was often seen socialising with the rich and powerful, including US President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the UK's Prince Andrew. Epstein was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002-05. He was arrested on 6 July. He avoided similar charges in a controversial deal in 2008, pleading guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution.

Police clear supermarket after TV price error,"The store refused to sell the television to customers at the bargain price Police cleared a supermarket in France after customers refused to leave when they were denied a deal on televisions. GÃ©ant Casino in the southern city of Montpellier accidentally priced TVs at â¬30.99 instead of â¬399 on Wednesday. However the supermarket refused to honour the bargain price. The customers then blocked the checkout demanding that they be allowed to purchase the television sets. Dozens of police officers were called in to help clear the store. According to French media, when customers arrived at the checkouts, staff told them they could not buy the television sets for the price advertised. Nutella 'riots' spread across France Customers then became angry and refused to leave the store unless they could purchase the televisions. Jean-Christophe, who works inside the shopping mall, told Midi Libre: ""We are located right across from the GÃ©ant Casino checkout lines. I saw a lot of police and a crowd of people. "" He added that some people had four or five televisions in their shopping trolley. Images and video posted to social media shows customers at the checkouts refusing to leave. Allow Twitter content?

Under the consumer code, any seller is required to sell the product at the price displayed even if it is due to a labelling error. However if the price is clearly an obvious mistake, thenthe vendors can refuse to sell,external, BFM TV said. There have been cases in the past where businesses have opted to honour the error price. Last January, Hong Kong based airline Cathay Pacific mistakenly sold business-class seats on August flights from Vietnam to New York for about $675 (Â£517) return. Prices on the same route in July and September cost $16,000. The airline laterannounced it would honour the fare purchases.

UK's chlorine-washed chicken ban 'to remain',"Chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef will be kept out of the UK under any trade deal with the US, the environment secretary has promised. Theresa Villiers told the BBC the current European Union ban on the two foods will be carried over into UK legislation after Brexit. Until now the UK has been wavering on the issue. But she told BBC Countryfile: âThere are legal barriers to the imports and those are going to stay in place.â Ms Villiers has previously talked of imposing tariffs on any future imports of US chicken and beef. But sheâs been under great pressure from Britainâs farmers. In the exclusive interview with the Countryfile programme, she said: âWe will defend our national interests and our values, including our high standards of animal welfare."" How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? Chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef are illegal under EU law for different reasons. The EU says feeding cows with growth-enhancing chemicals could potentially result in harm to beef-eating humans â a suggestion the US fervently rejects. There is, on the other hand, no human health threat from using a bleach solution to kill salmonella on chickens. In fact, itâs rather effective. But the EU says using chlorine allows American farmers to be careless with the welfare of the chickens. The US regards the rules against these products as a European ruse to protect its own producers, and has stated that the trade of both meat products will be central to any UK-US trade deal after Brexit. So Ms Villiersâ promise may please British consumers unhappy with the thought of chicken sprayed with bleach. But it may make things more difficult for Britainâs trade negotiators. The environment secretary has made a strong promise that ""legal barriers"" to the import of chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef will ""stay in place"" and that the government will ""hold the line"" on this even if insisted upon by President Trump in trade talks. This makes a quick trade deal with the US rather tricky to envisage. Leaked US-UK trade documents showed the US tried to establish how far the UK would, after Brexit, detach from the EU's hard line against US farm trade methods. US officials had made a presentation and repeatedly raised the ""unscientific approach the EU maintains towards Pathogen Reduction Treatments [chlorinated chicken]"". The US has been in a dispute with the EU over such methods since 1997. If the environment secretary's rejection of such key US exports is echoed in the UK's negotiating position with the US, the US Congress might also object. When similar statements were made by Michael Gove, when he was former environment secretary, in 2017, it caused a rift in cabinet with Liam Fox, who was then trade secretary . It is a clear example of the delicate balancing act and trade-offs involved in the UK's new post-Brexit trade freedom. The full interview with the environment secretary will be shown on Countryfile on BBC1 on 26 January. How safe is chlorine-washed chicken?

Government to miss 2021 broadband network target,"The Scottish government is to pay for people to access superfast broadband after admitting it will not hit its target for extending the fibre network. Ministers had originally pledged to extend high-speed cables to every home and business in Scotland by 2021. However MSPs have now been told that work on the network will run past 2023. A voucher scheme will be offered so those not connected on the original schedule can get superfast broadband from satellite or mobile operators. Energy minister Paul Wheelhouse said this would ensure everyone would be able to have access to high-speed services in the original timescale, despite the delay to the infrastructure rollout. But opposition parties said his announcement was ""deeply disappointing"" and ""another broken promise from the SNP"". Look back on Mr Wheelhouse's statement on Holyrood Live The SNP's manifesto in 2016 had pledged that the party would ""ensure that 100% of premises in Scotland have access to superfast broadband"" by the end of the parliamentary term, in 2021. In a statement at Holyrood, Mr Wheelhouse said the plan for the Reaching 100% or ""R100"" programme was now to roll out full-fibre broadband - with speeds ""significantly beyond our original commitment"". However he said the ""complexity"" this entails meant that work on ""around half"" of targeted premises in the south and centre of Scotland would be finished by the end of that year, ""with the majority of the build completed by the end of 2023"". The minister did not provide a target date for the north of Scotland, where the contract for the work has been caught up in a legal challenge. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse updated MSPs at Holyrood Mr Wheelhouse acknowledged that ""this on its own would be insufficient to enable superfast access for all homes and business by the end of 2021 as promised"", saying that ""additional support"" would be offered instead. This will take the form of a voucher scheme which the government said would ""allow people to obtain superfast broadband from other sources, from satellite operators to fixed wireless/mobile operators and larger fibre suppliers"". Details of how this scheme will work are expected later in the year. Mr Wheelhouse said: ""Through our investment, we will extend full-fibre broadband to much of rural Scotland, going beyond our original commitment, and helping to deliver future-proofed economic, social and environmental benefits for the whole country. ""This is one of the most challenging broadband infrastructure builds anywhere in the world, and this, combined with the decision to future-proof our technology, means the work will take time to complete. ""We are also setting up a voucher scheme which will launch later this year. This will provide grants to broadband customers, ahead of the delivery of the R100 contracts, to support access to a range of technologies and suppliers."" Scottish Conservative infrastructure spokesman Jamie Greene said it was ""another day, another failed contract, another broken promise from the SNP"". He said: ""The SNP had no obligation to make promises it couldn't keep to businesses and residents, but it chose to do so for political gain knowing it was nigh on impossible to deliver."" Scottish Labour's Colin Smyth said the government was ""never, ever going to deliver its R100 programme by the end of 2021"", calling this ""the worst kept secret"". He said: ""Superfast broadband is no luxury. The ability to have quick and easy access to the internet is a necessity in the modern world, particularly for those in rural areas from the Highlands to the Borders."" And Lib Dem connectivity spokesman Mike Rumbles said that people were getting ""a piece of paper"" instead of a service, adding: ""Ministers have utterly failed to do what they said they would do and thousands of homes in rural and remote communities have been let down by this Scottish government.""

'Misery' for A&E patients facing record-long waits,"Patients needing emergency care have faced a ""miserable"" time, doctors say, as data shows record-long delays in England in the past month. Hospitals reported huge pressures in December, with one in five A&E patients waiting over four hours. A key problem seems to have been a shortage of beds on wards. Nearly 100,000 of the sickest patients were forced to spend over four hours on trolleys and in corridors after their time in A&E as beds could not be found. Delays were also experienced by those brought in by ambulances. One in six crews had to queue outside A&E units for more than 30 minutes, waiting to handover patients to hospital staff - the target is 15. 11 charts on the challenges facing the NHS Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Katherine Henderson said: ""The NHS is struggling to escape its spiral of decline. ""This will have been a miserable Christmas period for many patients and staff alike."" NHS medical director Prof Stephen Powis said it had been a ""very busy"" period, compounded by an earlier outbreak of flu than had happened in previous winters. He said the health service was looking to recruit more staff and open more beds to help relieve pressure in the future. In the meantime, hospitals have been forced to take emergency steps to relieve pressure. Many have postponed routine operations to try to free up space. And some hospitals have even had to introduce emergency protocols and re-route ambulances to other nearby services. There were more than 120 cases of this happening last month - with some hospitals instigating the measure, known as an A&E divert, multiple times. This video can not be played Mark Newton reveals the long wait his father-in-law faced after attending the A&E unit at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital Mark Newton's 83-year-old father-in-law, George Bufton, was taken to Shrewsbury Hospital in the first week of January. He had a chest infection and a suspected gall bladder problem - and this came just over a month after a major bowel cancer operation. He spent 25 hours waiting for a bed to be found. Mr Newton said he was ""gobsmacked"" by what he saw. At one point about 20 trolleys were waiting in the corridor, with queues of ambulances outside A&E. He said staff were doing an ""admirable"" job in the circumstances but there was just not enough money or staff to cope. ""It was utter mayhem. This can't continue. Something must be done about it,"" Mr Newton said. December was certainly the worst month since the four-hour target was introduced, in 2004. Just 79.8% of patients spent less than four hours in A&E - well below the 95% target. Three trusts - Norfolk and Norwich, Stockport and Hull - all saw performance drop below 60%. Meanwhile, a group of Midlands trusts - Shrewsbury and Telford, Leicester, Birmingham and United Lincolnshire - were all among the 10 worst performers. Waiting times have been getting gradually worse over the autumn - October and November saw record worst levels set as well. But the problems in emergency care has not just been confined to A&E waits. The number of patients who then needed to be admitted on to the ward and faced long delays also hit a new worst level. There were 98,500 patients who faced a so-called ""trolley wait"" of a further four hours. That is nearly one in four of the patients who needed to be admitted. These ""trolley waits"" can be in corridors or temporary waiting areas, either in A&E or just outside. Patients who are admitted are often the sickest of those who attend A&E. The waiting time targets for cancer treatment and routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, have also been missed. Hospital bosses acknowledged it had been one of the most difficult months they had seen - and this comes despite the extra money the government has put in this year, which saw the NHS budget grow by 3.5%. There are a variety of reasons behind the problems. Prof Joe Harrison, chief executive of Milton Keynes Hospital, said his staff had been seeing some very sick patients. He said it had mainly been a combination of older patients and children, who seemed to have been particularly hard hit by flu and respiratory problems. But the figures also show the number of beds closed to contain vomiting and diarrhoea outbreaks rose by more than 60% compared with last year, with 760 beds closed on average each day last month - nearly 1% of the bed supply lost. Prof Harrison also said the social-care system in the community, which hospitals rely on to discharge patients into, seemed to have been struggling more than it had been last year. ""Keeping people safe has been our main priority. There is significant pressure, not just in this hospital, but across the NHS system as a whole,"" he said. Richard Murray, from the King's Fund think tank, said he believed there were too few beds in the system. ""Hospital bed numbers have fallen significantly over the past decade. With hospitals full to capacity, it is clear that bed reductions have gone too far."" The difficulties have not just been confined to England - none of the three core targets covering A&E, routine operations or cancer is being met in the other three nations. In recent days, the Hywel Dda health board, which is in charge of services in west Wales, said it had had to cancel planned surgery at a number of local hospitals because of the ""challenging"" situation. The British Medical Association said services across the nation had been stretched, with some reports cancer surgery had had to be cancelled too. The four-hour performance figures for December will not be released by the Welsh government until later in the month. Scotland's figures for the festive period are not available yet either - but November was one of the worst months on record. Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, which has the worst record when it comes to A&E delays, there is concern continuing strikes by nurses will have exacerbated the winter pressures. While A&E departments have remained running during the strikes, the second round of which took place this week, there have been reports hospitals have struggled to discharge patients quickly enough. And this has a knock-on effect of causing delays admitting patients. According to the latest figures, which date back to September, a third of patients were waiting longer than four hours in A&E, which was twice as bad as the situation in England and Scotland during that month.

'Red flags missed' before toddler's choke death,"James Manning died after choking on a piece of sausage at Butlin's holiday park in Bognor Regis A toddler who choked on a sausage while on a Butlin's holiday could still be alive if his tonsils had been removed sooner, an inquest heard. Two-year-old James Manning died in June 2018 after choking at Butlin's in Bognor Regis. Consultant Philip Hyde, from Southampton Children's Hospital told an inquest ""red flags"" were missed despite a number of choking episodes. Dr Hyde added that James's condition ""warranted an urgent referral"". The toddler, from Battle, East Sussex, died two weeks after choking on a piece of sausage at the holiday resort. James Manning had been at the resort with his mother and grandmother West Sussex Coroner's Court in Crawley heard James had a history of choking issues and breathing difficulties. He had been on a waiting list to have his adenoids removed, along with his enlarged tonsils, in a bid to prevent more incidents. His mother Natalie Reeves previously told the inquest her son would sometimes wake up gasping for breath and would choke on his food at least once a week. Ms Reeves said she felt she had to plead with doctors to get a hospital referral. Dr Hyde said: ""I feel that the NHS could have responded quicker to his situation, most particular his multiple episodes of presentation.  I feel there were opportunities to intervene and they would have made a difference to him choking in 2018."" Dr Hyde said ""red flags"" were missed and James should have been ""on a much more rapid referral pathway"".  He suggested James could still be alive if his tonsils had been removed earlier.

"'Full of dreams, and now they're gone'","This video can not be played ""She was full of dreams and now they're gone"": Vigil held for Iran plane crash victims in Toronto In the aftermath of the deadly Ukraine Flight PS752 crash, Canadians are left to mourn not just the loss of life but the bright futures snatched away, write Jessica Murphy and Robin Levinson-King. In a small room inside a student housing complex at the University of Toronto, more than a hundred people gathered to mourn, pray and share stories of the loved ones they lost in Ukraine Flight PS752. The space, which is typically used as a student common area, had been transformed into a kind of funeral parlour, decorated with candles, white bouquets and photos of the victims. Most of the service was in Persian, and tea and sweets were served. Like many being held across the country, the vigil on Wednesday evening was an impromptu event, quickly put together in the hours after the plane went down earlier that morning. Many were still in shock from the news, less than 24 hours old. ""She was full of dreams, and now they're gone,"" Elnaz Morshedi told the BBC between sobs. Her friend, University of Toronto student Zeynab Asadi Lari, was killed in the crash. Ms Morshedi says Ms Lari, who was studying health sciences, had wanted to volunteer with Doctors Without Borders next semester. ""She was studying all the time, but she wanted to live, she wanted to have fun, to fall in love. And she doesn't have time for this anymore."" Ms Lari's brother, Mohammad Asadi Lari, also died in the crash. He was the co-founder of STEM fellowship, a youth-run charity that helps students in the maths and sciences. ""They were the best of us,"" Ms Morshedi says. All 176 people on board the flight were killed when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Iran. Sixty-three of them were Canadian nationals, but many more called Canada their home, at least temporarily. They lived in cities like Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton. Many were students or professors, working on important research in their fields. US sanctions have made it increasingly difficult to travel between Iran and Canada, and the Ukraine International Airlines flight from Tehran to Kiev and then to Toronto is popular because it is one of the most affordable options for the journey, said Younes Zangiabadi with the Iranian Canadian Congress. Some 63 Canadians were on the Tehran to Kiev flight, en route to Toronto The deaths have cast a pall over university campuses across the country. ""You look at the odds of such a thing happening to you,"" said Seyed Hossein Mortazavi with disbelief, ""but I suppose that's fate."" ""They definitely didn't expect this. None of us did. But I think it's just a burden the whole community has to carry."" Who are the victims of Iran plane crash? Canada is home to a large Iranian diaspora, with some 210,000 citizens of Iranian descent, according to the federal census. But Mr Mortazavi said that on campuses the community feels small. ""Nearly anybody in our community knows someone on that plane, through friends, through family,"" he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the crash a ""heartbreaking tragedy"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to ensure the cause of the crash was found. ""Canadians have questions and they deserve answers,"" he told media in Ottawa on Wednesday evening. Mr Trudeau said Canada would work closely with its partners to ensure the crash is thoroughly investigated - and would be requesting the presence of Canadian officials in Tehran to assist families seeking consular assistance, as well as to participate in any investigation into the cause of the incident. To those who lost family members and loved ones, he said ""your loss is indescribable"". Tehran won't give Boeing or US black boxes ""This is a heartbreaking tragedy. While no words will erase your pain, we want you to know that an entire country is with you, we share your grief."" It was truly a national tragedy, leaving families and loved ones in mourning across the country. And each story was a tragedy in itself. In Vancouver, Ardalan Ebnoddin Hamidi, Niloofar Razzaghi, and their teenage son Kamyar were on the flight, confirmed family friend Kei Esmaeilpour, with the Civic Association of Iranian-Canadians. Mr Esmaeilpour said the family were in Iran for a short vacation, and that his friend Ardalan had expressed concerns to him before leaving about the security situation there, but eventually decided to go on the trip. He said people who knew the family were asking how something like this could have happened. Two separate couples were killed on the way back from their weddings in Iran. Siavash Ghafouri-Azar and his wife Sara Mamani Engineer Siavash Ghafouri-Azar was returning home with his new wife, Sara Mamani, when the plane crashed. The couple had just bought their first home near the Canadian city of Montreal, and were looking forward to throwing a house-warming party, said his former thesis supervisor Ali Dolatabadi, an engineering professor at Concordia University. ""It is a great loss,"" Mr Dolatabadi told the BBC. ""He was very intelligent, a gentleman. He had a kind and a gentle soul."" The couple had met a few years earlier at Concordia and both went on to work at top engineering firms in Montreal. They had decided to get married in Iran because they wanted to celebrate with family, Mr Dolatabadi said. Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand with their two daughters Newlyweds Arash Pourzarabi, 26, and Pouneh Gourji, 25, were graduate students in computer science at the University of Alberta and were also returning to Canada from their wedding. The crash also claimed the lives of two young girls, Daria and Dorina Mousavi, aged 14 and 9, along with their parents, Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand, who taught at the University of Alberta. Payman Parseyman, an Iranian-Canadian from Edmonton, said the community was devastated as they learned that many from the city's Iranian diaspora, as well as foreign Iranian students who had been studying there, had been on flight PS752. ""It's mostly been shock, disbelief,"" he told the BBC. Canadians across the country mourned lost family members and loved ones He said many Iranian-Canadians were already glued to their televisions or the internet watching for news about the ballistic missile strikes launched by Iran on air bases housing US forces in Iraq late on Tuesday evening, and ended up watching early reports on the plane crash in real time. Aftermath of Ukrainian passenger plane crash in Iran People were quick to begin connecting via the Telegram messaging app, seeking information and finding ways to support the families and loved ones of those killed. Canada has not had diplomatic representation in Iran since 2012, when it closed its embassy in Tehran and expelled Iranian diplomats from Ottawa. Officials said a number of allies, including France, Italy, and Australia, have offered Canada assistance on the ground in Iran. ""We've been having such a split as a community these past few months,"" says Mr Mortazavi, who attended the vigil at the University of Toronto. ""I hope this acts as a turning point for all of us, so that people start reflecting about each other, about the friendships.""

UK ban on US chlorine-washed chicken 'to remain',"Chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef will be kept out of the UK under any trade deal with the US, the environment secretary has promised. Theresa Villiers told the BBC the current European Union ban on the two foods will be carried over into UK legislation after Brexit. Until now the UK has been wavering on the issue. But she told BBC Countryfile: âThere are legal barriers to the imports and those are going to stay in place.â Ms Villiers has previously talked of imposing tariffs on any future imports of US chicken and beef. But sheâs been under great pressure from Britainâs farmers. In the exclusive interview with the Countryfile programme, she said: âWe will defend our national interests and our values, including our high standards of animal welfare."" How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? Chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef are illegal under EU law for different reasons. The EU says feeding cows with growth-enhancing chemicals could potentially result in harm to beef-eating humans â a suggestion the US fervently rejects. There is, on the other hand, no human health threat from using a bleach solution to kill salmonella on chickens. In fact, itâs rather effective. But the EU says using chlorine allows American farmers to be careless with the welfare of the chickens. The US regards the rules against these products as a European ruse to protect its own producers, and has stated that the trade of both meat products will be central to any UK-US trade deal after Brexit. So Ms Villiersâ promise may please British consumers unhappy with the thought of chicken sprayed with bleach. But it may make things more difficult for Britainâs trade negotiators. The environment secretary has made a strong promise that ""legal barriers"" to the import of chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef will ""stay in place"" and that the government will ""hold the line"" on this even if insisted upon by President Trump in trade talks. This makes a quick trade deal with the US rather tricky to envisage. Leaked US-UK trade documents showed the US tried to establish how far the UK would, after Brexit, detach from the EU's hard line against US farm trade methods. US officials had made a presentation and repeatedly raised the ""unscientific approach the EU maintains towards Pathogen Reduction Treatments [chlorinated chicken]"". The US has been in a dispute with the EU over such methods since 1997. If the environment secretary's rejection of such key US exports is echoed in the UK's negotiating position with the US, the US Congress might also object. When similar statements were made by Michael Gove, when he was former environment secretary, in 2017, it caused a rift in cabinet with Liam Fox, who was then trade secretary . It is a clear example of the delicate balancing act and trade-offs involved in the UK's new post-Brexit trade freedom. The full interview with the environment secretary will be shown on Countryfile on BBC1 on 26 January. How safe is chlorine-washed chicken?

John Lewis warns it may not pay staff bonus,"Paula Nickolds was John Lewis' first female managing director Retail group John Lewis Partnership has warned its staff bonus may be in doubt as it reported a fall in festive sales at its department store chain. It warned that annual partnership profits were expected to be ""substantially down on last year"". The board will meet in February to decide if it is ""prudent"" to pay the staff bonus, the partnership said. In a surprise announcement, John Lewis & Partners also said its managing director Paula Nickolds will step down. The partnership has been combining the executive teams behind John Lewis and Waitrose into one team, and she was expected to become executive director of brand next month when the teams merged. John Lewis said: ""After some reflection on the responsibilities of her proposed new role, we have decided together that the implementation of the future partnership structure in February is the right time for her to move on."" Worst year for retail in 25 years, says trade body Christmas pudding sales slump in challenging festive period M&S sales squeezed as men shun skinny trousers Ms Nickolds was the first woman to become managing director of the partnership, having worked her way up after joining as a graduate trainee in 1994. She will leave the partnership next month. There will be another big change at the top of the partnership in February, when top former civil servant Sharon White will take over as chair. Outgoing chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said the decision for Ms Nickolds to step down was taken by both of them. ""Paula has been a brilliant leader of this business for many years,"" he said. ""We decided together now is the time to step away."" Ms Nickolds had been a rising star in the business. When asked about what had changed between October and January, Sir Charlie said: ""Things change. People's desires, people's perspectives change. ""My perspective is that what we've done and what we're doing is the right thing to do."" The decision on whether or not to pay the traditional staff bonus, which will be taken by Ms White, will be ""influenced by our level of profitability, planned investment and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet"", the partnership said. The John Lewis Partnership is owned by its staff, who are known as partners. The last time that staff did not receive a bonus was in 1953. However, whether or not it would be paidwas in doubt last year. In March 2019, the partnershipcut the bonusafter a plunge in profits. John Lewis warned that this time around, full-year profits might not be enough for it to pay out any bonus. The partnershipfell to a loss in the first half of 2019, as it warned of ""difficult"" trading conditions and ""subdued consumer confidence"". It said on Thursday that it would reverse those losses, but it warned that profits would still be ""substantially down"" on the previous year. Sir Charlie said that profits had been hit ""because we are price competitive, because we match prices"". John Lewis has a price comparison promise enshrined in its ""never knowingly undersold"" slogan, which commits it to matching the prices of High Street competitors, but not those of online-only competitors. Trading conditions are tough at the moment, he said. ""Unfortunately, you can't choose the weather. When the weather is fine, you make hay - and we did. ""You have to use the winter to sow the seeds for the next harvest."" Christmas sales at John Lewis department stores were down 2% on a like-for-like basis, the partnership said. Sales in its home and technology departments were weak, down 3.4% and 4% respectively in the seven weeks from 17 November to 4 January. But it said beauty department sales were up 4.7% and Black Friday department store sales jumped 10%. At the same time, Waitrose sales rose 0.4%, which Sir Charlie described as ""a good sales performance"" in a ""weak grocery market"". Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said the results were ""a huge dent to John Lewis' recovery plans"". ""A company that was once placed on a pedestal as the future of retail by government and analysts has had its legs taken from under it, leaving it stumbling battered and bruised into 2020,"" she said. The ""never knowingly undersold"" promise ""continues to erode margins as it seeks to compete on price with competitors that have leaner operations and lower overheads"", she said. ""The rules of this promise may need to be reviewed and renewed if the retailer is to start turning around, and a savvy operator with Treasury experience like Sharon White may be just the kind of mind needed to do it,"" Ms Palmer added.

"'She was full of dreams, and now they're gone'","This video can not be played ""She was full of dreams and now they're gone"": Vigil held for Iran plane crash victims in Toronto In the aftermath of the deadly Ukraine Flight PS752 crash, Canadians are left to mourn not just the loss of life but the bright futures snatched away, write Jessica Murphy and Robin Levinson-King. In a small room inside a student housing complex at the University of Toronto, more than a hundred people gathered to mourn, pray and share stories of the loved ones they lost in Ukraine Flight PS752. The space, which is typically used as a student common area, had been transformed into a kind of funeral parlour, decorated with candles, white bouquets and photos of the victims. Most of the service was in Persian, and tea and sweets were served. Like many being held across the country, the vigil on Wednesday evening was an impromptu event, quickly put together in the hours after the plane went down earlier that morning. Many were still in shock from the news, less than 24 hours old. ""She was full of dreams, and now they're gone,"" Elnaz Morshedi told the BBC between sobs. Her friend, University of Toronto student Zeynab Asadi Lari, was killed in the crash. Ms Morshedi says Ms Lari, who was studying health sciences, had wanted to volunteer with Doctors Without Borders next semester. ""She was studying all the time, but she wanted to live, she wanted to have fun, to fall in love. And she doesn't have time for this anymore."" Ms Lari's brother, Mohammad Asadi Lari, also died in the crash. He was the co-founder of STEM fellowship, a youth-run charity that helps students in the maths and sciences.

Royals 'hurt' over Sussexes' announcement,"This video can not be played Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond: ""It is very clear the palace is very upset about what has happened"" The Royal Family are ""hurt"" at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's announcementthey will step back as senior royals. Prince Harry and Meghan did not consult any royal about making their personal statement, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond was told by palace sources. Buckingham Palace was ""blindsided"", he said, as talks about their future had begun but were in very early stages. The palace said there were ""complicated issues"" to work through. What do we know so far? In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight The Harry and Meghan story Intheir statementon Wednesday, Harry and Meghan said they made the decision ""after many months of reflection and internal discussions"". They said they intend ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially independent"". They plan to split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". ""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter,"" the couple said. Despite the couple's decision, Harrywill remain sixth in line to the throne.,external The pair was already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. The Sussexes' new charity is expected to be global, linked to Africa and the US, rather than domestic - and will have a commitment to female empowerment. It was revealed in December the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services. Meghan, of course, is American herself and has a particularly close relationship with her mother who lives in California. Butthe Sun, which broke the story on Wednesday,,externalwas firm in its speculation that Canada was their likely destination. The couple have just returned after a six-week break from royal duties, which they spent in Canada with their eight-month-old son, Archie. After returning to the UK on Tuesday, Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, visited Canada's High Commission in London to thank the country for hosting them and said the warmth and hospitality they received was ""unbelievable"". Former actress Meghan lived and worked in Toronto for seven years during her time starring in the popular US legal drama Suits. She has previously spoken about adopting the city as her second home after her native Los Angeles, andshe has several Canadian friends. Jessica Mulroney, a close friend of the duchess, posted a quote on Instagram about a ""strong woman"" facing a challenge. The Canadian stylist and TV star wrote: ""A strong woman looks a challenge in the eye and gives it a wink."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The couple's announcement raises numerous questions over what their future royal roles will entail. In stepping back as senior royals, Harry and Meghanhave announced they will no longer receive funding from the Sovereign Grant.,external The couple said this will make them ""members of the Royal Family with financial independence"". The Sovereign Grant is public money which pays for the cost of official royal duties, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. The Queen's Sovereign Grant from the Treasury was Â£82m in 2018-19. The couple said the Sovereign Grant paid for 5% of their official office from 2019, with the remaining 95% being funded by Prince Charles through his income from the Duchy of Cornwall. Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? Under current rules, the pair said they are ""prohibited from earning income in any form"", but in their new roles could follow other title-holding royals in having full-time jobs. The costs of official overseas visits will be funded by the Sovereign Grant and contributions from the host country ""when appropriate"". The couple are classified as ""internationally protected people"", which means they must have armed security provided by the Metropolitan Police. They will retain Frogmore cottage, the Grade-2 listed property in Windsorthat cost taxpayers Â£2.4m to renovate, as their official residence so they have a ""place to call home"" in the UK. Bryony Gordon, a Daily Telegraph journalist who knows and has interviewed the couple, suggested their decision could be linked to their mental health, after becoming a ""punching bag"" for a ""misogynistic and racist"" nation. In 2017, Ms Gordon interviewed the prince for herMad World podcast,externalin which he revealed hesought counselling while struggling in his late 20s to cope with the death of his mother.,external Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC 5 Live, she said: ""Here is a man who every day has to live out the trauma that he experienced as a little boy when he had to walk behind her coffin at the age of 12 in front of the world, and I think if any of us were put in that situation we would find it incredibly triggering."" She added the couple had become a ""punching bag for a nation that is still sort of deeply misogynistic and racist"" and they were ""entitled"" to ""do what is best"" for their family's mental health. She believes the couple will carry on exactly as before ""but just for free"", as they're ""sick of the scrutiny"" that comes with taking public money. Ms Gordon (pictured) interviewed the prince for a podcast in which he revealed he sought counselling to cope with his mother's death Royal historian Prof Kate Williams said it will be ""difficult"" for Harry and Meghan to lead ""normal"" lives, as media interest in them will increase after their ""unprecedented"" move. She told BBC Breakfast: ""It is going to be difficult if Harry and Meghan are going to live in Canada for a certain period of time and try and get on with business and be normal, charitable CEOs. ""They will require security because I don't see the media interest in them waning, I see it as probably increasing, because what they're doing is so unprecedented for royals."" A happy memory of Canada? The moment in 1991 when Prince Harry and his brother were reunited with their mother in Toronto during an official visit is an iconic royal image Royal commentator Penny Junor said the couple's actions were reminiscent of those of Harry's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The suggestion that they had not consulted other royals before making their statement was ""beyond bizarre"". She said: ""It has echoes of Diana when she suddenly announced after her separation [from Charles] that she was stepping back from 50 of her charities without consulting anybody. ""The problem is that they are not working for themselves, they are working for a family firm and to be making announcements of this sort without consulting is beyond bizarre."" Graham Smith, a spokesman for Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said Harry and Meghan's decision ""raises questions about the monarchy's future"" and will prompt taxpayers to ask how the couple's extra security and overseas lifestyle will be funded. ""To suggest that they're not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of self-entitlement and a lack of self-awareness that is common among royals,"" he said. ""This really is wanting to have your cake and eat it. They have said they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won't stop taking public money until they find other sources of income."" Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said ""we must continue to celebrate and support"" the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK, adding that it has an ""important role in public service"". This is clearly a major rift between Harry and Meghan on one part, and the rest of the Royal Family on the other. There are far more questions than answers. What will their new role be? Where will they live, and who will pay for it? What relationship will they have with the rest of the Royal Family? And there's the institutional question - what does this mean for the Royal Family? It comes just months afterPrince Andrew stepped back from his dutiesafter a BBC interview about his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Some might see this as the slimmed-down monarchy that the 21st Century needs. But Harry and Meghan reached people that other royals didn't. They were part of the reinvention and refreshing of the institution. It's understood talks have begun between Palace officials and No 10 about the implications of Harry and Meghan's announcement. We're now in wait-and-see mode as to whether this new model of being a royal can work - or if this is really a staging post for them to leave the Royal Family. Signs the couple were unhappy with their royal life have been apparent for some months. In October last year, the Duchess of Sussexbegan legal actionagainst the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The paper stands by its story. At the time, Prince Harry said his wife had ""become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press"" after a ""ruthless campaign"" of ""relentless propaganda"". ""Though we have continued to put on a brave face... I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,"" he said. In an ITV documentary last year, Meghan, who was born in the US, described motherhood as a ""struggle"" due to intense interest from newspapers. ""Not many people have asked if I'm OK,"" she said. This video can not be played Meghan spoke to ITV as part of a documentary last year Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said on Thursday the press should ""leave Harry and Meghan alone"" in the wake of their decision. The Labour MP for Leicester South expressed support for the couple, adding that the duchess had suffered ""appalling"" abuse and that she ""deserves a break"". On Wednesday the royal couple announced they would be adopting a ""revised media approach"" from the spring. As part of the new strategy,published on their website,external, they will ""engage with grassroots media organisations and young, up-and-coming journalists"". They will also pull out of the so-called royal rota system, where journalists and media representatives are given exclusive access to cover royal engagements on the understanding they share the material they gather. ""The current system predates the dramatic transformation of news reporting in the digital age,"" the couple said. The National Union of Journalists criticised the plans, saying the move appears to try and ""prevent the media from functioning and compromising the ability of journalists to do their jobs, which is completely unacceptable"".

Queen asks staff to find solution with Sussexes,"The Duchess of Sussex has returned to Canada to join her son amid discussions over the future role for her and Prince Harry in the Royal Family. Meghan and Prince Harry had been in Canada over Christmas with baby Archie. It comes as the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge asked staff to find a workable solution after the couple announced they will step back as senior royals. The Royal Family was said to be ""hurt"" at the couple's statement. Palace sources have told BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond that Prince Harry and Meghan did not consult any other royal about making their personal statement. Your questions answered on Harry and Meghan statement Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight In their announcementon Wednesday evening, Prince Harry and Meghan revealed they intend ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially independent"". They plan to split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". The decision came ""after many months of reflection and internal discussions"", they added. This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan: Who else has taken 'early retirement'? On Thursday, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the Queen had been in touch with the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. They all directed senior staff to work with the Sussex household and government to find a solution within days. It was later confirmed to the BBC that Meghan had left for Canada, said BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond. This video can not be played ""People should back off"": The public react to Prince Harry and Meghan stepping back Our correspondent said Buckingham Palace was ""blindsided"" by the couple's statement. There had been talks within the Royal Family about the Sussexes' future - but they were at an early stage, he said. US President Donald Trumptold Fox News,externalhe thought the announcement from Harry and Meghan was ""sad"". He said: ""I don't want to get into the whole thing, I just have such respect for the Queen, it shouldn't be happening to her."" In a statement on Wednesday, Buckingham Palace said: ""We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through."" Despite the couple's decision, Harrywill remain sixth in line to the throne.,external Meghan said the family's time in Canada was ""incredible"" Last October, Prince Harry and Meghanpublicly revealed their strugglesunder the media spotlight. After returning to the UK after their six-week break in Canada on Tuesday, Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, visited Canada's High Commission in London to thank the country for hosting them and said the warmth and hospitality they had received was ""unbelievable"". Former actress Meghan, who is American, lived and worked in Toronto during her time starring in the popular US drama Suits, and she has several Canadian friends. The talk in some quarters is that the Sussexes' hand was forced bythe impressive scoop of the Sun newspaper,externalon Wednesday. If that's the case - and the couple's media strategy is certainly unconventional - it goes some way to explaining why there are many more questions than there are answers. But how did they get here? Those who have always had it in for Meghan put it down to her. But that's a long way from the truth. Harry's royal path has always been hard. There was the long shadow of his mother's early death, the media spotlight on his youthful mistakes and the extraordinary interest that his relationships and then his marriage sparked. Unlike his older brother Prince William, Harry has never grown used to media, and still visibly bridles at the cameras and the questions. And he is obviously - visibly - bored by the ceremonial side of the job. In short, he has long wanted out. And together with the woman he loves he now thinks he has found a way. But the manner of his leaving - their leaving - is breathtaking. Read more from Jonny. The pair were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. The Sussexes' new charity is expected to be global, linked to Africa and the US, rather than domestic - and will have a commitment to female empowerment. It was revealed in December the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services. Sentebale, the charity co-founded by Prince Harry, issued a statement saying that, as its patron, he has been a ""passionate advocate"" for its work, adding: ""We know that support will continue."" This video can not be played What would Canadians think about welcoming the royal couple? In stepping back as senior royals, Harry and Meghanhave announced they will no longer receive funding from the Sovereign Grant.,external The Sovereign Grant is public money - Â£82m in 2018-19 - which pays for the cost of official royal duties, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. The couple said the Sovereign Grant paid for 5% of their official office from 2019, with the remaining 95% being funded by Prince Charles through his income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The couple are classified as ""internationally protected people"", which means they must have armed security provided by the Metropolitan Police. They will retain Frogmore cottage, the Grade-2 listed property in Windsorthat cost taxpayers Â£2.4m to renovate, as their official residence so they have a ""place to call home"" in the UK. Reaction to the couple's announcement from royal commentators has been mixed, with numerous questions over what their future royal roles will entail. Bryony Gordon, a Daily Telegraph journalist who knows and has interviewed the couple, suggested their decision could be linked to their mental health, after becoming a ""punching bag"" for a ""misogynistic and racist"" nation. This video can not be played Meghan spoke to ITV as part of a documentary last year Graham Smith, a spokesman for Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said Harry and Meghan's decision ""raises questions about the monarchy's future"" and will prompt taxpayers to ask how the couple's extra security and overseas lifestyle will be funded. ""This really is wanting to have your cake and eat it,"" he said. ""They have said they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won't stop taking public money until they find other sources of income."" Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said ""we must continue to celebrate and support"" the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK, adding that it has an ""important role in public service"". However, Labour leadership candidate Clive Lewissaid he believes there should be a referendum on the future of the Royal Family,adding: ""A lot of people would like to see the monarchy scaled down."" A happy memory of Canada? The moment in 1991 when Prince Harry and his brother were reunited with their mother in Toronto during an official visit In October last year, Meghanbegan legal actionagainst the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The paper stands by its story. At the time, Prince Harry said: ""Though we have continued to put on a brave face... I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.""

Iran 'mistakenly shot down Ukraine jet' - US media,"This video can not be played Footage appears to show missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Evidence suggests an Iranian missile brought down a Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed near Tehran, possibly in error, Western leaders say. Canada and the UK called for a full and thorough investigation into the crash, which killed all 176 people on board. Iran's civil aviation chief, however, said he was ""certain"" that the plane was not hit by a missile. The crash came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Iran is known to have Russian-made Tor missile defence systems US media have speculated that the timing of the crash suggests the plane may have been mistaken for a US warplane as Iran prepared for possible US retaliation for the strikes. Victims included 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians as well as nationals from Sweden, the UK, Afghanistan and Germany. CBS News quoted US intelligence sources as saying a satellite detected infrared ""blips"" of two missile launches, followed by another blip of an explosion. What we know about downed flight PS752 Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' Why were so many Canadians on the plane? Meanwhile, Newsweek quoted a Pentagon and senior US intelligence officials, as well as an Iraqi intelligence official, as saying they believed Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 was hit by a Russian-made Tor missile. Video obtained by the New York Times,externalappeared to show a missile streaking across the night sky over Tehran and then exploding on contact with a plane. About 10 seconds later a loud explosion is heard on the ground. The plane, ablaze, continues to fly. An investigation is continuing into what caused the crash US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he had ""suspicions"" about what happened to the plane. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Western countries to share their information about the crash. Amid tensions heightened by the US killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani on 3 January, Iran initially said it would not hand over the recovered black box flight recorders to Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, or to the US. However, an Iranian official later told Reuters the US had been formally invited to take part in the investigation, and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed it had assigned an investigator. Boeing said it would support the NTSB in the inquiry, and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said it had also been invited to the accident site by Tehran. This video can not be played Mobile phone footage appears to show the plane in the moments before it came down Under global aviation rules Iran has the right to lead the investigation, but manufacturers are typically involved. Iranian TV pictures later in the day showed the crash site being bulldozed. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had received intelligence from multiple sources indicating that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, adding that it was possible that this was unintentional. ""This reinforces the need for a thorough investigation,"" he said. ""Canadians have questions and they deserve answers."" But he said it was too early to apportion blame or draw any conclusions, and refused to go into detail about the evidence. Who were the victims of the crash? Tributes to three British nationals killed The Canadians on the flight were expecting to fly on to Toronto from Kyiv. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed Mr Trudeau's words and saidBritain was working closely with Canada and other international partners affected by the crash. Speaking in Canada, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British nationals were advised not to travel to Iran, ""given the body of information that UIA Flight 752 was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, and the heightened tensions"". Ukraine's president met the relatives of crew members on Thursday Newsweek quoted sources as saying that Iran's anti-aircraft systems were probably active following its attacks on the US airbases. Two Pentagon officials had assessed that the incident was accidental, Newsweek added. This video can not be played Asked about the cause of the plane crash, President Trump said: ""I have my suspicions"" Earlier on Thursday, Oleksiy Danylov, the secretary of Ukraine's security and defence council,said in a Facebook post (in Ukrainian),externalthat a Tor missile strike was one of four possible causes being considered: The others are: A mid-air collision with a drone or other flying object Engine destruction/explosion due to technical reasons An explosion inside the plane as a result of a terror attack Mr Danylov said Ukrainian investigators, who are already in Iran, would include experts who worked on the investigation intothe 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine. At a news conference on Friday, Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation (CAOI) chief Ali Abedzadeh repeated his view that a missile was not the cause of the crash. ""The thing that is clear to us and that we can say with certainty is that this plane was not hit by a missile,"" he told reporters. ""As I said last night, this plane for more than one and a half minutes was on fire and was in the air and the location shows that the pilot was attempting to return."" On Friday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei described the reports of a missile strike as ""psychological warfare"". A pattern of disturbing indications is emerging suggesting that Flight PS752 may well have been shot down by mistake by Iran's own air defences. While it is not unprecedented for air defence systems in conflict zones to shoot down airliners, this would be an extraordinary error. The aircraft had only just taken off from an international airport; it was a scheduled flight; and it should easily have been recognisable. However, precisely what the operators of the Russian-supplied, Soviet-era Tor - or SA-15/Gauntlet system as it is known by Nato - would have seen is unclear. All this is hugely embarrassing for the Iranian authorities and is only going to complicate the politics involved in getting to the bottom of this tragedy. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 to Kyiv had 167 passengers and nine Ukrainian crew on board. A team from Iran's Red Crescent searched the debris for victims There was good visibility when the plane went down near Iran's capital, according to the Flightradar24 aviation website. Officials from the airline said the crew were experienced. Iran's head of emergency operations said 147 of the victims were Iranian. That would suggest that 65 of the foreign nationals had dual nationalities. The Ukrainian airline gave a helpline number for further information about passengers:+38-044-581-50-19.

How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs lifeExplainer: Where do the royal couple get their money?Your questions: Will they keep their royal titles?World's media split on royal moveHarry's life in the spotlight,"The pair were first pictured together at the 2017 Invictus Games after months avoiding the cameras Meghan Markle was the American actress, with a passion for humanitarian and feminist causes. Harry was the rebel prince turned soldier, considered the world's most eligible bachelor. In the summer of 2016, the two were brought together on a blind date by a mutual friend in London. ""Beautiful"" Meghan ""just tripped and fell into my life"",Harry later told the press,and he knew immediately she was ""the one"". After just two dates, the new couple went on holiday together to Botswana, camping out under the stars. They fell in love ""so incredibly quickly"", proof the ""stars were aligned"", said Harry. To the British press, their romance was catnip. Here was a golden couple who were able to draw vast crowds, speak the language of younger generations and sprinkle royal stardust on any cause. For months the couple avoided the cameras and it wasn't until the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto that the the two were first photographed holding hands in public, smiling and laughing. Royals 'hurt' over Sussexes' announcement Royal Family tree and line of succession Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? But there had been signs early on that the fairytale was some way off a ""happily ever after"". When Harry first confirmed the relationship in late 2016, it came with a stark attack on the media, accusing them of subjecting his girlfriend to ""a wave of abuse and harassment"". He spoke of nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers, attempts by reporters and photographers to get into Meghan's home and the ""bombardment"" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. It was a problem that was only going to get worse. Despite that - or perhaps because of that - the two grew ever closer and in September 2017, Meghan declared to Vanity Fair magazine: ""Personally, I love a great love story."" The two of them had been enjoying a special time together and were really happy and in love, she said. The media was now on high alert for the sound of royal wedding bells - and they didn't have to wait long. This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan Markle posed for the cameras in the garden at Kensington Palace In November 2017, Harry got down on one knee to propose to Meghan as they made roast chicken together at their home in Kensington Palace. Harry had designed the ring, made with two diamonds which had belonged to his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. At the centre was a diamond from Botswana. The couple shared their story in a candid interview with the BBC, and appearing brimming with positivity for the future. They revealed Meghan would give up acting to focus on causes close to her heart, working alongside her husband-to-be. ""I know that she will be unbelievably good at the job part of it,"" said Harry. Things began to shift as preparations got under way for a May 2018 wedding in Windsor. This video can not be played Highlights from the wedding ceremony It quickly became clear that this was a royal couple who wanted to do things differently - their way. The wedding, which much of the world tuned in to watch, had all the traditions - a stunning dress, cheeky bridesmaids and heartfelt vows. But, as our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said at the time, the service with its gospel choir, young black cellist and breathtaking address from Bishop Curry, marked it out as a modern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple, which seemed to point to a different future for the Royal Family. Married life brought with it new titles - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and a new home at Windsor in Frogmore Cottage. During a trip to Merseyside, the duchess told well-wishers she was six months pregnant and did not know if it was a boy or a girl In October of that year, the couple embarked on their first royal tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, over 16 days. It was there that they shared the news that they were expecting their first baby. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, seventh in line to throne and the Queen's eighth great-grandchild, was born on 6 May 2019. To Harry, who was by Meghan's side at the birth, little Archie was ""absolutely to die for"". Throughout Meghan's pregnancy, the continual redrawing of battlelines had gone on between the press and the couple. This was to be no repeat of the Duchess of Cambridge's birth with the circus of journalists and photographers lying in wait outside hospital doors for days on end. The press had been told there would be no information about the birth, beyond that it was happening. Such scrutiny and pressure proved to be a struggle for the newly-wed Meghan during her pregnancy and in early motherhood, she later admitted in an ITV documentary filmed during their tour of southern Africa in September. ""Not many people have asked if I'm OK,"" she said, looking lost. She spoke of her vulnerability during pregnancy and the challenges of having a new-born - ""it's a lot"". Asked if she could cope, she said she had long told Harry it was not enough to just survive - ""that's not the point of life - you have got to thrive"". Archie was christened in a private ceremony, from which the press and the public were excluded There were further signs that the couple were not happy, when the prince opened up about his mental health. He said it was under constant management and he lived with the pressures of avoiding a repeat of the past that took his mother, the Princess of Wales, from him. She died in a car crash in Paris when Harry was just 12. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes. ""Everything that she went through, and what happened to her, is incredibly important every single day, and that is not me being paranoid,"" he said. ""Part of this job is putting on a brave face but, for me and my wife, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue,"" he added. It has also been suggested the scrutiny of Meghan has been greater because of her African-American heritage. Former US presidential candidateHillary Clinton said she wanted to hug Meghanfor the British media's ""racist"" treatment of her, while Harry hashighlighted how ""unconscious bias""can lead to racist behaviour even if people do not consider themselves to be racist. Their struggles were shared in an interview while touring southern Africa The couple's frustration and anger with some sections of the press has gone from being a matter between the palace and editors into the full glare of the public spotlight. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters and Harry filed proceedings at the High Court against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking. As such a dramatic year came to a close, the royal couple took an extended break from royal duties over Christmas, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped theirbombshell announcement. Neither Harry's father, Prince Charles, nor his older brother, Prince William, with whom Harry has said he has ""good days"" and ""bad days"", were consulted. Harry and Meghan were, they told their Instagram followers, planning to leave their royal duties - and the royal purse - behind. They hope their next chapter, spent in North America as well as the UK, will see the two of them, together with baby Archie, make their own path to the future.

Explainer: Where do the royal couple get their money?Your questions: Will they keep their royal titles?World's media split on royal moveHarry's life in the spotlight,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the UK after stepping back from official royal duties. The couple have since launched various commercial ventures, including a new lifestyle brand headed by Meghan Markle called American Riviera Orchard. Harry and Meghan met in 2016 and married in 2018. Theystepped down as senior royals in January 2020. Angry about media intrusion, they were frustrated that Buckingham Palace stopped them developing their ""SussexRoyal"" brand. Harry remains a prince andis fifth in line to the throne. Harry and Meghan were married in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle The couple kept their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, but are no longer addressed as his or her royal highness (HRH). Harry also gave up his military titles. When Harry's father Charles became King, the couple's two children became Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Harry and Meghan discuss 'protecting' their children Press battle 'central' to Royal Family rift - Harry Harry and Meghan moved to California in June 2020, saying they wanted space to raise Archie. Lilibet was born there in 2021. The couple no longer has an official UK residence. In early 2023, they were asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage, a Grade-II listed property on the Windsor estate. Frogmore Cottage had been a gift from the late Queen Elizabeth In April 2024, documents filed to Companies House listed the US as the country where Harry is usually resident, instead of the UK. The change was dated 29 June 2023, thought to be the date the couple formally left Frogmore Cottage. The conservative US think tank The Heritage Foundationhas repeatedly raised questions about Harry's US immigration statusbecause of his previous comments about taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms. It wants the government to release his records, to show whether drug use was disclosed - as this can block US visa applications. But in September,US judge Carl Nichols ruled Prince Harry's visa application should remain private. Separately, some reports had suggested the prince - who turned 40 on 15 September - was seeking a phased return to the UK. However, BBC News royal correspondent Sean Coughlan said ""well placed sources""had confirmed Prince Harry would continue to be based in the US,partly because of continuing concerns about his family's security arrangements. I met Harry as he turned 30 - here's how he's changed The duke returned to the UK fora memorial service for his uncle Lord Robert Fellowes in Norfolk in August. The Prince of Wales was also there, although the brothers reportedly did not speak to each other.

As working royals, they received 95% of their annual income from Harry's father, then Prince of Wales. Thetaxpayer-funded Sovereign Grantmade up the other 5%.

In September, Netflixannounced on X, formerly Twitter,external, that Polo would be broadcast in December. The couple previously featured in the Harry and Meghan documentary series, where they talked about life in the Royal Family, and The Heart of Invictus series, which discussed the duke's emotional ""unravelling"" after military service in Afghanistan. The Netflix documentaries have featured previously unseen photographs of the couple Archewell alsomade podcasts for Spotifyunder a contract thought to be worth $25m (Â£19.7m). The arrangement ended in June 2023. In February 2024,Meghan announced a new podcast deal with Lemonada Media.,external Books Harry's memoir, Spare, was published in January 2023. It discussed his relationship with his brother and father, as well as his griefover the death of his mother, Princess Diana. The Prince's much-publicised memoir sold 467,183 copies in its first week The book's publishers promised $1.5m (Â£1.18m) and Â£300,000 would be given to the Sentebale and WellChild charities. Meghan wrote a children's book called The Bench in 2021. Inheritance William and Harry received the bulk of Princess Diana's Â£13m fortune when she died in 1997. In a 2021 interview, Harry told Oprah Winfreythis money funded his family's move to the US. He is also thought to have inherited millions from his great-grandmother, the Queen Mother. It is not known whether the late Queen left him any money. Acting During her acting career, the Duchess of Sussex was reportedly paid $50,000 (Â£40,000) for each episode of the legal drama Suits. She appeared in more than 100 episodes. Meghan Markle pictured with her Suits co-stars in 2012 After stepping back from official duties, the duke and duchess were no longer afforded the security arrangements provided for senior royals. When Harry first left the UK, he said it would be too dangerous to bring his family back without adequate police protection, and took the government to court. Home Office lawyers said the duke would still have publicly funded police security in the UK, under ""bespoke arrangements"". In late February 2024,the High Court ruled that this approach ""was, and is, legally sound"". In June, Harry's legal team saidhe had been given permission to challenge the High Court decision in the Court of Appeal. An earlier separate court rulingrejected the prince's request to be allowed to pay privately for more substantial protection. Harrysettled a phone-hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers in February 2024. His lawyer said the duke had been awarded ""substantial"" damages. He was also grantedÂ£140,600 in damages in another part of the case.

Your questions: Will they keep their royal titles?World's media split on royal moveHarry's life in the spotlight,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's decision to ""step back"" as senior members of the Royal Family has generated interest across the world. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are said to have ""blindsided"" Buckingham Palace with the announcement, which the couple said came after ""many months of reflection"". They saidthey intended to become financially independent while continuing to supportthe Queen. But what does it mean for their future? Will the duke still be in the line of succession? And what if the couple split up?BBC royal correspondent Sarah Campbellanswers readers' questions. Succession to the throne in the UK is not only due to birth, but also legislation. It would take an Act of Parliament to remove a person from the line of succession. Downing Street has so far said that questions on the duke and duchess's announcement are ""for the royal household"". The Royal Family tree and line of succession It is worth noting that, as the Cambridge family expands, Prince Harry will keep moving down the line of succession. Archie has no title - that was his parents' decision when he was born. He is simply Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. There is no suggestion the duke and duchess wish to renounce their titles. In full: Sussexes' statement and palace response Harry and Meghan step back: What will happen next? In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together He remains a member of the Royal Family - stepping back from duties does not change that. Moreover, what the couple plan to do has not been tried before, so there is no precedent to guide us. This rule applies to some applicants for British citizenship. We were told that Meghan was not going to be fast-tracked to get citizenship and it will take the same length of time for her as for anyone else. We are not aware she is a dual citizen as yet (as in, that she has a British passport). Buckingham Palace did not respond when asked whether the duchess's citizenship application would be affected by the announcement. Meghan has talked about the fact that, even though she was already in the public eye, she wasnot prepared for the huge press interestwhich came with marrying into the Royal Family. We simply do not know how much support the duke and duchess have been given, so it is difficult to say whether they should have been given more. The next Invictus Games is to be held this year in The Hague. The Invictus Games Foundation - with Prince Harry as patron - was established to preside over the games and, as it is a separate entity, it will continue regardless of what happens with Prince Harry's status within the Royal Family. It will remain one of his key commitments. 'Freedom' or 'petulance'? World's media split on royal move How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight Prince Edward and his wife the Countess of Wessex are now both working members of the Royal Family with a busy schedule of engagements. But they both experienced difficulties when pursuing careers in the private sector: Sophie worked for a PR firm that was caught in a sting by a national newspaper and she was recorded making comments about members of the Royal Family; Edward had little success as a television producer. They both gave up their careers and are now full-time ""working royals"" paid for using income from the Duchy of Lancaster, the Queen's private income. Wallis Simpson was an American divorcee like Meghan Markle. In 1936, it was considered the public would never accept a divorcee as Queen. Edward VIII - the Queen's uncle - had to choose between the throne and Wallis Simpson. He chose her, thereby relieving himself of his position and all royal duties. Prince Harry and Meghan have said they wish to ""step back"" as senior royals suggesting they do intend to carry out some duties on behalf of the Queen. This is their choice as opposed to a course of action they have no option but to follow. But - it is early days and it is really not clear yet how their part-royal, part-private roles will pan out. On their website, the couple say they will continue to use Frogmore Cottage - their home on the Windsor estate - with the permission of its owner, the Queen. They say the cottage will be their ""official residence as they continue to support the monarchy, and so that their family will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom"". They add that the refurbishment of the cottage was planned well before they decided to move in and their decision to live there saved money when compared with the refurbishment of another property at Kensington Palace. On their website, Harry and Meghan say they will no longer receive funding through the Sovereign Grant, ""thereby making them members of the Royal Family with financial independence"". However, the couple say the grant only provides 5% of their income and it is unclear whether they will give up their other sources of funding. Explained: Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? The couple will continue to be given a security detail paid for by the taxpayer-funded Metropolitan Police, which does not disclose the costs involved. The couple's intention to travel back and forth from North America would likely add to this cost, but it is possible they will pay towards this - although it will be a large bill. This comes after Harry and Meghanclaimed on their new website,externalthat 95% of funding for their office comes through income from Prince Charles' estate - the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy estate belongs to all heirs to the throne and has existed since Edward III created it for his son and heir, Prince Edward (famously known as the Black Prince), in 1337. According to a charter, the Prince of Wales, as the Duke of Cornwall, receives income each year generated from assets on the estate - which includes large parts of Cornwall, Dorset and Herefordshire - but he does not benefit from the proceeds or profit on the sale of any assets,according to the Duchy's website.,external This means that the territory - and income - of the Duchy will pass to Prince William, as heir, and on to his son Prince George when he becomes the heir. Therefore the estate itself is not owned by any one member of the Royal Family, nor is it owned by the government. Harry and Meghan's wedding in May 2018 attracted some 100,000 well-wishers to Windsor as well as a global TV audience of hundreds of millions. At the time, the Berkshire police commissioner Anthony Stansfeldsuggested the costof securing the duke and duchess' wedding was ""between Â£2m and Â£4m"". Another recent comparison would be the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which cost the Metropolitan Police Â£6.35m - though it took place in London and was a larger event. The Metropolitan Police - which is responsible for securing the Royal Family - does not reveal the cost of day-to-day security or policing, so these costs are not known. Reports of previous estimates have suggested the cost of securing all senior royals costs the Met Police around Â£50m a year. Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?

World's media split on royal moveHarry's life in the spotlight,"Harry and Meghan at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto ""Come to Canada, where you belong."" It's a bold invitation fromthe Toronto Star,externalas the world's media digests the news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will step back from royal duties and consider basing themselves abroad. Not everyone is as supportive of Prince Harry and Meghan's decision, and there is some outright criticism to be found in editorials and leader columns of British newspapers. A scathing review of the move in the Daily Mirror says there ""can be no sympathy"" with the way the announcement was made. ""They were unable to find even a few moments to do our Queen the courtesy of discussing their plans,"" its leader reads. It says the move may cause ""an irreparable rift"" with the rest of the Royal Family. The Times leader calls,externalthe move ""premature... petulant and ill-judged"". ""The announcement carries all the hallmarks of the petulance and hot-headedness for which Prince Harry is sadly becoming well-known,"" it reads, adding that little thought has been given to the practicalities of their new roles. It argues that Harry and Meghan's wish to be financially independent but still be members of the royal family implies that they ""want to have it both ways"". The Harry and Meghan story Royals 'hurt' over Sussexes' announcement Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? In full: Sussexes' statement and palace response Royal Family tree and line of succession The Daily Express's leader is slightly more forgiving. It calls the couple a ""tremendous breath of fresh air"" but says they would have ""gained more empathy"" had they ""shown respect"". ""It is a massive error judgment not to have informed the Queen of such a bold decision,"" it reads. ""As a country we do expect a certain decorum from members of The Firm. And Harry's latest decision of not playing by those rules falls way short."" The Daily Mail's Richard Kay analyses,external""where it all went wrong"" for Harry and Meghan. He says the couple were ""bent on re-writing the rule book of what being a member of the Royal Family actually means"" from the moment they married, which led to a ""disconnect"". ""The rot set in even before the glow of that May wedding day had passed,"" Kay writes, citing, among other things, the privacy of their honeymoon and their ""secrecy"" over their son's birth. The Daily Telegraph's Camilla Tominey says,externaltheir ""break for freedom"" was ""long planned"" and can be traced back to November 2018, when they announced a ""split"" from the royal household they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. She quotes a source telling the paper at the time that Harry had ""always complained about being sidelined by William"" and they wanted to ""spread their wings"". The ""Fab Four"" at Sandringham on Christmas Day, 2017 Across the Atlantic, ""Megxit"" dominates thefront page of the New York Post,,externalwhich says Harry and Meghan are choosing ""commoner"" lifestyles. TheNew York Times says,externalthe duchess faced ""lacerating criticism"" from Britons who ""like their royals to be dutiful and traditional"". She was criticised for being ""too bold, too outspoken, too difficult, too American, too multicultural"", it writes, adding that the couple's desire to ""renounce the usual menu of royal obligations speaks directly to the challenges facing the monarchy"". Back at the Toronto Star, columnist Vinay Menon writes that the move will mean the couple are ""finally free"" and adds: ""Stepping back from your royal duties amounts to stepping into your future."" He adds that the rest of the Royal Family ""don't deserve"" them. The Australian says,externalthe move has ""breathed new life into the age-old debate over Australia's ties to the British monarchy"". It interviews the chairman of the Australian Republic Movement, who says that it ""highlights the Royal Family's waning power"". In France,Le Figaro interviews,externalFrench royal expert Stephane Bern, who says that royals who are ""not at the core"" need to show they can ""earn a living"" in today's world. ""Gone are the days when the English paid for everyone without wondering why,"" he tells the paper. Le Monde,externalsays it is ""a revolution in Buckingham Palace"". Die Zeit, in Germany, says,externalthe Queen now has a ""shortage of skilled workers"", andFrankfurter Allgemeine agrees,externalthat Harry and Meghan's decision is a ""serious loss"" for the Royal Family. Spain's El Mundo says on its front page that the couple have ""[slammed] the door in the British Royal Family's face"", whileEl PaÃ­s says,externalthey became the victims of a ""curse"" that sees royals without a ""determined destiny"" heavily criticised. The Italian paper La Repubblica says it is not clear whether it is ""the definitive strike that will weaken the foundations of The Firm"" or ""a publicity stunt"" to get more Instagram followers.

Harry's life in the spotlight,"The Duke of Sussex grew up in the media spotlight - from a young royal dealing with his mother's death, through his partying teenage years, to his career in the military. Since then Harry has followed in his mother's footsteps, doing charity work across the globe. He has got married and become a father. Now he and the Duchess of Sussex have begun a new chapter:giving up their royal duties, HRH titles and public fundingand living in California. Harry has tried to balance his public and private lives. At times, the publicity that comes with being sixth in line to the throne has helped him to bolster support for his charitable endeavours. But there have also been times when that attention has become too much, and he has fought fiercely for his family's privacy. Prince Harry was born in 1984, the second child of the Prince and Princess of Wales Born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on 15 September 1984, the prince was christened Henry Charles Albert David by the Archbishop of Canterbury in December of that year in St George's Chapel, Windsor. But it was officially announced from the start of his life that he would be known as Harry. Although christened Henry, he has always been known as Harry Harry with his mother and brother on a trip to Thorpe Park in 1993 The prince's childhood was cut short when his mother died in 1997. Princess Diana was killed in a crash in Paris, aged 36, as the car she was in sped through a tunnel followed by paparazzi photographers. Her death shook royal fans the world over, but it was 12-year-old Harry and 15-year-old William whose lives changed forever. The funeral, which featured the image of the boys walking behind their mother's hearse to attend the service at Westminster Abbey, remainsone of the most-watched programmes on the BBC. Prince Harry stood between his father, Prince Charles, and his older brother, Prince William, as they watched the hearse carry Diana's coffin ""I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,"" the prince said in aninterview with the Daily Telegraph,externalin 2017. He added: ""I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle."" The prince followed the educational path of his older brother William, at Wetherby School in Notting Hill, before entering Eton in 1998. Harry, five, on his first day at Wetherby School, Notting Hill Prince Harry watching his brother sign the Eton College entrance book in 1995 - he would follow in his footsteps, joining the school three years later After leaving Eton with two A-levels in 2003, Harry took a gap year. He worked on a sheep farm in Australia and with Aids orphans in Lesotho, paving the way for the charity he later set up there. Prince Charles took his sons on annual skiing holidays to Switzerland Attention from the press has been a constant in Harry's life. The front page of a 2002 edition of the (now defunct) News of the World roared: ""Harry's drugs shame"",  and claimed Prince Charles sent his son to visit a rehab clinic as punishment for smoking cannabis. St James's Palace confirmed the then 17-year-old had ""experimented with the drug on several occasions"" but said the use was not ""regular"". Then in October 2004, there was a scuffle with a photographer outside a club. A royal spokesman said at the time the 20-year-old prince was hit in the face by a camera ""when photographers crowded around him"". As part of his gap year, Prince Harry spent time at an orphanage in Lesotho, in southern Africa When Harry pushed the camera away, ""it's understood that a photographer's lip was cut"", the spokesman added. The following year, an image of the prince dressed as a Nazi at a fancy dress party sparked outrage. Clarence House later said the prince had apologised for any ""offence or embarrassment"" caused and had realised ""it was a poor choice of costume"". And in 2009, video footage emerged of Harry using offensive language to describe an Asian member of his Army platoon. St James's Palace said the prince was ""extremely sorry for any offence his words might cause"" but said he had ""used the term without any malice and as a nickname about a highly popular member of his platoon"". Harry enjoyed lighter-hearted press coverage during the London 2012 Olympic Games, in his role as an Olympic ambassador. The prince was an Olympic ambassador at the London 2012 Games In the same year he spent a lot of time in front of the cameras for the Queen's Jubilee. As part of those celebrations Harry completed his first royal solo tour overseas with visits to Belize, the Bahamas, Brazil and Jamaica. However, that August, photos emerged of the prince and a young woman naked in a Las Vegas hotel room. The two photos,published on US gossip website TMZ and later in the Sun newspaper, were taken on a private break with friends, with the site reporting the prince was in a group playing ""strip billiards"". He later said he had ""probably let myself down"" but added: ""I was in a private area and there should have been a certain amount of privacy that one should expect."" There is, however, a saving grace to the scrapes Harry has found himself in. As the younger brother to the expected future king, Harry has relatively little responsibility. Like the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and Prince Charles's younger siblings, Harry is a ""spare to the heir"" - and a world away from the throne. So Harry's indiscretions have done little to dent public opinion of him. And he has perhaps had a freer existence because of it; security worries would have made active service in Afghanistan impossible for his older brother, for example. Harry served a tour in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot Harry spent 10 years in the armed forces, becoming the first royal in more than 25 years to serve in a war zone. He was left disappointed in 2007 when Army chiefs decided not to send him to Iraq because of ""unacceptable risks"", but later spent 10 weeks serving in Afghanistan in 2008. Harry returned to the country as an Apache helicopter pilot from September 2012 to January 2013, before qualifying as an Apache commander in July 2013. He later describedhow he had shot at Taliban insurgents, and said that being in Afghanistan was ""as normal as it's going to get"" for him. The prince said quitting the Army had been a ""really tough decision"" When heannounced he would be leaving the Army in 2015, the prince said his time in the military would ""stay with me for the rest of my life"". This is reflected in his charity work, which mostly concentrates on mental health and helping service veterans. Harry's most notable charity work so far is his founding and chairing of the Invictus Games in 2014. The Paralympic-style international competition for injured ex-service personnel has been held in London, Orlando, Toronto and Sydney. The prince has been the driving force behind the Invictus Games He has also supported the charity Walking With the Wounded, for injured veterans. The prince's other charity work includes supporting conservation projects in Africa and jointly founding Sentebale, a charity to help orphans in Lesotho. On his visit to Angola in September, Harry said landmines are ""an unhealed scar of war"" Harry and his brother William have worked together on various charity initiatives He has continued his mother's work helping children affected by HIV and Aids, and supporting the Halo Trust's work in clearing landmines. Diana captured global attention when she walked through a live minefield in central Angola in 1997. She died in Paris later that year, before seeing the full impact of her visit - such as the signing of an international treaty to outlaw the weapons - but Harry highlighted her achievements whenhe retraced her stepsin September 2019. Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge supported Heads Together runners at the London Marathon in 2017 In later years, Harry has had counselling to help him deal with his mother's death. He was best man at his brother William's wedding in April 2011, and has since spoken of how hard it was not to have Diana there. In acandid interview with the Daily Telegraph,external, he described shutting down all of his emotions for nearly 20 years and refusing to thinking about his mother. This, he said, had a ""quite serious effect"" on his personal life and his work, and brought him close to a breakdown ""on numerous occasions"". He also said he would probably regret""for the rest of his life"" how brief his last phone call with his mother was, and spoke of her ""fun"" parenting. She was a ""total kid through and through"", he said. Harry, William and the Duchess of Cambridge joined forces to focus their campaigning efforts on mental health. They founded Heads Together, which aims to tackle stigma and fundraise for new support services. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were first pictured together at the Invictus Games in 2017 As one of the world's most high-profile bachelors, Harry's love life has drawn much interest over the years. In late 2016, he confirmed a new relationship with US actor, Meghan Markle,while issuing a statement,externalaccusing journalists of harassing her. He described ""nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers"", attempts by reporters and photographers to get into her home and the ""bombardment"" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. The pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. Then after just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana. Profile: Duchess of Sussex In September 2017, the year before their wedding, Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine she and Harry were ""two people who are really happy and in love,external"". Andin an interview that November, when their engagement was announced, Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was ""beautifully surprised"". He designed the engagement ring for Meghan, including two diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection. The couple married in May 2018at a ceremony at St George's Chapel in Windsor, and consequently became known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. On a 16-day tour of Australia that October, the duke and duchess announced they were expecting their first child, adding that they were happy to share the ""personal joy"" of their news. Baby Archie, described by Harry as ""our own little bundle of joy"", was born on 6 May 2019. Prince Harry said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" with the birth of his first child, Archie The duke's past few years have been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows. In 2019, he and his wife split their household office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the subsequent launch of the Sussexes' Instagram account amassed more than one million followers in record-breaking time (five hours and 45 minutes). The joy of becoming parents was followed days later by news Harry had accepted damages and an apology from a paparazzi agency that had used a helicopter to take photographs of his home in the Cotswolds. In June, the Sussexes announced they would split from the charity they shared with the Cambridges - fuelling speculation of a rift between brothers Harry and William. This video can not be played Prince Harry on his brother, William in 2019: ""We are certainly on different paths at the moment"" A 10-day tour of Africa at the end of September 2019 started well. Harry raised awareness for causes close to his heart, and the couple introduced Archie to anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. But during the tour, the Duchess of Sussex launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The duke and duchess went on a 10-day tour of Africa in September 2019 In a lengthy statement Harry said ""positive"" coverage of the tour of Africa had exposed the ""double standards"" of the ""press pack that has vilified [the duchess] almost daily for the past nine months"". And in an ITV documentary, filmed during the tour and broadcast the following month, the duchess admitted she was struggling to adjust to royal life, while the duke said his mental health was a matter of ""constant management"". Then, at the start of 2020, the couplemade a bombshell announcementthat they would be stepping back as senior royals. Later, Harry would tell host James Corden that the decision to step back was taken to protect himself and his family from the ""toxic"" situation created by the UK press. Their difficult relationship with the UK press saw both Harry and Meghan take legal action against publishers, as well ascutting ties with tabloid newspapers. After a brief stint in Canada, the couple now lives in California and are expecting their second child. The duke has since spoken out on several issues, includingon structural racism,human rightsandunconscious bias.

"Royals 'hurt' over Sussexes' announcementBuckingham Palace was ""blindsided"" by Prince Harry and Meghan's statement they were stepping back from their roles.UK","This video can not be played Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond: ""It is very clear the palace is very upset about what has happened"" The Royal Family are ""hurt"" at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's announcementthey will step back as senior royals. Prince Harry and Meghan did not consult any royal about making their personal statement, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond was told by palace sources. Buckingham Palace was ""blindsided"", he said, as talks about their future had begun but were in very early stages. The palace said there were ""complicated issues"" to work through. What do we know so far? In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight The Harry and Meghan story Intheir statementon Wednesday, Harry and Meghan said they made the decision ""after many months of reflection and internal discussions"". They said they intend ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially independent"". They plan to split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". ""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter,"" the couple said. Despite the couple's decision, Harrywill remain sixth in line to the throne.,external The pair was already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. The Sussexes' new charity is expected to be global, linked to Africa and the US, rather than domestic - and will have a commitment to female empowerment. It was revealed in December the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services. Meghan, of course, is American herself and has a particularly close relationship with her mother who lives in California. Butthe Sun, which broke the story on Wednesday,,externalwas firm in its speculation that Canada was their likely destination. The couple have just returned after a six-week break from royal duties, which they spent in Canada with their eight-month-old son, Archie. After returning to the UK on Tuesday, Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, visited Canada's High Commission in London to thank the country for hosting them and said the warmth and hospitality they received was ""unbelievable"". Former actress Meghan lived and worked in Toronto for seven years during her time starring in the popular US legal drama Suits. She has previously spoken about adopting the city as her second home after her native Los Angeles, andshe has several Canadian friends. Jessica Mulroney, a close friend of the duchess, posted a quote on Instagram about a ""strong woman"" facing a challenge. The Canadian stylist and TV star wrote: ""A strong woman looks a challenge in the eye and gives it a wink."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The couple's announcement raises numerous questions over what their future royal roles will entail. In stepping back as senior royals, Harry and Meghanhave announced they will no longer receive funding from the Sovereign Grant.,external The couple said this will make them ""members of the Royal Family with financial independence"". The Sovereign Grant is public money which pays for the cost of official royal duties, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. The Queen's Sovereign Grant from the Treasury was Â£82m in 2018-19. The couple said the Sovereign Grant paid for 5% of their official office from 2019, with the remaining 95% being funded by Prince Charles through his income from the Duchy of Cornwall. Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? Under current rules, the pair said they are ""prohibited from earning income in any form"", but in their new roles could follow other title-holding royals in having full-time jobs. The costs of official overseas visits will be funded by the Sovereign Grant and contributions from the host country ""when appropriate"". The couple are classified as ""internationally protected people"", which means they must have armed security provided by the Metropolitan Police. They will retain Frogmore cottage, the Grade-2 listed property in Windsorthat cost taxpayers Â£2.4m to renovate, as their official residence so they have a ""place to call home"" in the UK. Bryony Gordon, a Daily Telegraph journalist who knows and has interviewed the couple, suggested their decision could be linked to their mental health, after becoming a ""punching bag"" for a ""misogynistic and racist"" nation. In 2017, Ms Gordon interviewed the prince for herMad World podcast,externalin which he revealed hesought counselling while struggling in his late 20s to cope with the death of his mother.,external Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC 5 Live, she said: ""Here is a man who every day has to live out the trauma that he experienced as a little boy when he had to walk behind her coffin at the age of 12 in front of the world, and I think if any of us were put in that situation we would find it incredibly triggering."" She added the couple had become a ""punching bag for a nation that is still sort of deeply misogynistic and racist"" and they were ""entitled"" to ""do what is best"" for their family's mental health. She believes the couple will carry on exactly as before ""but just for free"", as they're ""sick of the scrutiny"" that comes with taking public money. Ms Gordon (pictured) interviewed the prince for a podcast in which he revealed he sought counselling to cope with his mother's death Royal historian Prof Kate Williams said it will be ""difficult"" for Harry and Meghan to lead ""normal"" lives, as media interest in them will increase after their ""unprecedented"" move. She told BBC Breakfast: ""It is going to be difficult if Harry and Meghan are going to live in Canada for a certain period of time and try and get on with business and be normal, charitable CEOs. ""They will require security because I don't see the media interest in them waning, I see it as probably increasing, because what they're doing is so unprecedented for royals."" A happy memory of Canada? The moment in 1991 when Prince Harry and his brother were reunited with their mother in Toronto during an official visit is an iconic royal image Royal commentator Penny Junor said the couple's actions were reminiscent of those of Harry's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The suggestion that they had not consulted other royals before making their statement was ""beyond bizarre"". She said: ""It has echoes of Diana when she suddenly announced after her separation [from Charles] that she was stepping back from 50 of her charities without consulting anybody. ""The problem is that they are not working for themselves, they are working for a family firm and to be making announcements of this sort without consulting is beyond bizarre."" Graham Smith, a spokesman for Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said Harry and Meghan's decision ""raises questions about the monarchy's future"" and will prompt taxpayers to ask how the couple's extra security and overseas lifestyle will be funded. ""To suggest that they're not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of self-entitlement and a lack of self-awareness that is common among royals,"" he said. ""This really is wanting to have your cake and eat it. They have said they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won't stop taking public money until they find other sources of income."" Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said ""we must continue to celebrate and support"" the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK, adding that it has an ""important role in public service"". This is clearly a major rift between Harry and Meghan on one part, and the rest of the Royal Family on the other. There are far more questions than answers. What will their new role be? Where will they live, and who will pay for it? What relationship will they have with the rest of the Royal Family? And there's the institutional question - what does this mean for the Royal Family? It comes just months afterPrince Andrew stepped back from his dutiesafter a BBC interview about his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Some might see this as the slimmed-down monarchy that the 21st Century needs. But Harry and Meghan reached people that other royals didn't. They were part of the reinvention and refreshing of the institution. It's understood talks have begun between Palace officials and No 10 about the implications of Harry and Meghan's announcement. We're now in wait-and-see mode as to whether this new model of being a royal can work - or if this is really a staging post for them to leave the Royal Family. Signs the couple were unhappy with their royal life have been apparent for some months. In October last year, the Duchess of Sussexbegan legal actionagainst the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The paper stands by its story. At the time, Prince Harry said his wife had ""become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press"" after a ""ruthless campaign"" of ""relentless propaganda"". ""Though we have continued to put on a brave face... I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,"" he said. In an ITV documentary last year, Meghan, who was born in the US, described motherhood as a ""struggle"" due to intense interest from newspapers. ""Not many people have asked if I'm OK,"" she said. This video can not be played Meghan spoke to ITV as part of a documentary last year Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said on Thursday the press should ""leave Harry and Meghan alone"" in the wake of their decision. The Labour MP for Leicester South expressed support for the couple, adding that the duchess had suffered ""appalling"" abuse and that she ""deserves a break"". On Wednesday the royal couple announced they would be adopting a ""revised media approach"" from the spring. As part of the new strategy,published on their website,external, they will ""engage with grassroots media organisations and young, up-and-coming journalists"". They will also pull out of the so-called royal rota system, where journalists and media representatives are given exclusive access to cover royal engagements on the understanding they share the material they gather. ""The current system predates the dramatic transformation of news reporting in the digital age,"" the couple said. The National Union of Journalists criticised the plans, saying the move appears to try and ""prevent the media from functioning and compromising the ability of journalists to do their jobs, which is completely unacceptable"".

MPs give final backing to Brexit billThe Withdrawal Agreement Bill will now pass to the House of Lords for further scrutiny next week.UK Politics,"MPs have given their final backing to the bill that will implement the UK government's Brexit deal. The Commons voted 330 to 231 in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and it will now pass to the House of Lords for further scrutiny next week. If peers choose to amend it will it come back before MPs. The bill covers ""divorce"" payments to the EU, citizens' rights, customs arrangements for Northern Ireland and the planned 11-month transition period. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January. The bill comfortably cleared its third reading in the House of Commons, as expected, with a majority of 99. All 330 votes in favour were Conservative. It took just three days for the bill to pass the remaining stages in the Commons, after MPs gave their initial approval to the legislation before the Christmas recess. Theresa May - Boris Johnson's predecessor in Downing Street - repeatedly failed to get her Brexit agreement passed by MPs, which led to her resignation as prime minister. Kuenssberg: What a difference a majority makes Adler: Why Brexit Stage Two may turn into a rocky ride What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? What is the transition period? The latest vote gives approval to the11-month transition periodafter 31 January, in which the UK will cease to be an EU member but will continue to follow its rules and contribute to its budget. The purpose of the transition period is to give time for the UK and EU to negotiate their future relationship, including a trade deal. Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael said his party would continue to oppose the ""dangerous"" bill. ""They have voted for a bill that will slash the rights of future generations to live and work across 27 other countries,"" he said. ""They have voted for a bill that strips away our guaranteed environmental protections, despite the fact that we are facing a climate emergency."" And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Scotland would ""remain an independent European country"". ""This is a constitutional crisis, because we will not and we cannot accept what is being done to us,"" he told MPs. But Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay has said the bill will deliver on the ""overwhelming mandate"" his party was given at the general election to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January. He has also said he is ""confident"" the UK will be able to negotiate a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year, despite critics saying that the deadline is too tight. Mr Johnson has also insisted a deal is possible by December 2020 and has said the transition period will not be extended. He has said the UK is ready to start negotiations ""as soon as possible"" after 31 January. On Wednesday, new European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned it would be ""impossible""to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020.

M&S sales squeezed as men shun skinny trousersThe retailer says it ordered too many tight-fitting men's clothes ahead of the busy festive period.,"M&S said it overestimated demand for tight-fitting men's clothing in the run-up to Christmas. As a result, the High Street retailer said it had ordered more ""regular"" and ""relaxed-fit"" clothing for spring. M&S boss, Steve Rowe, said ""disappointing"" issues, such as the surplus of skinny menswear, held the firm back from a stronger performance over Christmas. Weak sales in clothing and homeware were offset by higher food sales. However Mr Rowe said M&S did have issues with the ""waste and supply chain"" in its food department over Christmas. The retailer said it ordered too much food in the final two weeks before the big day. Meanwhile, an overly complex supply chain meant that food spent more time in the delivery system and less time on shelves. John Lewis warns it may not pay staff bonus Christmas pudding sales burnt out in festive period Nevertheless, like-for-like food sales, which exclude takings from new stores, increased by 1.4% in the final 13 weeks of 2019. However, that growth was largely offset by a dip in the home and clothing departments at M&S. The firm said customers were also more conservative when giving presents over Christmas. M&S said fewer customers bought items from its gift range, which includes things that could be considered token presents, such as fragrance sets. As a result, like-for-like sales at M&S climbed just 0.2% in the final months of the year. ""Disappointing one-off issues - notably waste and supply chain in the food business, the shape of buy in menswear and performance in our gifting categories - held us back from delivering a stronger result,"" said Mr Rowe. However, the firm outperformed rivals Tesco and Sainsbury's, both of which saw sales slip during a similar period. Richard Lim, the boss of analyst firm Retail Economics, said M&S could be showing signs of recovery after what was a tough year for the business, whichdropped out of the FTSE 100in September. ""Food performed particularly well, benefiting from stronger underlying household finances, but consumers also responded positively to more competitive pricing,"" he said. ""While clothing and home lagged overall growth, it still improved on previous performances."" But investors were disappointed by the result. Shares in the M&S fell by as much as 11.2% after it revealed its results on Thursday.

"'Red flags missed' before toddler's choke deathA boy who choked on a sausage could still be alive if he had an operation sooner, an inquest hears.Sussex","James Manning died after choking on a piece of sausage at Butlin's holiday park in Bognor Regis A toddler who choked on a sausage while on a Butlin's holiday could still be alive if his tonsils had been removed sooner, an inquest heard. Two-year-old James Manning died in June 2018 after choking at Butlin's in Bognor Regis. Consultant Philip Hyde, from Southampton Children's Hospital told an inquest ""red flags"" were missed despite a number of choking episodes. Dr Hyde added that James's condition ""warranted an urgent referral"". The toddler, from Battle, East Sussex, died two weeks after choking on a piece of sausage at the holiday resort. James Manning had been at the resort with his mother and grandmother West Sussex Coroner's Court in Crawley heard James had a history of choking issues and breathing difficulties. He had been on a waiting list to have his adenoids removed, along with his enlarged tonsils, in a bid to prevent more incidents. His mother Natalie Reeves previously told the inquest her son would sometimes wake up gasping for breath and would choke on his food at least once a week. Ms Reeves said she felt she had to plead with doctors to get a hospital referral. Dr Hyde said: ""I feel that the NHS could have responded quicker to his situation, most particular his multiple episodes of presentation.  I feel there were opportunities to intervene and they would have made a difference to him choking in 2018."" Dr Hyde said ""red flags"" were missed and James should have been ""on a much more rapid referral pathway"".  He suggested James could still be alive if his tonsils had been removed earlier.

Plane crash victims 'were the best of usâ,"This video can not be played ""She was full of dreams and now they're gone"": Vigil held for Iran plane crash victims in Toronto In the aftermath of the deadly Ukraine Flight PS752 crash, Canadians are left to mourn not just the loss of life but the bright futures snatched away, write Jessica Murphy and Robin Levinson-King. In a small room inside a student housing complex at the University of Toronto, more than a hundred people gathered to mourn, pray and share stories of the loved ones they lost in Ukraine Flight PS752. The space, which is typically used as a student common area, had been transformed into a kind of funeral parlour, decorated with candles, white bouquets and photos of the victims. Most of the service was in Persian, and tea and sweets were served. Like many being held across the country, the vigil on Wednesday evening was an impromptu event, quickly put together in the hours after the plane went down earlier that morning. Many were still in shock from the news, less than 24 hours old. ""She was full of dreams, and now they're gone,"" Elnaz Morshedi told the BBC between sobs. Her friend, University of Toronto student Zeynab Asadi Lari, was killed in the crash. Ms Morshedi says Ms Lari, who was studying health sciences, had wanted to volunteer with Doctors Without Borders next semester. ""She was studying all the time, but she wanted to live, she wanted to have fun, to fall in love. And she doesn't have time for this anymore."" Ms Lari's brother, Mohammad Asadi Lari, also died in the crash. He was the co-founder of STEM fellowship, a youth-run charity that helps students in the maths and sciences. ""They were the best of us,"" Ms Morshedi says. All 176 people on board the flight were killed when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Iran. Sixty-three of them were Canadian nationals, but many more called Canada their home, at least temporarily. They lived in cities like Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton. Many were students or professors, working on important research in their fields. US sanctions have made it increasingly difficult to travel between Iran and Canada, and the Ukraine International Airlines flight from Tehran to Kiev and then to Toronto is popular because it is one of the most affordable options for the journey, said Younes Zangiabadi with the Iranian Canadian Congress. Some 63 Canadians were on the Tehran to Kiev flight, en route to Toronto The deaths have cast a pall over university campuses across the country. ""You look at the odds of such a thing happening to you,"" said Seyed Hossein Mortazavi with disbelief, ""but I suppose that's fate."" ""They definitely didn't expect this. None of us did. But I think it's just a burden the whole community has to carry."" Who are the victims of Iran plane crash? Canada is home to a large Iranian diaspora, with some 210,000 citizens of Iranian descent, according to the federal census. But Mr Mortazavi said that on campuses the community feels small. ""Nearly anybody in our community knows someone on that plane, through friends, through family,"" he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the crash a ""heartbreaking tragedy"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to ensure the cause of the crash was found. ""Canadians have questions and they deserve answers,"" he told media in Ottawa on Wednesday evening. Mr Trudeau said Canada would work closely with its partners to ensure the crash is thoroughly investigated - and would be requesting the presence of Canadian officials in Tehran to assist families seeking consular assistance, as well as to participate in any investigation into the cause of the incident. To those who lost family members and loved ones, he said ""your loss is indescribable"". Tehran won't give Boeing or US black boxes ""This is a heartbreaking tragedy. While no words will erase your pain, we want you to know that an entire country is with you, we share your grief."" It was truly a national tragedy, leaving families and loved ones in mourning across the country. And each story was a tragedy in itself. In Vancouver, Ardalan Ebnoddin Hamidi, Niloofar Razzaghi, and their teenage son Kamyar were on the flight, confirmed family friend Kei Esmaeilpour, with the Civic Association of Iranian-Canadians. Mr Esmaeilpour said the family were in Iran for a short vacation, and that his friend Ardalan had expressed concerns to him before leaving about the security situation there, but eventually decided to go on the trip. He said people who knew the family were asking how something like this could have happened. Two separate couples were killed on the way back from their weddings in Iran. Siavash Ghafouri-Azar and his wife Sara Mamani Engineer Siavash Ghafouri-Azar was returning home with his new wife, Sara Mamani, when the plane crashed. The couple had just bought their first home near the Canadian city of Montreal, and were looking forward to throwing a house-warming party, said his former thesis supervisor Ali Dolatabadi, an engineering professor at Concordia University. ""It is a great loss,"" Mr Dolatabadi told the BBC. ""He was very intelligent, a gentleman. He had a kind and a gentle soul."" The couple had met a few years earlier at Concordia and both went on to work at top engineering firms in Montreal. They had decided to get married in Iran because they wanted to celebrate with family, Mr Dolatabadi said. Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand with their two daughters Newlyweds Arash Pourzarabi, 26, and Pouneh Gourji, 25, were graduate students in computer science at the University of Alberta and were also returning to Canada from their wedding. The crash also claimed the lives of two young girls, Daria and Dorina Mousavi, aged 14 and 9, along with their parents, Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand, who taught at the University of Alberta. Payman Parseyman, an Iranian-Canadian from Edmonton, said the community was devastated as they learned that many from the city's Iranian diaspora, as well as foreign Iranian students who had been studying there, had been on flight PS752. ""It's mostly been shock, disbelief,"" he told the BBC. Canadians across the country mourned lost family members and loved ones He said many Iranian-Canadians were already glued to their televisions or the internet watching for news about the ballistic missile strikes launched by Iran on air bases housing US forces in Iraq late on Tuesday evening, and ended up watching early reports on the plane crash in real time. Aftermath of Ukrainian passenger plane crash in Iran People were quick to begin connecting via the Telegram messaging app, seeking information and finding ways to support the families and loved ones of those killed. Canada has not had diplomatic representation in Iran since 2012, when it closed its embassy in Tehran and expelled Iranian diplomats from Ottawa. Officials said a number of allies, including France, Italy, and Australia, have offered Canada assistance on the ground in Iran. ""We've been having such a split as a community these past few months,"" says Mr Mortazavi, who attended the vigil at the University of Toronto. ""I hope this acts as a turning point for all of us, so that people start reflecting about each other, about the friendships.""

World's media split on royal move,"Harry and Meghan at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto ""Come to Canada, where you belong."" It's a bold invitation fromthe Toronto Star,externalas the world's media digests the news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will step back from royal duties and consider basing themselves abroad. Not everyone is as supportive of Prince Harry and Meghan's decision, and there is some outright criticism to be found in editorials and leader columns of British newspapers. A scathing review of the move in the Daily Mirror says there ""can be no sympathy"" with the way the announcement was made. ""They were unable to find even a few moments to do our Queen the courtesy of discussing their plans,"" its leader reads. It says the move may cause ""an irreparable rift"" with the rest of the Royal Family. The Times leader calls,externalthe move ""premature... petulant and ill-judged"". ""The announcement carries all the hallmarks of the petulance and hot-headedness for which Prince Harry is sadly becoming well-known,"" it reads, adding that little thought has been given to the practicalities of their new roles. It argues that Harry and Meghan's wish to be financially independent but still be members of the royal family implies that they ""want to have it both ways"". The Harry and Meghan story Royals 'hurt' over Sussexes' announcement Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? In full: Sussexes' statement and palace response Royal Family tree and line of succession The Daily Express's leader is slightly more forgiving. It calls the couple a ""tremendous breath of fresh air"" but says they would have ""gained more empathy"" had they ""shown respect"". ""It is a massive error judgment not to have informed the Queen of such a bold decision,"" it reads. ""As a country we do expect a certain decorum from members of The Firm. And Harry's latest decision of not playing by those rules falls way short."" The Daily Mail's Richard Kay analyses,external""where it all went wrong"" for Harry and Meghan. He says the couple were ""bent on re-writing the rule book of what being a member of the Royal Family actually means"" from the moment they married, which led to a ""disconnect"". ""The rot set in even before the glow of that May wedding day had passed,"" Kay writes, citing, among other things, the privacy of their honeymoon and their ""secrecy"" over their son's birth. The Daily Telegraph's Camilla Tominey says,externaltheir ""break for freedom"" was ""long planned"" and can be traced back to November 2018, when they announced a ""split"" from the royal household they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. She quotes a source telling the paper at the time that Harry had ""always complained about being sidelined by William"" and they wanted to ""spread their wings"". The ""Fab Four"" at Sandringham on Christmas Day, 2017 Across the Atlantic, ""Megxit"" dominates thefront page of the New York Post,,externalwhich says Harry and Meghan are choosing ""commoner"" lifestyles. TheNew York Times says,externalthe duchess faced ""lacerating criticism"" from Britons who ""like their royals to be dutiful and traditional"". She was criticised for being ""too bold, too outspoken, too difficult, too American, too multicultural"", it writes, adding that the couple's desire to ""renounce the usual menu of royal obligations speaks directly to the challenges facing the monarchy"". Back at the Toronto Star, columnist Vinay Menon writes that the move will mean the couple are ""finally free"" and adds: ""Stepping back from your royal duties amounts to stepping into your future."" He adds that the rest of the Royal Family ""don't deserve"" them. The Australian says,externalthe move has ""breathed new life into the age-old debate over Australia's ties to the British monarchy"". It interviews the chairman of the Australian Republic Movement, who says that it ""highlights the Royal Family's waning power"". In France,Le Figaro interviews,externalFrench royal expert Stephane Bern, who says that royals who are ""not at the core"" need to show they can ""earn a living"" in today's world. ""Gone are the days when the English paid for everyone without wondering why,"" he tells the paper. Le Monde,externalsays it is ""a revolution in Buckingham Palace"". Die Zeit, in Germany, says,externalthe Queen now has a ""shortage of skilled workers"", andFrankfurter Allgemeine agrees,externalthat Harry and Meghan's decision is a ""serious loss"" for the Royal Family. Spain's El Mundo says on its front page that the couple have ""[slammed] the door in the British Royal Family's face"", whileEl PaÃ­s says,externalthey became the victims of a ""curse"" that sees royals without a ""determined destiny"" heavily criticised. The Italian paper La Repubblica says it is not clear whether it is ""the definitive strike that will weaken the foundations of The Firm"" or ""a publicity stunt"" to get more Instagram followers. Sweden's Dagens Nyheter compares what it calls ""chaos and civil war in the British royal house"" with Brexit, while the Belgian Flemish-language newspaper Het Nieuwsblad says Harry ""has had enough of the royal circus"".

Will they keep their royal titles? Your questions answered,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's decision to ""step back"" as senior members of the Royal Family has generated interest across the world. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are said to have ""blindsided"" Buckingham Palace with the announcement, which the couple said came after ""many months of reflection"". They saidthey intended to become financially independent while continuing to supportthe Queen. But what does it mean for their future? Will the duke still be in the line of succession? And what if the couple split up?BBC royal correspondent Sarah Campbellanswers readers' questions. Succession to the throne in the UK is not only due to birth, but also legislation. It would take an Act of Parliament to remove a person from the line of succession. Downing Street has so far said that questions on the duke and duchess's announcement are ""for the royal household"". The Royal Family tree and line of succession It is worth noting that, as the Cambridge family expands, Prince Harry will keep moving down the line of succession. Archie has no title - that was his parents' decision when he was born. He is simply Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. There is no suggestion the duke and duchess wish to renounce their titles. In full: Sussexes' statement and palace response Harry and Meghan step back: What will happen next? In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together He remains a member of the Royal Family - stepping back from duties does not change that. Moreover, what the couple plan to do has not been tried before, so there is no precedent to guide us. This rule applies to some applicants for British citizenship. We were told that Meghan was not going to be fast-tracked to get citizenship and it will take the same length of time for her as for anyone else. We are not aware she is a dual citizen as yet (as in, that she has a British passport). Buckingham Palace did not respond when asked whether the duchess's citizenship application would be affected by the announcement. Meghan has talked about the fact that, even though she was already in the public eye, she wasnot prepared for the huge press interestwhich came with marrying into the Royal Family. We simply do not know how much support the duke and duchess have been given, so it is difficult to say whether they should have been given more. The next Invictus Games is to be held this year in The Hague. The Invictus Games Foundation - with Prince Harry as patron - was established to preside over the games and, as it is a separate entity, it will continue regardless of what happens with Prince Harry's status within the Royal Family. It will remain one of his key commitments. 'Freedom' or 'petulance'? World's media split on royal move How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight Prince Edward and his wife the Countess of Wessex are now both working members of the Royal Family with a busy schedule of engagements. But they both experienced difficulties when pursuing careers in the private sector: Sophie worked for a PR firm that was caught in a sting by a national newspaper and she was recorded making comments about members of the Royal Family; Edward had little success as a television producer. They both gave up their careers and are now full-time ""working royals"" paid for using income from the Duchy of Lancaster, the Queen's private income. Wallis Simpson was an American divorcee like Meghan Markle. In 1936, it was considered the public would never accept a divorcee as Queen. Edward VIII - the Queen's uncle - had to choose between the throne and Wallis Simpson. He chose her, thereby relieving himself of his position and all royal duties. Prince Harry and Meghan have said they wish to ""step back"" as senior royals suggesting they do intend to carry out some duties on behalf of the Queen. This is their choice as opposed to a course of action they have no option but to follow. But - it is early days and it is really not clear yet how their part-royal, part-private roles will pan out. On their website, the couple say they will continue to use Frogmore Cottage - their home on the Windsor estate - with the permission of its owner, the Queen. They say the cottage will be their ""official residence as they continue to support the monarchy, and so that their family will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom"". They add that the refurbishment of the cottage was planned well before they decided to move in and their decision to live there saved money when compared with the refurbishment of another property at Kensington Palace. On their website, Harry and Meghan say they will no longer receive funding through the Sovereign Grant, ""thereby making them members of the Royal Family with financial independence"". However, the couple say the grant only provides 5% of their income and it is unclear whether they will give up their other sources of funding. Explained: Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? The couple will continue to be given a security detail paid for by the taxpayer-funded Metropolitan Police, which does not disclose the costs involved. The couple's intention to travel back and forth from North America would likely add to this cost, but it is possible they will pay towards this - although it will be a large bill. This comes after Harry and Meghanclaimed on their new website,externalthat 95% of funding for their office comes through income from Prince Charles' estate - the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy estate belongs to all heirs to the throne and has existed since Edward III created it for his son and heir, Prince Edward (famously known as the Black Prince), in 1337. According to a charter, the Prince of Wales, as the Duke of Cornwall, receives income each year generated from assets on the estate - which includes large parts of Cornwall, Dorset and Herefordshire - but he does not benefit from the proceeds or profit on the sale of any assets,according to the Duchy's website.,external This means that the territory - and income - of the Duchy will pass to Prince William, as heir, and on to his son Prince George when he becomes the heir. Therefore the estate itself is not owned by any one member of the Royal Family, nor is it owned by the government. Harry and Meghan's wedding in May 2018 attracted some 100,000 well-wishers to Windsor as well as a global TV audience of hundreds of millions. At the time, the Berkshire police commissioner Anthony Stansfeldsuggested the costof securing the duke and duchess' wedding was ""between Â£2m and Â£4m"". Another recent comparison would be the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which cost the Metropolitan Police Â£6.35m - though it took place in London and was a larger event. The Metropolitan Police - which is responsible for securing the Royal Family - does not reveal the cost of day-to-day security or policing, so these costs are not known. Reports of previous estimates have suggested the cost of securing all senior royals costs the Met Police around Â£50m a year. Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?

Meghan wrote a children's book called The Bench in 2021. Inheritance William and Harry received the bulk of Princess Diana's Â£13m fortune when she died in 1997. In a 2021 interview, Harry told Oprah Winfreythis money funded his family's move to the US. He is also thought to have inherited millions from his great-grandmother, the Queen Mother. It is not known whether the late Queen left him any money. Acting During her acting career, the Duchess of Sussex was reportedly paid $50,000 (Â£40,000) for each episode of the legal drama Suits. She appeared in more than 100 episodes. Meghan Markle pictured with her Suits co-stars in 2012 After stepping back from official duties, the duke and duchess were no longer afforded the security arrangements provided for senior royals. When Harry first left the UK, he said it would be too dangerous to bring his family back without adequate police protection, and took the government to court. Home Office lawyers said the duke would still have publicly funded police security in the UK, under ""bespoke arrangements"". In late February 2024,the High Court ruled that this approach ""was, and is, legally sound"". In June, Harry's legal team saidhe had been given permission to challenge the High Court decision in the Court of Appeal. An earlier separate court rulingrejected the prince's request to be allowed to pay privately for more substantial protection.

The Harry and Meghan story,"The pair were first pictured together at the 2017 Invictus Games after months avoiding the cameras Meghan Markle was the American actress, with a passion for humanitarian and feminist causes. Harry was the rebel prince turned soldier, considered the world's most eligible bachelor. In the summer of 2016, the two were brought together on a blind date by a mutual friend in London. ""Beautiful"" Meghan ""just tripped and fell into my life"",Harry later told the press,and he knew immediately she was ""the one"". After just two dates, the new couple went on holiday together to Botswana, camping out under the stars. They fell in love ""so incredibly quickly"", proof the ""stars were aligned"", said Harry. To the British press, their romance was catnip. Here was a golden couple who were able to draw vast crowds, speak the language of younger generations and sprinkle royal stardust on any cause. For months the couple avoided the cameras and it wasn't until the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto that the the two were first photographed holding hands in public, smiling and laughing. Royals 'hurt' over Sussexes' announcement Royal Family tree and line of succession Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? But there had been signs early on that the fairytale was some way off a ""happily ever after"". When Harry first confirmed the relationship in late 2016, it came with a stark attack on the media, accusing them of subjecting his girlfriend to ""a wave of abuse and harassment"". He spoke of nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers, attempts by reporters and photographers to get into Meghan's home and the ""bombardment"" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. It was a problem that was only going to get worse. Despite that - or perhaps because of that - the two grew ever closer and in September 2017, Meghan declared to Vanity Fair magazine: ""Personally, I love a great love story."" The two of them had been enjoying a special time together and were really happy and in love, she said. The media was now on high alert for the sound of royal wedding bells - and they didn't have to wait long. This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan Markle posed for the cameras in the garden at Kensington Palace In November 2017, Harry got down on one knee to propose to Meghan as they made roast chicken together at their home in Kensington Palace. Harry had designed the ring, made with two diamonds which had belonged to his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. At the centre was a diamond from Botswana. The couple shared their story in a candid interview with the BBC, and appearing brimming with positivity for the future. They revealed Meghan would give up acting to focus on causes close to her heart, working alongside her husband-to-be. ""I know that she will be unbelievably good at the job part of it,"" said Harry. Things began to shift as preparations got under way for a May 2018 wedding in Windsor. This video can not be played Highlights from the wedding ceremony It quickly became clear that this was a royal couple who wanted to do things differently - their way. The wedding, which much of the world tuned in to watch, had all the traditions - a stunning dress, cheeky bridesmaids and heartfelt vows. But, as our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said at the time, the service with its gospel choir, young black cellist and breathtaking address from Bishop Curry, marked it out as a modern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple, which seemed to point to a different future for the Royal Family. Married life brought with it new titles - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and a new home at Windsor in Frogmore Cottage. During a trip to Merseyside, the duchess told well-wishers she was six months pregnant and did not know if it was a boy or a girl In October of that year, the couple embarked on their first royal tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, over 16 days. It was there that they shared the news that they were expecting their first baby. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, seventh in line to throne and the Queen's eighth great-grandchild, was born on 6 May 2019. To Harry, who was by Meghan's side at the birth, little Archie was ""absolutely to die for"". Throughout Meghan's pregnancy, the continual redrawing of battlelines had gone on between the press and the couple. This was to be no repeat of the Duchess of Cambridge's birth with the circus of journalists and photographers lying in wait outside hospital doors for days on end. The press had been told there would be no information about the birth, beyond that it was happening. Such scrutiny and pressure proved to be a struggle for the newly-wed Meghan during her pregnancy and in early motherhood, she later admitted in an ITV documentary filmed during their tour of southern Africa in September. ""Not many people have asked if I'm OK,"" she said, looking lost. She spoke of her vulnerability during pregnancy and the challenges of having a new-born - ""it's a lot"". Asked if she could cope, she said she had long told Harry it was not enough to just survive - ""that's not the point of life - you have got to thrive"". Archie was christened in a private ceremony, from which the press and the public were excluded There were further signs that the couple were not happy, when the prince opened up about his mental health. He said it was under constant management and he lived with the pressures of avoiding a repeat of the past that took his mother, the Princess of Wales, from him. She died in a car crash in Paris when Harry was just 12. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes. ""Everything that she went through, and what happened to her, is incredibly important every single day, and that is not me being paranoid,"" he said. ""Part of this job is putting on a brave face but, for me and my wife, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue,"" he added. It has also been suggested the scrutiny of Meghan has been greater because of her African-American heritage. Former US presidential candidateHillary Clinton said she wanted to hug Meghanfor the British media's ""racist"" treatment of her, while Harry hashighlighted how ""unconscious bias""can lead to racist behaviour even if people do not consider themselves to be racist. Their struggles were shared in an interview while touring southern Africa The couple's frustration and anger with some sections of the press has gone from being a matter between the palace and editors into the full glare of the public spotlight. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters and Harry filed proceedings at the High Court against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking. As such a dramatic year came to a close, the royal couple took an extended break from royal duties over Christmas, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped theirbombshell announcement. Neither Harry's father, Prince Charles, nor his older brother, Prince William, with whom Harry has said he has ""good days"" and ""bad days"", were consulted. Harry and Meghan were, they told their Instagram followers, planning to leave their royal duties - and the royal purse - behind. They hope their next chapter, spent in North America as well as the UK, will see the two of them, together with baby Archie, make their own path to the future.

Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight,"The Duke of Sussex grew up in the media spotlight - from a young royal dealing with his mother's death, through his partying teenage years, to his career in the military. Since then Harry has followed in his mother's footsteps, doing charity work across the globe. He has got married and become a father. Now he and the Duchess of Sussex have begun a new chapter:giving up their royal duties, HRH titles and public fundingand living in California. Harry has tried to balance his public and private lives. At times, the publicity that comes with being sixth in line to the throne has helped him to bolster support for his charitable endeavours. But there have also been times when that attention has become too much, and he has fought fiercely for his family's privacy. Prince Harry was born in 1984, the second child of the Prince and Princess of Wales Born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on 15 September 1984, the prince was christened Henry Charles Albert David by the Archbishop of Canterbury in December of that year in St George's Chapel, Windsor. But it was officially announced from the start of his life that he would be known as Harry. Although christened Henry, he has always been known as Harry Harry with his mother and brother on a trip to Thorpe Park in 1993 The prince's childhood was cut short when his mother died in 1997. Princess Diana was killed in a crash in Paris, aged 36, as the car she was in sped through a tunnel followed by paparazzi photographers. Her death shook royal fans the world over, but it was 12-year-old Harry and 15-year-old William whose lives changed forever. The funeral, which featured the image of the boys walking behind their mother's hearse to attend the service at Westminster Abbey, remainsone of the most-watched programmes on the BBC. Prince Harry stood between his father, Prince Charles, and his older brother, Prince William, as they watched the hearse carry Diana's coffin ""I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,"" the prince said in aninterview with the Daily Telegraph,externalin 2017. He added: ""I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle."" The prince followed the educational path of his older brother William, at Wetherby School in Notting Hill, before entering Eton in 1998. Harry, five, on his first day at Wetherby School, Notting Hill Prince Harry watching his brother sign the Eton College entrance book in 1995 - he would follow in his footsteps, joining the school three years later After leaving Eton with two A-levels in 2003, Harry took a gap year. He worked on a sheep farm in Australia and with Aids orphans in Lesotho, paving the way for the charity he later set up there. Prince Charles took his sons on annual skiing holidays to Switzerland Attention from the press has been a constant in Harry's life. The front page of a 2002 edition of the (now defunct) News of the World roared: ""Harry's drugs shame"",  and claimed Prince Charles sent his son to visit a rehab clinic as punishment for smoking cannabis. St James's Palace confirmed the then 17-year-old had ""experimented with the drug on several occasions"" but said the use was not ""regular"". Then in October 2004, there was a scuffle with a photographer outside a club. A royal spokesman said at the time the 20-year-old prince was hit in the face by a camera ""when photographers crowded around him"". As part of his gap year, Prince Harry spent time at an orphanage in Lesotho, in southern Africa When Harry pushed the camera away, ""it's understood that a photographer's lip was cut"", the spokesman added. The following year, an image of the prince dressed as a Nazi at a fancy dress party sparked outrage. Clarence House later said the prince had apologised for any ""offence or embarrassment"" caused and had realised ""it was a poor choice of costume"". And in 2009, video footage emerged of Harry using offensive language to describe an Asian member of his Army platoon. St James's Palace said the prince was ""extremely sorry for any offence his words might cause"" but said he had ""used the term without any malice and as a nickname about a highly popular member of his platoon"". Harry enjoyed lighter-hearted press coverage during the London 2012 Olympic Games, in his role as an Olympic ambassador. The prince was an Olympic ambassador at the London 2012 Games In the same year he spent a lot of time in front of the cameras for the Queen's Jubilee. As part of those celebrations Harry completed his first royal solo tour overseas with visits to Belize, the Bahamas, Brazil and Jamaica. However, that August, photos emerged of the prince and a young woman naked in a Las Vegas hotel room. The two photos,published on US gossip website TMZ and later in the Sun newspaper, were taken on a private break with friends, with the site reporting the prince was in a group playing ""strip billiards"". He later said he had ""probably let myself down"" but added: ""I was in a private area and there should have been a certain amount of privacy that one should expect."" There is, however, a saving grace to the scrapes Harry has found himself in. As the younger brother to the expected future king, Harry has relatively little responsibility. Like the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and Prince Charles's younger siblings, Harry is a ""spare to the heir"" - and a world away from the throne. So Harry's indiscretions have done little to dent public opinion of him. And he has perhaps had a freer existence because of it; security worries would have made active service in Afghanistan impossible for his older brother, for example. Harry served a tour in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot Harry spent 10 years in the armed forces, becoming the first royal in more than 25 years to serve in a war zone. He was left disappointed in 2007 when Army chiefs decided not to send him to Iraq because of ""unacceptable risks"", but later spent 10 weeks serving in Afghanistan in 2008. Harry returned to the country as an Apache helicopter pilot from September 2012 to January 2013, before qualifying as an Apache commander in July 2013. He later describedhow he had shot at Taliban insurgents, and said that being in Afghanistan was ""as normal as it's going to get"" for him. The prince said quitting the Army had been a ""really tough decision"" When heannounced he would be leaving the Army in 2015, the prince said his time in the military would ""stay with me for the rest of my life"". This is reflected in his charity work, which mostly concentrates on mental health and helping service veterans. Harry's most notable charity work so far is his founding and chairing of the Invictus Games in 2014. The Paralympic-style international competition for injured ex-service personnel has been held in London, Orlando, Toronto and Sydney. The prince has been the driving force behind the Invictus Games He has also supported the charity Walking With the Wounded, for injured veterans. The prince's other charity work includes supporting conservation projects in Africa and jointly founding Sentebale, a charity to help orphans in Lesotho. On his visit to Angola in September, Harry said landmines are ""an unhealed scar of war"" Harry and his brother William have worked together on various charity initiatives He has continued his mother's work helping children affected by HIV and Aids, and supporting the Halo Trust's work in clearing landmines. Diana captured global attention when she walked through a live minefield in central Angola in 1997. She died in Paris later that year, before seeing the full impact of her visit - such as the signing of an international treaty to outlaw the weapons - but Harry highlighted her achievements whenhe retraced her stepsin September 2019. Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge supported Heads Together runners at the London Marathon in 2017 In later years, Harry has had counselling to help him deal with his mother's death. He was best man at his brother William's wedding in April 2011, and has since spoken of how hard it was not to have Diana there. In acandid interview with the Daily Telegraph,external, he described shutting down all of his emotions for nearly 20 years and refusing to thinking about his mother. This, he said, had a ""quite serious effect"" on his personal life and his work, and brought him close to a breakdown ""on numerous occasions"". He also said he would probably regret""for the rest of his life"" how brief his last phone call with his mother was, and spoke of her ""fun"" parenting. She was a ""total kid through and through"", he said. Harry, William and the Duchess of Cambridge joined forces to focus their campaigning efforts on mental health. They founded Heads Together, which aims to tackle stigma and fundraise for new support services. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were first pictured together at the Invictus Games in 2017 As one of the world's most high-profile bachelors, Harry's love life has drawn much interest over the years. In late 2016, he confirmed a new relationship with US actor, Meghan Markle,while issuing a statement,externalaccusing journalists of harassing her. He described ""nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers"", attempts by reporters and photographers to get into her home and the ""bombardment"" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. The pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. Then after just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana. Profile: Duchess of Sussex In September 2017, the year before their wedding, Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine she and Harry were ""two people who are really happy and in love,external"". Andin an interview that November, when their engagement was announced, Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was ""beautifully surprised"". He designed the engagement ring for Meghan, including two diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection. The couple married in May 2018at a ceremony at St George's Chapel in Windsor, and consequently became known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. On a 16-day tour of Australia that October, the duke and duchess announced they were expecting their first child, adding that they were happy to share the ""personal joy"" of their news. Baby Archie, described by Harry as ""our own little bundle of joy"", was born on 6 May 2019. Prince Harry said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" with the birth of his first child, Archie The duke's past few years have been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows. In 2019, he and his wife split their household office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the subsequent launch of the Sussexes' Instagram account amassed more than one million followers in record-breaking time (five hours and 45 minutes). The joy of becoming parents was followed days later by news Harry had accepted damages and an apology from a paparazzi agency that had used a helicopter to take photographs of his home in the Cotswolds. In June, the Sussexes announced they would split from the charity they shared with the Cambridges - fuelling speculation of a rift between brothers Harry and William. This video can not be played Prince Harry on his brother, William in 2019: ""We are certainly on different paths at the moment"" A 10-day tour of Africa at the end of September 2019 started well. Harry raised awareness for causes close to his heart, and the couple introduced Archie to anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. But during the tour, the Duchess of Sussex launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The duke and duchess went on a 10-day tour of Africa in September 2019 In a lengthy statement Harry said ""positive"" coverage of the tour of Africa had exposed the ""double standards"" of the ""press pack that has vilified [the duchess] almost daily for the past nine months"". And in an ITV documentary, filmed during the tour and broadcast the following month, the duchess admitted she was struggling to adjust to royal life, while the duke said his mental health was a matter of ""constant management"". Then, at the start of 2020, the couplemade a bombshell announcementthat they would be stepping back as senior royals. Later, Harry would tell host James Corden that the decision to step back was taken to protect himself and his family from the ""toxic"" situation created by the UK press. Their difficult relationship with the UK press saw both Harry and Meghan take legal action against publishers, as well ascutting ties with tabloid newspapers. After a brief stint in Canada, the couple now lives in California and are expecting their second child. The duke has since spoken out on several issues, includingon structural racism,human rightsandunconscious bias. The duke and duchess gave an interview with Oprah, who went to their wedding And the couple have signed deals to make shows and podcasts with Netflix and Spotify. His charity work continues - although he has returned his military appointments and royal patronages. Buckingham Palace said he and Meghan will keep their ""private patronages and associations"". He told interviewer Corden that his ""life is always going to be about public service"". But much of the rest of his future - including how he will continue to carve his own path - remains unclear.

Harry and Meghan step back: What will happen next?,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are stepping back from royal duties and will divide their time between the UK and North America, Buckingham Palace has announced. They will no longer use their HRH titles and will stop receiving public funds for royal duties under the ""new arrangement"". The couple, who have a baby son, Archie, had previously said they planned to carve out a ""progressive new role"" in the Royal Family and intended to ""work to become financially independent"". Following the announcement from the Queen, a separate statement from Buckingham Palace said the couple were grateful to the monarch and the Royal Family for their support as they ""embark on the next chapter of their lives"". It said they understood they are ""required to step back from royal duties, including official military appointments"". The couple will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations ""with the Queen's blessing"", the statement said. Prince Harry and Meghan said previously they plan to launch a new ""charitable entity"". Exactly where and exactly what are unclear as the couple have not yet elaborated on how they see their new role. However, their new charity is expected to be global in reach, with some of the focus likely to be on the US and Africa. On the pair's first official overseas tour last year with their son, Archie, the Duchess of Sussex told teenage girls in a deprived part of South Africa that she was with them""as a woman of colour and as your sister"". Prince Harry has spoken ofhis personal love for Africa, describing the continent as a place ""where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world"". The couple's charity work is also likely to have a commitment to female empowerment, an issue on whichMeghan has publicly pledged to ""shine a light"". The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not receive public funds for royal duties. They have said their ambition is to ""work to become financially independent"". This video can not be played ""Nothing like this has ever happened before"" â royal correspondent Daniela Relph explains David McClure, author of a book on how royals have made and spent their wealth, said they already have their own money and could make more from TV in future. Meghan was reportedly paid $50,000 (Â£38,400) per episode of the TV show Suits. While she is no longer a working actress she will receive some payments whenever the show is rebroadcast. Currently, the duke and duchess's expenses - such as living costs, travel, clothing - are covered by Harry's father for their role as working royals, representing the Queen. The Prince of Wales funds his sons and their families with income from the Duchy of Cornwall. Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royals Where do the couple get their money? Historian and royal author Hugo Vickers previously told the BBC he was unconvinced by the couple's plans. He said: ""They think they can do all sorts of things together but the fact is that they're very likely, if they're not careful, to end up as slightly tarnished celebrities, perhaps"". They plan to divide their time between the UK and North America, but BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said: ""It is expected that they will spend the majority of their time in North America now."" They only moved into their new home - Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, Berkshire - last April ahead of the birth of their son. The estimated cost to the taxpayer of renovations to it is about Â£2.4m. Buckingham Palace said in a statement the couple have ""shared their wish to repay Sovereign Grant expenditure"" for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage. It will remain their UK family home, the palace added. Ben and Jessica Mulroney, pictured in 2009 Harry and Meghan took an extended break from royal duties over Christmas, including time spent in the Canadian province of British Columbia. While acting in the US drama Suits, Toronto became an adopted city for Meghan. It is home to her friends, Jessica and Ben Mulroney, the city's ""most polished power couple"", according to Toronto Life magazine. It is likely that the family would spend time in Meghan's US homeland too - her mother, Doria Ragland, lives in California. Her father, Thomas Markle, with whom Meghan has little contact, lives in Mexico. Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, lives in California Many months of reflection and internal discussions, they said. In October, the public got a glimpse into the couple's mindset in an ITV documentary filmed during a tour of Africa. The Duchess of Sussex admitted adjusting to royal life had been ""hard"" and she had not been prepared for the intensity of the media scrutiny, despite warnings from her British friends that the tabloids could ""destroy"" her life. Asked whether she was coping, Meghan, a new mother, said: ""I have said for a long time to H - that is what I call him - it's not enough to just survive something, that's not the point of life. You have got to thrive."" Prince Harry also described his mental health and the way he deals with the pressures of his life as a matter of ""constant management"". Following their decision to step back as senior royals, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said there were ""great chunks"" of the job that the couple ""simply could not stand"", while Harry ""hated the cameras and was visibly bored by the ceremonial"". Towards the end of last year, Prince Harry said he and Meghan were to take legal action against the Mail on Sunday over a claim it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The paper stands by its story. At the time, an unrestrained Harry said: ""I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces."" Referring to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales' sudden death in 1997, he said: ""I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person."" In full: Sussexes' statements and palace response This video can not be played Meghan spoke to ITV as part of a documentary last year Speaking at an event on Sunday evening, Prince Harry said he is ""taking a leap of faith"" in stepping back from being a senior royal, adding that""there really was no other option"". The duke insisted he and Meghan had hoped to continue serving the Queen, but without public funding. ""Unfortunately, that wasn't possible,"" he said. In his speech,posted on the couple's Instagram account,external, Prince Harry also spoke of his ""great sadness"" over his and Meghan's new relationship with the Royal Family. ""The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly,"" he said. The BBC's royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said there were ""two big messages"" to take from the speech: including Harry stressing that the move was his call; and that the prince wanted to continue in some sort of royal role. Following the announcement from the Queen that the couple were stepping back from royal duties and can no longer formally represent the Queen, Buckingham Palace said the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will ""continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty"". While no details have been given about security arrangements for the couple, the statement said ""there are well-established and independent processes to determine the need for publicly-funded security"". The Royal Family faces intense media scrutiny Harry and Meghan had also updatedthe section of their website,externalwhich outlines their attitude to the media. The duke and duchess said they would be adopting a ""revised media approach to ensure diverse and open access of their work"" in 2020. Included in this new strategy, Harry and Meghan said they would ""engage with grassroots media organisations and young, up-and-coming journalists"". They will also pull out of the so-called royal rota system, where journalists and media representatives are given exclusive passes to cover royal engagements on the understanding they share all the material they gather. ""The current system predates the dramatic transformation of news reporting in the digital age,"" the couple said in a statement on their website. Under a heading asking what Harry and Meghan's stance is on the media in general, the couple said they believe in a ""free, strong and open media"" which ""upholds accuracy and fosters inclusivity, diversity and tolerance"". ""Their Royal Highnesses recognise that their roles as members of the Royal Family are subject to interest, and they welcome accurate and honest media reporting as well as being held to account if appropriate. Equally, like every member of society, they also value privacy as individuals and as a family."" The couple said they would continue to use social media, including their Instagram account which has 10.1m followers, to ""personally share moments in their lives directly with members of the public"".

Plastic packaging ban 'could harm environment',"Consumer pressure to end plastic packaging in shops could actually be harming the environment, a report says. Firms are swapping to other packaging materials which are potentially even worse for the environment, an independent think tank warns. Glass bottles, for instance, are much heavier than plastic so are far more polluting to transport. Paper bags tend to have higher carbon emissions than plastic bags â and are more difficult to re-use. The change in packaging materials has been prompted by concern from shoppers about the impact of plastic waste in the oceans. But the authors ofthe report, called Plastic Promises,external, say the consequences of using new materials have not been properly assessed. How Ibiza's party scene is tackling plastic pollution Reality Check: Should we burn or bury waste plastic? Plastic particles falling out of sky with snow Several supermarkets, for instance, are selling more drinks in coated cartons under the assumption that they can be recycled. In fact, the Green Alliance says, the UK only has the facilities to recycle a third of the coated containers in circulation. This video can not be played Family of the inventor of the plastic carrier bag says they were designed to stop trees from being destroyed Compostable confusion The group has been working with recycling organisations to survey shopsâ anonymous responses to public anxiety about plastic polluting the oceans. Its spokeswoman, Libby Peake, told BBC News: âA lot of shops are selling packaging described as biodegradable or compostable. âIn fact the items might only be composted in an industrial composter â and, even then, some items might not be fully digested.â The report says: âOver 80% of consumers think biodegradable or compostable plastic is environmentally friendly, but there is little understanding of what the terms mean and how the material should be dealt with. âOur interviewees wanted a clearer approach to where it should be used and how it should be marked to avoid confusing consumers and potentially causing more problems.â The retailers worried that confusion could potentially harm the environment if people either put ""compostable"" plastic in with conventional plastic, or littered it, wrongly assuming it would biodegrade like an apple core. Some companies that had tried using this type of plastic also suggested that the material did not degrade as expected in real world conditions. This video can not be played How recyclable is your food shop? One firm is quoted as saying: âConsumers are hugely confused about what bio-based, compostable and biodegradable mean. âWe are aware that [by switching from plastic to other materials] we may, in some cases, be increasing our carbon footprint.â Another said: ""If I could have a magic wand, Iâd like to see more joined up, top-down government interventionâ¦ We would like to see government be braver."" A different firm said: âPackaging technology innovations can be quite the competitive advantage in the current climate.â Andrew Opie, from the British Retail Consortium, echoed calls for a clearer strategy. He said: âAll responsible retailers agree that climate change needs to be at the heart of their business, whether that is sourcing products or changing packaging. âPlastic remains the most effective material in many circumstances - for example cucumbers wrapped in plastic last 14 days longer, reducing food waste. ""A coherent waste and resources strategy is one that prioritises reducing the environmental impact of the things we buy, not simply reducing plastic use.â The government published its resources and waste strategy in December 2018, and has conducted initial consultations on three policies: extended producer responsibility for packaging; introducing a deposit return system for drinks bottles; and bringing in greater consistency for recycling and waste collections. Ministers say businesses will pay for 100% of costs for dealing with material when it becomes waste, as opposed to around 10% currently. Consultations on the three topics are expected later this year, but the timeline for their implementation remains unclear, and the government has not confirmed if the deposit return will apply to all materials and container sizes. There are also efforts to target plastic straws The government has partially banned microbeads, and a ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds is set to come in later this year. A ban on expanded polystyrene has also been mooted and the Treasury has promised to introduce a tax on plastic packaging that does not include at least 30% recycled content. The UK has committed to adopting the EUâs Circular Economy Package, which includes much more stringent recycling targets, but has not committed to transposing the Single-Use Plastics Directive, which requires more widespread action on plastic reduction, including bans on plastic cutlery. They have said, however, that they will meet or exceed whatever the EU does in this area. It is also not clear if the UK will adopt the EUâs much more wide-ranging ban on microbeads.

Tesco sales fall in 'challenging' market,"Sales at the UK's biggest supermarket, Tesco, fell slightly in the months that include the crucial Christmas period. But stronger takings in the weeks just before the festive period, which included its biggest day to date for food sales, helped bolster performance. It was the final Christmas under the leadership of Tesco's boss Dave Lewis, who said the chain had ""performed well"" in a ""subdued"" UK market. However, Tesco said the UK market had ""clearly been challenging"". Mr Lewis said customers were cautious about how they spent their money at Christmas, but the supermarket claimed ""strong"" promotions appealed to shoppers. That helped the firm increase sales by 0.1% in the six-week festive period. However, that was not enough to reverse a decline in UK sales in the 19 weeks to 4 January. During that period, like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, fell by 0.2%. Julie Palmer from consultancy Begbies Traynor said Mr Lewis would feel that he was leaving the company on ""solid foundations"". ""Despite the slump in sales for some of the UK's 'big four' supermarkets, Tesco has managed to remain robust during this precarious period,"" she said. In contrast, rival Marks & Spencer reported a rise in sales for the first time since 2017 in the the 13 weeks to 28 December. M&S said its food departments had a ""standout"" run in the two weeks leading up to Christmas, with like-for-like sales up 1.4%. However, clothing and home sales were worse than expected, dropping 1.7% in the same period. The chain's boss Steve Rowe also described the market as ""challenging"". On Monday, market research firm Kantar said supermarket sales growth over Christmas was the slowest in five years. ""There was no sign of the post-election rush many had hoped for in the final weeks before Christmas, with shoppers carefully watching their budgets,"" said Kantar's Fraser McKevitt.

She said Mr Griffiths wished his wife a happy new year shortly after midnight, just hours before he died.

The Daily Mail,externalhas brought out what it calls a ""royal bombshell special issue"", with coverage stretching to page 17. It calls the couple ""the rogue royals"" and says they've ""pressed the nuclear button"".

A&E patients face long waits as winter bites,"Patients needing emergency care have faced a ""miserable"" time, doctors say, as data shows record-long delays in England in the past month. Hospitals reported huge pressures in December, with one in five A&E patients waiting over four hours. A key problem seems to have been a shortage of beds on wards. Nearly 100,000 of the sickest patients were forced to spend over four hours on trolleys and in corridors after their time in A&E as beds could not be found. Delays were also experienced by those brought in by ambulances. One in six crews had to queue outside A&E units for more than 30 minutes, waiting to handover patients to hospital staff - the target is 15. 11 charts on the challenges facing the NHS Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Katherine Henderson said: ""The NHS is struggling to escape its spiral of decline. ""This will have been a miserable Christmas period for many patients and staff alike."" NHS medical director Prof Stephen Powis said it had been a ""very busy"" period, compounded by an earlier outbreak of flu than had happened in previous winters. He said the health service was looking to recruit more staff and open more beds to help relieve pressure in the future. In the meantime, hospitals have been forced to take emergency steps to relieve pressure. Many have postponed routine operations to try to free up space. And some hospitals have even had to introduce emergency protocols and re-route ambulances to other nearby services. There were more than 120 cases of this happening last month - with some hospitals instigating the measure, known as an A&E divert, multiple times. This video can not be played Mark Newton reveals the long wait his father-in-law faced after attending the A&E unit at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital Mark Newton's 83-year-old father-in-law, George Bufton, was taken to Shrewsbury Hospital in the first week of January. He had a chest infection and a suspected gall bladder problem - and this came just over a month after a major bowel cancer operation. He spent 25 hours waiting for a bed to be found. Mr Newton said he was ""gobsmacked"" by what he saw. At one point about 20 trolleys were waiting in the corridor, with queues of ambulances outside A&E. He said staff were doing an ""admirable"" job in the circumstances but there was just not enough money or staff to cope. ""It was utter mayhem. This can't continue. Something must be done about it,"" Mr Newton said. December was certainly the worst month since the four-hour target was introduced, in 2004. Just 79.8% of patients spent less than four hours in A&E - well below the 95% target. Three trusts - Norfolk and Norwich, Stockport and Hull - all saw performance drop below 60%. Meanwhile, a group of Midlands trusts - Shrewsbury and Telford, Leicester, Birmingham and United Lincolnshire - were all among the 10 worst performers. Waiting times have been getting gradually worse over the autumn - October and November saw record worst levels set as well. But the problems in emergency care has not just been confined to A&E waits. The number of patients who then needed to be admitted on to the ward and faced long delays also hit a new worst level. There were 98,500 patients who faced a so-called ""trolley wait"" of a further four hours. That is nearly one in four of the patients who needed to be admitted. These ""trolley waits"" can be in corridors or temporary waiting areas, either in A&E or just outside. Patients who are admitted are often the sickest of those who attend A&E. The waiting time targets for cancer treatment and routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, have also been missed. Hospital bosses acknowledged it had been one of the most difficult months they had seen - and this comes despite the extra money the government has put in this year, which saw the NHS budget grow by 3.5%. There are a variety of reasons behind the problems. Prof Joe Harrison, chief executive of Milton Keynes Hospital, said his staff had been seeing some very sick patients. He said it had mainly been a combination of older patients and children, who seemed to have been particularly hard hit by flu and respiratory problems. But the figures also show the number of beds closed to contain vomiting and diarrhoea outbreaks rose by more than 60% compared with last year, with 760 beds closed on average each day last month - nearly 1% of the bed supply lost. Prof Harrison also said the social-care system in the community, which hospitals rely on to discharge patients into, seemed to have been struggling more than it had been last year. ""Keeping people safe has been our main priority. There is significant pressure, not just in this hospital, but across the NHS system as a whole,"" he said. Richard Murray, from the King's Fund think tank, said he believed there were too few beds in the system. ""Hospital bed numbers have fallen significantly over the past decade. With hospitals full to capacity, it is clear that bed reductions have gone too far."" The difficulties have not just been confined to England - none of the three core targets covering A&E, routine operations or cancer is being met in the other three nations. In recent days, the Hywel Dda health board, which is in charge of services in west Wales, said it had had to cancel planned surgery at a number of local hospitals because of the ""challenging"" situation. The British Medical Association said services across the nation had been stretched, with some reports cancer surgery had had to be cancelled too. The four-hour performance figures for December will not be released by the Welsh government until later in the month. Scotland's figures for the festive period are not available yet either - but November was one of the worst months on record. Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, which has the worst record when it comes to A&E delays, there is concern continuing strikes by nurses will have exacerbated the winter pressures. While A&E departments have remained running during the strikes, the second round of which took place this week, there have been reports hospitals have struggled to discharge patients quickly enough. And this has a knock-on effect of causing delays admitting patients. According to the latest figures, which date back to September, a third of patients were waiting longer than four hours in A&E, which was twice as bad as the situation in England and Scotland during that month.

Airline boss Willie Walsh to step down,"Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group (IAG), the owner of British Airways, has announced he is to step down. He is set to retire as chief executive and from the board of IAG on 30 June. Mr Walsh said it had been a privilege to have worked on the creation of IAG after British Airways (BA) and Iberia were merged. Antonio VÃ¡zquez, IAG's chairman, described Mr Walsh as one of the ""main drivers"" of the project. Mr Walsh became the British Airways boss in 2005 and is ending a 15-year career with the IAG group, which also controls Aer Lingus and Vueling. He will step down from the role in March before retiring in June this year. Mr Walsh said: ""It has been a privilege to have been instrumental in the creation and development of IAG. I have had the pleasure of working with many exceptional people over the past 15 years at British Airways and at IAG."" Willie Walsh is a long-standing figure in the aviation industry. He joined Aer Lingus in the late 1970s as a cadet pilot. Willie Walsh, then head of British Airways, at the construction site of Heathrow's Terminal 5 in 2005 He gradually worked his way up through the ranks to work in flight operations and was appointed as chief executive of Aer Lingus in 2001. Luis Gallego, head of the group's Spanish division, Iberia, since 2014, will succeed Mr Walsh. He said: ""It is a huge honour to lead this great company. It is an exciting time at IAG and I am confident that we can build on the strong foundations created by Willie."" Mr Gallego will take over as head of the holding company of British Airways after the airline saw major disruption last year. For the first time in its 100-year history,BA pilots went on strike in a long-running pay dispute. In November, dozens of British Airways flights were also delayed or cancelledbecause of a ""technical issue"".The airline also faced a Â£183m fine in Julyfor a customer data breach. Mr Walsh was boss at British Airways and then IAG for 15 years, more than triple the normal lifespan of a FTSE-100 chief executive. Arguably, though, he achieved more than all of his predecessors put together since the airline was privatised in 1987. Previous leaders at BA had tried to do deals with rivals to reduce the company's reliance on a single market - the UK - and a single airport - Heathrow. They had tried to reduce the power of unions at the company, to tackle its potentially ruinous pension deficit and to restore it to steady profitability. Mr Walsh managed to do all four. But his critics will counter that in doing so, he hurt the airline's status and turned British Airways from the ""world's favourite"", as its marketing claimed, to a run-of-the mill carrier. He arrived at BA from Aer Lingus in 2005, an unfancied choice to replace the cerebral Australian Rod Eddington. Mr Eddington had been hired, in the words of one board member at the time, ""to put a smile on people's faces"". Mr Walsh never showed any sign of being interested in popularity contests and had a distinctly down-to-earth approach to management. BA had tried to do deals with Air France, KLM of the Netherlands and various other potential partners - to no avail. Mr Walsh quickly tied up a deal with Iberia and followed on with Aer Lingus, turning BA into the largest player in a multi-airline group, IAG. Generous terms and conditions for flight crew were gradually whittled down, and he was able to put enough money into BA's two big pension schemes that big chunks of the remaining liabilities could be hived off to insurance companies. In the process, though, BA has gradually slipped down consumer rankings. Last month, Which? put it alongside Ryanair as one of the UK's least-favourite airlines, while it has suffered from embarrassing IT glitches. Mr Walsh's successor, the current boss of Iberia, Luis Gallego, will have to consider how to address this challenge when he takes over at the end of June. Mr Gallego is unlikely to continue one of the aviation industry's best-known feuds. Both Willie Walsh and Sir Richard Branson claimed to have won a previous bet over the survival of Virgin Atlantic. Mr Walsh suggested that Branson's brand could disappear after Delta Airlines purchased a 49% stake. In a blog post, Sir Richard said the stakes were high,external- ""a knee in the groin"" if the company folded within five years. Other spats have taken place between Virgin Atlantic and BA. Virgin launched a campaign against BA's proposed merger with American Airlines in the 1990s, with some planes painted ""No Way BA/AA"". Sir Richard Branson also won damages and an apology from BA at the High Court in 1993 after BA allegedly gave negative stories about the Virgin founder to the media.

'Worst year for retail in 25 years',"Retail sales fell for the first time in 25 years last year, according to the leading UK retail industry body. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said total sales fell 0.1%, marking the first annual sales decline since 1995. Sales in November and December were particularly weak, falling 0.9%, the BRC said. A separate report from Barclaycard found a rise in consumer confidence had failed to boost festive spending. The payments firm, which processes nearly half of all UK debit and credit transactions, said that consumer spending growth had declined if inflation was taken into account. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: ""Twice the UK faced the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, as well as political instability that concluded in a December general election - further weakening demand for the festive period. ""Retailers also faced challenges as consumers became both more cautious and more conscientious as they went about their Christmas shopping,"" she added. The BRC's figures do not include the entire retail market. For instance, its survey excludes some fast-growing online retailers, including Amazon, which some experts reckon now account for some 20% of online sales. However, its chief executive told the BBC Today programme she felt the figures did give ""an accurate picture"". Ms Dickinson said: ""These figures are not an estimate, they are full sales data from retailers that represent the majority of retail sales."" She added: ""While it is not 100% of retailers in the country, some businesses that aren't included will also be compensated by those that have gone bust."" The BBC's business correspondent Emma Simpson says: ""Figuring out what's going on in retail can be a bit of a jigsaw puzzle, and this is certainly a very large piece, particularly when it comes to reflecting how our biggest, traditional, chains are faring."" Total sales figures look at all sales, while like-for-like data compares sales from shops that were open the previous year, stripping out the effects of expansion in a business. Like-for-like retail sales climbed in December, but that was due to a relatively late Black Friday, the BRC said. Once November, was included to include this distortion, like-for-like sales dropped 1.2% compared with the previous year, it said. Despite the drop in total sales last year, the volume of sales was still higher than in 2017. A rise in cinema ticket sales was one of the few retail bright spots Payments company Barclaycard said in a separate report that supermarket sales contracted by 0.9% in December, while sales at specialist retailers such as toys and gaming stores fell 4%. However, it picked out some bright spots, noting cinema sales rose by 19%, helped by blockbuster releases including Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen II. Spending in pubs and takeaways also rose over the festive period. It's been a tough year for High Street retailers with several shops either going into administration or announcing job losses in 2019. Mothercare UK, Bonmarche and luxury jeweller Links of London all went into administration last year. Harrogate's commercial property market is the toughest some experts can recall Meanwhile, Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire, HMV and Debenhams both announced significant store closures. Costs are rising, with business rates, rents and wages taking a bigger chunk of retailers' expenditure. And with footfall in decline, many shops are simply too big and frequently in the wrong locations. Also, High Street retailersare under pressurefrom changing shopping habits, with customers spending one in every Â£5 online.

GP shortages cause 'unacceptable' patient waits,"Family doctors are under intense pressure and general practice is running on empty, warns the Royal College of GPs (RCGP). It says severe staff shortages are causing ""unacceptable"" delays for patients in England. In a letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, its chairman says ministers must take urgent action to deal with the lack of GPs. The government said it had recruited a ""record number"" of GP trainees. Ministers are committed to recruiting 6,000 more GPs in England by 2025. Tory pledge to boost GP numbers GPs 'shun full-time work as pressures take toll' Prof Martin Marshall, who took over as RCGP chairman in November, says GPs are struggling with an escalating workload, which is causing many to burn out and leave the profession. He says the problem is compounded by difficulty recruiting GPs and other members of staff to manage the demand. A spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC the recruitment of thousands more highly-skilled practitioners would mean patients would get ""an extra 50 million appointments a year within the next five years."" Dr Dharman: ""Sometimes it feels like you're drowning"" Dr Andrew Dharman, who works at the The Avenue surgery in Ealing, said the stress has got worse because of the enormous workload placed on GPs. He said: ""Sometimes it feels like you're drowning. You know you're trying to stay afloat and on top of all the workload. And you're trying to make sure you're providing the kind of care that you envisage when you go to medical school. ""You feel frustrated sometimes that you can't necessarily do that because of the amount of work and patients."" Prof Marshall has asked Mr Hancock to clarify how he will increase the number of family doctors, and what significant investments he will make in the profession. There are concerns that targets for extra GPs might not be met, with figures showing the numbers of doctors falling. In the letter, Prof Marshall says: ""No patient should have to wait three weeks for a GP appointment. This is unacceptable and our patients, and GPs, deserve better. ""We want a commitment to increase GP training places to 4,000 in 2020-21, as outlined in your election manifesto, but also to 5,000 soon after; and significant investment into initiatives to improve GP workload and retain existing GPs in the profession to improve the wellbeing and moral of the whole practice team."" According to official figures, there were just over 28,000 fully qualified full-time equivalent GPs in England as of September 2019.  This is a drop of 3.7% since September 2015. There were 160.8 million GP appointments in the 12 months to November 2019, with 41.9 million of those in the last three months, 450,000 more than in the same period a year earlier GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years Where not to live if you need a GP Millions miss out on seven-day GP access LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

John Lewis warns it may not pay staff bonusThe retail group warns on profits as John Lewis managing director Paula Nickolds steps down.Business,"Paula Nickolds was John Lewis' first female managing director Retail group John Lewis Partnership has warned its staff bonus may be in doubt as it reported a fall in festive sales at its department store chain. It warned that annual partnership profits were expected to be ""substantially down on last year"". The board will meet in February to decide if it is ""prudent"" to pay the staff bonus, the partnership said. In a surprise announcement, John Lewis & Partners also said its managing director Paula Nickolds will step down. The partnership has been combining the executive teams behind John Lewis and Waitrose into one team, and she was expected to become executive director of brand next month when the teams merged. John Lewis said: ""After some reflection on the responsibilities of her proposed new role, we have decided together that the implementation of the future partnership structure in February is the right time for her to move on."" Worst year for retail in 25 years, says trade body Christmas pudding sales slump in challenging festive period M&S sales squeezed as men shun skinny trousers Ms Nickolds was the first woman to become managing director of the partnership, having worked her way up after joining as a graduate trainee in 1994. She will leave the partnership next month. There will be another big change at the top of the partnership in February, when top former civil servant Sharon White will take over as chair. Outgoing chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said the decision for Ms Nickolds to step down was taken by both of them. ""Paula has been a brilliant leader of this business for many years,"" he said. ""We decided together now is the time to step away."" Ms Nickolds had been a rising star in the business. When asked about what had changed between October and January, Sir Charlie said: ""Things change. People's desires, people's perspectives change. ""My perspective is that what we've done and what we're doing is the right thing to do."" The decision on whether or not to pay the traditional staff bonus, which will be taken by Ms White, will be ""influenced by our level of profitability, planned investment and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet"", the partnership said. The John Lewis Partnership is owned by its staff, who are known as partners. The last time that staff did not receive a bonus was in 1953. However, whether or not it would be paidwas in doubt last year. In March 2019, the partnershipcut the bonusafter a plunge in profits. John Lewis warned that this time around, full-year profits might not be enough for it to pay out any bonus. The partnershipfell to a loss in the first half of 2019, as it warned of ""difficult"" trading conditions and ""subdued consumer confidence"". It said on Thursday that it would reverse those losses, but it warned that profits would still be ""substantially down"" on the previous year. Sir Charlie said that profits had been hit ""because we are price competitive, because we match prices"". John Lewis has a price comparison promise enshrined in its ""never knowingly undersold"" slogan, which commits it to matching the prices of High Street competitors, but not those of online-only competitors. Trading conditions are tough at the moment, he said. ""Unfortunately, you can't choose the weather. When the weather is fine, you make hay - and we did. ""You have to use the winter to sow the seeds for the next harvest."" Christmas sales at John Lewis department stores were down 2% on a like-for-like basis, the partnership said. Sales in its home and technology departments were weak, down 3.4% and 4% respectively in the seven weeks from 17 November to 4 January. But it said beauty department sales were up 4.7% and Black Friday department store sales jumped 10%. At the same time, Waitrose sales rose 0.4%, which Sir Charlie described as ""a good sales performance"" in a ""weak grocery market"". Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said the results were ""a huge dent to John Lewis' recovery plans"". ""A company that was once placed on a pedestal as the future of retail by government and analysts has had its legs taken from under it, leaving it stumbling battered and bruised into 2020,"" she said. The ""never knowingly undersold"" promise ""continues to erode margins as it seeks to compete on price with competitors that have leaner operations and lower overheads"", she said. ""The rules of this promise may need to be reviewed and renewed if the retailer is to start turning around, and a savvy operator with Treasury experience like Sharon White may be just the kind of mind needed to do it,"" Ms Palmer added.

Dr Dharman: ""Sometimes it feels like you're drowning"" Dr Andrew Dharman, who works at the The Avenue surgery in Ealing, said the stress has got worse because of the enormous workload placed on GPs. He said: ""Sometimes it feels like you're drowning. You know you're trying to stay afloat and on top of all the workload. And you're trying to make sure you're providing the kind of care that you envisage when you go to medical school. ""You feel frustrated sometimes that you can't necessarily do that because of the amount of work and patients."" Prof Marshall has asked Mr Hancock to clarify how he will increase the number of family doctors, and what significant investments he will make in the profession. There are concerns that targets for extra GPs might not be met, with figures showing the numbers of doctors falling. In the letter, Prof Marshall says: ""No patient should have to wait three weeks for a GP appointment. This is unacceptable and our patients, and GPs, deserve better. ""We want a commitment to increase GP training places to 4,000 in 2020-21, as outlined in your election manifesto, but also to 5,000 soon after; and significant investment into initiatives to improve GP workload and retain existing GPs in the profession to improve the wellbeing and moral of the whole practice team."" According to official figures, there were just over 28,000 fully qualified full-time equivalent GPs in England as of September 2019.  This is a drop of 3.7% since September 2015. There were 160.8 million GP appointments in the 12 months to November 2019, with 41.9 million of those in the last three months, 450,000 more than in the same period a year earlier GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years Where not to live if you need a GP Millions miss out on seven-day GP access LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Papers highlight 'bombshell' move,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are the main story for most of the papers, with their photograph on almost all the front pages. ""Harry and Meghan quit the firm"" isthe Daily Telegraph's,externaltake. According tothe Times,external, the couple's ""personal message"" has opened a rift with the rest of the Royal Family. ""They didn't even tell the Queen"", complainsthe Daily Mirror,external, which accuses Prince Harry of petulance and selfishness. The Sun,externalheadlines its story ""Megxit"". It says the couple have triggered a ""civil war"", leaving the Queen ""deeply upset"" and Prince Charles and Prince William ""incandescent with rage"". The Daily Mail,externalhas brought out what it calls a ""royal bombshell special issue"", with coverage stretching to page 17. It calls the couple ""the rogue royals"" and says they've ""pressed the nuclear button"". Unnamed royal sources put the knife in, telling the Mail that Harry and Meghan are ""awkward and childish"", have treated the Queen ""shoddily"" and acted with a ""staggering"" level of deceit. The Financial Times,externalis more restrained but even it puts the story on the front page - with a headline focusing on the couple's desire for ""financial independence"". The announcement has also made headlines on the other side of the Atlantic, where the Sussexes plan to spend more time. Forthe Washington Post,external, it's a ""bold and remarkable"" move, signalling that two of the younger, more popular royals may be fed up with what it calls ""an anachronistic, cosseted life of endless ribbon-cutting and fusty, scripted engagements - and the scrutiny that comes with all of that"". According tothe Financial Times,external, Donald Trump has stepped back from the brink with a measured reaction to Iran's missile strikes against US forces in Iraq. The Guardian says that European leaders ""breathed a sigh of relief"" after the President heeded their public and private pleas to draw a line under the conflict.

Royals 'hurt' as Sussexes begin 'next chapter',"This video can not be played Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond: ""It is very clear the palace is very upset about what has happened"" The Royal Family are ""hurt"" at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's announcementthey will step back as senior royals. Prince Harry and Meghan did not consult any royal about making their personal statement, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond was told by palace sources. Buckingham Palace was ""blindsided"", he said, as talks about their future had begun but were in very early stages. The palace said there were ""complicated issues"" to work through. What do we know so far? In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight The Harry and Meghan story Intheir statementon Wednesday, Harry and Meghan said they made the decision ""after many months of reflection and internal discussions"". They said they intend ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially independent"". They plan to split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". ""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter,"" the couple said. Despite the couple's decision, Harrywill remain sixth in line to the throne.,external The pair was already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. The Sussexes' new charity is expected to be global, linked to Africa and the US, rather than domestic - and will have a commitment to female empowerment. It was revealed in December the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services. Meghan, of course, is American herself and has a particularly close relationship with her mother who lives in California. Butthe Sun, which broke the story on Wednesday,,externalwas firm in its speculation that Canada was their likely destination. The couple have just returned after a six-week break from royal duties, which they spent in Canada with their eight-month-old son, Archie. After returning to the UK on Tuesday, Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, visited Canada's High Commission in London to thank the country for hosting them and said the warmth and hospitality they received was ""unbelievable"". Former actress Meghan lived and worked in Toronto for seven years during her time starring in the popular US legal drama Suits. She has previously spoken about adopting the city as her second home after her native Los Angeles, andshe has several Canadian friends. Jessica Mulroney, a close friend of the duchess, posted a quote on Instagram about a ""strong woman"" facing a challenge. The Canadian stylist and TV star wrote: ""A strong woman looks a challenge in the eye and gives it a wink."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The couple's announcement raises numerous questions over what their future royal roles will entail. In stepping back as senior royals, Harry and Meghanhave announced they will no longer receive funding from the Sovereign Grant.,external The couple said this will make them ""members of the Royal Family with financial independence"". The Sovereign Grant is public money which pays for the cost of official royal duties, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. The Queen's Sovereign Grant from the Treasury was Â£82m in 2018-19. The couple said the Sovereign Grant paid for 5% of their official office from 2019, with the remaining 95% being funded by Prince Charles through his income from the Duchy of Cornwall. Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? Under current rules, the pair said they are ""prohibited from earning income in any form"", but in their new roles could follow other title-holding royals in having full-time jobs. The costs of official overseas visits will be funded by the Sovereign Grant and contributions from the host country ""when appropriate"". The couple are classified as ""internationally protected people"", which means they must have armed security provided by the Metropolitan Police. They will retain Frogmore cottage, the Grade-2 listed property in Windsorthat cost taxpayers Â£2.4m to renovate, as their official residence so they have a ""place to call home"" in the UK. Bryony Gordon, a Daily Telegraph journalist who knows and has interviewed the couple, suggested their decision could be linked to their mental health, after becoming a ""punching bag"" for a ""misogynistic and racist"" nation. In 2017, Ms Gordon interviewed the prince for herMad World podcast,externalin which he revealed hesought counselling while struggling in his late 20s to cope with the death of his mother.,external Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC 5 Live, she said: ""Here is a man who every day has to live out the trauma that he experienced as a little boy when he had to walk behind her coffin at the age of 12 in front of the world, and I think if any of us were put in that situation we would find it incredibly triggering."" She added the couple had become a ""punching bag for a nation that is still sort of deeply misogynistic and racist"" and they were ""entitled"" to ""do what is best"" for their family's mental health. She believes the couple will carry on exactly as before ""but just for free"", as they're ""sick of the scrutiny"" that comes with taking public money. Ms Gordon (pictured) interviewed the prince for a podcast in which he revealed he sought counselling to cope with his mother's death Royal historian Prof Kate Williams said it will be ""difficult"" for Harry and Meghan to lead ""normal"" lives, as media interest in them will increase after their ""unprecedented"" move. She told BBC Breakfast: ""It is going to be difficult if Harry and Meghan are going to live in Canada for a certain period of time and try and get on with business and be normal, charitable CEOs. ""They will require security because I don't see the media interest in them waning, I see it as probably increasing, because what they're doing is so unprecedented for royals."" A happy memory of Canada? The moment in 1991 when Prince Harry and his brother were reunited with their mother in Toronto during an official visit is an iconic royal image Royal commentator Penny Junor said the couple's actions were reminiscent of those of Harry's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The suggestion that they had not consulted other royals before making their statement was ""beyond bizarre"". She said: ""It has echoes of Diana when she suddenly announced after her separation [from Charles] that she was stepping back from 50 of her charities without consulting anybody. ""The problem is that they are not working for themselves, they are working for a family firm and to be making announcements of this sort without consulting is beyond bizarre."" Graham Smith, a spokesman for Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said Harry and Meghan's decision ""raises questions about the monarchy's future"" and will prompt taxpayers to ask how the couple's extra security and overseas lifestyle will be funded. ""To suggest that they're not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of self-entitlement and a lack of self-awareness that is common among royals,"" he said. ""This really is wanting to have your cake and eat it. They have said they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won't stop taking public money until they find other sources of income."" Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said ""we must continue to celebrate and support"" the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK, adding that it has an ""important role in public service"". This is clearly a major rift between Harry and Meghan on one part, and the rest of the Royal Family on the other. There are far more questions than answers. What will their new role be? Where will they live, and who will pay for it? What relationship will they have with the rest of the Royal Family? And there's the institutional question - what does this mean for the Royal Family? It comes just months afterPrince Andrew stepped back from his dutiesafter a BBC interview about his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Some might see this as the slimmed-down monarchy that the 21st Century needs. But Harry and Meghan reached people that other royals didn't. They were part of the reinvention and refreshing of the institution. It's understood talks have begun between Palace officials and No 10 about the implications of Harry and Meghan's announcement. We're now in wait-and-see mode as to whether this new model of being a royal can work - or if this is really a staging post for them to leave the Royal Family. Signs the couple were unhappy with their royal life have been apparent for some months. In October last year, the Duchess of Sussexbegan legal actionagainst the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The paper stands by its story. At the time, Prince Harry said his wife had ""become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press"" after a ""ruthless campaign"" of ""relentless propaganda"". ""Though we have continued to put on a brave face... I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,"" he said. In an ITV documentary last year, Meghan, who was born in the US, described motherhood as a ""struggle"" due to intense interest from newspapers. ""Not many people have asked if I'm OK,"" she said. This video can not be played Meghan spoke to ITV as part of a documentary last year Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said on Thursday the press should ""leave Harry and Meghan alone"" in the wake of their decision. The Labour MP for Leicester South expressed support for the couple, adding that the duchess had suffered ""appalling"" abuse and that she ""deserves a break"". On Wednesday the royal couple announced they would be adopting a ""revised media approach"" from the spring. As part of the new strategy,published on their website,external, they will ""engage with grassroots media organisations and young, up-and-coming journalists"". They will also pull out of the so-called royal rota system, where journalists and media representatives are given exclusive access to cover royal engagements on the understanding they share the material they gather. ""The current system predates the dramatic transformation of news reporting in the digital age,"" the couple said. The National Union of Journalists criticised the plans, saying the move appears to try and ""prevent the media from functioning and compromising the ability of journalists to do their jobs, which is completely unacceptable"".

"Barry Gardiner 'considering' Labour leadership bidThe shadow international trade secretary will make a decision shortly, the BBC understands.","Veteran Labour MP Barry Gardiner has said he is considering running for the party's leadership. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, the shadow energy minister said colleagues had told him he could bring ""dynamism to the debate"". Candidates have until 13 January to win the backing of the 22 MPs and MEPs needed to get on the ballot paper.

Full UK-EU trade deal 'impossible' by end of 2020,"This video can not be played EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says the UK and the EU will remain ""best of friends and partners"" The UK and the EU will remain the ""best of friends"" but they will ""not be as close as before"" after Brexit, the new European Commission president has said. Speaking ahead of talks with the PM, Ursula von der Leyen warned it would be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020. She said if the deadline was not extended it was not a case of ""all or nothing"", but of priorities. Boris Johnson has insisted a deal is possible by December 2020. After their meeting in No 10, a Downing Street spokesman said talks had been ""positive"", but the PM had been ""clear"" the process of negotiation would not be extended. After its 31 January exit, the UK will enter into an 11-month transition period in which it will largely follow EU rules but will not have any representation in the bloc's institutions. This period will come to an end on 31 December. Only when the UK leaves the EU can the two sides begin talks on their future economic relationship. Mr Johnson told Mrs von der Leyen he ""wanted a positive new UK and EU partnership, based on friendly co-operation, our shared history, interests and values"", as well as a ""broad free trade agreement covering goods and services, and cooperation in other areas"". He also said the UK was ready to start negotiations ""as soon as possible"" after 31 January. MPs resume scrutiny of PM's Brexit bill What's happening with Brexit this week? Who is Ursula von der Leyen? MSPs set to reject UK Brexit legislation Speaking at the London School of Economics earlier in the day, Mrs von der Leyen said the EU was ""ready to negotiate a truly ambitions partnership with UK"" but she warned of ""tough"" talks ahead. ""We will go as far as we can, but the truth is that our partnership cannot and will not be the same as before and it cannot and will not be as close as before because with every choice comes a consequences with every decision comes a trade off."" Ursula von der Leyen met Boris Johnson in Number 10 Mrs von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, took over from Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of December. She was a student at the LSE in the 1970s. She also attended the same school as Mr Johnson in Belgium - something the prime minister highlighted as they posed for photos in Number 10. Mrs von der Leyen said she hoped the new trading relationship would be based on ""zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping"". What is the transition period? Week ahead in Parliament But she said: ""Without the free movement of people you cannot have the free movement of capital and services. ""The more divergence there is the more distant the partnership will be."" Mrs von der Leyen also warned that without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020  ""you cannot expect to agree every single aspect of our new partnership"". She called the deadline ""very tight"". This video can not be played Barclay: 'Let's be positive' about 2020 Brexit trade deal deadline Opposition MPs have warned that trade deals typically take years to conclude and the UK risks defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules at the start of 2021, potentially leading to damaging tariffs for some industries. But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast the UK and EU had agreed in the political declaration to do a trade deal by the end of this year and he was ""confident"" they would do that. The meeting between Boris Johnson and new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is significant in that it's their first face-to-face in their new roles - but today does not mark the start of post-Brexit trade talks. EU law dictates that trade talks can't start until the UK legally leaves the bloc. Then EU countries must agree a mandate for the EU Commission to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement on their behalf. This mandate then has to be formally signed off at minister level by representatives of all EU countries. All this means, the EU says, is trade talks will start at the beginning of March. When UK ministers complain that's too long to wait, the EU response is that the UK always pushed for bigger role for national governments in EU decision-making to make it more democratic. Expect red-line drawing with smiles today between the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen - presented as ""friends telling each other truths"". The EU position is that the prime minister's timetable to get an ""ambitious, comprehensive"" trade deal agreed and ratified by December is unrealistic. However, the prime minister will counter this with ""truths"" of his own, including that negotiations have to be done by December because he won't extend the transition period. Legislation implementing the terms of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal continues to move through the Commons, with the government easily winning all three votes on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Tuesday. The bill will enshrine in law the terms of the transition period, first negotiated by Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May, as well as agreements on citizens' rights, customs arrangements in Northern Ireland and the UK's financial settlement. Attempts by Northern Ireland parties to amend the bill to ensure ""unfettered access"" for businesses there to the rest of the UK market failed to pass on Wednesday afternoon. MPs also rejected an attempt by Labourto reinstate child refugee protection rights in the Brexit bill.
