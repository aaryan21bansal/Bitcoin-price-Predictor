US warns N Korea of 'massive response',"This video can not be played Any US response would be ""effective and overwhelming"" - James Mattis Pentagon chief James Mattis says any threat to the US or its allies by North Korea will be met with a ""massive military response"". His comments came after a national security briefing with President Donald Trump about the secretive communist state's latest nuclear test. Pyongyang says it has successfully trialled a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. The move has drawn international condemnation. North Korea has defied UN sanctions and international pressure by developing nuclear weapons and test missiles that could potentially reach the US. How should Trump handle North Korea? What are the military options? N Korea: China's 'nightmare neighbour'? The most powerful nuclear blasts ever But speaking to reporters outside the White House, Defence Secretary Mattis said the US had the ability to defend itself and its allies South Korea and Japan, adding that its commitments were ""ironclad"". ""Any threat to the United States or its territories - including Guam - or our allies will be met with a massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming."" This video can not be played Nuclear N Korea: What do we know? However, he said the hope was for denuclearisation, ""because we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea"". The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss an international response,according to the US mission.,external Meanwhile, President Trump has warned that America may stop trading with any country that does business with the North. The first suggestion that this was to be a far from normal Sunday in the region came when seismologists' equipment started picking up readings of an earth tremor in the area where North Korea has conducted nuclear tests before. The US Geological Survey put the tremor at 6.3 magnitude. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said there was no doubt this was North Korea's sixth nuclear test, calling it ""unforgivable"". Then North Korean state media confirmed this was no earthquake. It claimed the country had conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, detonating a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded onto a long-range missile. This video can not be played North Korean state media announces ""hydrogen bomb"" test North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured with what state media said was a new type of hydrogen bomb. Hydrogen bombs are many times more powerful than an atomic bomb. They use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash huge amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. Analysts say the North's claims should be treated with caution, but that its nuclear capability is clearly advancing. Officials in China, where the blast was felt as a tremor, said they were carrying out emergency radiation testing along the border with North Korea. Denouncing the test as""hostile"" and ""dangerous"",external, President Trump described the North as a ""rogue nation"" which had become a ""great threat and embarrassment"" to China - Pyongyang's main ally. He also said South Korea's ""talk of appeasement"" was not working and that the secretive communist state ""only understands one thing"". ""The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,"" Mr Trump later said in a tweet. North Korea relies on China for about 90% of its foreign trade. Kim inspects 'nuclear warhead': A picture decoded 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues State media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb South Korean President Moon Jae-in called for the ""strongest possible"" response, including new UN Security Council sanctions to ""completely isolate"" the country. The country staged a ""live-fire exercise"" late on Sunday simulating an attack on the North's Punggye-ri nuclear site, military officials said. The drill saw a Hyunmoo surface-to-surface missile and air-to-ground missiles fired from F-15K jets hit targets in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff quoted by Yonhap news agency. China, meanwhile, also expressed ""strong condemnation"" and said the state ""had ignored the international community's widespread opposition"". Russia urged all sides involved to hold talks, saying this was the only way to resolve the Korean peninsula's problems. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the ""reckless"" new test represented an ""unacceptable further threat to the international community"". She called on world leaders to come together to stop North Korea's ""destabilising actions"". South Korean officials said the latest test took place in Kilju County, where the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site is situated. The ""artificial quake"" was 9.8 times more powerful than the tremor from the North's fifth test in September 2016, the state weather agency said. Although experts urged caution, this does appear to be the biggest and most successful nuclear test by North Korea to date - and the messaging is clear. North Korea wants to demonstrate it knows what makes a credible nuclear warhead. Nuclear weapons expert Catherine Dill told the BBC it was not yet clear exactly what nuclear weapon design was tested. ""But based on the seismic signature, the yield of this test definitely is an order of magnitude higher than the yields of the previous tests."" Current information did not definitively indicate that a thermonuclear weapon had been tested ""but it appears to be a likely possibility at this point"", she said By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent North Korea's sixth nuclear test - probably its largest so far - sends out one clear political signal. Despite the bluster and threats from the Trump administration in Washington and near-universal condemnation from around the world, Pyongyang is not going to halt or constrain its nuclear activities. Worryingly, it also suggests that this is a programme that is progressing on all fronts at a faster rate than many had expected. So far all efforts to pressure North Korea - sanctions, isolation and military threats - have all failed to move Pyongyang. Could more be done? Certainly, but the harshest economic pressure would potentially cripple the regime and push it towards catastrophe - something China is unwilling to countenance. Containment and deterrence will now come to the fore as the world adjusts its policy from seeking to roll-back Pyongyang's weapons programme to living with a nuclear-armed North Korea. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? This video can not be played Speaking before the new nuclear test, Senator Lindsey Graham told BBC HARDtalk a US attack was inevitable if diplomacy failed By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai North Korea's sixth nuclear weapons test is an utter rejection of all that its only ally has called for. Beijing's response was predictable - condemnation, urging an end to provocation and dialogue. But it also spoke of urging North Korea to ""face up to the firm will"" of the international community to see denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. There is no sign, though, that China is willing yet to see that ""firm will"" go beyond UN sanctions, which recently clamped down on seafood and iron ore exports, in addition to the coal and minerals that are already banned from crossing the border. It is noteworthy also that this test took place just as the Chinese president was about to welcome a handful of world leaders to the two-day showpiece Brics summit on China's east coast. Even the state-controlled media will find it hard to ignore the fact that their man has been upstaged - embarrassed too - by its almost universally ostracised ally and neighbour.

"No rate rise until 2019, economists say","Many economists do not expect UK interest rates to rise until 2019 despite inflation remaining above target, according to a BBC snapshot. They believe that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will be reluctant to raise rates during Brexit negotiations. Inflation stood at 2.6% in July - well above the Bank's official target of 2%. Half the economists contacted by the BBC think wages growth will outpace inflation in the first half of 2019. Last week, one MPC member, Michael Saunders, said a""modest rise"" in rates was neededto curb high inflation. The base rate has stood at a record low of 0.25% since August 2016 - the first move since March 2009, when it was reduced to 0.5%. In June, three MPC members voted for a rate rise - the first time since May 2011 that so many had wanted to tighten policy. The same month the Bank's chief economist,Andy Haldane, also made a call for a rate risethis year. However, Mark Carney, the Bank governor, said in his Mansion House speech in late June that ""now is not yet the time"" to start raising rates once more. Borrowing becomes more expensive, meaning consumers have less to spend, so some prices are less likely to increase The cost of some mortgages rises, reducing disposable income Higher interest rates also encourage saving, rather than spending Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has cast doubt on an imminent interest rate rise Stuart Green, of Santander Global Corporate Banking, told the BBC he did not expect a rate hike to happen before 2019. ""We believe that policymakers will be reluctant to tighten monetary policy until greater clarity emerges around the UK's post-EU trading framework, and our expectation of declining inflation through 2018 should also reduce the pressure for an interest rate rise,"" he said. Others expect it to be even longer, with economists at Morgan Stanley not expecting any movement until March 2019 at the earliest, with Andrew Goodwin at Oxford Economics suggesting it would not happen until the third quarter of that year. Similarly, Fabrice Montagne, at Barclays, expects rates to stay on hold until ""at least 2019"". But there are those who argue that the Bank will raise rates sooner. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY ITEM Club, said he had one increase, to 0.5%, pencilled in for late 2018, adding: ""I would not be at all surprised if it was delayed until 2019."" Michael Lee, at Cambridge Econometrics, expects a rise to come in either the second or third quarter of next year as he thinks inflation will stay above the Bank's 2% target for the next two to three years. Philip Rush, at Heteronomica, is more specific, settling on May 2018. The one outlier is George Buckley at Nomura, who expects the MPC to jump in November. The BBC also asked the economists when they expect inflation to peak in the UK. Both Mr Rush and Mr Archer think it will hit 2.9% in October, with the latter predicting it will then start to fall back ""as the impact of the sharp drop in sterling following the June 2016 Brexit vote increasingly wanes"". Several others, such as Mr Green, Mr Lee and Mr Goodwin, expect inflation to hit 3% in the final three months of the year before starting to retreat. Morgan Stanley is more pessimistic, however, predicting a peak of 3.2% in Spring 2018. Holiday makers planning trips to the continent in the next few months should prepare themselves for more pain, according to Morgan Stanley. Its currency strategy team expect sterling to weaken against the euro by a further 10% by March 2018. Mr Green at Santander also forecasts more weakness for the UK currency over the course of the next year, with an average of $1.25 to the pound and just 96 euro cents in the final quarter of 2018. Mr Archer thinks the pound will sink to about $1.25 by Christmas, but recover to trade about seven cents higher by the end of 2018. Heteronomica's Mr Rush is also a little more optimistic about sterling, expecting it to be stronger within a year. The last time interest rates went up was 5 July, 2007. They rose by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75%. The next month the credit crunch struck, and so began a series of cuts, down to 0.5% in March 2009. These were supposed to be emergency measures. Then came the Brexit vote, and in August 2016 the official rate dropped to a fresh record low of 0.25%. That compares to a typical range of between 5% and 13% for most of the 1990s. Emergency rates are the new normal. That carries dangers. If we hit another slump, we've run out of road; there won't be much the Bank of England can do to help by cutting interest rates. While some members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee think we should start restoring interest rates to non-emergency levels this year, that is a minority view, as our snapshot of economists' forecasts shows. You could draw a number of conclusions. You might decide interest rates aren't effective on their own - so the government should rely less on the central bank stimulus and instead use fiscal policy such as cutting taxes or raising spending. You might take the view that rates should rise to help savers and pension schemes. Or you might take the view that an early rise could worsen the economic slowdown. You might even believe that we need to find ways to get the official rate below zero (so that I, the lender, pay you, the borrower, to take my money). Take your pick, but whichever you choose, normality ain't what it used to be.

"Trump, N Korea, and police custody deaths","The tensions between North Korea and US President Trump feature on many of Sunday's papers TheFinancial Times,externalsays US President Donald Trump has opened the door to launching an attack on North Korea, while both theDaily Telegraph,externaland theDaily Mail,externalalso highlight warnings by the US that it is ready to ""annihilate"" the country. The Times,externallays part of the blame at the door of the US president. It says the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has been emboldened by the incoherence of Mr Trump's attitude towards him. The Guardian,externalsays it has learnt that a long-awaited official report on deaths in custody, which has yet to be published, will call for far-reaching reforms to the police and justice system. It says the review - ordered by Theresa May when she was home secretary - will recommend that police cells should be completely phased out as a place to hold people who are believed to have mental health problems. It will also say that the families of those who have died in police custody should receive ""free, non-means tested"" legal advice.

How should Trump handle North Korea?,"The US is drawing up a new proposal to punish any countries doing business with North Korea North Korea's dramatic testing of a sixth nuclear device has once again raised fears of rising tensions in north-east Asia and the prospect of war breaking out on the Korean peninsula. The size ofthe latest test- equivalent to a 6.3 magnitude earthquake - suggests a step-change in the destructive power of the North's nuclear assets. It was five to six times larger than its last test in September 2016, and potentially seven times as large as the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. But it is too early to assess Pyongyang's boast to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. The North has madesimilar uncorroborated claimsin the past, but irrespective of the precise nature of the explosion, there seems little doubt that the destructive capacity of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal has increased substantially. The North's motives for testing remain unchanged. Pyongyang's desire to acquire nuclear weapons dates from at least the 1960s, and is rooted in a desire for political autonomy, national prestige and military strength. Added to this is Kim Jong-un's desire to secure an unambiguous deterrent to safeguard against a potential US pre-emptive attack - a key element in explaining not only Kim's sharply accelerated missile testing programme, but alsothe latest photoboast apparently showing him inspecting a new entirely ""homemade"" nuclear warhead. While analysts are divided on whether the North's progress in developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (following its two tests in July) has enabled it to strike the United States with nuclear weapons, in some ways the technical debate is moot. State media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb The demonstration effect of repeated missile and nuclear weapons testing makes it extremely unlikely that an American president would contemplate a direct strike on the country, other than in retaliation against a North Korean attack - a move that North Korean officials know would be suicidal. Kim Jong-un's behaviour since taking over as the North's leader in December 2011 suggests that he is a rational actor, albeit a particularly egotistical and brutal one given hiswillingness to executeand purge both close family members and senior elite North Korean officials. His actions are those of a calculating risk-taker (more so than his father Kim Jong-il) intent on thumbing his nose at President Trump, while also bolstering his legitimacy in the eyes of his own people by realising his goal of military modernisation. This objective appears to be widely popular with many North Koreans, especially those living in Pyongyang. While the North remains the primary source of regional insecurity, an additional, and perhaps more worrying element of instability is the temperament and thinking of Donald Trump. The US president continues very conspicuouslyto hintat the possibility of pre-emptive US military action against the North - a course of action that would have catastrophic consequences for the citizens of Japan, South Korea and especially the 10 million or so residents of Seoul directly in range of the North's conventional and nuclear forces. Ultimately, a US military response to the North Korean challenge would, therefore, represent a ""doomsday"" scenario for America's two key regional allies as well as jeopardising the lives of the 28,500 US servicemen and personnel based in South Korea. It is, therefore, easy to understand why both US Defence Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster are reportedly firmly opposed to the military option except as a last defensive resort. South Korea and US soldiers watch a joint live firing drill in Pocheon, 65km northeast of Seoul President Trump's bellicose sabre-rattling may be a negotiating ploy, intended to alarm Pyongyang sufficiently to deter it from further provocations, or to encourage an increasingly irritated Chinese leadership to impose decisive and punitive economic pressure on the North, most immediately through a suspension of critical crude oil supplies. Yet if this is the intention, it does not appear to be working. The North has since April been stockpiling supplies of oil to guard against any new sanctions and the Chinese leadership, while reportedly increasingly irritated by the North, may therefore have concluded that restricting oil as either a symbolic or actual economic weapon may have limited immediate impact. Assuming the president is neither irrational nor wilfully impulsive, nor willing to sacrifice Seoul for the interests of Washington, then the most likely response to the current crisis will be for the administration to push for much tougher sanctions against the North. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is currently drawing up a new proposal to punish any third countries doing business with the North by cutting off their access to the US market. While this would certainly be a dramatic and arguably proportionate response to the new North Korean provocation, it runs the risk of being both ineffective and counter-productive.

Unilateral US sanctions would be hard to enforce, would potentially provoke crippling retaliatory trade sanctions by countries such as China that have balked at further across the board economic pressure on the North, and would at best, even if enforceable, take time to have a meaningful effect on the North Korean leadership. Given the grave risks and limited benefits associated with either sanctions or military action, diplomacy and dialogue remain the best means of defusing the current crisis. While the UN and individual nations should continue toforcefully condemnthe North's behaviour, it remains the responsibility of the United States - still the world's indispensable superpower - to actively and imaginatively explore the options for some form of dialogue with North Korea. Not talking leaves open the possibility that strategic tensions will continue. A frustrated President Trump confronted, weeks or months from now, by the failure of sanctions or political brinkmanship to bring the North to heel, may end up acting on his apparent belief that force is the ""one thing"" that Kim Jong-un understands. In such a situation it is conceivable that both sides may misperceive the intentions of the other and end up stumbling into conflict that could escalate to the nuclear level - not through rational design but by accidental miscalculation. Patient negotiation remains, therefore, a way of pointing out to the North not only the costs (both diplomatic and economic) of further provocations, but also the potential gains to be realised through moderation. Talking is not, as President Trump has erroneously suggested, ""appeasement"" and represents the best way of averting military conflict and preventing the hands of the doomsday clock, for now at least, moving perilously closer to midnight.

Barnier vows to 'educate' UK over Brexit,"The latest salvos come after a week of Brexit talks involving David Davis (left) and Michel Barnier The EU's Brexit negotiator has said he sees the process as an opportunity to ""teach"" the British people and others what leaving the single market means. Michel Barnier said: ""There are extremely serious consequences of leaving the single market and it hasn't been explained to the British people."" The UK has hit back, saying the EU does ""not want to talk about the future"". Brexit Secretary David Davis said it was ""frightened"" and the UK would not be bounced into a divorce bill deal. The latest salvos come after a week of talks in Brussels about the UK's withdrawal from the EU - scheduled to take place in March 2019 - which increased tensions between the two sides. PM appeals to backbench Tories over Brexit Brexit: All you need to know The EU suggested little substantive progress had been made on three key ""separation"" issues, the size of the UK's financial liabilities to the EU, the future of the Irish border and citizens' rights after Brexit. Mr Barnier accused the UK of ""nostalgia"" and cast doubt on whether enough progress had been made to broaden the discussions, in the autumn, to consider the UK's post-Brexit trading relationship with the EU. This led to a frosty response from British ministers, one of whom, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, said the UK would not be blackmailed into doing a deal on money in order to open discussions on trade. Speaking at a conference in Italy on Saturday, Mr Barnier said he did not want to punish the UK for leaving but said: ""I have a state of mind - not aggressive... but I'm not naÃ¯ve."" This video can not be played Davis: ""This bill is about ensuring continuity"" ""We intend to teach peopleâ¦ what leaving the single market means,"" he told the Ambrosetti forum. On the issue of finance, he said the UK must accept some key principles, such as honouring the commitment it made in 2014 to pay 14% of the EU budget until 2020 He said that a future free trade deal would be different to all others in the past and there had to be assurances there would be no unfair competition in the form of social, environmental or fiscal dumping, or state aid. But speaking to BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Davis insisted the UK would not be pressured into agreeing an EU divorce bill until it is sure the sums being demanded are fair. He dismissed newspaper reports the UK had secretly agreed to pay a figure of up to Â£50bn as ""nonsense"". The UK was assessing the EU's financial demands on an item-by-item basis in a ""very British and pragmatic fashion"" - which he said the EU found difficult. While Mr Davis said he personally liked his counterpart, he said the European Commission risked making itself appear ""silly"" when it claimed no progress had been made in areas such as access to welfare and healthcare rights across Europe for British expats. ""What he's concerned about of course is he's not getting the answer on moneyâ¦ they've set this up to try and create pressure on us on moneyâ¦ they're trying to play time against money"". He added: ""We're going through [the bill] line by line, and they're finding it difficult because we've got good lawyersâ¦ He wants to put pressure on us, which is why the stance this week in the press conference. Bluntly, I think it looked a bit silly, because plainly there were things that we've achieved. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""This is grown-up politics from the Labour party in the public interest"" ""We put people before process, what they're in danger of doing is putting process before people"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said some of the figures touted for the size of the divorce bill were ""extravagant"" and the UK would only respect a number that was ""serious and validated in law"". ""We will certainly honour our legal obligations as we understand them,"" he said, while stressing the UK would ""certainly not pay for access to the European markets"". The continuing tit-for-tat between the two sides comes as Downing Street called for unity among its MPs as they prepare to debate the government's flagship Brexit bill. The EU Withdrawal Bill will repeal the law that paved the way for the UK to join the European Economic Community in the 1970s and convert 40 years worth of EU statutes into domestic law. Labour has said it will seek to amend the bill to stop the government from automatically accruing new powers after Brexit. The opposition is courting europhile Conservative MPs, claiming its position on remaining in the single market and customs union during any Brexit transition is more ""clear and coherent"" than the Tories. ""To suggest, as some do, that you can have, as it were, bespoke, special arrangements negotiated between now and March 2019 is nonsense, and so this is grown-up politics from the Labour party in the public interest,"" shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told Andrew Marr. But Mr Davis said Labour was onto its ""perhaps seventh, eighth, ninth"" policy on Brexit and the opposition knew the legislation was essential to ensuring legal certainty and practical continuity as the UK takes responsibility for policy in a wide range of areas. 4 September 2017: This story was updated to amend the wording of some direct quotes from Michel Barnier.

Why don't many British tourists visit Victoria Falls?,"The statue of David Livingstone next to the Victoria Falls has few British visitors In August 1934, a memorial statue to one of Britain's greatest national heroes, David Livingstone, was unveiled alongside his beloved Victoria Falls. A thousand people attended the grand ceremony, including British government dignitaries and hundreds of Africans, some of whom had travelled for days to honour him. Fully 60 years after the explorer's death, Livingstone's almost mythical status was undiminished. A Christian missionary who risked his life many times to expose - and ultimately end - the evils of the East African slave trade, he introduced the world to one of its natural wonders, and was the first European person ever to walk across Africa from coast to coast, exploring and mapping the geography of the ""dark continent"". David Livingstone - shown being attacked by a lion in this 1850 illustration - travelled with few servants and porters Images of the life-sized bronze on the banks of the Zambezi were broadcast across the British Empire, countless school children thrilling to the stories of Livingstone's adventures and achievements. Today, visitors still file past the statue on their way to experience the humbling majesty of the Zambezi as it plunges over the towering First Gorge. But the British are notable by their absence. Official figures from the Zimbabwe Tourism Ministry show that, since the turn of the millennium, the statue has rarely heard an accent from the United Kingdom, never mind voices from Livingstone's native Scotland. In 2015, there were more Italian visitors than Britons, about twice as many Australians and French, three times as many Germans and seven times the number of Americans. David Livingstone dreamed of turning the falls he first saw in 1855 into a major tourist attraction The irony is profound. It was Livingstone's dream to turn Victoria Falls into a tourist attraction, his journals imagining paddle-steamers bringing visitors from the mouth of the Zambezi to witness their splendour. There is a similar Britain-shaped hole at the quintessentially English Victoria Falls Hotel, where the flying boat from Southampton once stopped on its way to the Cape. The Victoria Falls Hotel dates back to 1904 Pink gins are sipped on the lawns overlooking the Darlington-built steel bridge that has spanned the Zambezi gorge since 1905. Pictures of British kings and queens adorn the walls, alongside animal heads and zebra skins. The current Queen stayed at the hotel in 1947. A framed photograph shows the then-Princess Elizabeth with her father, George VI, watching the mighty Zambezi tumble over the precipice, an image that inspired huge numbers of British tourists to follow the Royals to the falls. A visit by then-Princess Elizabeth and George VI to Victoria Falls in 1947 helped boost the area's appeal But in recent years, that flood has become a trickle. Why? Robert Mugabe. Livingstone's statue stands on what is now Zimbabwean soil, and Britain has an uncomfortable relationship with its former colony. Most UK tourists visit what locals call Mosi-oa-Tunya (The Smoke That Thunders) from the Zambian side, north of the river, where consciences may feel less troubled. Limited sanctions remain in place against Zimbabwe,external, although these are mostly to do with arms dealing and individuals, including Robert and Grace Mugabe. Tourists can travel to the country. And this corner of Zimbabwe is making a plan to woo the British back. Victoria Falls are regularly dubbed one of the world's seven natural wonders The border town of Victoria Falls exists only for tourism. But afterPresident Mugabe began forcibly confiscating land from white farmers in 2000, the country's status as an international pariah saw the number of foreign visitors there dwindle almost to nothing. A decade later and facing ruin, business leaders in the town met in emergency session. It was clear the Mugabe government was not in a position to help them. The economy was in tatters, ravaged by hyperinflation, the national bank had to issue trillion-dollar notes. Shops were empty and the people haunted by desperate poverty and fear. The roads had not been maintained, anti-malaria measures had all but been abandoned, the international press painted a picture of a country where white Westerners were treated as the enemy. What hope of attracting foreign tourists to that? Victoria Falls hotelier Ross Kennedy galvanised fellow business owners to try to address the town's problems ""If you have a pothole outside your house, there is no point in moaning about it if no-one is going to fix it,"" says Ross Kennedy, the hotelier behind the crisis meeting. ""We got together and agreed there are times when it is necessary to fix the pothole yourself."" So that's what they did, both metaphorically and literally. ""The town council said it could provide the labour and the trucks.  We all chipped in to buy gravel and tar.  It was a real town effort - hotel operators, transport operators, activity operators all helped fix the roads,"" Mr Kennedy says. It was the same strategy with the fight against malaria. The council didn't have the foreign currency to buy the necessary chemicals to spray, so local businesses funded what was required, offsetting the cost against their rates. They also tackled the security issue. As the owner of a number of local resorts, Mr Kennedy knew his business could never thrive if guests felt unsafe. ""Myself and three other guys in Vic Falls funded around 10 or 12 people to act as tourist police,"" he says. The tourist police are jointly funded by local businesses and the tourism authority Initially sceptical, the government's tourism authority soon decided the friendly uniformed teams were a great way to reassure potential visitors. ""There are many more tourist police now,"" Mr Kennedy says. ""We pay half, and the tourism authority pays half. ""The local police have become more supportive, and now train the recruits in basic police work and public relations."" The latest plan is for private business to buy new software that would speed up the issuing of visas at the border, reducing the process from three minutes to 30 seconds, ending the long queues that are many tourists' dreary introduction to Zimbabwe. As a result of these innovative joint ventures, Victoria Falls has managed to insulate itself from many of Zimbabwe's problems. ""We are in a bubble here,"" says Africa Albida Tourism's Michele Vickery. ""When the state could not be relied upon, the people of this community just looked out for each other. The result is that tourism is picking up again."" The Americans are coming back, both young backpackers and wealthy baby-boomers. Australians, Germans, French and Italians are beginning to arrive again too. The town is much busier. But where are the British? ""Britain is still a bit behind,"" Mr Kennedy says. ""I think the main reason is the colonial past. There is an element who say: 'There is no way I am spending a dollar in a country that behaves like that, where X, Y or Z is in power,' to which I say, 'I am not your moral compass.'"" The British Embassy has been lobbied by town businesses to push for the inclusion of a paragraph in theUK's official Zimbabwe travel advice,external, saying that warnings of violence, assaults by security forces, shortages of fuel and water do not apply to Victoria Falls. But the advice has not changed. The UK's relationship with Zimbabwe was formalised following the Congress of Berlin in 1885, part of the so-called scramble for Africa. This French cartoon from 1885 mocks German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and his fellow European leaders slicing up Africa like a cake Western powers sat around a table carving up the continent and claiming territorial rights. Britain walked away with the keys to exploiting the area it would later call Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. The man granted the honour of unveiling David Livingstone's statue on the banks of the Zambezi in 1934 was the explorer's nephew, Howard Moffatt. A very different personality to his liberal and reforming uncle, Moffatt had just stepped down as prime minister of Southern Rhodesia, having pushed through the Land Apportionment Act of 1930. The legislation barred African landownership in the British Crown colony, outside special reserves. The best land was allocated exclusively to white people, farms where the seeds of black grievance and bitterness were sown. Mr Mugabe's violent seizure of white-owned property 70 years later might be seen by some as the bloody consequence of that colonial arrogance. In unusually candid comments in 2015, President Mugabe admitted there had been flaws in Zimbabwe's controversial land reform programme The moral ambiguity that lies behind Britain's relationship with Zimbabwe surely helps explain the persistent reluctance of many in this country to risk association with it. Since 2015, Victoria Falls has had its own international airport with a runway capable of taking the largest passenger aircraft. The townsfolk have pressed airlines to begin direct flights from Europe, but British carriers have so far not expressed much interest. UK airlines say there are commercial and logistical reasons for not flying directly to the resort at the moment. It is easy to find reasons not to step upon the troubled lands of Zimbabwe. At the moment, the country faces an acute cash shortage. cash machines are usually empty, and American dollars - now the legal currency - are so scarce, hawkers beg tourists for their shoes and clothes. There are concerns that dreaded inflation is returning. People worry about social and political instability, with elections next year and, at some point,transition to a post-Mugabe Zimbabwe. But the fundamentals of this beautiful and enchanting country are pretty solid. The landscape and wildlife are stunning. The climate is benign and the soil fertile. Communities have become resilient and practical. There are a few straws in the savannah wind. Some British tour operators have recently returned to Zimbabwe, and hoteliers report UK bookings are creeping up, although there is still a long way to go. Zimbabwe's Tourism Minister Walter Mzembi points out that visitors to Niagara Falls in North America bring in income double that of the whole of Zimbabwe's economy. ""They are spending $30bn [Â£23bn] whilst Victoria Falls, a natural wonder of a higher magnitude, receives just $1bn,"" he told the Zimbabwe parliament. Victoria Falls can shield itself from some of Zimbabwe's contemporary woes. But the grim countenance of Livingstone's statue, staring resolutely at the great falls, reminds us of the struggle to navigate a path through the thorny undergrowth of African history.

US issues stark warning to North Korea,"This video can not be played Any US response would be ""effective and overwhelming"" - James Mattis Pentagon chief James Mattis says any threat to the US or its allies by North Korea will be met with a ""massive military response"". His comments came after a national security briefing with President Donald Trump about the secretive communist state's latest nuclear test. Pyongyang says it has successfully trialled a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. The move has drawn international condemnation.

However, he said the hope was for denuclearisation, ""because we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea"". The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss an international response,according to the US mission.,external Meanwhile, President Trump has warned that America may stop trading with any country that does business with the North. The first suggestion that this was to be a far from normal Sunday in the region came when seismologists' equipment started picking up readings of an earth tremor in the area where North Korea has conducted nuclear tests before. The US Geological Survey put the tremor at 6.3 magnitude. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said there was no doubt this was North Korea's sixth nuclear test, calling it ""unforgivable"". Then North Korean state media confirmed this was no earthquake. It claimed the country had conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, detonating a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded onto a long-range missile. This video can not be played North Korean state media announces ""hydrogen bomb"" test North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured with what state media said was a new type of hydrogen bomb. Hydrogen bombs are many times more powerful than an atomic bomb. They use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash huge amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. Analysts say the North's claims should be treated with caution, but that its nuclear capability is clearly advancing. Officials in China, where the blast was felt as a tremor, said they were carrying out emergency radiation testing along the border with North Korea. Denouncing the test as""hostile"" and ""dangerous"",external, President Trump described the North as a ""rogue nation"" which had become a ""great threat and embarrassment"" to China - Pyongyang's main ally. He also said South Korea's ""talk of appeasement"" was not working and that the secretive communist state ""only understands one thing"". ""The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,"" Mr Trump later said in a tweet. North Korea relies on China for about 90% of its foreign trade. Kim inspects 'nuclear warhead': A picture decoded 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues State media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb South Korean President Moon Jae-in called for the ""strongest possible"" response, including new UN Security Council sanctions to ""completely isolate"" the country. The country staged a ""live-fire exercise"" late on Sunday simulating an attack on the North's Punggye-ri nuclear site, military officials said. The drill saw a Hyunmoo surface-to-surface missile and air-to-ground missiles fired from F-15K jets hit targets in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff quoted by Yonhap news agency. China, meanwhile, also expressed ""strong condemnation"" and said the state ""had ignored the international community's widespread opposition"". Russia urged all sides involved to hold talks, saying this was the only way to resolve the Korean peninsula's problems. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the ""reckless"" new test represented an ""unacceptable further threat to the international community"". She called on world leaders to come together to stop North Korea's ""destabilising actions"". South Korean officials said the latest test took place in Kilju County, where the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site is situated. The ""artificial quake"" was 9.8 times more powerful than the tremor from the North's fifth test in September 2016, the state weather agency said. Although experts urged caution, this does appear to be the biggest and most successful nuclear test by North Korea to date - and the messaging is clear. North Korea wants to demonstrate it knows what makes a credible nuclear warhead. Nuclear weapons expert Catherine Dill told the BBC it was not yet clear exactly what nuclear weapon design was tested. ""But based on the seismic signature, the yield of this test definitely is an order of magnitude higher than the yields of the previous tests."" Current information did not definitively indicate that a thermonuclear weapon had been tested ""but it appears to be a likely possibility at this point"", she said By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent North Korea's sixth nuclear test - probably its largest so far - sends out one clear political signal. Despite the bluster and threats from the Trump administration in Washington and near-universal condemnation from around the world, Pyongyang is not going to halt or constrain its nuclear activities. Worryingly, it also suggests that this is a programme that is progressing on all fronts at a faster rate than many had expected. So far all efforts to pressure North Korea - sanctions, isolation and military threats - have all failed to move Pyongyang. Could more be done? Certainly, but the harshest economic pressure would potentially cripple the regime and push it towards catastrophe - something China is unwilling to countenance. Containment and deterrence will now come to the fore as the world adjusts its policy from seeking to roll-back Pyongyang's weapons programme to living with a nuclear-armed North Korea.

This video can not be played Speaking before the new nuclear test, Senator Lindsey Graham told BBC HARDtalk a US attack was inevitable if diplomacy failed By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai North Korea's sixth nuclear weapons test is an utter rejection of all that its only ally has called for. Beijing's response was predictable - condemnation, urging an end to provocation and dialogue. But it also spoke of urging North Korea to ""face up to the firm will"" of the international community to see denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. There is no sign, though, that China is willing yet to see that ""firm will"" go beyond UN sanctions, which recently clamped down on seafood and iron ore exports, in addition to the coal and minerals that are already banned from crossing the border. It is noteworthy also that this test took place just as the Chinese president was about to welcome a handful of world leaders to the two-day showpiece Brics summit on China's east coast.

'Full-fibre' broadband locations named,"At present, many UK properties offered fibre connections still rely on copper cables for the ""last leg"" of the journey Six areas in the UK will soon be trying out broadband technology that provides data at speeds approaching one gigabit per second (gbps). Businesses, schools and hospitals will be the first to try out the ""full-fibre"" network technology. The pilots will be run in Aberdeenshire, West Sussex, Coventry and Warwickshire, Bristol, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. The government will spend about Â£10m getting the pilots up and running. The technology involved is known as full-fibre because it takes high-speed cables directly to premises. By contrast, much of the existing fibre services in the UK connect the fast cables to roadside cabinets and then rely on older, slower copper for the final link to homes and other buildings. Currently full-fibre networks are only available to about 2% of premises in the UK. The government hopes that the projects will significantly boost the availability of the technology. The preferred technology of Openreach, the body that runs much of the UK's fibre network, has to date been fibre to the cabinet. That means that homes and businesses are connected by a slower copper-based connection to local street cabinets, before the fibre optic network takes over. Full-fibre broadband uses fibre to the premises (FTTP) technology, which is widely regarded as the best way to deliver fast internet services. Here, the fast-fibre optic cables run directly to homes and offices, providing a more stable, efficient and reliable connection than the hybrid copper and fibre systems. They can also support broadband speeds of up to 1Gbps, enough to download an HD TV programme in five seconds. ""How we live and work today is directly affected by how good our broadband connection is,"" said Andrew Jones, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, in a statement. Faster, more reliable connections would create jobs, help new industries to emerge and let people work more flexibly, he said. Some remote homes have struggled to get decent broadband connections Possible uses of full-fibre broadband would include hospitals sharing high-definition images to aid diagnosis, or schools using video more effectively during lessons. However, broadband market analysts have pointed out that gigabit-capable cables would be shared with many different premises, suggesting that actual data download speeds would be much lower than the theoretical maximum. The gigabit speeds that are possible with full-fibre are much faster than the 10 megabits per second (mbps) which the regulator Ofcom says modern families need to meet their requirements. Last month, the government published,externalinformation about the work being done on its broadband delivery programme, which aims to improve download speeds across the UK. It claimed that 93% of premises in the UK can now get superfast broadband services, which run at speeds of about 24mbps. Cash for the gigabit-speed broadband pilots comes from a Â£200m fund announced in the budget earlier this year. The government said it aimed to spend the remaining balance of the fund by the end of 2021.

North Korea nuclear test - latest updates,"North Korea claims ""perfect success"" in hydrogen bomb test State TV says device can be loaded onto a missile South Korean leader Moon calls for ""strongest response"" Japan confirms North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test North Korea's biggest test yet caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake Alastair Lawson and Vicky Baker We're pausing our live page coverage for now. You can continue to follow the main developmentsin our story here.The key points so far are as follows:  US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told BBC HARDtalk on Saturday that an American first military strike against North Korea is ""inevitable"" if something does not change. Mr Graham was speaking to programme host Stephen Sackur at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy, just hours before North Korea's new claim of a successful hydrogen bomb test. ""I am 100% certain that if Kim Jong-un continues to develop missile technology that can hit America, if diplomacy fails to stop him, there will be an attack by the US against his weapon system. I'm assuming the worst, I'm assuming we drop one bomb, he fires at South Korea and maybe Japan. Let me tell you how the war ends: it ends with his utter destruction. Thousands of people could be killed or maimed. ""There's a lot at stake here. Let me ask you: why would the world allow him [Kim Jong-un] to get a hydrogen bomb with a missile to deliver it anywhere in the world? Why would we do that?"" Japan will work with the US and others to implement existing stringent UN Security Council sanctions resolutions on North Korea, in addition to pursuing the adoption of a new, stricter resolution, says Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, according toKyodo News,external. Mr Suga - the government's top spokesman - said that imposing restrictions on North Korea's trade in crude oil and oil products is ""one of the options"" Japan might seek. But he said it would require the agreement of China and Russia, the permanent members of the Security Council with economic ties to Pyongyang.    The executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation, Lassina Zerbo (above), says that it is up to the international community to decide its response to the latest North Korean test, but that the current range of sanctions did not appear to be working:

""The [UN] Security Council has dealt with many sanctions and the sanctions seem to not be stopping [North Korea] from going beyond the acceptable in terms of their nuclear weapons programme. 

""'Where do we go?' is probably the million-dollar question, but I think many of the states today in their remarks have urged a political and diplomatic solution to this problem."" Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have agreed to stick to their goal of the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua. They agreed ""to keep close communication and co-ordination to deal with the new situation"" and ""appropriately deal with"" the latest nuclear test, the agency said. China and Russia have already voiced strong criticism against the latest nuclear test.  US-based security expert Vikram Singh tweets: Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken about North Korea's test, describing it as ""reckless and posing ""an unacceptable further threat to the international community"". She added: ""I discussed the serious and grave threat these dangerous and illegal actions present with President Abe in Japan this week and reiterate the call we jointly made for tougher action, including increasing the pace of implementation of existing sanctions and looking urgently in the UN Security Council at new measures. ""This is now even more pressing. The international community has universally condemned this test and must come together to continue to increase the pressure on North Korea's leaders to stop their destabilising actions."" North Koreans gathered in front of a large screen outside Pyongyang Station and applauded as state television broadcast a special announcement confirming the hydrogen bomb test. Speaking on North Korean TV, Shin Seok Chol said: ""I feel great pride in how much our nuclear warheads have advanced in their precision. We can now perfectly rely on our operational ability, and it is astonishing how greatly our nuclear weapons technology has progressed."" Another man, Jang Guk Hwan, said he was ""cheering with pride and honour to call myself part of the people of our great and respected leader, Kim Jong-un's nation"". BBC China Correspondent tweets...

""We will work with our allies. We will work with China. But people need to cut off North Korea economically, this is unacceptable behaviour."" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is reported to be drafting a new sanctions package on North Korea to give to President Trump. He tells Fox News that will ask the president to ""strongly to consider"" cutting off all trade and impose new sanctions. Chinese people felt the ground tremble, but the government is more like to be shaking with anger. President Trump and his national security team will have a meeting later on Sunday to discuss North Korea's latest nuclear test, a White House statement says. As news of the latest nuclear test reverberated around the world, life on the border between North and South Korea continued as normal. South Korean tanks continued their military exercises in Paju, close to the border with the north. Elsewhere in Paju, people continued to look at North Korean positions from viewpoints. There was no unusual activity to be seen at North Korean guard posts viewed from Paju. North Korea is the only country that has performed a nuclear test in the 21st Century,The Washington Post says,external. The paper points out that most nuclear powers - including the US and Russia which between them possess 93% of global nuclear warheads - have not performed a nuclear test in decades.  The apparent hydrogen bomb that North Korea is believed to have detonated underground on Sunday has been estimated at 100 kilotons. This is five times more powerful than Fat Boy, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki by the US in 1945 and which killed 70,000 people instantly. But how does it compare withthe other big bombs exploded on Earth?  Regardless of whether it was actually a hydrogen bomb, the explosion was big enough to âpretty much end an American cityâ if strapped on an ICBM, Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologytells Bloomberg,external. Abdul Qadeer Khan,
the Pakistani scientist accused of selling nuclear secrets to
North Korea, Iran and Libya, has said he is ânot surprisedâ with Pyongyangâs
sixth nuclear test, Japanese news agency Kyodoreports. Mr Khan, who
is described as the architect of Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme, has
urged Western countries, as well as Japan and South Korea, to stop their
""nasty threats and rhetoric"" towards Pyongyang. President Trump's tweet attacking South Korea's ""talk of appeasing"" North Korea is coming in for some criticism. Some observers say his stance may be related to a threat to pull the US out of a trade deal with South Korea. On Saturday reports said Mr Trump had asked aides to prepare for US withdrawal. In July the UStold South Koreait wanted to renegotiate a 2012 trade deal, citing a lopsided trading relationship. In July South Korea proposed holdingmilitary talks with the North, after weeks of heightened tension following a long-range missile test by Pyongyang. Joshua Pollack, associate fellow at defence and security think tank RUSI, said the two were linked. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US condemns 'hostile' North Korea test,"This video can not be played Any US response would be ""effective and overwhelming"" - James Mattis Pentagon chief James Mattis says any threat to the US or its allies by North Korea will be met with a ""massive military response"". His comments came after a national security briefing with President Donald Trump about the secretive communist state's latest nuclear test. Pyongyang says it has successfully trialled a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. The move has drawn international condemnation. North Korea has defied UN sanctions and international pressure by developing nuclear weapons and test missiles that could potentially reach the US. How should Trump handle North Korea? What are the military options? N Korea: China's 'nightmare neighbour'? The most powerful nuclear blasts ever But speaking to reporters outside the White House, Defence Secretary Mattis said the US had the ability to defend itself and its allies South Korea and Japan, adding that its commitments were ""ironclad"". ""Any threat to the United States or its territories - including Guam - or our allies will be met with a massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming."" This video can not be played Nuclear N Korea: What do we know? However, he said the hope was for denuclearisation, ""because we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea"". The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss an international response,according to the US mission.,external Meanwhile, President Trump has warned that America may stop trading with any country that does business with the North. The first suggestion that this was to be a far from normal Sunday in the region came when seismologists' equipment started picking up readings of an earth tremor in the area where North Korea has conducted nuclear tests before. The US Geological Survey put the tremor at 6.3 magnitude. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said there was no doubt this was North Korea's sixth nuclear test, calling it ""unforgivable"". Then North Korean state media confirmed this was no earthquake. It claimed the country had conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, detonating a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded onto a long-range missile. This video can not be played North Korean state media announces ""hydrogen bomb"" test North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured with what state media said was a new type of hydrogen bomb. Hydrogen bombs are many times more powerful than an atomic bomb. They use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash huge amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. Analysts say the North's claims should be treated with caution, but that its nuclear capability is clearly advancing. Officials in China, where the blast was felt as a tremor, said they were carrying out emergency radiation testing along the border with North Korea. Denouncing the test as""hostile"" and ""dangerous"",external, President Trump described the North as a ""rogue nation"" which had become a ""great threat and embarrassment"" to China - Pyongyang's main ally. He also said South Korea's ""talk of appeasement"" was not working and that the secretive communist state ""only understands one thing"". ""The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,"" Mr Trump later said in a tweet. North Korea relies on China for about 90% of its foreign trade. Kim inspects 'nuclear warhead': A picture decoded 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues State media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb South Korean President Moon Jae-in called for the ""strongest possible"" response, including new UN Security Council sanctions to ""completely isolate"" the country. The country staged a ""live-fire exercise"" late on Sunday simulating an attack on the North's Punggye-ri nuclear site, military officials said. The drill saw a Hyunmoo surface-to-surface missile and air-to-ground missiles fired from F-15K jets hit targets in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff quoted by Yonhap news agency. China, meanwhile, also expressed ""strong condemnation"" and said the state ""had ignored the international community's widespread opposition"". Russia urged all sides involved to hold talks, saying this was the only way to resolve the Korean peninsula's problems. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the ""reckless"" new test represented an ""unacceptable further threat to the international community"". She called on world leaders to come together to stop North Korea's ""destabilising actions"". South Korean officials said the latest test took place in Kilju County, where the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site is situated. The ""artificial quake"" was 9.8 times more powerful than the tremor from the North's fifth test in September 2016, the state weather agency said. Although experts urged caution, this does appear to be the biggest and most successful nuclear test by North Korea to date - and the messaging is clear. North Korea wants to demonstrate it knows what makes a credible nuclear warhead. Nuclear weapons expert Catherine Dill told the BBC it was not yet clear exactly what nuclear weapon design was tested. ""But based on the seismic signature, the yield of this test definitely is an order of magnitude higher than the yields of the previous tests."" Current information did not definitively indicate that a thermonuclear weapon had been tested ""but it appears to be a likely possibility at this point"", she said By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent North Korea's sixth nuclear test - probably its largest so far - sends out one clear political signal. Despite the bluster and threats from the Trump administration in Washington and near-universal condemnation from around the world, Pyongyang is not going to halt or constrain its nuclear activities. Worryingly, it also suggests that this is a programme that is progressing on all fronts at a faster rate than many had expected. So far all efforts to pressure North Korea - sanctions, isolation and military threats - have all failed to move Pyongyang. Could more be done? Certainly, but the harshest economic pressure would potentially cripple the regime and push it towards catastrophe - something China is unwilling to countenance. Containment and deterrence will now come to the fore as the world adjusts its policy from seeking to roll-back Pyongyang's weapons programme to living with a nuclear-armed North Korea.

North Korea hails 'perfect' H-bomb test,"This video can not be played North Korean state media announces ""hydrogen bomb"" test North Korea says it has successfully tested a nuclear weapon that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. The secretive communist state said its sixth nuclear test was a ""perfect success"", hours after seismologists had detected an earth tremor. Pyongyang said it had tested a hydrogen bomb - a device many times more powerful than an atomic bomb. Analysts say the claims should be treated with caution, but its nuclear capability is clearly advancing. North Korea last carried out a nuclear test in September 2016. It has defied UN sanctions and international pressure to develop nuclear weapons and to test missiles which could potentially reach the mainland US.

The ""artificial quake"" was 9.8 times more powerful than the tremor from the North's fifth test, the state weather agency said. Latest updates on the nuclear test It came hours after Pyongyang said it had miniaturised a hydrogen bomb for use on a long-range missile, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured with what state media said was a new type of hydrogen bomb. State media said the device could be loaded on to a ballistic missile. A series of recent missile tests has caused growing international unease. In a report on Sunday, the North's state news agency KCNA said Kim Jong-un had visited scientists at the nuclear weapons institute and ""guided the work for nuclear weaponisation"". The news came hours after state media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb The North has previously claimed to have miniaturised a nuclear weapon, but experts have cast doubt on this.

Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said sanctions against North Korea should include restrictions on the trade of oil products. Russia meanwhile said the test defied international law and urged all sides involved to hold talks, saying this was the only way to resolve the Korean peninsula's problems. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, described the test as ""an extremely regrettable act"".

'Full fibre' broadband locations named,"At present, many UK properties offered fibre connections still rely on copper cables for the ""last leg"" of the journey Six areas in the UK will soon be trying out broadband technology that provides data at speeds approaching one gigabit per second (gbps). Businesses, schools and hospitals will be the first to try out the ""full-fibre"" network technology. The pilots will be run in Aberdeenshire, West Sussex, Coventry and Warwickshire, Bristol, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. The government will spend about Â£10m getting the pilots up and running. The technology involved is known as full-fibre because it takes high-speed cables directly to premises. By contrast, much of the existing fibre services in the UK connect the fast cables to roadside cabinets and then rely on older, slower copper for the final link to homes and other buildings. Currently full-fibre networks are only available to about 2% of premises in the UK. The government hopes that the projects will significantly boost the availability of the technology. The preferred technology of Openreach, the body that runs much of the UK's fibre network, has to date been fibre to the cabinet. That means that homes and businesses are connected by a slower copper-based connection to local street cabinets, before the fibre optic network takes over. Full-fibre broadband uses fibre to the premises (FTTP) technology, which is widely regarded as the best way to deliver fast internet services. Here, the fast-fibre optic cables run directly to homes and offices, providing a more stable, efficient and reliable connection than the hybrid copper and fibre systems. They can also support broadband speeds of up to 1Gbps, enough to download an HD TV programme in five seconds. ""How we live and work today is directly affected by how good our broadband connection is,"" said Andrew Jones, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, in a statement. Faster, more reliable connections would create jobs, help new industries to emerge and let people work more flexibly, he said. Some remote homes have struggled to get decent broadband connections Possible uses of full-fibre broadband would include hospitals sharing high-definition images to aid diagnosis, or schools using video more effectively during lessons. However, broadband market analysts have pointed out that gigabit-capable cables would be shared with many different premises, suggesting that actual data download speeds would be much lower than the theoretical maximum. The gigabit speeds that are possible with full-fibre are much faster than the 10 megabits per second (mbps) which the regulator Ofcom says modern families need to meet their requirements. Last month, the government published,externalinformation about the work being done on its broadband delivery programme, which aims to improve download speeds across the UK. It claimed that 93% of premises in the UK can now get superfast broadband services, which run at speeds of about 24mbps. Cash for the gigabit-speed broadband pilots comes from a Â£200m fund announced in the budget earlier this year. The government said it aimed to spend the remaining balance of the fund by the end of 2021.

How the demand for sand is killing rivers,"You cannot have concrete without sand. River beds are being dug up across Africa to fuel a building boom, with little thought for what this means for the health of the river, and those who depend on it, as Harriet Constable found in Kenya. Sand. The word conjures happy holiday memories: building castles from it; watching nervous crabs scuttle across it; digging giant holes in it, and then hiding in them and leaping out at opportune moments to terrify unknowing relatives. Sand is the make up of glittering beaches, hundreds of thousands of years of weathering to create millions and millions of tiny, sparkling, and yet seemingly insignificant particles. Sand is infinite, surely. And yet the world is running out. A beach in Tiwi, along Kenya's coast, where sand dredging has caused the beach to subside and start to disappear - it's a key nesting ground for sea turtles It's obvious when you think about it. All the major building materials - concrete, bricks, glass, are made using sand. Exploding population numbers and the knock on need for development have made sand the second most used natural commodity on the planet after water. Billions and billions of tonnes are being used across the globe. So much so that a UN report estimated global sand use in 2012 alone could have created a concrete wall 27m high by 27m wide around the equator. We need not go to the beach to be surrounded by sand - our cities are essentially giant towering sand castles disguised in concrete. A sand dredger just beyond the reef in Tiwi kicks up giants plumes of sand in the ocean - it settles over coral, suffocates fish, and muddies the waters for sea turtles who feed on the seagrass at the bottom The sand used for construction comes mainly from riverbeds and oceans. Desert sand, it turns out, is too smooth for the mix. Huge projects quickly exhausted Dubai's marine sand supply, so, despite being a city built on sand, it now imports the material from Australia. The irony: sand has become such a precious commodity it is literally being sold to the Arabs. Innocent as sand may seem, the immense demand for it is causing loss of livelihoods, loss of ecosystems and even deaths. In India, a black market for sand harvesting has emerged, operated by violent sand mafias. In China, the country's biggest freshwater lake - Poyang Lake - is drying up due to sand dredging. Hundreds of locals rely on the lake for fish, as do the millions of migratory birds that stop here each year. In Kenya, sand dredging from the riverbeds of poor rural counties like Makueni is leaving some communities without access to water. During the rainy season, water percolates into the sand and is stored underground - then during the dry season, locals dig small wells in the sand to get water From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Saturdays at 11:30 BST With the country's population expected to double in the next 40 years, massive infrastructure projects like Kenya's new Standard Gauge Railway are necessary.  But they need millions of tonnes of sand. Kenya's coast and inland rivers have all been exploited in recent years, but the effect in Makueni has been particularly acute. Kenya's new Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) spans 609km from Mombasa to Nairobi, and its construction requires millions of tonnes of sand Throughout the year, temperatures in Makueni soar to over 35C (95F). Seasonal, sand-filled rivers snake their way through the arid land. During the rainy season, water percolates through and is stored underneath. During the dry season, the population of nearly one million people dig holes in the sand to extract water to survive. However, when enough sand is harvested, only the bedrock remains, and during the rainy season the water simply rushes across it. No water is stored. Anthony Mua Kimeu stares at the steep cliffs of the Kilome Ikolya ""dead"" River I visited several sand harvesting sites across the county earlier this year. ""We call this the dead river,"" a local called Anthony told me, staring over the steep, reddish-brown cliff edge into the barren riverbed at Kilome Ikolya River in Makueni. A couple of years ago this river was flat. Now, there is sheer drop of about 10m from the top of the bank to the riverbed. Tree roots jut out awkwardly from the cliff face, and along the dry, meandering river, bedrock sticks out of the ground, glistening in the sunshine. ""No-one can get water here now,"" Anthony said. ""No-one can get water here now,"" says Anthony, a farmer For some, sand is life, and for others, sand is money. In a poor area with few employment opportunities, the reality of what desperate humans will do is stark. Local Police Officer Geoffrey Kasyoki was well known in his community for trying to stop illegal sand harvesting in Makueni. In February 2011 he was set upon by a group of young men in broad daylight. They shot him with poisoned arrows, crushed his head and slashed his skin. Irene Nduku Kasyoki holds up a portrait of her late husband Geoffrey, a police officer who died trying to defend his community's sand Standing over her husband's grave, his widow Irene told me, ""He was killed to send a message to the community from the sand harvesters: do not try to stop us"". Her chest heaved in and out, shuddering with sobs, and she reached out to touch the sandy mound of earth under which he is buried. As Anthony and I walked further along the riverbed, we came across harvesters labouring under the baking midday sun, shovelling sand into a pile ready for a truck to collect it. Harvester Richard Mutinda shovels sand into a big pile to be collected by trucks later - up to 100 tonnes of sand is taken from this stretch of the Nthange River daily While I watched and wondered whether sand could soon become the stuff of distant childhood memories, others around me had more pressing concerns. For them, sand could mean the difference between eating and going hungry, whether they'd have drinking water or not, or whether they'd ever see their loved ones again.

Buying and selling maids online,"Migrant labour in Gulf countries has long been a subject of controversy, and the system that regulates it has now spawned a black market for domestic servants who are bought and sold online. BBC Trending has discovered that dozens of private Facebook groups are being used to circumvent local laws and regulations. Messages like these appeared recently on a Facebook group that matches maids to potential employers: ""Am looking for a maid who is on visit/tourist visa to work as a live in maid."" ""Urgently need a maid even for monthly basis 1 month or 2, 3 months till I travel in December"" ""Looking for live in maid Indian/Philippino to take care of 2 month old baby"" Although group moderators warn participants against breaking the law, the messages are a window into a black market that's developing online and which has resulted in investigations and prosecutions in Saudi Arabia. BBC Trending on Facebook,external In Saudi Arabia, as in many Gulf countries, workers from Asian and African countries can obtain visas under sponsorship system known as ""kafala"". The system ties immigrants, who often work as live-in maids, to their employers for the duration of their stay. Most of the working arrangements are done through official recruitment agencies, but the black market that has developed on social media has allowed some employees and workers to circumvent the system. ""The main reason social media recruitment is attractive to employers is going through a recruitment agency can be very expensive,"" says Vani Saraswathi of Migrant Rights, an advocacy group based in the region. ""For a contract period, you have to pay anything from $2,500 to $5,000 (Â£2,000 to Â£4,000)... if you go through social media, you don't have to pay any of this."" Qatar ends 'kafala' labour system Indian workerâs tearful plea to leave Saudi Arabia Migrant workers rounded up in Saudi Employees can potentially benefit as well - one Saudi activist and campaigner told BBC Trending that maids can potentially double their salaries if they find employers illegally online. Black market employers, freed from those expensive agency fees, can afford to offer their workers a higher rate of pay. ""Unfortunately social media made it really harder for working families to obtain help lawfully,"" says Nawal Al Hausawi. She says that she has previously hired maids through legal channels. ""Once [a worker] enters the country legally that she will make twice as much if she breaks the contract and uses social media to find another family."" There are dozens of Facebook groups online with thousands of members putting women looking for work as maids in touch with potential employers in the Gulf - although not all of them are facilitating illegal employment. And the kafala system itself has come under intense criticism for tying workers to abusive employers and other scandals. Human rights groups say the system gives workers very little protection against mistreatment. Gulf countries have been promising to bring in labour reforms. Last month, Qatar adopted a new law giving workers new rights including at least one day off a week and paid annual leave. Activists say the bigger challenge is implementing these new guidelines, getting rid of loopholes and adding more provisions so that new laws meet international standards. One maid told Trending that domestic workers will often run away, and look for illegal employment, because of delayed pay, physical and emotional abuse and poor working conditions, and that maids were well aware of the market being facilitated by social media. ""Now, when you go tell somebody 'I'm looking for work', legally or illegally, the person will post your number on these [Facebook] pages,"" said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to jeopardise her work status. ""That's how you can get work through social mediaâ¦ But that's illegal."" Khaled Aba Alkhail, a spokesman for the Ministry of Labour Affairs in Saudi Arabia says that the country is aware of the problem and will prosecute anyone who in effect runs illegal recruitment agencies using social media platforms. He says that in the last few months, the labour ministry investigated 90 adverts on social media and that a number of individuals involved have been prosecuted.

North Korea 'nuclear test' - latest updates,"North Korea claims ""perfect success"" in hydrogen bomb test State TV says device can be loaded onto a missile South Korean leader Moon calls for ""strongest response"" Japan confirms North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test North Korea's biggest test yet caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake Alastair Lawson and Vicky Baker We're pausing our live page coverage for now. You can continue to follow the main developmentsin our story here.The key points so far are as follows:  US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told BBC HARDtalk on Saturday that an American first military strike against North Korea is ""inevitable"" if something does not change. Mr Graham was speaking to programme host Stephen Sackur at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy, just hours before North Korea's new claim of a successful hydrogen bomb test. ""I am 100% certain that if Kim Jong-un continues to develop missile technology that can hit America, if diplomacy fails to stop him, there will be an attack by the US against his weapon system. I'm assuming the worst, I'm assuming we drop one bomb, he fires at South Korea and maybe Japan. Let me tell you how the war ends: it ends with his utter destruction. Thousands of people could be killed or maimed. ""There's a lot at stake here. Let me ask you: why would the world allow him [Kim Jong-un] to get a hydrogen bomb with a missile to deliver it anywhere in the world? Why would we do that?"" Japan will work with the US and others to implement existing stringent UN Security Council sanctions resolutions on North Korea, in addition to pursuing the adoption of a new, stricter resolution, says Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, according toKyodo News,external. Mr Suga - the government's top spokesman - said that imposing restrictions on North Korea's trade in crude oil and oil products is ""one of the options"" Japan might seek. But he said it would require the agreement of China and Russia, the permanent members of the Security Council with economic ties to Pyongyang.    The executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation, Lassina Zerbo (above), says that it is up to the international community to decide its response to the latest North Korean test, but that the current range of sanctions did not appear to be working:

""The [UN] Security Council has dealt with many sanctions and the sanctions seem to not be stopping [North Korea] from going beyond the acceptable in terms of their nuclear weapons programme. 

""'Where do we go?' is probably the million-dollar question, but I think many of the states today in their remarks have urged a political and diplomatic solution to this problem."" Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have agreed to stick to their goal of the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua. They agreed ""to keep close communication and co-ordination to deal with the new situation"" and ""appropriately deal with"" the latest nuclear test, the agency said. China and Russia have already voiced strong criticism against the latest nuclear test.  US-based security expert Vikram Singh tweets: Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken about North Korea's test, describing it as ""reckless and posing ""an unacceptable further threat to the international community"". She added: ""I discussed the serious and grave threat these dangerous and illegal actions present with President Abe in Japan this week and reiterate the call we jointly made for tougher action, including increasing the pace of implementation of existing sanctions and looking urgently in the UN Security Council at new measures. ""This is now even more pressing. The international community has universally condemned this test and must come together to continue to increase the pressure on North Korea's leaders to stop their destabilising actions."" North Koreans gathered in front of a large screen outside Pyongyang Station and applauded as state television broadcast a special announcement confirming the hydrogen bomb test. Speaking on North Korean TV, Shin Seok Chol said: ""I feel great pride in how much our nuclear warheads have advanced in their precision. We can now perfectly rely on our operational ability, and it is astonishing how greatly our nuclear weapons technology has progressed."" Another man, Jang Guk Hwan, said he was ""cheering with pride and honour to call myself part of the people of our great and respected leader, Kim Jong-un's nation"". BBC China Correspondent tweets...

""I'm going to draft a sanctions package and send it to the president for his strong consideration so anybody (who) wants to do trade or business with them will be prevented from doing trade or business with us,"" Treasury Secretary Mnuchin tells Fox News. ""We will work with our allies. We will work with China. But people need to cut off North Korea economically, this is unacceptable behaviour."" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is reported to be drafting a new sanctions package on North Korea to give to President Trump. He tells Fox News that will ask the president to ""strongly to consider"" cutting off all trade and impose new sanctions. Chinese people felt the ground tremble, but the government is more like to be shaking with anger. President Trump and his national security team will have a meeting later on Sunday to discuss North Korea's latest nuclear test, a White House statement says. As news of the latest nuclear test reverberated around the world, life on the border between North and South Korea continued as normal. South Korean tanks continued their military exercises in Paju, close to the border with the north. Elsewhere in Paju, people continued to look at North Korean positions from viewpoints. There was no unusual activity to be seen at North Korean guard posts viewed from Paju. North Korea is the only country that has performed a nuclear test in the 21st Century,The Washington Post says,external. The paper points out that most nuclear powers - including the US and Russia which between them possess 93% of global nuclear warheads - have not performed a nuclear test in decades.  The apparent hydrogen bomb that North Korea is believed to have detonated underground on Sunday has been estimated at 100 kilotons. This is five times more powerful than Fat Boy, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki by the US in 1945 and which killed 70,000 people instantly. But how does it compare withthe other big bombs exploded on Earth?  Regardless of whether it was actually a hydrogen bomb, the explosion was big enough to âpretty much end an American cityâ if strapped on an ICBM, Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologytells Bloomberg,external. Abdul Qadeer Khan,
the Pakistani scientist accused of selling nuclear secrets to
North Korea, Iran and Libya, has said he is ânot surprisedâ with Pyongyangâs
sixth nuclear test, Japanese news agency Kyodoreports. Mr Khan, who
is described as the architect of Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme, has
urged Western countries, as well as Japan and South Korea, to stop their
""nasty threats and rhetoric"" towards Pyongyang. President Trump's tweet attacking South Korea's ""talk of appeasing"" North Korea is coming in for some criticism. Some observers say his stance may be related to a threat to pull the US out of a trade deal with South Korea. On Saturday reports said Mr Trump had asked aides to prepare for US withdrawal. In July the UStold South Koreait wanted to renegotiate a 2012 trade deal, citing a lopsided trading relationship. In July South Korea proposed holdingmilitary talks with the North, after weeks of heightened tension following a long-range missile test by Pyongyang. Joshua Pollack, associate fellow at defence and security think tank RUSI, said the two were linked. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"North Korea hails ""perfect"" H-bomb test","This video can not be played North Korean state media announces ""hydrogen bomb"" test North Korea says it has successfully tested a nuclear weapon that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. The secretive communist state said its sixth nuclear test was a ""perfect success"", hours after seismologists had detected an earth tremor. Pyongyang said it had tested a hydrogen bomb - a device many times more powerful than an atomic bomb. Analysts say the claims should be treated with caution, but its nuclear capability is clearly advancing. North Korea last carried out a nuclear test in September 2016. It has defied UN sanctions and international pressure to develop nuclear weapons and to test missiles which could potentially reach the mainland US. South Korean officials said the latest test took place in Kilju County, where the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site is situated. The ""artificial quake"" was 9.8 times more powerful than the tremor from the North's fifth test, the state weather agency said. Latest updates on the nuclear test It came hours after Pyongyang said it had miniaturised a hydrogen bomb for use on a long-range missile, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured with what state media said was a new type of hydrogen bomb. State media said the device could be loaded on to a ballistic missile. A series of recent missile tests has caused growing international unease. In a report on Sunday, the North's state news agency KCNA said Kim Jong-un had visited scientists at the nuclear weapons institute and ""guided the work for nuclear weaponisation"". The news came hours after state media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb The North has previously claimed to have miniaturised a nuclear weapon, but experts have cast doubt on this. There is also scepticism about the North's claims to have developed a hydrogen bomb. However, this does appears to be the biggest and most successful nuclear test by North Korea to date - and the messaging is clear. North Korea wants to demonstrate it knows what makes a credible nuclear warhead. Kim inspects 'nuclear warhead': A picture decoded 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues Nuclear weapons expert Catherine Dill told the BBC it was not yet clear exactly what nuclear weapon design was tested. ""But based on the seismic signature, the yield of this test definitely is an order of magnitude higher than the yields of the previous tests."" Current information did not definitively indicate that a thermonuclear weapon had been tested ""but it appears to be a likely possibility at this point"", she said. Hydrogen bombs use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash huge amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said North Korea's sixth nuclear test should be met with the ""strongest possible"" response, including new United Nations Security Council sanctions to ""completely isolate"" the country. China, North Korea's only major ally, condemned the test. North Korea ""has ignored the international community's widespread opposition, again carrying out a nuclear test. China's government expresses resolute opposition and strong condemnation toward this,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said sanctions against North Korea should include restrictions on the trade of oil products. Russia meanwhile said the test defied international law and urged all sides involved to hold talks, saying this was the only way to resolve the Korean peninsula's problems. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, described the test as ""an extremely regrettable act"". Yukiya Amano added: ""This new test, which follows the two tests last year and is the sixth since 2006, is in complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community."" Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent North Korea's sixth nuclear test - probably its largest so far - sends out one clear political signal. Despite the bluster and threats from the Trump administration in Washington and near-universal condemnation from around the world, Pyongyang is not going to halt or constrain its nuclear activities. Worryingly, it also suggests that this is a programme that is progressing on all fronts at a faster rate than many had expected. So far all efforts to pressure North Korea - sanctions, isolation, and military threats - have all failed to move Pyongyang. Could more be done? Certainly, but the harshest economic pressure would potentially cripple the regime and push it towards catastrophe - something China is unwilling to countenance. Containment and deterrence will now come to the fore as the world adjusts its policy from seeking to roll-back Pyongyang's weapons programme to living with a nuclear-armed North Korea. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? The first suggestion that this was to be a far from normal Sunday in the region came when seismologists' equipment started picking up readings of an earth tremor in the area where North Korea has conducted nuclear tests before. Initial reports from the US Geological Survey put the tremor at 5.6 magnitude with a depth of 10km (six miles) but this was later upgraded to 6.3 magnitude at 0km. The USGS put the site of the quake near the Punggye-ri test site Then Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said there was no doubt this was North Korea's sixth nuclear test. Finally, in a radio broadcast that had been trailed as a ""major announcement"", North Korean state media confirmed this was no earthquake. Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai North Korea's sixth nuclear weapons test is an utter rejection of all that its only ally has called for. Beijing's response was predictable: condemnation, urging an end to provocation and dialogue. But it also spoke of urging North Korea to ""face up to the firm will"" of the international community to see denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. There is no sign though that China is willing yet to see that firm will go beyond UN sanctions, which recently clamped down on seafood and iron ore exports, in addition to the coal and minerals that are already banned from crossing the border. It is noteworthy also that this test took place just as the Chinese president was about to welcome a handful of world leaders to the two-day showpiece Brics summit on China's east coast. Even the state-controlled media will find it hard to ignore the fact that their man has been upstaged - embarrassed too - by its almost universally ostracised ally and neighbour.

PM appeals to backbench Tories over Brexit,"Theresa May has appealed for unity from pro-EU Conservative MPs as the Commons is set to debate the government's Brexit repeal bill on Thursday. The bill, seen as a key plank of the government's Brexit policy, transfers EU law into UK legislation Mrs May has said there will be proper scrutiny, but some MPs fear it will give ministers sweeping new powers. Brexit Secretary David Davis said this was ""nonsense"" and all Tories should back it as it ensured ""continuity"". Labour has said that while it backs the principle of the bill, it will not give the government a ""blank cheque to pass powers into the hands of ministers"". First Secretary of State Damian Green warned that if Tory MPs backed Labour attempts to amend the bill it would increase ""the threat of a Corbyn government"". Brexit: All you need to to know Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? The prime minister said the legislation, known officially as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, was ""the single most important step we can take to prevent a cliff-edge for people and businesses"". She said the bill delivered the result of last year's EU referendum, adding that ""now it is time for Parliament to play its part"". Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the draft legislation is a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy The first line of the bill says the European Communities Act 1972, which took Britain into the EU, will be ""repealed on exit day"" This will end the supremacy of EU law and stop the flow of new regulations from Brussels But all existing laws derived from the EU will continue to be in force - they can be changed or scrapped by further legislation The bill does not detail policies line-by-line but transfers all regulations into domestic law It gives the UK two years after Brexit to correct any ""deficiencies"" arising from the transfer Repeal bill: All you need to know Mrs May added: ""We have made time for proper parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit legislation and welcome the contributions of MPs from across the house."" In an article in the Sunday Telegraph,external, the prime minister's de facto deputy Mr Green said that ""no Conservative wants a bad Brexit deal"", and a potential rebellion threatened to strengthen Labour's position. But former minister and RemainerAnna Soubry told the Observer,externalthat attempts to frustrate changes to the repeal bill would amount to ""a trouncing of democracy and people will not accept it"". She added that it was ""outrageous"" to suggest pro-EU Tories supported Jeremy Corbyn. The legislation is not supported by the Labour Party, which has requested changes in six areas, including guarantees that workers' rights will be protected. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the government's approach to the process was ""completely wrong"", as it was reserving the power for ministers to overhaul existing EU laws and regulations after Brexit without any Parliamentary scrutiny. ""This is not about frustrating the process, it is not giving government a blank cheque to pass powers into the hands of ministers,"" he told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show. ""You could entrench important EU rights on Monday and take them away on Tuesday without primary legislation."" At-a-glance guide to Brexit negotiations Brexit: Repeal bill 'not a blank cheque' But Mr Davis told the programme Labour knew the legislation was necessary to ensure an orderly Brexit and was acting cynically in an attempt to destabilise the government. Asked what his message to Tory MPs was, he said: ""Everything that is significant in terms of changes will be done in separate primary legislation, on immigration, customs you name it. ""This bill is about ensuring continuity. Every MP, whether leaver or remainer, should support this bill."" The Scottish and Welsh governments have also raised concerns about the repeal bill, with Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones describing it as a""naked power-grab"". Damian Green warned potential Tory rebels that voting against the repeal bill increased the threat of a Labour government Separately, Downing Street has rejected reports the prime minister is preparing to approve a Â£50bn financial settlement with the EU after the Conservative Party conference in October. According to the Sunday Times,external, a close ally of Mrs May said her negotiating position with Brussels had been weakened because of June's election result, in which the Conservatives lost the Commons majority they had won in 2015. A spokesman for No 10 said the claims were ""not true"". Britain's divorce bill with the EU has been frustrating talks with negotiators in Brussels. During the third set of talks between the UK and the EU, Europe's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Mr Davis needed to ""start negotiating seriously"". What happens now that a deal's been done?

N Korea 'nuclear test' - latest updates,"North Korea claims ""perfect success"" in hydrogen bomb test State TV says device can be loaded onto a missile South Korean leader Moon calls for ""strongest response"" Japan confirms North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test North Korea's biggest test yet caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake Alastair Lawson and Vicky Baker We're pausing our live page coverage for now. You can continue to follow the main developmentsin our story here.The key points so far are as follows:  US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told BBC HARDtalk on Saturday that an American first military strike against North Korea is ""inevitable"" if something does not change. Mr Graham was speaking to programme host Stephen Sackur at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy, just hours before North Korea's new claim of a successful hydrogen bomb test. ""I am 100% certain that if Kim Jong-un continues to develop missile technology that can hit America, if diplomacy fails to stop him, there will be an attack by the US against his weapon system. I'm assuming the worst, I'm assuming we drop one bomb, he fires at South Korea and maybe Japan. Let me tell you how the war ends: it ends with his utter destruction. Thousands of people could be killed or maimed. ""There's a lot at stake here. Let me ask you: why would the world allow him [Kim Jong-un] to get a hydrogen bomb with a missile to deliver it anywhere in the world? Why would we do that?"" Japan will work with the US and others to implement existing stringent UN Security Council sanctions resolutions on North Korea, in addition to pursuing the adoption of a new, stricter resolution, says Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, according toKyodo News,external. Mr Suga - the government's top spokesman - said that imposing restrictions on North Korea's trade in crude oil and oil products is ""one of the options"" Japan might seek. But he said it would require the agreement of China and Russia, the permanent members of the Security Council with economic ties to Pyongyang.    The executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation, Lassina Zerbo (above), says that it is up to the international community to decide its response to the latest North Korean test, but that the current range of sanctions did not appear to be working:

""The [UN] Security Council has dealt with many sanctions and the sanctions seem to not be stopping [North Korea] from going beyond the acceptable in terms of their nuclear weapons programme. 

""'Where do we go?' is probably the million-dollar question, but I think many of the states today in their remarks have urged a political and diplomatic solution to this problem."" Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have agreed to stick to their goal of the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua. They agreed ""to keep close communication and co-ordination to deal with the new situation"" and ""appropriately deal with"" the latest nuclear test, the agency said. China and Russia have already voiced strong criticism against the latest nuclear test.  US-based security expert Vikram Singh tweets: Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken about North Korea's test, describing it as ""reckless and posing ""an unacceptable further threat to the international community"". She added: ""I discussed the serious and grave threat these dangerous and illegal actions present with President Abe in Japan this week and reiterate the call we jointly made for tougher action, including increasing the pace of implementation of existing sanctions and looking urgently in the UN Security Council at new measures. ""This is now even more pressing. The international community has universally condemned this test and must come together to continue to increase the pressure on North Korea's leaders to stop their destabilising actions."" North Koreans gathered in front of a large screen outside Pyongyang Station and applauded as state television broadcast a special announcement confirming the hydrogen bomb test. Speaking on North Korean TV, Shin Seok Chol said: ""I feel great pride in how much our nuclear warheads have advanced in their precision. We can now perfectly rely on our operational ability, and it is astonishing how greatly our nuclear weapons technology has progressed."" Another man, Jang Guk Hwan, said he was ""cheering with pride and honour to call myself part of the people of our great and respected leader, Kim Jong-un's nation"". BBC China Correspondent tweets...

""We will work with our allies. We will work with China. But people need to cut off North Korea economically, this is unacceptable behaviour."" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is reported to be drafting a new sanctions package on North Korea to give to President Trump. He tells Fox News that will ask the president to ""strongly to consider"" cutting off all trade and impose new sanctions. Chinese people felt the ground tremble, but the government is more like to be shaking with anger. President Trump and his national security team will have a meeting later on Sunday to discuss North Korea's latest nuclear test, a White House statement says. As news of the latest nuclear test reverberated around the world, life on the border between North and South Korea continued as normal. South Korean tanks continued their military exercises in Paju, close to the border with the north. Elsewhere in Paju, people continued to look at North Korean positions from viewpoints. There was no unusual activity to be seen at North Korean guard posts viewed from Paju. North Korea is the only country that has performed a nuclear test in the 21st Century,The Washington Post says,external. The paper points out that most nuclear powers - including the US and Russia which between them possess 93% of global nuclear warheads - have not performed a nuclear test in decades.  The apparent hydrogen bomb that North Korea is believed to have detonated underground on Sunday has been estimated at 100 kilotons. This is five times more powerful than Fat Boy, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki by the US in 1945 and which killed 70,000 people instantly. But how does it compare withthe other big bombs exploded on Earth?  Regardless of whether it was actually a hydrogen bomb, the explosion was big enough to âpretty much end an American cityâ if strapped on an ICBM, Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologytells Bloomberg,external.

the Pakistani scientist accused of selling nuclear secrets to
North Korea, Iran and Libya, has said he is ânot surprisedâ with Pyongyangâs
sixth nuclear test, Japanese news agency Kyodoreports. Mr Khan, who
is described as the architect of Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme, has
urged Western countries, as well as Japan and South Korea, to stop their
""nasty threats and rhetoric"" towards Pyongyang. President Trump's tweet attacking South Korea's ""talk of appeasing"" North Korea is coming in for some criticism. Some observers say his stance may be related to a threat to pull the US out of a trade deal with South Korea. On Saturday reports said Mr Trump had asked aides to prepare for US withdrawal. In July the UStold South Koreait wanted to renegotiate a 2012 trade deal, citing a lopsided trading relationship.

North Korea tremor suggests nuclear test,"This video can not be played North Korean state media announces ""hydrogen bomb"" test North Korea says it has successfully tested a nuclear weapon that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. The secretive communist state said its sixth nuclear test was a ""perfect success"", hours after seismologists had detected an earth tremor. Pyongyang said it had tested a hydrogen bomb - a device many times more powerful than an atomic bomb. Analysts say the claims should be treated with caution, but its nuclear capability is clearly advancing. North Korea last carried out a nuclear test in September 2016. It has defied UN sanctions and international pressure to develop nuclear weapons and to test missiles which could potentially reach the mainland US. South Korean officials said the latest test took place in Kilju County, where the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site is situated. The ""artificial quake"" was 9.8 times more powerful than the tremor from the North's fifth test, the state weather agency said. Latest updates on the nuclear test It came hours after Pyongyang said it had miniaturised a hydrogen bomb for use on a long-range missile, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured with what state media said was a new type of hydrogen bomb. State media said the device could be loaded on to a ballistic missile. A series of recent missile tests has caused growing international unease. In a report on Sunday, the North's state news agency KCNA said Kim Jong-un had visited scientists at the nuclear weapons institute and ""guided the work for nuclear weaponisation"". The news came hours after state media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb The North has previously claimed to have miniaturised a nuclear weapon, but experts have cast doubt on this. There is also scepticism about the North's claims to have developed a hydrogen bomb. However, this does appears to be the biggest and most successful nuclear test by North Korea to date - and the messaging is clear. North Korea wants to demonstrate it knows what makes a credible nuclear warhead. Kim inspects 'nuclear warhead': A picture decoded 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues Nuclear weapons expert Catherine Dill told the BBC it was not yet clear exactly what nuclear weapon design was tested. ""But based on the seismic signature, the yield of this test definitely is an order of magnitude higher than the yields of the previous tests."" Current information did not definitively indicate that a thermonuclear weapon had been tested ""but it appears to be a likely possibility at this point"", she said. Hydrogen bombs use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash huge amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said North Korea's sixth nuclear test should be met with the ""strongest possible"" response, including new United Nations Security Council sanctions to ""completely isolate"" the country. China, North Korea's only major ally, condemned the test. North Korea ""has ignored the international community's widespread opposition, again carrying out a nuclear test. China's government expresses resolute opposition and strong condemnation toward this,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said sanctions against North Korea should include restrictions on the trade of oil products. Russia meanwhile said the test defied international law and urged all sides involved to hold talks, saying this was the only way to resolve the Korean peninsula's problems. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, described the test as ""an extremely regrettable act"". Yukiya Amano added: ""This new test, which follows the two tests last year and is the sixth since 2006, is in complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community."" Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent North Korea's sixth nuclear test - probably its largest so far - sends out one clear political signal. Despite the bluster and threats from the Trump administration in Washington and near-universal condemnation from around the world, Pyongyang is not going to halt or constrain its nuclear activities. Worryingly, it also suggests that this is a programme that is progressing on all fronts at a faster rate than many had expected. So far all efforts to pressure North Korea - sanctions, isolation, and military threats - have all failed to move Pyongyang. Could more be done? Certainly, but the harshest economic pressure would potentially cripple the regime and push it towards catastrophe - something China is unwilling to countenance. Containment and deterrence will now come to the fore as the world adjusts its policy from seeking to roll-back Pyongyang's weapons programme to living with a nuclear-armed North Korea. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? The first suggestion that this was to be a far from normal Sunday in the region came when seismologists' equipment started picking up readings of an earth tremor in the area where North Korea has conducted nuclear tests before. Initial reports from the US Geological Survey put the tremor at 5.6 magnitude with a depth of 10km (six miles) but this was later upgraded to 6.3 magnitude at 0km. The USGS put the site of the quake near the Punggye-ri test site Then Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said there was no doubt this was North Korea's sixth nuclear test. Finally, in a radio broadcast that had been trailed as a ""major announcement"", North Korean state media confirmed this was no earthquake. Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai North Korea's sixth nuclear weapons test is an utter rejection of all that its only ally has called for. Beijing's response was predictable: condemnation, urging an end to provocation and dialogue. But it also spoke of urging North Korea to ""face up to the firm will"" of the international community to see denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. There is no sign though that China is willing yet to see that firm will go beyond UN sanctions, which recently clamped down on seafood and iron ore exports, in addition to the coal and minerals that are already banned from crossing the border. It is noteworthy also that this test took place just as the Chinese president was about to welcome a handful of world leaders to the two-day showpiece Brics summit on China's east coast. Even the state-controlled media will find it hard to ignore the fact that their man has been upstaged - embarrassed too - by its almost universally ostracised ally and neighbour.

It has defied UN sanctions and international pressure to develop nuclear weapons and to test missiles which could potentially reach the mainland US. South Korean officials said the latest test took place in Kilju County, where the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site is situated. The ""artificial quake"" was 9.8 times more powerful than the tremor from the North's fifth test, the state weather agency said. Latest updates on the nuclear test It came hours after Pyongyang said it had miniaturised a hydrogen bomb for use on a long-range missile, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured with what state media said was a new type of hydrogen bomb. State media said the device could be loaded on to a ballistic missile. A series of recent missile tests has caused growing international unease. In a report on Sunday, the North's state news agency KCNA said Kim Jong-un had visited scientists at the nuclear weapons institute and ""guided the work for nuclear weaponisation"". The news came hours after state media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb The North has previously claimed to have miniaturised a nuclear weapon, but experts have cast doubt on this. There is also scepticism about the North's claims to have developed a hydrogen bomb. However, this does appears to be the biggest and most successful nuclear test by North Korea to date - and the messaging is clear. North Korea wants to demonstrate it knows what makes a credible nuclear warhead. Kim inspects 'nuclear warhead': A picture decoded 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues Nuclear weapons expert Catherine Dill told the BBC it was not yet clear exactly what nuclear weapon design was tested. ""But based on the seismic signature, the yield of this test definitely is an order of magnitude higher than the yields of the previous tests."" Current information did not definitively indicate that a thermonuclear weapon had been tested ""but it appears to be a likely possibility at this point"", she said. Hydrogen bombs use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash huge amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said North Korea's sixth nuclear test should be met with the ""strongest possible"" response, including new United Nations Security Council sanctions to ""completely isolate"" the country. China, North Korea's only major ally, condemned the test. North Korea ""has ignored the international community's widespread opposition, again carrying out a nuclear test. China's government expresses resolute opposition and strong condemnation toward this,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said sanctions against North Korea should include restrictions on the trade of oil products. Russia meanwhile said the test defied international law and urged all sides involved to hold talks, saying this was the only way to resolve the Korean peninsula's problems. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, described the test as ""an extremely regrettable act"". Yukiya Amano added: ""This new test, which follows the two tests last year and is the sixth since 2006, is in complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community."" Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent North Korea's sixth nuclear test - probably its largest so far - sends out one clear political signal. Despite the bluster and threats from the Trump administration in Washington and near-universal condemnation from around the world, Pyongyang is not going to halt or constrain its nuclear activities. Worryingly, it also suggests that this is a programme that is progressing on all fronts at a faster rate than many had expected. So far all efforts to pressure North Korea - sanctions, isolation, and military threats - have all failed to move Pyongyang. Could more be done? Certainly, but the harshest economic pressure would potentially cripple the regime and push it towards catastrophe - something China is unwilling to countenance. Containment and deterrence will now come to the fore as the world adjusts its policy from seeking to roll-back Pyongyang's weapons programme to living with a nuclear-armed North Korea. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? The first suggestion that this was to be a far from normal Sunday in the region came when seismologists' equipment started picking up readings of an earth tremor in the area where North Korea has conducted nuclear tests before. Initial reports from the US Geological Survey put the tremor at 5.6 magnitude with a depth of 10km (six miles) but this was later upgraded to 6.3 magnitude at 0km. The USGS put the site of the quake near the Punggye-ri test site Then Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said there was no doubt this was North Korea's sixth nuclear test. Finally, in a radio broadcast that had been trailed as a ""major announcement"", North Korean state media confirmed this was no earthquake. Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai North Korea's sixth nuclear weapons test is an utter rejection of all that its only ally has called for. Beijing's response was predictable: condemnation, urging an end to provocation and dialogue. But it also spoke of urging North Korea to ""face up to the firm will"" of the international community to see denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. There is no sign though that China is willing yet to see that firm will go beyond UN sanctions, which recently clamped down on seafood and iron ore exports, in addition to the coal and minerals that are already banned from crossing the border. It is noteworthy also that this test took place just as the Chinese president was about to welcome a handful of world leaders to the two-day showpiece Brics summit on China's east coast. Even the state-controlled media will find it hard to ignore the fact that their man has been upstaged - embarrassed too - by its almost universally ostracised ally and neighbour.
