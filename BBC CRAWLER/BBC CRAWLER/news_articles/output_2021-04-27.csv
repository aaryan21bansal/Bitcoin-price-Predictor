London Bridge attacker known as high-risk inmate,"Saskia Jones, 23, and Jack Merritt, 25, were killed by Usman Khan during a conference on rehabilitating offenders A convicted terrorist who killed two people had been one of the UK's highest risk inmates, an inquest heard. Usman Khan, 28, killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones at Fishmongers' Hall in London Bridge on 29 November 2019. Eight months earlier he had been released from prison, where he was viewed as an ""influential"" inmate who mixed with high-profile terrorists. A panel tasked with managing Khan after his release did not discuss the risks of his London visit, the inquest heard. During his eight years in prison Khan was considered to be among the 70 highest-risk prisoners in the entire country, jurors were told. Khan associated with terrorists including Fusilier Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebowale, and was involved with violent incidents and radicalisation of fellow inmates at seven prisons across England, the inquest heard. At HMP Woodhill he was deemed to be a ""Muslim enforcer"" who headed up ""a bullying gang"". Senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp Dan Brown gave evidence about Khan's life and long history of extremism in and out of prison, including: January 2011:Khan suggested he had access to a weapon and would ""do someone in the eye or neck"" and wanted to die and go to paradise March 2011:Khan and others were involved in an attack on another prisoner to shouts of ""Allahu Akbar"" November 2011:Khan shouted during the two-minute silence for Armistice Day. June 2012:Khan recited a poem including a reference to beheading a ""kuffar"", or non-believer May 2013:A stockpile of chemicals was found in Khan's cell November 2013:A Church of England chaplain was caught up in an assault by Khan on another prisoner. A razor blade was found in his cell later that day. Khan recorded a video for Learning Together months before launching the attack By March 2017, Khan was at HMP Whitemoor where he remained a high risk, Mr Brown said, and in June of the same year was regarded as an ""influential"" terrorist prisoner involved in ""extremist bullying"". Evidence suggested he continued to harbour extremist attitudes and deliberately ""told lies or ticked boxes to achieve progression"", the detective said. Intelligence gathered in October 2018 suggested he would ""return to his old ways"" following release, the court heard. Jurors have also heard Khan engaged with Learning Together, the education project where Mr Merritt and Ms Jones worked, describing it as ""kind of a family"". He launched his fatal attack at one of its rehabilitation conferences held at Fishmongers' Hall. The inquest has heard Khan shaved off his body hair - an apparent preparation for an act of martyrdom - in a toilet cubicle at the venue before attacking fellow attendees. He was chased on to London Bridge by several people, including a serving and former offender, and was then shot dead by police. Killer called education project a 'kind of family' Prison chaplain 'conned' by 'remorseful' terrorist Terror attacker shouted 'I'm going to blow you up' A multi-agency public protection arrangements (Mappa) panel tasked with managing Khan after his release had not discussed the risks his trip might pose, the court was told. At a final meeting on 14 November 2019, jurors heard, the group mentioned arrangements for Khan to travel to London on 29 November. However, Jonathan Hough QC, counsel for the coroner, said consideration of the trip referred to ""logistics rather than risks"". The inquest hearing continues.

Google owner sees record profits in lockdown boom,"Google owner Alphabet saw its earnings soar in the first quarter as people stuck at home in the pandemic used more of its services. Net profit jumped by 162% to a record $17.9bn in the three months to March as advertising revenue swelled by a third. It comes as the tech giant faces increased scrutiny over its power and the pandemic has people turning to the internet more than ever. The firm credited ""elevated consumer activity online"" for its results. ""Over the last year, people have turned to Google Search and many online services to stay informed, connected and entertained,"" said Alphabet and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai. Analysts had expected a good performance as economies around the world have continued to reopen, prompting more spending on online advertising. Reflecting this revenue at Google's search business jumped by 30% to $31.9bn in the quarter , while sales at YouTube leapt 49% to $6bn. 'Shocked' man buys Google web address for Â£2 Google and Apple attacked on app store 'monopoly' Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Alphabet had ""lapped up the rewards from the pandemic like a big cat pouncing on cream"". ""While famous for its start-up culture and offices, this tech giant is, rather unspectacularly, an advertising business,"" she said. ""Covid means phenomenal sums of money have shifted to online shopping, so Alphabet's impenetrable family of digital advertising businesses have seen revenue skyrocket."" The only problem facing the tech giant is continued regulatory action over issues such as competition and privacy. The latest dispute emerged on Monday when streaming TV technology company Roku accused Google of engaging in anticompetitive behaviour to benefit its YouTube and hardware businesses. Meanwhile, US and European regulators continue to discuss tightening oversight of Google and other tech giants, but have yet to agree legislation. On the back of the strong results, shares in Alphabet rose by 4.5% in after-hours trading.

Harry and Meghan to join Covid vaccine concert,"The couple have been encouraging the private sector to make donations to Covax Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will appear at a star-studded concert aimed at increasing access to Covid vaccines. The couple were announced as campaign chairs of the Vax Live event, organised by anti-poverty group Global Citizen. US President Joe Biden will also appear at the concert, which is being hosted by pop star Selena Gomez. ""We will all benefit, we will all be safer, when everyone, everywhere has equal access to the vaccine,"" Harry and Meghan said. ""We must pursue equitable vaccine distribution and, in that, restore faith in our common humanity. The mission couldn't be more critical or important."" The scheme to share vaccines with other countries Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The event will be recorded on Sunday at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, and broadcast on 8 May. Vax Live is calling on governments to commit to vaccine equity by donating doses and resources.

The campaign is also pushing businesses to ""donate dollars for doses"", and for pharmaceutical companies to make vaccines available at not-for-profit prices. In their role as campaign chairs, Harry and Meghan have been encouraging the private sector to make donations to the Covax scheme, which is co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor. More than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have now been administered worldwide. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, with some countries having delivered doses to a large proportion of their population and others still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. President Biden will appear at the concert, as will Jennifer Lopez, who performed at his inauguration The concert will feature performances from artists including Jennifer Lopez, Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Mr Biden, his wife Jill and Vice-President Kamala Harris will promote the ""We Can Do This"" initiative, which seeks to increase confidence in Covid-19 vaccines French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic will also make appearances.

Tensions overshadow EU vote on Brexit trade deal,"EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen oversees trade relations with the UK The European Parliament has ratified the post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal - a key move to ensure that tariff- and quota-free trade continues. The Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) has been operating provisionally since January. MEPs voted in favour by 660 votes to 5, while 32 abstained. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, said the vote ""brings certainty and allows us to focus on the future"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of a ""final step in a long journey"". The trade deal provided ""stability to our new relationship with the EU as vital trading partners, close allies and sovereign equals"", he said. The result, announced on Wednesday after a vote late on Tuesday, was also welcomed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier Ms von der Leyen said the TCA ""comes with real teeth, with a binding dispute settlement mechanism"". And she warned that the EU would use those teeth if necessary. The parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt described the deal as ""a failure for both sides, but better than nothing"". Lord Frost's opposite number in the Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, was also less than flattering. ""This is a divorce. It is a warning, Brexit. It's a failure of the European Union and we have to learn lessons from it,"" he told MEPs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit tensions remain, including a French threat of ""reprisals"" against the UK over new fishing restrictions. Northern Ireland trade is also a thorny issue. Under a separate protocol, Northern Ireland remains de facto part of the EU's single market, so goods arriving there from Britain have to undergo EU checks. Since Brexit there has been some disruption to that trade. The TCA covers EU-UK trade in goods, but not services. The UK economy is dominated by services - sectors such as banking, insurance, advertising and legal advice. What are the key points of the Brexit deal? 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal The TCA has still resulted in more paperwork, extra costs and less trade between the two sides, since the UK left the EU. A European Parliament resolution,externaldescribed the UK's exit from the EU as ""a historic mistake"". Among the areas not covered by the deal are foreign policy, financial services and student exchanges. Before the MEPs' debate started on Tuesday, French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune accused the UK of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with ""reprisals"" in financial services. ""The United Kingdom is expecting quite a few authorisations from us for financial services. We won't give any for as long as we don't have guarantees on fishing and other issues,"" he said on French news channel BFMTV. French fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Meanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish. Scottish firms account for most of that business, and some now face collapse. EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister The UK made fishing rights a key issue in the negotiations, with control over access to its waters seen as a sign of British sovereignty. Praising the TCAwhen it was agreed in December, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said""we have taken back control of our laws and our destiny"". He described it as ""a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends"". 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump In Tuesday's debate, German MEP David McAllister said Brexit ""will always be a lose-lose situation"", but he backed the TCA. It is a 1,400-page deal which was not clinched until 24 December. The Brexit negotiations began in 2017 and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Common rules remained during the UK's transition period until January 2021. After nearly four years of difficult negotiations on the UK exit from the EU and the post-Brexit relationship, it's hardly surprising that a few bruises are showing. The TCA certainly hasn't solved everything. There are still big questions to resolve on issues like financial services, for example. Monitoring and implementing what has been agreed, in a complex network of committees, will also be a constant feature of the new relationship. But it will take some time before the long-term effect on trade becomes clear. Trade volumes fell sharply in January before rebounding in February. But theUK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex,externalsays UK exports to the EU were still down by 17.2% in February compared to an average of February 2018 to 2020. A significant part is down to Brexit, although Covid is also a factor. The most prominent post-Brexit issue so far this year, though, isn't part of the TCA itself.  Northern Ireland's trading relationship with the rest of the UK, and with the EU, won't change as a result of this agreement being ratified. Both sides say they are working hard to find practical solutions in Northern Ireland, but some checks on trade between NI and Britain will remain in place. This video can not be played Is the point-scoring coming to an end - or have we only seen the first half of this grudge match? The European Commission has launched legal action, accusing the UK of breaching the agreement on Northern Ireland trade and breaking international law - charges Downing Street denies. Brexit also means: Blanket free movement of citizens between the UK and EU no longer applies. Business travellers do not need a visa for short trips, but artists and performers are not covered - so, for example, British rock bands face bureaucracy for gigs in the EU The rights of the roughly one million UK citizens living in the EU, and of EU citizens in the UK, are protected under the TCA. But the UK citizens face varying deadlines for obtaining residence rights; for the three million EU citizens in the UK the deadline for applications is 30 June Government subsidies are now under intense scrutiny on both sides, as the EU insists on a ""level playing field"" in trade. Courts will have to decide in cases where subsidies are allegedly unfair. UK financial services, not covered by the TCA, face new EU bureaucracy - so many City banks have beefed up their EU-based operations. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Euro MPs' vote bolsters EU-UK Brexit trade deal EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister UK exports to European Union drop 40% in January 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas, says No.10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

Parents criticise treatment of teens with autism,"Parents of autistic children want an end to their restraint in hospitals The mother of a teenager with autism has told MPs that her daughter's treatment in the care of the NHS was ""barbaric and inhumane"". Benji O'Reilly, who herself works for the NHS, described a ""prison-like environment"" endured by her daughter. MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee also heard from Dr Sarah Ryan whose sonConnor Sparrowhawk died in a bath in a learning disability unit. Care minister Helen Whately said she backed better support in the community. The hearing comes as aserious case review into Jonty Bravery, who threw a six-year-old boy from a balcony at London's Tate Modern, highlights a national shortage of specialist and residential carefor children and young people with complex and high-risk behaviours. Ms O'Reilly, a former nurse who now works in healthcare planning, wept as she told MPs how her daughter had waited three years for community support. In her last admission, in October 2020, the girl was forced to wait 30 hours in an emergency department before being transferred to an infant ward. There, her mother says, she was ""kept in a tiny box-sized, bland side-room for four weeks, with no fresh air, no exercise, no stimulation, no activities, not able to see friends, family, pets"". ""Unsurprisingly, she had a huge meltdown and started displaying some, what is seen as, challenging behaviour"". The teenager has been an inpatient for the past seven months, in a hospital ""miles away from home"", without access to her phone and cut off from friends, home, community, school and hobbies, Ms O'Reilly told MPs. ""She has been treated like a criminal at times. She has often asked why she's being punished."" Ms O'Reilly described how her daughter was ""physically pulled away from me and restrained in front of my eyes"", having been left ""screaming and crying for her mum"" when the hospital cancelled a planned visit at the last minute. The teenager is approaching her GCSE examinations, but her mum says that ""education has gone out of the window"". She said the family does not feel listened to and it ""feels like our daughter has just been swallowed up by the system"". Ms O'Reilly said restraint needed to be banned: ""Our daughter's been forcibly stripped and sedated via injection."" Dr Ryan said the only treatment her 18-year-old son was offered during the 107 days he spent at the specialist unit where he died, was a change in medication which increased his seizures. ""We are generating traumatic experiences for people and then puzzling about why we cannot release people back into the community,"" she said. ""There is absolutely no reason why anybody should be restrained or secluded in the 21st century for health-related reasons."" Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt suggested the UK needed a ""radical change"" in its care of people with learning disabilities and autism. Care Minister Helen Whately, who also appeared before the committee, said she shared the horror of the image of the teenager being held down and agreed the system should change. She added: ""Everyone is calling out, myself included, for there to be more effective support in the community. ""We need actually greater clarity on what does actually work in the community, what is the right model, so we can then say to every area across the country: 'Make sure you have this in place.'""

City of London set to convert offices into homes,"The City of London is planning to convert empty offices into housing in a bid to revive the area after the Covid crisis. The City of London Corporation, which looks after the Square Mile, is aiming for at least 1,500 new homes by 2030. Its policy chair said firms had told them their operations will change to accommodate flexible working. Current government guidance,externalsays people in England should work from home if possible. During the pandemic, many city centre areas have been left deserted as workers stayed at home to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. As part of a recovery strategy, the Corporation has set out how it will ""rise to the challenge of adapting to the new normal that emerges after the pandemic."" It plans to use a mixture of new schemes and refurbishments of old buildings to meet its housing target. BP staff set to work from home two days a week 'Horrible' offices look to tempt back workers The Corporation said this would include at least 35% affordable housing ""with an ambition to deliver higher levels of affordable housing where this is viable"". Although the area in and around the City dates back over 2,000 years, most of its housing stock was built in the late 1960s, according to estate agentsKnight Frank,external. In March 2020, there were about 7,850 residential units in the area many financial services firms call home - mostly found across purpose-built estates. Under the new proposals published on Tuesday, long-term lets in empty buildings could be offered to creatives, while it will also try to attract ""high-potential tech-led businesses"" to the area with improvements like making 5G available across the area. Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, said the body had been trying to listen to companies and how their needs have changed during the pandemic. ""Firms have told us that they remain committed to retaining a central London hub but how they operate will inevitably change to reflect post-pandemic trends, such as hybrid and flexible working. ""The Square Mile must evolve in order to provide an ecosystem that remains attractive to workers, visitors, learners and residents."" The pandemic has accelerated a shift to a new way of working that has seen many firms shake up routines. BP staff, for example,are set to work from home two days a weekgoing forward. IWG, the world's biggest flexible workspace provider, also expects a big jump in demand once pandemic subsides and ""hybrid working"", a mixture of going in and working from home, becomes more common. The firm, formerly known as Regus,recently struck a deal with London-based bank Standard Chartered,externalwhich will provide its 95,000 employees access to 3,500 offices, which are found across suburbs and cities. However, others such as investment bankGoldman Sachs have rejected remote workingas the ""new normal"", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an ""aberration"".

Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter,"Boris Johnson's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has alleged that the prime minister once planned for Conservative donors to ""secretly pay"" for the revamp of the flat where he and fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds live. But the defence secretary has responded by saying Mr Johnson ""personally"" footed the bill. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? It's not clear whether any of the work - reportedly costing up to Â£200,000 - was initially paid for by another source, whom the prime minister then repaid. It was reported that Conservative Lord Brownlow said he was making a donation to the party, which included ""Â£58,000 to cover the payments"" already made. Asked whether he had ever discussed using donations to pay for refurbishments, Mr Johnson said: ""If there's anything to be said about that, any declaration to be made, that will of course be made in due course."" Why it matters:If Lord Brownlow, or other donors, contributed to the fund or made a loan, this should have been reported to the Electoral Commission, the body which ensures transparency in political funding. Details of the second lockdown were released before the government announced it on 31 October. Dominic Cummings has denied responsibility for those leaks. He also claimed the prime minister had considered stopping an inquiry into who was responsible for the leak after it was found that ""all the evidence"" pointed to Henry Newman - who was a Cabinet Office adviser at the time and now works in Downing Street. Carrie Symonds oversaw the redecoration of the flat she shares with the PM Mr Johnson allegedly said Mr Newman and Carrie Symonds were ""best friends"" and he would have to fire Mr Newman if the inquiry concluded that he was to blame - and that this could cause problems in his family life. The government said the PM had ""never interfered in a government leak inquiry"". And Cabinet Secretary Simon Case warned it was ""probable"" it would ""not successfully"" identify the person responsible, given the time that's elapsed. Why it matters:The inquiry still has not reported its findings, almost six months after being launched. If Mr Johnson wanted to stop it because it might conclude his fiancee's friend was the leaker, this would contravene the ministerial code, laying out rules of behaviour. Last week, messages sent between Mr Johnson and the businessman came to light. They revealed that, early in the pandemic, the prime minister had promised to ""fix"" a tax issue so that Sir James's Singapore-based staff could work for longer in the UK in order to help build more ventilators for sick patients. Johnson told Dyson he would 'fix' tax issue Mr Johnson promised to publish the full exchange on Friday, but while some details of the correspondence were released, this did not happen. Why it matters:The prime minister said there would be transparency over the texts and is therefore under pressure to give more information. Plans for a football competition in which six of the UK's clubs were guaranteed a place - whatever their Premier League performance - were announced last week. Mr Johnson was among its heaviest critics, calling it a ""cartel"". Edward Woodward came to Downing Street a few days before the European Super League was announced But it was later revealed that Manchester United chief executive Edward Woodward - whose club was one of those behind the European Super League (ESL) - had met the PM's chief of staff in Downing Street five days earlier. The Sunday Times reported that the plans had been discussed in the meeting. But Downing Street denied that, saying it had specifically been about the safe reopening of stadiums and what forms of Covid registration needed to be in place. Labour is pushing for fuller details of what happened in the meeting. Why it matters:The UK government welcomed the end of the ESL, from which the English clubs have withdrawn. But were some in Downing Street aware of the clubs' plan in advance? Mohammed bin Salman is accused of having authorised the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi It's been reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman contacted Mr Johnson to say relations between his country and the UK would be damaged if he did not try to ""correct"" the Premier League's decision not to allow a Â£300m takeover of Newcastle United. It is claimed the prime minister asked an aide, Lord Udny-Lister, to look into the matter. Government 'not involved' in Newcastle United sale But the government has denied any involvement with the takeover, a position backed up by Newcastle United. Why it matters:The Premier League had been scrutinising the takeover attempt over concerns that the consortium behind the bid was not properly independent from the Saudi government.

What are the rules governing political donations?,"The Electoral Commission has announced it will investigate the funding of Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat renovation, saying there are ""reasonable grounds to suspect an offence"". Mr Johnson says he covered the cost of the refurbishment himself and has ""conformed in full with the code of conduct"". Conflict of interest Prime ministers are allowed to spend Â£30,000 a year of public money to renovate their accommodation. The final bill for the latest refit is not known but there has been speculation that it could be as much as Â£200,000. The government has refused to say whether Mr Johnson received a loan from the Conservative Party to pay for the renovations that were above the annual allowance. If this was the case, Mr Johnson would need to demonstrate that the arrangement was consistent withthe ministerial code,external- a government document that sets out the ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office. The code makes clear there should be""no actual or perceived conflicts of interest"". Hannah White, from the Institute for Government think tank, says there could be ""a problem of perception"". ""There's no legal problem with the PM having taken a loan from a political party... it's more about whether there's a sense the prime minister might have a conflict if he wanted to reorganise the Conservative Party or sack the treasurer or something like that. ""He then has a financial obligation with the Conservative Party."" Watchdog to investigate PM's flat renovations What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat? Five questions for the PM Declarations There are numerous registers where political donations need to be declared, depending on who is sending and receiving the funds. Each one has its own rules about what needs to be declared and when. Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500must be reported to the Electoral Commission,external- the organisation which regulates political donations in the UK. This register is updated every three months. On 28 April, the Electoral Commission announced it would carry out an investigation about whether any funding should have been declared. In a statement, the commission said: ""We are now satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred"". A second register, tied to the ministerial code, requires ministers to declare any financial benefits received. The government is supposed to publish a list of ministers' financial interests twice a year. However,the last one was released in July 2020,external. The list is overseen by an independent adviser. However, the post was left vacant after Sir Alex Allan - the previous adviser on standards -resigned in Novemberin a row over a bullying inquiry involving Home Secretary Priti Patel. On 28 April thegovernment announced Lord Geidt as the new independent adviser,external. Shortly after the appointment Mr Johnson said he would seek advice from Lord Geidt on whether any further declarations were required. Separately, all MPs must declare - within 28 days - any donations which could influence their actions. This is known as theRegister of Members' Financial Interests,externaland is updated frequently. Alex Thomas - a former principal private secretary to then cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood - believes the prime minister would be required to make a disclosure: ""If you owe someone money in this context, I would say it should be declared on that register."" It depends exactly what the offensive is and which register it relates to. If a party breaks the rules about making declarations to the Electoral Commissiona range of sanctions are available,external- including fines of up to Â£20,000. Very serious offensives can also be referred to the police. If there is a breach of the ministerial code, it would normally be the prime minister who decides the sanction - such as sacking the minister responsible. However, given that Mr Johnson is at the centre of the row on this occasion and wrote the foreword to the code, that exposes an obvious gap that's not easily resolvable. The register of members' financial interests, on the other hand, is regulated by Parliament'sCommittee on Standards,external. The committee, which is chaired by an MP, can carry out investigations for possible rule breaches and impose sanctions. This includes forcing an MP to apologise or a suspension from Parliament. Mr Johnson has previously been in hot water with the standards committee. In 2018 - before he became prime minister - Mr Johnson made a ""full and unreserved"" apology to MPsfor failing to declare more than Â£52,000 in income. At the time, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone ruled that the breaches were ""neither inadvertent nor minor"". Thereport,externalnoted that there had been nine payments registered by Mr Johnson after the required 28-day deadline.

Updates were brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright, Paul Kirby, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Holly Wallis and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. Here's a recap of the UK's coronavirus news today:  We're drawing the live page to a close for the day soon. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest developments from around the world today:  A US state says it will offer young people a $100 (Â£72) savings bond if they receive a Covid-19 vaccine. West Virginia saysit hopes the payment for those aged 16 to 35 will ""motivate"" them to get the jab. ""Our kids today probably don't really realise just how important they are in shutting this thing down,"" State Governor Jim Justice said on Monday. West Virginia had been among the top US states for vaccination rates, but progress has slowed in recent weeks. There are particular concerns that younger people may be more hesitant about receiving a jab. The incentive means those who are vaccinated within the age group can retrieve the $100, plus interest, at a later date. It will also be offered to anyone aged 16 to 35 who has already been vaccinated. West Virginia has the 16th highest rate of new coronavirus cases per person among US states, according to the New York Times. Conversely,a Miami school has discouraged teachers from getting the Covid vaccine, saying any vaccinated employees will be barred from interacting with students. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wait to receive vaccines in Ruili over the weekend There is a lot of fanfare today in the Chinese city of
Ruili, where the authorities have lifted stay-at-home orders for people in
low-risk areas. Ruili, in southwestern Yunnan province, has been the site
of Chinaâs one domestic Covid-19 outbreak over the last month. There have been
more than 100 confirmed cases in the China-Myanmar border city since 30 March,
affecting both Chinese and Burmese nationals. The city implemented strict lockdowns in March, with a
number of city districts becoming âmediumâ or âhigh-riskâ. In these areas, people were
under strict orders to stay at home. All but essential businesses closed.
Students began having online classes, and transport links were suspended. Thousands of medical workers from outside of the city were
also sent to the front-line. However, today, media note that they have
âcompleted their missionâ, and footage is circulating showing local residents
dancing and waving to see them off. There were also fireworks set off yesterday evening
following the announcement that in areas that had recently returned to being
âlow-riskâ, home lockdowns were to be lifted. The Yunnan Health Commission says that 59 people are
currently being treated with symptoms,
including 13 who have arrived from overseas. Dr Jerryl Bennett from the Doctors Association of India has spoken to the BBC from Nagpur in Maharsahtra state. He says authorities are trying to step up supplies of oxygen, but it's been a losing battle: ""They are trying to provide us with oxygen, but the demand is so much that whatever amount of supply is there from the government it is not sufficient enough right now,"" he says. ""Patients are in a panic-stricken mode. The entire country is in panic-stricken mode."" He says medical staff are being pushed to the edge. ""We are physically exhausted. We are working over the capacity which a human can work. But it is also very traumatising emotionally and mentally that we are losing patients because of lack of oxygen or lack of beds. ""We are losing patients because they are coming in the hospitals at a very late stage where it is very difficult for us to give them the treatment for them to survive or for them to revive back from Covid,"" he says. ""It becomes very difficult for all the young generation doctors as well as the senior doctors. These patients could have been saved had we intervened a little earlier."" An Isle of Man ferry terminal in Liverpool will be at least Â£5m over budget and a year late due to the impact of coronavirus. Delays to the government-funded project caused by the pandemic are currently costing Â£8,000 per day, says infrastructure minister Tim Baker. The project was originally expected to cost Â£38m and be completed by December 2020, but that waspushed back to March and then July 2021. It will now be finished in March 2022. Baker told the Manx House of Keys: ""Progress is being made day by day, week by week, but it is being heavily impacted by the ongoing impact of coronavirus."" He says: ""I will do absolutely what I can to control the cost and to speed up delivery, but I cannot promise that we have yet met all the challenges that this scheme will bring."" The new facility is being built at the Princes Half Tide Dock about 670m from the existing terminal at Pier Head. BBC Radio 5 Live With a deadly second wave of Covid infections happening in India, BBC Radio 5 Live Drive has been hearing from people whose family and friends have been affected. Harsimrat Kaur lives in London with her husband Jagjit Singh and has relatives in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Her aunt and cousin have both died of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks. Harsimrat said: ""It hit home really hardâ¦ two people from the same family, theyâve got young kids as wellâ¦ I donât have any words, itâs just insane what is happening.â Harsimrat explained that her cousin managed to get a hospital bed ""after fighting for days with the doctors"" but still couldnât get oxygen or treatment there. Her aunt never got into hospital and had been ""struggling for oxygen"" too. Following the recent birth of their baby boy, both Harsimrat and her husband feel jumping on a plane to be with their family on compassionate grounds, would be âtoo much of a riskâ for their sonâs health. She added that her and her husband also âjust canât affordâ to travel to India and then spend two weeks in hotel quarantine. They have applied for a visa to allow some members of their family to come to the UK, when international travel opens up again. Listen back to the conversation on BBC Sounds. Leisure centres, outdoor attractions and hairdressers are open to customers across much of the UK, for the first time in months since coronavirus restrictions were imposed. But what are the rules in the UK's different nations? Here's our explainer of the rules below - which you can read it in fullhere. InEngland:  InWales:  InScotland:  InNorthern Ireland: Love of Lesbian played to a crowd of 5,000 Researchers in Spain have found ""no sign"" of higher levels of infection among people who took part in a large test concert last month. Six people tested positive within 14 days of attending the gig in Barcelona, but the incidence was lower than that seen in the general population. Around 5,000 music fans took part in the experiment after testing negative for Covid-19. Revellers wore masks but did not have to socially distance. Of the six people who tested positive, researchers concluded that four of them were infected elsewhere, not at the event itself. Spanish authorities let the show, featuring band Love of Lesbian, go ahead as part of a research project. The rate of infection among attendees was half the rate of people of the same age in Barcelona, researchers found. ""There is no sign that suggests transmission took place during the event,"" infectious disease specialist Josep Maria Llibre told a news conference on Tuesday. Read more here. More than 1.5 million Moroccans were arrested in the last nine months for not respecting Covid measures, a top official has said. This translates to a rate of more than 5,700 people arrested every day during that timeframe, Deputy Interior Minister Noureddine Boutayeb said, according to the 2M TV channel. ""Although this number seems large, it indicates a great involvement of all the authorities in charge of law enforcement,"" he told parliament. Failure to wear protective masks, respect curfews and travel bans were among the main offences, according to the Hespress website. Last year, Morocco rejected allegations of police abuse in taking measures to combat the spread of coronavirus in the country. This came after a top official at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) included the country in a list of states where the authorities' response to the pandemic had raised concerns. Almost 9,000 people have been reported to have lost their lives to Covid-19 in the country of 36 million people. A customer picks up a token that can be exchanged for a beer at the Warpigs Brewpub in Copenhagen A bar in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, has come up with a novel way of tempting its customers back in. In return for 149 kroner (Â£17, $24), punters at Warpigs Brewpub are able to take a test and wait for the result with a free beer. After half an hour, if they test negative, they are allowed inside the bar. It works as part ofthe country's coronapas (corona passport) systemwhich allows Danes to show proof that they are infection-free. Although they can get hold of free government-provided tests, the bar's customers
say the paid-for versions let them avoid the queues at testing centres. Warpigs says it's trying this out in partnership with a medical company to see if there's appetite for the scheme. One customer seemed happy enough: ""It [the test] costs some money, but you get a free beer - paid beer I guess, but you get a beer. And it was worth it. It took two minutes, you did it yourself, it wasn't uncomfortable and I got 'negative', so it's a win-win in my opinion,"" Nicolai Marteens told Reuters news agency. Health authorities in Bangladesh have approved the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, for emergency use amid uncertainty over deliveries from neighbouring India. The director-general of the Bangladeshi Drug Administration, Mahbubur Rahman, said the country was expecting the arrival of about four million doses from Russia next month. Rahman also indicated that Bangladesh could approve China's Sinopharm vaccine shortly. India has halted exports
of the AstraZeneca vaccinein response to a record surge in domestic infections. Assome MPs call for a review of fixed penalty noticesfor Covid lockdown breaches today, we've been hearing from people who were issued fines. One public sector worker told us he has been left in debt after being given a Â£1,000 fine for going to a friend's house for drinks. He and his wife, who was a nurse, met up with friends on the 11th day of self-isolation after a holiday abroad. At the time, the self-isolation period was 14 days. They'd both had Covid earlier in the year and thought the party posed minimal risk. ""It was wrong, I admit it and I came clean about it. But Â£1,000 is a ridiculous amount
of money. I'm still paying it off every month out of my wages, it's an impossible situation,"" the father-of-three explained. And in Manchester, Abe, 29, was fined after he went to a BBQ in January with four friends, and a neighbour called the police. He was issued two fines of Â£200 each, instead of one. After challenging the mistake, both fines were withdrawn, but his friends each paid their fines. ""Most people just pay the fine because theyâre
scared - the letters are alarming and say ""criminal records office"". It also concerned me that police were attending these calls when there are so many other serious issues,"" he said. There have been a further 17 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's latest figures.,external That brings the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,451. There were also a further 2,685 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Over the last few days, Chinese media have been
dominated by reports on the catastrophic scenes in India. State media yesterday
noted that China had sent hundreds of oxygen concentrators, and was vowing to
send 10,000 more. The national Global Times newspaper said that the country
would âkeep in contact with India for urgent supportâ. Today, the Global Times has criticised the US for
not responding in the same way. It says that âUS aid to India is long overdueâ,
and says that âcountries with strong, anti-epidemic capabilities must shoulder
greater responsibilitiesâ. The Xinhua news agency says that only 1.4% of Indiaâs
population have been vaccinated, and that âthe US is hoarding Covid-19
vaccinesâ. It adds that this comes amid other developing nations denouncing US
âvaccine apartheidâ. Chinese media have been keen to highlight
internal divisions between ordinary Indians and the elite. They were critical
of Indiaâs super-rich chartering eight private jets to London ahead of being
included on the UK governmentâs red list,
and The Paper notes that some Bollywood stars have been trolled for taking
holiday photos in the Maldives as the situation continues to escalate. Meanwhile, papers have been speaking to Chinese
nationals who are based in India. One called Niko told Beijing News that she
has tested positive for Covid-19, âbut the hospital said on 13 April that
hospital beds were all occupiedâ¦ so Iâve had no choice but to take medicine at
homeâ. In a video shared by the Global Times, a student,
Ms Chen, says that âthere are no flights; I can only stay at home and protect
myselfâ. An NHS boss has praised the ""heroic efforts"" of all those involved in the vaccine roll out as the UK reaches one-in-four adults having had their second jab. But Ruth Rankine, primary care director at the NHS Confederation, has urged everyone to stick to lockdown rules, warning that the pandemic is not yet over. She says: ""Today we reach another milestone in the UK's vaccination campaign and this is yet more evidence of the heroic efforts of so many people across the NHS, including and especially primary care, to make sure as many people as possible are protected."" ""But at the same time, we need to continue to follow the rules, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks to make sure the progress we have made in recent weeks can continue. ""With growing numbers of cases in the UK of mutant strains of the virus, we must not fall into the trap of believing the crisis is over.""

Assistant head teacher Victoria Day has shared her top tips to help children with their communication. The Brazilian congress is launching an inquiry today into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed almost 400,000 people. The commission could potentially lead to the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro. He's been widely criticised for his anti-lockdown, vaccine-sceptic stance. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Bolsonaro said he's ""not worried"" by the commission - but his chance of re-election next year could be at stake. On Monday, Brazil's health regulator rejected requests from several states to receive batches of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V. The UK has fully vaccinated a quarter of its adult population against coronavirus and is on track to offer a first jab to all adults by the end of July, the government says. Public Health England data shows
vaccines are already having a significant impact in the UK in reducing
hospitalisations and deaths, and saved more than 10,000 lives between December
and March. Data from the ONS and Oxford University shows that
COVID-19 infections fell by 65% after the first dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, and further after the second
dose. The latest vaccine effectiveness data from PHE
show that in those aged over 70, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and
Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines reduce the risk of getting symptomatic disease by
around 60% after a single dose. This protection lasts for several weeks. In
those aged over 80, protection against hospitalisation is around 80% and the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 85% effective at stopping people aged over 80 dying
from COVID-19. Rolling reviews are under way by the MHRA to
assess the Janssen and Novavax vaccines - find out when you'll get your jabhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Parents criticise treatment of teens with autismParents tell MPs their children were restrained unnecessarily and isolated from their families.UK,"Parents of autistic children want an end to their restraint in hospitals The mother of a teenager with autism has told MPs that her daughter's treatment in the care of the NHS was ""barbaric and inhumane"". Benji O'Reilly, who herself works for the NHS, described a ""prison-like environment"" endured by her daughter. MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee also heard from Dr Sarah Ryan whose sonConnor Sparrowhawk died in a bath in a learning disability unit. Care minister Helen Whately said she backed better support in the community. The hearing comes as aserious case review into Jonty Bravery, who threw a six-year-old boy from a balcony at London's Tate Modern, highlights a national shortage of specialist and residential carefor children and young people with complex and high-risk behaviours. Ms O'Reilly, a former nurse who now works in healthcare planning, wept as she told MPs how her daughter had waited three years for community support. In her last admission, in October 2020, the girl was forced to wait 30 hours in an emergency department before being transferred to an infant ward. There, her mother says, she was ""kept in a tiny box-sized, bland side-room for four weeks, with no fresh air, no exercise, no stimulation, no activities, not able to see friends, family, pets"". ""Unsurprisingly, she had a huge meltdown and started displaying some, what is seen as, challenging behaviour"". The teenager has been an inpatient for the past seven months, in a hospital ""miles away from home"", without access to her phone and cut off from friends, home, community, school and hobbies, Ms O'Reilly told MPs. ""She has been treated like a criminal at times. She has often asked why she's being punished."" Ms O'Reilly described how her daughter was ""physically pulled away from me and restrained in front of my eyes"", having been left ""screaming and crying for her mum"" when the hospital cancelled a planned visit at the last minute. The teenager is approaching her GCSE examinations, but her mum says that ""education has gone out of the window"". She said the family does not feel listened to and it ""feels like our daughter has just been swallowed up by the system"". Ms O'Reilly said restraint needed to be banned: ""Our daughter's been forcibly stripped and sedated via injection."" Dr Ryan said the only treatment her 18-year-old son was offered during the 107 days he spent at the specialist unit where he died, was a change in medication which increased his seizures. ""We are generating traumatic experiences for people and then puzzling about why we cannot release people back into the community,"" she said. ""There is absolutely no reason why anybody should be restrained or secluded in the 21st century for health-related reasons."" Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt suggested the UK needed a ""radical change"" in its care of people with learning disabilities and autism. Care Minister Helen Whately, who also appeared before the committee, said she shared the horror of the image of the teenager being held down and agreed the system should change. She added: ""Everyone is calling out, myself included, for there to be more effective support in the community. ""We need actually greater clarity on what does actually work in the community, what is the right model, so we can then say to every area across the country: 'Make sure you have this in place.'""

Amphetamine lab discovered in raid on outbuilding,"This video can not be played Footage shows an amphetamine lab found in raid near Redditch A drugs laboratory capable of producing Â£10m of amphetamine a month has been uncovered during a police raid. The ""large-scale"" operation was found in outbuildings on Ullenhall Lane near Redditch, Worcestershire. The investigation began after text messages were obtained by French police during the penetration of the encrypted phone network Encrochat last year. Vats and sacks of ingredients were found in the lab, which is currently too hazardous for police to enter. Five people have been arrested in the joint operation between the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Warwickshire Police on Tuesday. Firefighters and a chemicals expert were drafted in to assist with the raid. Firefighters and scientific advisers have also been at the scene Footage of the inside of the building has been sent to scientific experts for analysis. Peter Stevens, branch commander at the NCA, said conducting the raid on the ""semi-rural"" site had taken weeks of meticulous planning. ""The laboratory will make illicit amphetamine, it is a class B drug, and will be sold on the market for approximately Â£2,000 per kilo, wholesale price,"" he said. ""It involves a number of different chemicals, all very volatile and dangerous chemicals, as well as some quite specific and sophisticated scientific apparatus and equipment. ""It takes someone with a very good knowledge of those chemicals and the processes required to produce the amphetamine, which is why it is rare for us to encounter it as it needs a crime group that is able to access the chemicals, able to access the equipment and then have someone that can essentially cook the chemicals. ""Once it is cooked, they can then distribute it to other crime groups in the UK, as this crime group has done."" Peter Stevens, from the NCA, said he was ""pleased and proud"" with the efforts of officers Assistant Chief Constable Alex Franklin Smith, from Warwickshire Police, said he is confident the operation will have a ""huge"" impact on the organised criminal gangs involved. ""Such an operation taking place in such a quiet, rural location will no doubt have caused some concerns for people in the area,"" he said. ""Our officers will be working with people in the local community in the coming days to provide reassurance."" Police raided two other properties in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, and Quinton, Birmingham, in connection with an investigation into an organised crime network. Searches are ongoing at the farm buildings Warwickshire Police said two men, aged 40 and 60, were arrested in Buckinghamshire. A third man, aged 50, suspected of operating the lab, was apprehended at his home in Quinton. While a man aged 36 and a woman aged 28 were arrested at a building on the site. All five remain in custody where they are being interviewed, the force added. Officers said searches of the farm buildings are ongoing, with support from specialist teams from West Midlands Police, West Midlands Fire Service and West Midlands Ambulance Service. Latest news from the West Midlands This operation is the latest in a string of cases which have resulted from the penetration of Encrochat. French police obtained the messages of 9,000 British people using the service, and the NCA said the vast majority were using it for criminal purposes. More than 1,500 people have been arrested in Operation Venetic, the British effort to analyse criminality using the messages.

Meth lab discovered in raid on outbuilding,"This video can not be played Footage shows an amphetamine lab found in raid near Redditch A drugs laboratory capable of producing Â£10m of amphetamine a month has been uncovered during a police raid. The ""large-scale"" operation was found in outbuildings on Ullenhall Lane near Redditch, Worcestershire. The investigation began after text messages were obtained by French police during the penetration of the encrypted phone network Encrochat last year. Vats and sacks of ingredients were found in the lab, which is currently too hazardous for police to enter. Five people have been arrested in the joint operation between the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Warwickshire Police on Tuesday. Firefighters and a chemicals expert were drafted in to assist with the raid. Firefighters and scientific advisers have also been at the scene Footage of the inside of the building has been sent to scientific experts for analysis. Peter Stevens, branch commander at the NCA, said conducting the raid on the ""semi-rural"" site had taken weeks of meticulous planning. ""The laboratory will make illicit amphetamine, it is a class B drug, and will be sold on the market for approximately Â£2,000 per kilo, wholesale price,"" he said. ""It involves a number of different chemicals, all very volatile and dangerous chemicals, as well as some quite specific and sophisticated scientific apparatus and equipment. ""It takes someone with a very good knowledge of those chemicals and the processes required to produce the amphetamine, which is why it is rare for us to encounter it as it needs a crime group that is able to access the chemicals, able to access the equipment and then have someone that can essentially cook the chemicals. ""Once it is cooked, they can then distribute it to other crime groups in the UK, as this crime group has done."" Peter Stevens, from the NCA, said he was ""pleased and proud"" with the efforts of officers Assistant Chief Constable Alex Franklin Smith, from Warwickshire Police, said he is confident the operation will have a ""huge"" impact on the organised criminal gangs involved. ""Such an operation taking place in such a quiet, rural location will no doubt have caused some concerns for people in the area,"" he said. ""Our officers will be working with people in the local community in the coming days to provide reassurance."" Police raided two other properties in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, and Quinton, Birmingham, in connection with an investigation into an organised crime network. Searches are ongoing at the farm buildings Warwickshire Police said two men, aged 40 and 60, were arrested in Buckinghamshire. A third man, aged 50, suspected of operating the lab, was apprehended at his home in Quinton. While a man aged 36 and a woman aged 28 were arrested at a building on the site. All five remain in custody where they are being interviewed, the force added. Officers said searches of the farm buildings are ongoing, with support from specialist teams from West Midlands Police, West Midlands Fire Service and West Midlands Ambulance Service. Latest news from the West Midlands This operation is the latest in a string of cases which have resulted from the penetration of Encrochat. French police obtained the messages of 9,000 British people using the service, and the NCA said the vast majority were using it for criminal purposes. More than 1,500 people have been arrested in Operation Venetic, the British effort to analyse criminality using the messages.

French warn UK ahead of Brexit trade deal vote,"EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen oversees trade relations with the UK The European Parliament has ratified the post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal - a key move to ensure that tariff- and quota-free trade continues. The Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) has been operating provisionally since January. MEPs voted in favour by 660 votes to 5, while 32 abstained. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, said the vote ""brings certainty and allows us to focus on the future"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of a ""final step in a long journey"". The trade deal provided ""stability to our new relationship with the EU as vital trading partners, close allies and sovereign equals"", he said. The result, announced on Wednesday after a vote late on Tuesday, was also welcomed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier Ms von der Leyen said the TCA ""comes with real teeth, with a binding dispute settlement mechanism"". And she warned that the EU would use those teeth if necessary. The parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt described the deal as ""a failure for both sides, but better than nothing"". Lord Frost's opposite number in the Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, was also less than flattering. ""This is a divorce. It is a warning, Brexit. It's a failure of the European Union and we have to learn lessons from it,"" he told MEPs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit tensions remain, including a French threat of ""reprisals"" against the UK over new fishing restrictions. Northern Ireland trade is also a thorny issue. Under a separate protocol, Northern Ireland remains de facto part of the EU's single market, so goods arriving there from Britain have to undergo EU checks. Since Brexit there has been some disruption to that trade. The TCA covers EU-UK trade in goods, but not services. The UK economy is dominated by services - sectors such as banking, insurance, advertising and legal advice. What are the key points of the Brexit deal? 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal The TCA has still resulted in more paperwork, extra costs and less trade between the two sides, since the UK left the EU. A European Parliament resolution,externaldescribed the UK's exit from the EU as ""a historic mistake"". Among the areas not covered by the deal are foreign policy, financial services and student exchanges. Before the MEPs' debate started on Tuesday, French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune accused the UK of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with ""reprisals"" in financial services. ""The United Kingdom is expecting quite a few authorisations from us for financial services. We won't give any for as long as we don't have guarantees on fishing and other issues,"" he said on French news channel BFMTV. French fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Meanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish. Scottish firms account for most of that business, and some now face collapse. EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister The UK made fishing rights a key issue in the negotiations, with control over access to its waters seen as a sign of British sovereignty. Praising the TCAwhen it was agreed in December, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said""we have taken back control of our laws and our destiny"". He described it as ""a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends"". 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump In Tuesday's debate, German MEP David McAllister said Brexit ""will always be a lose-lose situation"", but he backed the TCA. It is a 1,400-page deal which was not clinched until 24 December. The Brexit negotiations began in 2017 and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Common rules remained during the UK's transition period until January 2021. After nearly four years of difficult negotiations on the UK exit from the EU and the post-Brexit relationship, it's hardly surprising that a few bruises are showing. The TCA certainly hasn't solved everything. There are still big questions to resolve on issues like financial services, for example. Monitoring and implementing what has been agreed, in a complex network of committees, will also be a constant feature of the new relationship. But it will take some time before the long-term effect on trade becomes clear. Trade volumes fell sharply in January before rebounding in February. But theUK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex,externalsays UK exports to the EU were still down by 17.2% in February compared to an average of February 2018 to 2020. A significant part is down to Brexit, although Covid is also a factor. The most prominent post-Brexit issue so far this year, though, isn't part of the TCA itself.  Northern Ireland's trading relationship with the rest of the UK, and with the EU, won't change as a result of this agreement being ratified. Both sides say they are working hard to find practical solutions in Northern Ireland, but some checks on trade between NI and Britain will remain in place. This video can not be played Is the point-scoring coming to an end - or have we only seen the first half of this grudge match? The European Commission has launched legal action, accusing the UK of breaching the agreement on Northern Ireland trade and breaking international law - charges Downing Street denies. Brexit also means: Blanket free movement of citizens between the UK and EU no longer applies. Business travellers do not need a visa for short trips, but artists and performers are not covered - so, for example, British rock bands face bureaucracy for gigs in the EU The rights of the roughly one million UK citizens living in the EU, and of EU citizens in the UK, are protected under the TCA. But the UK citizens face varying deadlines for obtaining residence rights; for the three million EU citizens in the UK the deadline for applications is 30 June Government subsidies are now under intense scrutiny on both sides, as the EU insists on a ""level playing field"" in trade. Courts will have to decide in cases where subsidies are allegedly unfair. UK financial services, not covered by the TCA, face new EU bureaucracy - so many City banks have beefed up their EU-based operations. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Euro MPs' vote bolsters EU-UK Brexit trade deal EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister UK exports to European Union drop 40% in January 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas, says No.10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

"Every lockdown fine should be reviewed, say MPs","All fixed penalty notices for Covid lockdown breaches, which can be as high as Â£10,000, should be reviewed - according to a parliamentary committee. The system is ""muddled, discriminatory and unfair"", MPs on the Joint Committee on Human Rights argued. More than 85,000 fixed penalty notices have been issued in England since the pandemic began, and  8,000 in Wales. A government spokesperson said it was right there were consequences for those who most flagrantly breached the rules. The JCHR, which is made up of MPs and peers, said it had ""significant concerns"" about the validity of fines, the inadequacy of the review and appeal process, the size of the penalties and the criminalisation of those who could not afford to pay. ""The whole process disproportionately hits the less well-off and criminalises the poor over the better off,"" said committee chairwoman Harriet Harman. Fines increase during third national lockdown Patel defends police lockdown fines Women's lockdown exercise fines dropped While the committee recognised swift action had been needed in the face of the pandemic, the government needed to ensure rules were clear, enforcement was fair and that mistakes could be rectified, she said, adding: ""None of that is the case in respect of Covid-19 fixed penalty notices."" Ms Harman said police had a difficult job enforcing the rules during the pandemic, but warned a ""lack of legal clarity"" meant there could be a large number of wrongly issued fines. The Labour MP added: ""This means we've got an unfair system - with clear evidence that young people, those from certain ethnic minority backgrounds, men, and the most socially deprived, are most at risk. ""Those who can't afford to pay face a criminal record along with all the resulting consequences for their future development."" Have you been issued with a lockdown fine?

According to the report, coronavirus rules have changed at least 65 times since March 2020. ""It is possible to tell from penalties that have not been paid and have then progressed through the system towards a prosecution, that a significant number of FPNs are incorrectly issued,"" the committee said. It highlighted a Crown Prosecution Service review of prosecutions under coronavirus regulations which found in February that 27% of the defendants had been incorrectly charged. In January, two womenreceived an apology and had their fines waivedafter being given fixed penalty notices after driving to a Derbyshire beauty spot for exercise. A solicitor's daughter received a fixed penalty notice (FPN) in March while in halls of residence at the University of Nottingham. Jane, who did not want to share her surname, told the BBC her daughter was visiting another flat for a ""get together"" with eight others. She said all nine had previously tested positive for Covid-19 and were ""playing cards and listening to smooth jazz"". Then the police entered the flat shouting ""where is everyone?"", according to Jane. She said they were ""aggressive and overbearing"". Those who did not live in the flat then returned to their own residences - but were still issued with Â£100 fines, rising to Â£200 if paid late. Jane said: ""[The police] did not at any time follow the National Police Chiefs' Council guidance to 'engage, âexplain, encourage, enforce'."" Jane paid the Â£200 fine and has now requested a review by Nottinghamshire Police, but is yet to hear back. Nottinghamshire Police Chief Constable Craig Guildford said the force had a duty to protect the public ""and this was clearly an illegal gathering taking place in halls of residence, where dozens of other students live as well"". He said that police have followed the four Es of approach of engaging, explaining, encouraging and then enforcing as a last resort throughout most of the first year of the pandemic. And he added: ""By now the laws around Covid can come as a surprise to no one - and where people are blatantly or repeatedly holding parties or going to parties outside their own home they really shouldn't be shocked to be given a fine.""

"Lockdowns hurt child speech and language skillsDelays to speech and language skills are a top concern for primary schools, researchers say.Family & Education","This video can not be played Assistant head teacher Victoria Day has five tips to ensure children's vocabulary keeps improving There is growing evidence that the past year of lockdowns has had an impact on young children's language skills, according to research. Data from 50,000 pupils and a survey of schools across England have shown an increased number of four- and five-year-olds needing help with language. Evidence shows poor speech development can have long-term effects on learning. The government says it is investing Â£18m in early-years catch-up, including extra help for those in Reception year. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) research suggests the measures taken to combat the pandemic have deprived the youngest children of social contact and experiences essential for increasing vocabulary. Less or no contact with grandparents, social distancing, no play dates, and the wearing of face coverings in public have left children less exposed to conversations and everyday experiences. Of 58 primary schools surveyed across England: 76% said pupils starting school in September 2020 needed more support with communication than in previous years 96% they were concerned about pupils' speech-and-language development. And 56% of parents were concerned about their child starting at school following the lockdown in the spring and summer. Niamh, in Reception at Ryders Hayes Primary School, in Walsall, is slowly building her confidence with words. Like many children, her life has been limited by the pandemic, her social circle shrinking to her immediate family. And this left her mother, Lisa, anxious about her starting school. Lisa, whose surname we have not used, was worried about her daughter starting school ""She was one of the youngest in the year and it worried me that other children had got more school experience with nursery or pre-school,"" Lisa said. ""We tried to prepare her as well as we could. She was looking forward to it - but she didn't know any of the children in the class, so we were a bit worried about that. ""My concern was, after being locked down all of the summer and not going out to play with her friends, how was she going to respond to a room full of new children and new teachers?"" But the school's approach had worked well. ""We never had a tearful morning - we never had a day where she didn't want to come to school,"" Lisa said. Five ways children could make up for lost school time Should I worry about my child's development in lockdown? Another mother at Ryder Hayes - Emma - was also worried about the school start and whether her son, Harry, would be able to articulate his needs. ""I was worried about him making friends, that if something was troubling him he'd be sat in the corner upset and he'd not be able to ask for help or say what was wrong with him, so I was concerned,"" she said. Emma, whose full name we have not used, says Harry is now ""a little chatterbox"" But Harry has been participating in the Nuffield Early Language Intervention at school, which can help children make up about three months' progress. ""It is making a huge difference,"" Emma said. ""He's become a little chatterbox. He's always asking questions and thinking more and asking more like, 'How does hair grow?' He's communicating his thoughts more."" The school's head teacher Saly Miner said problems with communication were ""really limiting"" for young children, particularly if they were unable to express themselves, interact with peers and make themselves understood. ""It's absolutely key,"" she said. ""It's all about a child's self-esteem and confidence. ""And without that, they're not going to feel happy, they're not going to be able to grow, they're not going to be able to gain all the benefits of interacting with their peers as we'd want them to, and interact with staff. ""All the research shows that if a child does have issues with language at that age, by adulthood they're four times more likely to struggle with reading, three time more likely to have mental health issues, twice as likely to be unemployed and have social-mobility issues, so getting this right at such an early age is literally the key to children's futures."" EEF chief executive Prof Becky Francis said there was ""huge concern expressed by schools about young children's speech and language following the impact of the pandemic"". ""We can see that in the survey results but also anecdotally right across our networks."" Catch-up plans 'not reaching poorest pupils' Generation Covid: How will they catch up? The EEF's findings are also reflected in data from the company Speech Link, which offers standardised assessments to primary schools. Among 50,000 four- and five-year-olds starting school in September, an extra 20-25% needed help with language skills compared with the previous year, the company found. There are also concerns about the impact of the pandemic on pre-school children. In some parts of England, up to 63% of health visitors, who check on the development of babies and toddlers, had been redeployed early in the pandemic, the Institute of Health Visiting said. Many families had missed out on face-to-face assessments, acting executive director Alison Morton said. ""We know there are children out there with difficulties who haven't been identified,"" she said. ""There hasn't been a 'build back better' for younger children in the way there has been for older children."" Children and Families Minister Vicky Ford said the earliest  years were ""the most crucial"". ""On top of the Â£3.5bn we have spent in each of the past three years on our free childcare entitlements, we have also invested Â£18m to support language development in the early years, part of our new Â£700m package to provide extra support to children who need it as they return to the classroom,"" she said. ""This includes funding to build on the early successes of the Nuffield Early Language Intervention scheme and roll it out to more schools, so that thousands more four- and five-year-olds whose language, communication and literacy skills have been impacted by the disruption of the past year will benefit from targeted support."" But Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said the government had treated children as ""an afterthought"" throughout the pandemic. ""Government 'catch-up' plans fall far short of what is needed for children to recover lost learning, including nothing on wellbeing or social development. In addition, their stealth cut to the pupil premium hinders schools' ability to put their own plans in place,"" she said. ""Labour want children to be at the heart of our national recovery.""

Lockdowns hurt child speech and language skills,"This video can not be played Assistant head teacher Victoria Day has five tips to ensure children's vocabulary keeps improving There is growing evidence that the past year of lockdowns has had an impact on young children's language skills, according to research. Data from 50,000 pupils and a survey of schools across England have shown an increased number of four- and five-year-olds needing help with language. Evidence shows poor speech development can have long-term effects on learning. The government says it is investing Â£18m in early-years catch-up, including extra help for those in Reception year. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) research suggests the measures taken to combat the pandemic have deprived the youngest children of social contact and experiences essential for increasing vocabulary. Less or no contact with grandparents, social distancing, no play dates, and the wearing of face coverings in public have left children less exposed to conversations and everyday experiences. Of 58 primary schools surveyed across England: 76% said pupils starting school in September 2020 needed more support with communication than in previous years 96% they were concerned about pupils' speech-and-language development. And 56% of parents were concerned about their child starting at school following the lockdown in the spring and summer. Niamh, in Reception at Ryders Hayes Primary School, in Walsall, is slowly building her confidence with words. Like many children, her life has been limited by the pandemic, her social circle shrinking to her immediate family. And this left her mother, Lisa, anxious about her starting school. Lisa, whose surname we have not used, was worried about her daughter starting school ""She was one of the youngest in the year and it worried me that other children had got more school experience with nursery or pre-school,"" Lisa said. ""We tried to prepare her as well as we could. She was looking forward to it - but she didn't know any of the children in the class, so we were a bit worried about that. ""My concern was, after being locked down all of the summer and not going out to play with her friends, how was she going to respond to a room full of new children and new teachers?"" But the school's approach had worked well. ""We never had a tearful morning - we never had a day where she didn't want to come to school,"" Lisa said. Five ways children could make up for lost school time Should I worry about my child's development in lockdown? Another mother at Ryder Hayes - Emma - was also worried about the school start and whether her son, Harry, would be able to articulate his needs. ""I was worried about him making friends, that if something was troubling him he'd be sat in the corner upset and he'd not be able to ask for help or say what was wrong with him, so I was concerned,"" she said. Emma, whose full name we have not used, says Harry is now ""a little chatterbox"" But Harry has been participating in the Nuffield Early Language Intervention at school, which can help children make up about three months' progress. ""It is making a huge difference,"" Emma said. ""He's become a little chatterbox. He's always asking questions and thinking more and asking more like, 'How does hair grow?' He's communicating his thoughts more."" The school's head teacher Saly Miner said problems with communication were ""really limiting"" for young children, particularly if they were unable to express themselves, interact with peers and make themselves understood. ""It's absolutely key,"" she said. ""It's all about a child's self-esteem and confidence. ""And without that, they're not going to feel happy, they're not going to be able to grow, they're not going to be able to gain all the benefits of interacting with their peers as we'd want them to, and interact with staff. ""All the research shows that if a child does have issues with language at that age, by adulthood they're four times more likely to struggle with reading, three time more likely to have mental health issues, twice as likely to be unemployed and have social-mobility issues, so getting this right at such an early age is literally the key to children's futures."" EEF chief executive Prof Becky Francis said there was ""huge concern expressed by schools about young children's speech and language following the impact of the pandemic"". ""We can see that in the survey results but also anecdotally right across our networks."" Catch-up plans 'not reaching poorest pupils' Generation Covid: How will they catch up? The EEF's findings are also reflected in data from the company Speech Link, which offers standardised assessments to primary schools. Among 50,000 four- and five-year-olds starting school in September, an extra 20-25% needed help with language skills compared with the previous year, the company found. There are also concerns about the impact of the pandemic on pre-school children. In some parts of England, up to 63% of health visitors, who check on the development of babies and toddlers, had been redeployed early in the pandemic, the Institute of Health Visiting said. Many families had missed out on face-to-face assessments, acting executive director Alison Morton said. ""We know there are children out there with difficulties who haven't been identified,"" she said. ""There hasn't been a 'build back better' for younger children in the way there has been for older children."" Children and Families Minister Vicky Ford said the earliest  years were ""the most crucial"". ""On top of the Â£3.5bn we have spent in each of the past three years on our free childcare entitlements, we have also invested Â£18m to support language development in the early years, part of our new Â£700m package to provide extra support to children who need it as they return to the classroom,"" she said. ""This includes funding to build on the early successes of the Nuffield Early Language Intervention scheme and roll it out to more schools, so that thousands more four- and five-year-olds whose language, communication and literacy skills have been impacted by the disruption of the past year will benefit from targeted support."" But Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said the government had treated children as ""an afterthought"" throughout the pandemic. ""Government 'catch-up' plans fall far short of what is needed for children to recover lost learning, including nothing on wellbeing or social development. In addition, their stealth cut to the pupil premium hinders schools' ability to put their own plans in place,"" she said. ""Labour want children to be at the heart of our national recovery.""

Premier Inn owner braces for UK holiday boom,"Premier Inn owner Whitbread has said it expects strong demand for holidays in the UK throughout the summer as Covid restrictions ease further from mid-May. The hotel and restaurant firm forecasts ""a significant bounce in leisure demand in our tourist locations"". At the same time, Whitbread laid bare the impact of the pandemic on its business as annual losses reached Â£1bn and sales tumbled by more than 70%. The firm said last year was the ""most challenging in our 279 year history"". It revealed that it had benefitted from Â£270m worth of government support during coronavirus, including the furlough scheme. Whitbread, which also owns the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurant chains, said almost all of its 800 UK and Ireland hotels, some 92%, were now open. This compares with just 39 that were opened during the first lockdown when they were used to provide accommodation for essential workers. â¢Lockdown rules have changed again - what's happening? When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Recent lockdowns saw its hotels at just 23% of potential occupancy in January and 29% in February. The company said: ""Strong demand is expected for 'staycations' in UK tourist destinations throughout the summer, with business and event-led leisure demand starting to gradually recover thereafter."" It also plans to invest Â£350m this year, which will go partly toward refurbishments, but also to new advertising, which will again feature comedian and actor Sir Lenny Henry. Despite this investment programme, it still intends to cut Â£100m in costs. Last year, it warned it may have to lay off thousands of staff and approached landlords for a temporary rent cut. It also scrapped its dividend payout to shareholders, while directors and senior management took pay cuts. It employs some 30,000 staff, 27,000 of which were furloughed under the Job Retention Scheme. Whitbread's chief executive, Alison Brittain, said: ""The vaccination programme in the UK means we can look forward to the planned relaxation of government restrictions as we move into summer, with the first major milestone being the return of leisure guests to our hotels, and the full reopening of restaurants from 17 May. ""We expect a significant bounce in leisure demand in our tourist locations during the summer, followed by a gradual recovery in business and event-driven leisure demand."" Julie Palmer from professional services firm, Begbies Traynor, said: ""After having been able to report positive results and sell its profitable Costa arm to focus on hotels in previous years Whitbread, like so many others in this industry, has been rocked by the pandemic. ""It can get back on its feet again, but the Whitbread we saw before the pandemic could be different to the one we see after it. Even after all restrictions are removed change is coming.""

US police mock dementia sufferer during arrest,"This video can not be played Watch the moment officer says: ""I love it"" US police officers are seen mocking a 73-year-old woman with dementia as they watch video of her shoulder going ""pop"" during her forcible arrest, according to footage released by her lawyer. Karen Garner was detained on 26 June last year after she walked out of a Walmart store in the state of Colorado without paying for $13 (Â£9) of items. Her elbow was fractured and shoulder dislocated, says her lawyer. An investigation has been launched into the Loveland Police Department arrest. In the footage released on Monday from the booking area of the police station on the day of the arrest, officers are seen fist-bumping one another as they review body camera video of the incident. Video from inside Ms Garner's nearby holding cell shows the frail-looking grandmother slumped handcuffed to a bench while the officers joke about the incident, says her lawyer. ""Ready for the pop? Hear the pop?"" one of the officers says at one point, referring to Ms Garner's shoulder. As they continue to watch the footage, the same officer says: ""I love it."" Don't shoot, I'm disabled The Garner family hired a sound engineer to enhance audio of the officers' remarks. Their lawyer has filed a federal lawsuit against the department, alleging the officers violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and ""violently assaulted"" Ms Garner. Attorney Sarah Schielke says her client went six hours without medical help while confused and crying in pain after an arrest that amounted to ""torture"". ""They failed Karen Garner,"" Ms Schielke said in a press release. ""They failed the community. And they did it all on camera."" Loveland police said in a statement on Monday they would not be making any comments pending the results of a ""criminal investigation"" launched last week. The Larimer County district attorney is looking into the department's use of force during Ms Garner's arrest. Loveland police chief Robert Ticer has pledged full transparency with the inquiry, which will be led by Fort Collins Police. One officer has been placed on administrative leave and two others moved to administrative duties. The bodycam footage caused public outcry when it was released earlier this month. It shows two police officers stopping Ms Garner as she was picking flowers by the roadside after she left the Walmart store in the town of Loveland, about 50 miles (80km) north of Denver. CCTV from the supermarket shortly beforehand showed members of staff stopping Ms Garner to recover the $13.38 of merchandise, which included cans of fizzy drinks and laundry detergent. After she walks away from the officers, she is thrown to the ground, handcuffed, shoved face down on the bonnet of the police car and has her legs tied together with a hobble. She was left bleeding. Ms Garner's daughter-in-law, Shannon Steward, told the Denver Post the arrest had worsened Ms Garner's dementia. ""She hasn't come back the way she was before,"" Ms Steward told the newspaper. ""It was too much."" The release of the footage comes amid a nationwide reckoning over police brutality, especially against African Americans, although Ms Garner is white.

Book sales surge in 2020 as UK rediscovers reading,"UK consumer book sales climbed 7% to Â£2.1bn last year as people ""rediscovered their love of reading"" in lockdown, the industry body says. Demand for fiction and non-fiction jumped, while audio-book sales were up 37%, the Publishers Association said. Bestsellers included The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman, Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo and 7 Ways by Jamie Oliver. But educational book sales slumped as schools were shut for months. Stephen Lotinga, chief executive of the Publishers' Association, said: ""It's clear that many people rediscovered their love of reading last year and that publishers were able to deliver the entertaining and thought-provoking books that so many of us needed. ""But we shouldn't ignore the fact that it's been a particularly challenging year for education publishers and many smaller publishers. ""It's also been a hugely difficult time for many booksellers and authors whose livelihoods have been enormously disrupted.""

The consumer market performed particularly well, with sales of fiction up 16% and non-fiction by 4%. Print accounted for Â£1.7bn of those sales (up 4%) while for digital it was Â£418m, up 24%. Other bestselling titles included The Mirror and the Light by Hilary Mantel and Barack Obama's memoir A Promised Land, published in November, which sold well in audio. The UK's enormous academic publishing industry also remained in good shape, with total income up 3% at Â£3.3bn. But sales of school textbooks and word books fell by a fifth. Mr Lotinga said: ""With bookshops now able to reopen, and physical events returning, we are optimistic that people will soon be able to enjoy books together again.

US to share up to 60m AstraZeneca vaccine doses,"The US will share up to 60 million doses of its AstraZeneca vaccine with other countries as they become available, the White House has said. The doses will be able to be exported in the coming months after a federal safety review. The US has a stockpile of the vaccine even though its regulators have not yet authorised it for public use. Critics have accused the government of hoarding the vaccine, while other countries are in desperate need. India sets another Covid record as crisis deepens EU sues AstraZeneca over Covid vaccine delays Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Last month President Joe Biden pledged to share aboutfour million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Mexico and Canada- both of which have approved the jab. The crisis in Indiahas also piled pressure on the Biden administration to share US health resources. On Monday, the White House said it expected that about 10 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine could be released when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finishes its review in the coming weeks. It said that another 50 million doses were in various stages of production. At a news briefing, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said FDA officials would carry out quality checks on doses before they were exported. ""Our team will share more details about our planning and who will be receiving offers from here, but we're in the planning process at this point in time,"" she added. The US has already announced that it will provide raw materials for Indian vaccine manufacturers as the country battles a devastating surge in cases. In a ""warm and positive"" phone call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, President Biden promised more emergency assistance ""including oxygen-related supplies, vaccine materials and therapeutics"", a White House statement said. Washington is also looking at supplying oxygen, Covid tests, personal protective equipment (PPE) and the antiviral drug remdesivir to India's health service. The FDA has so far authorised three vaccines against Covid- 19 - Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen). Experts say it looks likely that these will provide all the country's needs and the AstraZeneca jab may not be needed. According to the latest figures, more than 53% of adults have so far received at least one dose of vaccine. The US handling of the coronavirus pandemic has had plenty of shortcomings, but vaccine production isn't one of them. The Biden administration has an abundance of jabs, and now it is sharing some of that bounty with other countries. The decision to ship as many as 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine - which have yet to be approved for use in the US - comes at a critical moment, with US neighbours Canada and Mexico continuing to struggle and India facing a devastating surge in cases. It gives the Biden administration the opportunity to engage in ""vaccine diplomacy"" - using the shipments to pressure other nations to follow suit and engender goodwill that might help advance other US foreign policy priorities. At the very least it inoculates Joe Biden from criticism that the US has turned its back on the world as it sat on millions of doses that weren't needed - or wanted - when they could be saving lives. The domestic risk for the president seems minimal, as long as the US supply holds up. It signals the administration's growing confidence that the domestic challenge ahead isn't one of having enough jabs, but convincing all Americans to receive vaccinations that are already available.

Updates were brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright, Paul Kirby, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Holly Wallis and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. Here's a recap of the UK's coronavirus news today:  We're drawing the live page to a close for the day soon. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest developments from around the world today:  A US state says it will offer young people a $100 (Â£72) savings bond if they receive a Covid-19 vaccine. West Virginia saysit hopes the payment for those aged 16 to 35 will ""motivate"" them to get the jab. ""Our kids today probably don't really realise just how important they are in shutting this thing down,"" State Governor Jim Justice said on Monday. West Virginia had been among the top US states for vaccination rates, but progress has slowed in recent weeks. There are particular concerns that younger people may be more hesitant about receiving a jab. The incentive means those who are vaccinated within the age group can retrieve the $100, plus interest, at a later date. It will also be offered to anyone aged 16 to 35 who has already been vaccinated. West Virginia has the 16th highest rate of new coronavirus cases per person among US states, according to the New York Times. Conversely,a Miami school has discouraged teachers from getting the Covid vaccine, saying any vaccinated employees will be barred from interacting with students. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wait to receive vaccines in Ruili over the weekend There is a lot of fanfare today in the Chinese city of
Ruili, where the authorities have lifted stay-at-home orders for people in
low-risk areas. Ruili, in southwestern Yunnan province, has been the site
of Chinaâs one domestic Covid-19 outbreak over the last month. There have been
more than 100 confirmed cases in the China-Myanmar border city since 30 March,
affecting both Chinese and Burmese nationals. The city implemented strict lockdowns in March, with a
number of city districts becoming âmediumâ or âhigh-riskâ. In these areas, people were

Baker told the Manx House of Keys: ""Progress is being made day by day, week by week, but it is being heavily impacted by the ongoing impact of coronavirus.""

BBC Radio 5 Live With a deadly second wave of Covid infections happening in India, BBC Radio 5 Live Drive has been hearing from people whose family and friends have been affected. Harsimrat Kaur lives in London with her husband Jagjit Singh and has relatives in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Her aunt and cousin have both died of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks. Harsimrat said: ""It hit home really hardâ¦ two people from the same family, theyâve got young kids as wellâ¦ I donât have any words, itâs just insane what is happening.â Harsimrat explained that her cousin managed to get a hospital bed ""after fighting for days with the doctors"" but still couldnât get oxygen or treatment there. Her aunt never got into hospital and had been ""struggling for oxygen"" too. Following the recent birth of their baby boy, both Harsimrat and her husband feel jumping on a plane to be with their family on compassionate grounds, would be âtoo much of a riskâ for their sonâs health. She added that her and her husband also âjust canât affordâ to travel to India and then spend two weeks in hotel quarantine. They have applied for a visa to allow some members of their family to come to the UK, when international travel opens up again. Listen back to the conversation on BBC Sounds. Leisure centres, outdoor attractions and hairdressers are open to customers across much of the UK, for the first time in months since coronavirus restrictions were imposed. But what are the rules in the UK's different nations? Here's our explainer of the rules below - which you can read it in fullhere. InEngland:  InWales:  InScotland:  InNorthern Ireland: Love of Lesbian played to a crowd of 5,000 Researchers in Spain have found ""no sign"" of higher levels of infection among people who took part in a large test concert last month. Six people tested positive within 14 days of attending the gig in Barcelona, but the incidence was lower than that seen in the general population. Around 5,000 music fans took part in the experiment after testing negative for Covid-19. Revellers wore masks but did not have to socially distance. Of the six people who tested positive, researchers concluded that four of them were infected elsewhere, not at the event itself. Spanish authorities let the show, featuring band Love of Lesbian, go ahead as part of a research project. The rate of infection among attendees was half the rate of people of the same age in Barcelona, researchers found. ""There is no sign that suggests transmission took place during the event,"" infectious disease specialist Josep Maria Llibre told a news conference on Tuesday. Read more here. More than 1.5 million Moroccans were arrested in the last nine months for not respecting Covid measures, a top official has said. This translates to a rate of more than 5,700 people arrested every day during that timeframe, Deputy Interior Minister Noureddine Boutayeb said, according to the 2M TV channel. ""Although this number seems large, it indicates a great involvement of all the authorities in charge of law enforcement,"" he told parliament. Failure to wear protective masks, respect curfews and travel bans were among the main offences, according to the Hespress website. Last year, Morocco rejected allegations of police abuse in taking measures to combat the spread of coronavirus in the country. This came after a top official at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) included the country in a list of states where the authorities' response to the pandemic had raised concerns. Almost 9,000 people have been reported to have lost their lives to Covid-19 in the country of 36 million people. A customer picks up a token that can be exchanged for a beer at the Warpigs Brewpub in Copenhagen A bar in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, has come up with a novel way of tempting its customers back in. In return for 149 kroner (Â£17, $24), punters at Warpigs Brewpub are able to take a test and wait for the result with a free beer. After half an hour, if they test negative, they are allowed inside the bar. It works as part ofthe country's coronapas (corona passport) systemwhich allows Danes to show proof that they are infection-free. Although they can get hold of free government-provided tests, the bar's customers
say the paid-for versions let them avoid the queues at testing centres. Warpigs says it's trying this out in partnership with a medical company to see if there's appetite for the scheme. One customer seemed happy enough: ""It [the test] costs some money, but you get a free beer - paid beer I guess, but you get a beer. And it was worth it. It took two minutes, you did it yourself, it wasn't uncomfortable and I got 'negative', so it's a win-win in my opinion,"" Nicolai Marteens told Reuters news agency. Health authorities in Bangladesh have approved the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, for emergency use amid uncertainty over deliveries from neighbouring India. The director-general of the Bangladeshi Drug Administration, Mahbubur Rahman, said the country was expecting the arrival of about four million doses from Russia next month. Rahman also indicated that Bangladesh could approve China's Sinopharm vaccine shortly. India has halted exports
of the AstraZeneca vaccinein response to a record surge in domestic infections. Assome MPs call for a review of fixed penalty noticesfor Covid lockdown breaches today, we've been hearing from people who were issued fines. One public sector worker told us he has been left in debt after being given a Â£1,000 fine for going to a friend's house for drinks. He and his wife, who was a nurse, met up with friends on the 11th day of self-isolation after a holiday abroad. At the time, the self-isolation period was 14 days. They'd both had Covid earlier in the year and thought the party posed minimal risk. ""It was wrong, I admit it and I came clean about it. But Â£1,000 is a ridiculous amount
of money. I'm still paying it off every month out of my wages, it's an impossible situation,"" the father-of-three explained. And in Manchester, Abe, 29, was fined after he went to a BBQ in January with four friends, and a neighbour called the police. He was issued two fines of Â£200 each, instead of one. After challenging the mistake, both fines were withdrawn, but his friends each paid their fines. ""Most people just pay the fine because theyâre
scared - the letters are alarming and say ""criminal records office"". It also concerned me that police were attending these calls when there are so many other serious issues,"" he said. There have been a further 17 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's latest figures.,external That brings the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,451. There were also a further 2,685 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Over the last few days, Chinese media have been
dominated by reports on the catastrophic scenes in India. State media yesterday
noted that China had sent hundreds of oxygen concentrators, and was vowing to
send 10,000 more. The national Global Times newspaper said that the country
would âkeep in contact with India for urgent supportâ. Today, the Global Times has criticised the US for
not responding in the same way. It says that âUS aid to India is long overdueâ,
and says that âcountries with strong, anti-epidemic capabilities must shoulder
greater responsibilitiesâ. The Xinhua news agency says that only 1.4% of Indiaâs
population have been vaccinated, and that âthe US is hoarding Covid-19
vaccinesâ. It adds that this comes amid other developing nations denouncing US
âvaccine apartheidâ. Chinese media have been keen to highlight
internal divisions between ordinary Indians and the elite. They were critical
of Indiaâs super-rich chartering eight private jets to London ahead of being
included on the UK governmentâs red list,
and The Paper notes that some Bollywood stars have been trolled for taking
holiday photos in the Maldives as the situation continues to escalate. Meanwhile, papers have been speaking to Chinese
nationals who are based in India. One called Niko told Beijing News that she
has tested positive for Covid-19, âbut the hospital said on 13 April that
hospital beds were all occupiedâ¦ so Iâve had no choice but to take medicine at
homeâ. In a video shared by the Global Times, a student,
Ms Chen, says that âthere are no flights; I can only stay at home and protect
myselfâ. An NHS boss has praised the ""heroic efforts"" of all those involved in the vaccine roll out as the UK reaches one-in-four adults having had their second jab. But Ruth Rankine, primary care director at the NHS Confederation, has urged everyone to stick to lockdown rules, warning that the pandemic is not yet over. She says: ""Today we reach another milestone in the UK's vaccination campaign and this is yet more evidence of the heroic efforts of so many people across the NHS, including and especially primary care, to make sure as many people as possible are protected."" ""But at the same time, we need to continue to follow the rules, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks to make sure the progress we have made in recent weeks can continue. ""With growing numbers of cases in the UK of mutant strains of the virus, we must not fall into the trap of believing the crisis is over.""

Assistant head teacher Victoria Day has shared her top tips to help children with their communication. The Brazilian congress is launching an inquiry today into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed almost 400,000 people. The commission could potentially lead to the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro. He's been widely criticised for his anti-lockdown, vaccine-sceptic stance. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Bolsonaro said he's ""not worried"" by the commission - but his chance of re-election next year could be at stake. On Monday, Brazil's health regulator rejected requests from several states to receive batches of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V. The UK has fully vaccinated a quarter of its adult population against coronavirus and is on track to offer a first jab to all adults by the end of July, the government says. Public Health England data shows
vaccines are already having a significant impact in the UK in reducing
hospitalisations and deaths, and saved more than 10,000 lives between December
and March. Data from the ONS and Oxford University shows that
COVID-19 infections fell by 65% after the first dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, and further after the second
dose. The latest vaccine effectiveness data from PHE
show that in those aged over 70, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and
Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines reduce the risk of getting symptomatic disease by
around 60% after a single dose. This protection lasts for several weeks. In
those aged over 80, protection against hospitalisation is around 80% and the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 85% effective at stopping people aged over 80 dying
from COVID-19. Rolling reviews are under way by the MHRA to

Updates were brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright, Paul Kirby, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Holly Wallis and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. Here's a recap of the UK's coronavirus news today:  We're drawing the live page to a close for the day soon. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest developments from around the world today:  A US state says it will offer young people a $100 (Â£72) savings bond if they receive a Covid-19 vaccine. West Virginia saysit hopes the payment for those aged 16 to 35 will ""motivate"" them to get the jab. ""Our kids today probably don't really realise just how important they are in shutting this thing down,"" State Governor Jim Justice said on Monday. West Virginia had been among the top US states for vaccination rates, but progress has slowed in recent weeks. There are particular concerns that younger people may be more hesitant about receiving a jab. The incentive means those who are vaccinated within the age group can retrieve the $100, plus interest, at a later date. It will also be offered to anyone aged 16 to 35 who has already been vaccinated. West Virginia has the 16th highest rate of new coronavirus cases per person among US states, according to the New York Times. Conversely,a Miami school has discouraged teachers from getting the Covid vaccine, saying any vaccinated employees will be barred from interacting with students. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wait to receive vaccines in Ruili over the weekend There is a lot of fanfare today in the Chinese city of
Ruili, where the authorities have lifted stay-at-home orders for people in
low-risk areas. Ruili, in southwestern Yunnan province, has been the site
of Chinaâs one domestic Covid-19 outbreak over the last month. There have been
more than 100 confirmed cases in the China-Myanmar border city since 30 March,
affecting both Chinese and Burmese nationals. The city implemented strict lockdowns in March, with a
number of city districts becoming âmediumâ or âhigh-riskâ. In these areas, people were
under strict orders to stay at home. All but essential businesses closed.
Students began having online classes, and transport links were suspended. Thousands of medical workers from outside of the city were
also sent to the front-line. However, today, media note that they have
âcompleted their missionâ, and footage is circulating showing local residents
dancing and waving to see them off. There were also fireworks set off yesterday evening
following the announcement that in areas that had recently returned to being

"Every lockdown fine should be reviewed, say MPsMany of the 93,000 fixed penalties issued in England and Wales were discriminatory or unfair, MPs argue.UK","All fixed penalty notices for Covid lockdown breaches, which can be as high as Â£10,000, should be reviewed - according to a parliamentary committee. The system is ""muddled, discriminatory and unfair"", MPs on the Joint Committee on Human Rights argued. More than 85,000 fixed penalty notices have been issued in England since the pandemic began, and  8,000 in Wales. A government spokesperson said it was right there were consequences for those who most flagrantly breached the rules. The JCHR, which is made up of MPs and peers, said it had ""significant concerns"" about the validity of fines, the inadequacy of the review and appeal process, the size of the penalties and the criminalisation of those who could not afford to pay. ""The whole process disproportionately hits the less well-off and criminalises the poor over the better off,"" said committee chairwoman Harriet Harman. Fines increase during third national lockdown Patel defends police lockdown fines Women's lockdown exercise fines dropped While the committee recognised swift action had been needed in the face of the pandemic, the government needed to ensure rules were clear, enforcement was fair and that mistakes could be rectified, she said, adding: ""None of that is the case in respect of Covid-19 fixed penalty notices."" Ms Harman said police had a difficult job enforcing the rules during the pandemic, but warned a ""lack of legal clarity"" meant there could be a large number of wrongly issued fines. The Labour MP added: ""This means we've got an unfair system - with clear evidence that young people, those from certain ethnic minority backgrounds, men, and the most socially deprived, are most at risk.

According to the report, coronavirus rules have changed at least 65 times since March 2020. ""It is possible to tell from penalties that have not been paid and have then progressed through the system towards a prosecution, that a significant number of FPNs are incorrectly issued,"" the committee said. It highlighted a Crown Prosecution Service review of prosecutions under coronavirus regulations which found in February that 27% of the defendants had been incorrectly charged. In January, two womenreceived an apology and had their fines waivedafter being given fixed penalty notices after driving to a Derbyshire beauty spot for exercise. A solicitor's daughter received a fixed penalty notice (FPN) in March while in halls of residence at the University of Nottingham. Jane, who did not want to share her surname, told the BBC her daughter was visiting another flat for a ""get together"" with eight others. She said all nine had previously tested positive for Covid-19 and were ""playing cards and listening to smooth jazz"". Then the police entered the flat shouting ""where is everyone?"", according to Jane. She said they were ""aggressive and overbearing"". Those who did not live in the flat then returned to their own residences - but were still issued with Â£100 fines, rising to Â£200 if paid late. Jane said: ""[The police] did not at any time follow the National Police Chiefs' Council guidance to 'engage, âexplain, encourage, enforce'."" Jane paid the Â£200 fine and has now requested a review by Nottinghamshire Police, but is yet to hear back. Nottinghamshire Police Chief Constable Craig Guildford said the force had a duty to protect the public ""and this was clearly an illegal gathering taking place in halls of residence, where dozens of other students live as well"". He said that police have followed the four Es of approach of engaging, explaining, encouraging and then enforcing as a last resort throughout most of the first year of the pandemic. And he added: ""By now the laws around Covid can come as a surprise to no one - and where people are blatantly or repeatedly holding parties or going to parties outside their own home they really shouldn't be shocked to be given a fine.""

"US police mock dementia sufferer during arrestThe Colorado officers are seen reviewing a clip where the 73-year-old's shoulder goes ""pop"".US & Canada","This video can not be played Watch the moment officer says: ""I love it"" US police officers are seen mocking a 73-year-old woman with dementia as they watch video of her shoulder going ""pop"" during her forcible arrest, according to footage released by her lawyer. Karen Garner was detained on 26 June last year after she walked out of a Walmart store in the state of Colorado without paying for $13 (Â£9) of items. Her elbow was fractured and shoulder dislocated, says her lawyer. An investigation has been launched into the Loveland Police Department arrest. In the footage released on Monday from the booking area of the police station on the day of the arrest, officers are seen fist-bumping one another as they review body camera video of the incident. Video from inside Ms Garner's nearby holding cell shows the frail-looking grandmother slumped handcuffed to a bench while the officers joke about the incident, says her lawyer. ""Ready for the pop? Hear the pop?"" one of the officers says at one point, referring to Ms Garner's shoulder. As they continue to watch the footage, the same officer says: ""I love it."" Don't shoot, I'm disabled The Garner family hired a sound engineer to enhance audio of the officers' remarks. Their lawyer has filed a federal lawsuit against the department, alleging the officers violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and ""violently assaulted"" Ms Garner. Attorney Sarah Schielke says her client went six hours without medical help while confused and crying in pain after an arrest that amounted to ""torture"". ""They failed Karen Garner,"" Ms Schielke said in a press release. ""They failed the community. And they did it all on camera."" Loveland police said in a statement on Monday they would not be making any comments pending the results of a ""criminal investigation"" launched last week. The Larimer County district attorney is looking into the department's use of force during Ms Garner's arrest. Loveland police chief Robert Ticer has pledged full transparency with the inquiry, which will be led by Fort Collins Police. One officer has been placed on administrative leave and two others moved to administrative duties. The bodycam footage caused public outcry when it was released earlier this month. It shows two police officers stopping Ms Garner as she was picking flowers by the roadside after she left the Walmart store in the town of Loveland, about 50 miles (80km) north of Denver. CCTV from the supermarket shortly beforehand showed members of staff stopping Ms Garner to recover the $13.38 of merchandise, which included cans of fizzy drinks and laundry detergent. After she walks away from the officers, she is thrown to the ground, handcuffed, shoved face down on the bonnet of the police car and has her legs tied together with a hobble. She was left bleeding. Ms Garner's daughter-in-law, Shannon Steward, told the Denver Post the arrest had worsened Ms Garner's dementia. ""She hasn't come back the way she was before,"" Ms Steward told the newspaper. ""It was too much."" The release of the footage comes amid a nationwide reckoning over police brutality, especially against African Americans, although Ms Garner is white.

French warn UK ahead of Brexit trade deal voteFrench concern over fishing rights overshadows a key European Parliament vote on EU-UK trade.Europe,"EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen oversees trade relations with the UK The European Parliament has ratified the post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal - a key move to ensure that tariff- and quota-free trade continues. The Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) has been operating provisionally since January. MEPs voted in favour by 660 votes to 5, while 32 abstained. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, said the vote ""brings certainty and allows us to focus on the future"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of a ""final step in a long journey"". The trade deal provided ""stability to our new relationship with the EU as vital trading partners, close allies and sovereign equals"", he said. The result, announced on Wednesday after a vote late on Tuesday, was also welcomed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier Ms von der Leyen said the TCA ""comes with real teeth, with a binding dispute settlement mechanism"". And she warned that the EU would use those teeth if necessary. The parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt described the deal as ""a failure for both sides, but better than nothing"". Lord Frost's opposite number in the Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, was also less than flattering. ""This is a divorce. It is a warning, Brexit. It's a failure of the European Union and we have to learn lessons from it,"" he told MEPs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit tensions remain, including a French threat of ""reprisals"" against the UK over new fishing restrictions. Northern Ireland trade is also a thorny issue. Under a separate protocol, Northern Ireland remains de facto part of the EU's single market, so goods arriving there from Britain have to undergo EU checks. Since Brexit there has been some disruption to that trade. The TCA covers EU-UK trade in goods, but not services. The UK economy is dominated by services - sectors such as banking, insurance, advertising and legal advice. What are the key points of the Brexit deal? 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal The TCA has still resulted in more paperwork, extra costs and less trade between the two sides, since the UK left the EU. A European Parliament resolution,externaldescribed the UK's exit from the EU as ""a historic mistake"". Among the areas not covered by the deal are foreign policy, financial services and student exchanges. Before the MEPs' debate started on Tuesday, French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune accused the UK of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with ""reprisals"" in financial services. ""The United Kingdom is expecting quite a few authorisations from us for financial services. We won't give any for as long as we don't have guarantees on fishing and other issues,"" he said on French news channel BFMTV. French fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Meanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish. Scottish firms account for most of that business, and some now face collapse. EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister The UK made fishing rights a key issue in the negotiations, with control over access to its waters seen as a sign of British sovereignty. Praising the TCAwhen it was agreed in December, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said""we have taken back control of our laws and our destiny"". He described it as ""a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends"". 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump In Tuesday's debate, German MEP David McAllister said Brexit ""will always be a lose-lose situation"", but he backed the TCA. It is a 1,400-page deal which was not clinched until 24 December. The Brexit negotiations began in 2017 and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Common rules remained during the UK's transition period until January 2021. After nearly four years of difficult negotiations on the UK exit from the EU and the post-Brexit relationship, it's hardly surprising that a few bruises are showing. The TCA certainly hasn't solved everything. There are still big questions to resolve on issues like financial services, for example. Monitoring and implementing what has been agreed, in a complex network of committees, will also be a constant feature of the new relationship. But it will take some time before the long-term effect on trade becomes clear. Trade volumes fell sharply in January before rebounding in February. But theUK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex,externalsays UK exports to the EU were still down by 17.2% in February compared to an average of February 2018 to 2020. A significant part is down to Brexit, although Covid is also a factor. The most prominent post-Brexit issue so far this year, though, isn't part of the TCA itself.  Northern Ireland's trading relationship with the rest of the UK, and with the EU, won't change as a result of this agreement being ratified. Both sides say they are working hard to find practical solutions in Northern Ireland, but some checks on trade between NI and Britain will remain in place. This video can not be played Is the point-scoring coming to an end - or have we only seen the first half of this grudge match? The European Commission has launched legal action, accusing the UK of breaching the agreement on Northern Ireland trade and breaking international law - charges Downing Street denies. Brexit also means: Blanket free movement of citizens between the UK and EU no longer applies. Business travellers do not need a visa for short trips, but artists and performers are not covered - so, for example, British rock bands face bureaucracy for gigs in the EU The rights of the roughly one million UK citizens living in the EU, and of EU citizens in the UK, are protected under the TCA. But the UK citizens face varying deadlines for obtaining residence rights; for the three million EU citizens in the UK the deadline for applications is 30 June Government subsidies are now under intense scrutiny on both sides, as the EU insists on a ""level playing field"" in trade. Courts will have to decide in cases where subsidies are allegedly unfair. UK financial services, not covered by the TCA, face new EU bureaucracy - so many City banks have beefed up their EU-based operations. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Euro MPs' vote bolsters EU-UK Brexit trade deal EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister UK exports to European Union drop 40% in January 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas, says No.10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

"LiveLiveCovid fines system muddled and unfair, say MPs2 minutes ago","A quarter of UK adults - more than 13m people - have had both doses of a Covid vaccine Those aged 42 and 43 are now being invited to take up a first jab Prime Minister Boris Johnson chairs a cabinet meeting amid controversy over comments he denies making about a third lockdown No 10 denies Johnson said he would rather see ""bodies pile high"" than announce a third lockdown; It does not deny he said he would rather let coronavirus ""rip"" than impose tighter restrictions He told senior government colleagues the UK is not out of the pandemic woods yet as variants of concern continue to emerge Makeshift pyres are being built in crematoriums in India's capital Delhi as space runs out to cremate the dead Medical supplies from the UK have arrived in India - the first international shipment aimed at stemming the effects of a devastating Covid-19 surge Portugal registers no Covid-related deaths for 24 hours for the second time since the pandemic began Fines for Covid lockdown breaches should be reviewed because they hit poorer people, a committee of UK MPs and peers says Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for being with us for our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright, Paul Kirby, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Holly Wallis and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. Here's a recap of the UK's coronavirus news today:  We're drawing the live page to a close for the day soon. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest developments from around the world today:  A US state says it will offer young people a $100 (Â£72) savings bond if they receive a Covid-19 vaccine. West Virginia saysit hopes the payment for those aged 16 to 35 will ""motivate"" them to get the jab. ""Our kids today probably don't really realise just how important they are in shutting this thing down,"" State Governor Jim Justice said on Monday. West Virginia had been among the top US states for vaccination rates, but progress has slowed in recent weeks. There are particular concerns that younger people may be more hesitant about receiving a jab. The incentive means those who are vaccinated within the age group can retrieve the $100, plus interest, at a later date. It will also be offered to anyone aged 16 to 35 who has already been vaccinated. West Virginia has the 16th highest rate of new coronavirus cases per person among US states, according to the New York Times. Conversely,a Miami school has discouraged teachers from getting the Covid vaccine, saying any vaccinated employees will be barred from interacting with students. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wait to receive vaccines in Ruili over the weekend There is a lot of fanfare today in the Chinese city of
Ruili, where the authorities have lifted stay-at-home orders for people in
low-risk areas. Ruili, in southwestern Yunnan province, has been the site
of Chinaâs one domestic Covid-19 outbreak over the last month. There have been
more than 100 confirmed cases in the China-Myanmar border city since 30 March,
affecting both Chinese and Burmese nationals. The city implemented strict lockdowns in March, with a
number of city districts becoming âmediumâ or âhigh-riskâ. In these areas, people were
under strict orders to stay at home. All but essential businesses closed.
Students began having online classes, and transport links were suspended. Thousands of medical workers from outside of the city were
also sent to the front-line. However, today, media note that they have
âcompleted their missionâ, and footage is circulating showing local residents
dancing and waving to see them off. There were also fireworks set off yesterday evening
following the announcement that in areas that had recently returned to being
âlow-riskâ, home lockdowns were to be lifted. The Yunnan Health Commission says that 59 people are
currently being treated with symptoms,
including 13 who have arrived from overseas. Dr Jerryl Bennett from the Doctors Association of India has spoken to the BBC from Nagpur in Maharsahtra state. He says authorities are trying to step up supplies of oxygen, but it's been a losing battle: ""They are trying to provide us with oxygen, but the demand is so much that whatever amount of supply is there from the government it is not sufficient enough right now,"" he says. ""Patients are in a panic-stricken mode. The entire country is in panic-stricken mode."" He says medical staff are being pushed to the edge. ""We are physically exhausted. We are working over the capacity which a human can work. But it is also very traumatising emotionally and mentally that we are losing patients because of lack of oxygen or lack of beds. ""We are losing patients because they are coming in the hospitals at a very late stage where it is very difficult for us to give them the treatment for them to survive or for them to revive back from Covid,"" he says. ""It becomes very difficult for all the young generation doctors as well as the senior doctors. These patients could have been saved had we intervened a little earlier."" An Isle of Man ferry terminal in Liverpool will be at least Â£5m over budget and a year late due to the impact of coronavirus. Delays to the government-funded project caused by the pandemic are currently costing Â£8,000 per day, says infrastructure minister Tim Baker. The project was originally expected to cost Â£38m and be completed by December 2020, but that waspushed back to March and then July 2021. It will now be finished in March 2022. Baker told the Manx House of Keys: ""Progress is being made day by day, week by week, but it is being heavily impacted by the ongoing impact of coronavirus."" He says: ""I will do absolutely what I can to control the cost and to speed up delivery, but I cannot promise that we have yet met all the challenges that this scheme will bring."" The new facility is being built at the Princes Half Tide Dock about 670m from the existing terminal at Pier Head. BBC Radio 5 Live With a deadly second wave of Covid infections happening in India, BBC Radio 5 Live Drive has been hearing from people whose family and friends have been affected. Harsimrat Kaur lives in London with her husband Jagjit Singh and has relatives in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Her aunt and cousin have both died of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks. Harsimrat said: ""It hit home really hardâ¦ two people from the same family, theyâve got young kids as wellâ¦ I donât have any words, itâs just insane what is happening.â Harsimrat explained that her cousin managed to get a hospital bed ""after fighting for days with the doctors"" but still couldnât get oxygen or treatment there. Her aunt never got into hospital and had been ""struggling for oxygen"" too. Following the recent birth of their baby boy, both Harsimrat and her husband feel jumping on a plane to be with their family on compassionate grounds, would be âtoo much of a riskâ for their sonâs health. She added that her and her husband also âjust canât affordâ to travel to India and then spend two weeks in hotel quarantine. They have applied for a visa to allow some members of their family to come to the UK, when international travel opens up again. Listen back to the conversation on BBC Sounds. Leisure centres, outdoor attractions and hairdressers are open to customers across much of the UK, for the first time in months since coronavirus restrictions were imposed. But what are the rules in the UK's different nations? Here's our explainer of the rules below - which you can read it in fullhere. InEngland:  InWales:  InScotland:  InNorthern Ireland: Love of Lesbian played to a crowd of 5,000 Researchers in Spain have found ""no sign"" of higher levels of infection among people who took part in a large test concert last month. Six people tested positive within 14 days of attending the gig in Barcelona, but the incidence was lower than that seen in the general population. Around 5,000 music fans took part in the experiment after testing negative for Covid-19. Revellers wore masks but did not have to socially distance. Of the six people who tested positive, researchers concluded that four of them were infected elsewhere, not at the event itself. Spanish authorities let the show, featuring band Love of Lesbian, go ahead as part of a research project. The rate of infection among attendees was half the rate of people of the same age in Barcelona, researchers found. ""There is no sign that suggests transmission took place during the event,"" infectious disease specialist Josep Maria Llibre told a news conference on Tuesday. Read more here. More than 1.5 million Moroccans were arrested in the last nine months for not respecting Covid measures, a top official has said. This translates to a rate of more than 5,700 people arrested every day during that timeframe, Deputy Interior Minister Noureddine Boutayeb said, according to the 2M TV channel. ""Although this number seems large, it indicates a great involvement of all the authorities in charge of law enforcement,"" he told parliament. Failure to wear protective masks, respect curfews and travel bans were among the main offences, according to the Hespress website. Last year, Morocco rejected allegations of police abuse in taking measures to combat the spread of coronavirus in the country. This came after a top official at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) included the country in a list of states where the authorities' response to the pandemic had raised concerns. Almost 9,000 people have been reported to have lost their lives to Covid-19 in the country of 36 million people. A customer picks up a token that can be exchanged for a beer at the Warpigs Brewpub in Copenhagen A bar in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, has come up with a novel way of tempting its customers back in. In return for 149 kroner (Â£17, $24), punters at Warpigs Brewpub are able to take a test and wait for the result with a free beer. After half an hour, if they test negative, they are allowed inside the bar. It works as part ofthe country's coronapas (corona passport) systemwhich allows Danes to show proof that they are infection-free. Although they can get hold of free government-provided tests, the bar's customers
say the paid-for versions let them avoid the queues at testing centres. Warpigs says it's trying this out in partnership with a medical company to see if there's appetite for the scheme. One customer seemed happy enough: ""It [the test] costs some money, but you get a free beer - paid beer I guess, but you get a beer. And it was worth it. It took two minutes, you did it yourself, it wasn't uncomfortable and I got 'negative', so it's a win-win in my opinion,"" Nicolai Marteens told Reuters news agency. Health authorities in Bangladesh have approved the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, for emergency use amid uncertainty over deliveries from neighbouring India. The director-general of the Bangladeshi Drug Administration, Mahbubur Rahman, said the country was expecting the arrival of about four million doses from Russia next month. Rahman also indicated that Bangladesh could approve China's Sinopharm vaccine shortly. India has halted exports
of the AstraZeneca vaccinein response to a record surge in domestic infections. Assome MPs call for a review of fixed penalty noticesfor Covid lockdown breaches today, we've been hearing from people who were issued fines. One public sector worker told us he has been left in debt after being given a Â£1,000 fine for going to a friend's house for drinks. He and his wife, who was a nurse, met up with friends on the 11th day of self-isolation after a holiday abroad. At the time, the self-isolation period was 14 days. They'd both had Covid earlier in the year and thought the party posed minimal risk. ""It was wrong, I admit it and I came clean about it. But Â£1,000 is a ridiculous amount
of money. I'm still paying it off every month out of my wages, it's an impossible situation,"" the father-of-three explained. And in Manchester, Abe, 29, was fined after he went to a BBQ in January with four friends, and a neighbour called the police. He was issued two fines of Â£200 each, instead of one. After challenging the mistake, both fines were withdrawn, but his friends each paid their fines. ""Most people just pay the fine because theyâre
scared - the letters are alarming and say ""criminal records office"". It also concerned me that police were attending these calls when there are so many other serious issues,"" he said. There have been a further 17 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's latest figures.,external That brings the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,451. There were also a further 2,685 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Over the last few days, Chinese media have been
dominated by reports on the catastrophic scenes in India. State media yesterday
noted that China had sent hundreds of oxygen concentrators, and was vowing to
send 10,000 more. The national Global Times newspaper said that the country
would âkeep in contact with India for urgent supportâ. Today, the Global Times has criticised the US for
not responding in the same way. It says that âUS aid to India is long overdueâ,
and says that âcountries with strong, anti-epidemic capabilities must shoulder
greater responsibilitiesâ. The Xinhua news agency says that only 1.4% of Indiaâs
population have been vaccinated, and that âthe US is hoarding Covid-19
vaccinesâ. It adds that this comes amid other developing nations denouncing US
âvaccine apartheidâ. Chinese media have been keen to highlight
internal divisions between ordinary Indians and the elite. They were critical
of Indiaâs super-rich chartering eight private jets to London ahead of being
included on the UK governmentâs red list,
and The Paper notes that some Bollywood stars have been trolled for taking
holiday photos in the Maldives as the situation continues to escalate. Meanwhile, papers have been speaking to Chinese
nationals who are based in India. One called Niko told Beijing News that she
has tested positive for Covid-19, âbut the hospital said on 13 April that
hospital beds were all occupiedâ¦ so Iâve had no choice but to take medicine at
homeâ. In a video shared by the Global Times, a student,
Ms Chen, says that âthere are no flights; I can only stay at home and protect
myselfâ. An NHS boss has praised the ""heroic efforts"" of all those involved in the vaccine roll out as the UK reaches one-in-four adults having had their second jab. But Ruth Rankine, primary care director at the NHS Confederation, has urged everyone to stick to lockdown rules, warning that the pandemic is not yet over. She says: ""Today we reach another milestone in the UK's vaccination campaign and this is yet more evidence of the heroic efforts of so many people across the NHS, including and especially primary care, to make sure as many people as possible are protected."" ""But at the same time, we need to continue to follow the rules, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks to make sure the progress we have made in recent weeks can continue. ""With growing numbers of cases in the UK of mutant strains of the virus, we must not fall into the trap of believing the crisis is over."" This video can not be played Recovering from lockdown: Five tips to boost your child's vocabulary We reported earlier that there isgrowing evidence that the lockdown has had an impact on young children's language skills. Assistant head teacher Victoria Day has shared her top tips to help children with their communication. The Brazilian congress is launching an inquiry today into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed almost 400,000 people. The commission could potentially lead to the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro. He's been widely criticised for his anti-lockdown, vaccine-sceptic stance. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Bolsonaro said he's ""not worried"" by the commission - but his chance of re-election next year could be at stake. On Monday, Brazil's health regulator rejected requests from several states to receive batches of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V. The UK has fully vaccinated a quarter of its adult population against coronavirus and is on track to offer a first jab to all adults by the end of July, the government says. Public Health England data shows
vaccines are already having a significant impact in the UK in reducing
hospitalisations and deaths, and saved more than 10,000 lives between December
and March. Data from the ONS and Oxford University shows that
COVID-19 infections fell by 65% after the first dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, and further after the second
dose. The latest vaccine effectiveness data from PHE

Premier Inn owner braces for 'staycation' demand,"Premier Inn owner Whitbread has said it expects strong demand for holidays in the UK throughout the summer as Covid restrictions ease further from mid-May. The hotel and restaurant firm forecasts ""a significant bounce in leisure demand in our tourist locations"". At the same time, Whitbread laid bare the impact of the pandemic on its business as annual losses reached Â£1bn and sales tumbled by more than 70%. The firm said last year was the ""most challenging in our 279 year history"". It revealed that it had benefitted from Â£270m worth of government support during coronavirus, including the furlough scheme. Whitbread, which also owns the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurant chains, said almost all of its 800 UK and Ireland hotels, some 92%, were now open. This compares with just 39 that were opened during the first lockdown when they were used to provide accommodation for essential workers. â¢Lockdown rules have changed again - what's happening? When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Recent lockdowns saw its hotels at just 23% of potential occupancy in January and 29% in February. The company said: ""Strong demand is expected for 'staycations' in UK tourist destinations throughout the summer, with business and event-led leisure demand starting to gradually recover thereafter."" It also plans to invest Â£350m this year, which will go partly toward refurbishments, but also to new advertising, which will again feature comedian and actor Sir Lenny Henry. Despite this investment programme, it still intends to cut Â£100m in costs. Last year, it warned it may have to lay off thousands of staff and approached landlords for a temporary rent cut. It also scrapped its dividend payout to shareholders, while directors and senior management took pay cuts. It employs some 30,000 staff, 27,000 of which were furloughed under the Job Retention Scheme. Whitbread's chief executive, Alison Brittain, said: ""The vaccination programme in the UK means we can look forward to the planned relaxation of government restrictions as we move into summer, with the first major milestone being the return of leisure guests to our hotels, and the full reopening of restaurants from 17 May. ""We expect a significant bounce in leisure demand in our tourist locations during the summer, followed by a gradual recovery in business and event-driven leisure demand."" Julie Palmer from professional services firm, Begbies Traynor, said: ""After having been able to report positive results and sell its profitable Costa arm to focus on hotels in previous years Whitbread, like so many others in this industry, has been rocked by the pandemic. ""It can get back on its feet again, but the Whitbread we saw before the pandemic could be different to the one we see after it. Even after all restrictions are removed change is coming.""

Suspect arrested as armed police storm collegeSussex Police is liaising with counter-terror officers over reports of gunshots at Crawley College.,"Students were evacuated from the college as armed police continued to search the area Staff and students were evacuated from a college amid reports of shots being fired on the campus. An 18-year-old man was arrested and a knife and firearm recovered after armed police swooped on Crawley College. Unconfirmed reports suggest a staff member tackled the suspect. Video seen by the BBC appears to show a person being held on the ground by several others. Sussex Police said two staff members sustained minor injuries. No-one is thought to have been seriously hurt. Counter-terror police are working with local officers and ""all lines of inquiry are open,"" the force said. An 18-year-old student, who did not want to be named, said the ""frightening experience"" had left him feeling shaken up. ""It was quite hectic and it seemed liked something out of a game, like Call of Duty,"" he continued. ""Everyone was just shouting and screaming and bangs in the background, which some people assumed were gunshots."" Teachers told students to ""get under the table and shut the door, just as a precautionary measure,"" he said. They later left the college to a ""large police presence and police shouting and asking people to show their hands and evacuate the building in an orderly manner,"" he added. Video appearing to show a suspect being pinned to the ground has been shared by students on Snapchat. A student said he believed the footage showed a member of staff tackling the suspect before police ""swarmed the area"" and made an arrest. Police snipers were seen outside Crawley College Specialist counter-terror firearms officers were sent to the scene, alongside armed from Sussex and the Metropolitan Police. Officers searched a property about a mile from the college and helicopters patrolled the area. Ch Supt Howard Hodges said two members of college staff had ""suffered minor injuries and presented themselves to a walk-in medical centre"". The college said it would remain closed on Tuesday and further education provider Chichester College Group, said: ""Our priority remains the safety of students and staff."" Allow Twitter content?

Updates were brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright, Paul Kirby, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Holly Wallis and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. Here's a recap of the UK's coronavirus news today:  We're drawing the live page to a close for the day soon. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest developments from around the world today:  A US state says it will offer young people a $100 (Â£72) savings bond if they receive a Covid-19 vaccine. West Virginia saysit hopes the payment for those aged 16 to 35 will ""motivate"" them to get the jab. ""Our kids today probably don't really realise just how important they are in shutting this thing down,"" State Governor Jim Justice said on Monday. West Virginia had been among the top US states for vaccination rates, but progress has slowed in recent weeks. There are particular concerns that younger people may be more hesitant about receiving a jab. The incentive means those who are vaccinated within the age group can retrieve the $100, plus interest, at a later date. It will also be offered to anyone aged 16 to 35 who has already been vaccinated. West Virginia has the 16th highest rate of new coronavirus cases per person among US states, according to the New York Times. Conversely,a Miami school has discouraged teachers from getting the Covid vaccine, saying any vaccinated employees will be barred from interacting with students. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wait to receive vaccines in Ruili over the weekend There is a lot of fanfare today in the Chinese city of
Ruili, where the authorities have lifted stay-at-home orders for people in
low-risk areas. Ruili, in southwestern Yunnan province, has been the site
of Chinaâs one domestic Covid-19 outbreak over the last month. There have been
more than 100 confirmed cases in the China-Myanmar border city since 30 March,
affecting both Chinese and Burmese nationals. The city implemented strict lockdowns in March, with a
number of city districts becoming âmediumâ or âhigh-riskâ. In these areas, people were
under strict orders to stay at home. All but essential businesses closed.
Students began having online classes, and transport links were suspended. Thousands of medical workers from outside of the city were
also sent to the front-line. However, today, media note that they have
âcompleted their missionâ, and footage is circulating showing local residents
dancing and waving to see them off. There were also fireworks set off yesterday evening
following the announcement that in areas that had recently returned to being
âlow-riskâ, home lockdowns were to be lifted. The Yunnan Health Commission says that 59 people are
currently being treated with symptoms,
including 13 who have arrived from overseas. Dr Jerryl Bennett from the Doctors Association of India has spoken to the BBC from Nagpur in Maharsahtra state. He says authorities are trying to step up supplies of oxygen, but it's been a losing battle: ""They are trying to provide us with oxygen, but the demand is so much that whatever amount of supply is there from the government it is not sufficient enough right now,"" he says. ""Patients are in a panic-stricken mode. The entire country is in panic-stricken mode."" He says medical staff are being pushed to the edge. ""We are physically exhausted. We are working over the capacity which a human can work. But it is also very traumatising emotionally and mentally that we are losing patients because of lack of oxygen or lack of beds. ""We are losing patients because they are coming in the hospitals at a very late stage where it is very difficult for us to give them the treatment for them to survive or for them to revive back from Covid,"" he says. ""It becomes very difficult for all the young generation doctors as well as the senior doctors. These patients could have been saved had we intervened a little earlier."" An Isle of Man ferry terminal in Liverpool will be at least Â£5m over budget and a year late due to the impact of coronavirus. Delays to the government-funded project caused by the pandemic are currently costing Â£8,000 per day, says infrastructure minister Tim Baker. The project was originally expected to cost Â£38m and be completed by December 2020, but that waspushed back to March and then July 2021. It will now be finished in March 2022. Baker told the Manx House of Keys: ""Progress is being made day by day, week by week, but it is being heavily impacted by the ongoing impact of coronavirus."" He says: ""I will do absolutely what I can to control the cost and to speed up delivery, but I cannot promise that we have yet met all the challenges that this scheme will bring."" The new facility is being built at the Princes Half Tide Dock about 670m from the existing terminal at Pier Head. BBC Radio 5 Live With a deadly second wave of Covid infections happening in India, BBC Radio 5 Live Drive has been hearing from people whose family and friends have been affected. Harsimrat Kaur lives in London with her husband Jagjit Singh and has relatives in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Her aunt and cousin have both died of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks. Harsimrat said: ""It hit home really hardâ¦ two people from the same family, theyâve got young kids as wellâ¦ I donât have any words, itâs just insane what is happening.â Harsimrat explained that her cousin managed to get a hospital bed ""after fighting for days with the doctors"" but still couldnât get oxygen or treatment there. Her aunt never got into hospital and had been ""struggling for oxygen"" too. Following the recent birth of their baby boy, both Harsimrat and her husband feel jumping on a plane to be with their family on compassionate grounds, would be âtoo much of a riskâ for their sonâs health. She added that her and her husband also âjust canât affordâ to travel to India and then spend two weeks in hotel quarantine. They have applied for a visa to allow some members of their family to come to the UK, when international travel opens up again. Listen back to the conversation on BBC Sounds. Leisure centres, outdoor attractions and hairdressers are open to customers across much of the UK, for the first time in months since coronavirus restrictions were imposed. But what are the rules in the UK's different nations? Here's our explainer of the rules below - which you can read it in fullhere. InEngland:  InWales:  InScotland:  InNorthern Ireland: Love of Lesbian played to a crowd of 5,000 Researchers in Spain have found ""no sign"" of higher levels of infection among people who took part in a large test concert last month. Six people tested positive within 14 days of attending the gig in Barcelona, but the incidence was lower than that seen in the general population. Around 5,000 music fans took part in the experiment after testing negative for Covid-19. Revellers wore masks but did not have to socially distance. Of the six people who tested positive, researchers concluded that four of them were infected elsewhere, not at the event itself. Spanish authorities let the show, featuring band Love of Lesbian, go ahead as part of a research project. The rate of infection among attendees was half the rate of people of the same age in Barcelona, researchers found. ""There is no sign that suggests transmission took place during the event,"" infectious disease specialist Josep Maria Llibre told a news conference on Tuesday. Read more here. More than 1.5 million Moroccans were arrested in the last nine months for not respecting Covid measures, a top official has said. This translates to a rate of more than 5,700 people arrested every day during that timeframe, Deputy Interior Minister Noureddine Boutayeb said, according to the 2M TV channel. ""Although this number seems large, it indicates a great involvement of all the authorities in charge of law enforcement,"" he told parliament. Failure to wear protective masks, respect curfews and travel bans were among the main offences, according to the Hespress website. Last year, Morocco rejected allegations of police abuse in taking measures to combat the spread of coronavirus in the country. This came after a top official at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) included the country in a list of states where the authorities' response to the pandemic had raised concerns. Almost 9,000 people have been reported to have lost their lives to Covid-19 in the country of 36 million people. A customer picks up a token that can be exchanged for a beer at the Warpigs Brewpub in Copenhagen A bar in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, has come up with a novel way of tempting its customers back in. In return for 149 kroner (Â£17, $24), punters at Warpigs Brewpub are able to take a test and wait for the result with a free beer. After half an hour, if they test negative, they are allowed inside the bar. It works as part ofthe country's coronapas (corona passport) systemwhich allows Danes to show proof that they are infection-free. Although they can get hold of free government-provided tests, the bar's customers
say the paid-for versions let them avoid the queues at testing centres. Warpigs says it's trying this out in partnership with a medical company to see if there's appetite for the scheme. One customer seemed happy enough: ""It [the test] costs some money, but you get a free beer - paid beer I guess, but you get a beer. And it was worth it. It took two minutes, you did it yourself, it wasn't uncomfortable and I got 'negative', so it's a win-win in my opinion,"" Nicolai Marteens told Reuters news agency. Health authorities in Bangladesh have approved the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, for emergency use amid uncertainty over deliveries from neighbouring India. The director-general of the Bangladeshi Drug Administration, Mahbubur Rahman, said the country was expecting the arrival of about four million doses from Russia next month. Rahman also indicated that Bangladesh could approve China's Sinopharm vaccine shortly. India has halted exports
of the AstraZeneca vaccinein response to a record surge in domestic infections. Assome MPs call for a review of fixed penalty noticesfor Covid lockdown breaches today, we've been hearing from people who were issued fines. One public sector worker told us he has been left in debt after being given a Â£1,000 fine for going to a friend's house for drinks. He and his wife, who was a nurse, met up with friends on the 11th day of self-isolation after a holiday abroad. At the time, the self-isolation period was 14 days. They'd both had Covid earlier in the year and thought the party posed minimal risk. ""It was wrong, I admit it and I came clean about it. But Â£1,000 is a ridiculous amount
of money. I'm still paying it off every month out of my wages, it's an impossible situation,"" the father-of-three explained. And in Manchester, Abe, 29, was fined after he went to a BBQ in January with four friends, and a neighbour called the police. He was issued two fines of Â£200 each, instead of one. After challenging the mistake, both fines were withdrawn, but his friends each paid their fines. ""Most people just pay the fine because theyâre
scared - the letters are alarming and say ""criminal records office"". It also concerned me that police were attending these calls when there are so many other serious issues,"" he said. There have been a further 17 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's latest figures.,external That brings the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,451. There were also a further 2,685 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Over the last few days, Chinese media have been
dominated by reports on the catastrophic scenes in India. State media yesterday
noted that China had sent hundreds of oxygen concentrators, and was vowing to
send 10,000 more. The national Global Times newspaper said that the country
would âkeep in contact with India for urgent supportâ. Today, the Global Times has criticised the US for
not responding in the same way. It says that âUS aid to India is long overdueâ,
and says that âcountries with strong, anti-epidemic capabilities must shoulder
greater responsibilitiesâ. The Xinhua news agency says that only 1.4% of Indiaâs
population have been vaccinated, and that âthe US is hoarding Covid-19
vaccinesâ. It adds that this comes amid other developing nations denouncing US
âvaccine apartheidâ. Chinese media have been keen to highlight
internal divisions between ordinary Indians and the elite. They were critical
of Indiaâs super-rich chartering eight private jets to London ahead of being
included on the UK governmentâs red list,
and The Paper notes that some Bollywood stars have been trolled for taking
holiday photos in the Maldives as the situation continues to escalate. Meanwhile, papers have been speaking to Chinese
nationals who are based in India. One called Niko told Beijing News that she
has tested positive for Covid-19, âbut the hospital said on 13 April that
hospital beds were all occupiedâ¦ so Iâve had no choice but to take medicine at
homeâ. In a video shared by the Global Times, a student,
Ms Chen, says that âthere are no flights; I can only stay at home and protect
myselfâ. An NHS boss has praised the ""heroic efforts"" of all those involved in the vaccine roll out as the UK reaches one-in-four adults having had their second jab. But Ruth Rankine, primary care director at the NHS Confederation, has urged everyone to stick to lockdown rules, warning that the pandemic is not yet over. She says: ""Today we reach another milestone in the UK's vaccination campaign and this is yet more evidence of the heroic efforts of so many people across the NHS, including and especially primary care, to make sure as many people as possible are protected."" ""But at the same time, we need to continue to follow the rules, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks to make sure the progress we have made in recent weeks can continue. ""With growing numbers of cases in the UK of mutant strains of the virus, we must not fall into the trap of believing the crisis is over."" This video can not be played Recovering from lockdown: Five tips to boost your child's vocabulary We reported earlier that there isgrowing evidence that the lockdown has had an impact on young children's language skills. Assistant head teacher Victoria Day has shared her top tips to help children with their communication. The Brazilian congress is launching an inquiry today into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed almost 400,000 people. The commission could potentially lead to the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro. He's been widely criticised for his anti-lockdown, vaccine-sceptic stance. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Bolsonaro said he's ""not worried"" by the commission - but his chance of re-election next year could be at stake. On Monday, Brazil's health regulator rejected requests from several states to receive batches of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V. The UK has fully vaccinated a quarter of its adult population against coronavirus and is on track to offer a first jab to all adults by the end of July, the government says. Public Health England data shows
vaccines are already having a significant impact in the UK in reducing
hospitalisations and deaths, and saved more than 10,000 lives between December
and March. Data from the ONS and Oxford University shows that
COVID-19 infections fell by 65% after the first dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, and further after the second
dose. The latest vaccine effectiveness data from PHE
show that in those aged over 70, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and
Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines reduce the risk of getting symptomatic disease by
around 60% after a single dose. This protection lasts for several weeks. In
those aged over 80, protection against hospitalisation is around 80% and the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 85% effective at stopping people aged over 80 dying
from COVID-19. Rolling reviews are under way by the MHRA to
assess the Janssen and Novavax vaccines - find out when you'll get your jabhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

But what are the rules in the UK's different nations? Here's our explainer of the rules below - which you can read it in fullhere. InEngland:  InWales:  InScotland:  InNorthern Ireland: Love of Lesbian played to a crowd of 5,000 Researchers in Spain have found ""no sign"" of higher levels of infection among people who took part in a large test concert last month. Six people tested positive within 14 days of attending the gig in Barcelona, but the incidence was lower than that seen in the general population. Around 5,000 music fans took part in the experiment after testing negative for Covid-19. Revellers wore masks but did not have to socially distance. Of the six people who tested positive, researchers concluded that four of them were infected elsewhere, not at the event itself. Spanish authorities let the show, featuring band Love of Lesbian, go ahead as part of a research project. The rate of infection among attendees was half the rate of people of the same age in Barcelona, researchers found. ""There is no sign that suggests transmission took place during the event,"" infectious disease specialist Josep Maria Llibre told a news conference on Tuesday. Read more here. More than 1.5 million Moroccans were arrested in the last nine months for not respecting Covid measures, a top official has said. This translates to a rate of more than 5,700 people arrested every day during that timeframe, Deputy Interior Minister Noureddine Boutayeb said, according to the 2M TV channel. ""Although this number seems large, it indicates a great involvement of all the authorities in charge of law enforcement,"" he told parliament. Failure to wear protective masks, respect curfews and travel bans were among the main offences, according to the Hespress website. Last year, Morocco rejected allegations of police abuse in taking measures to combat the spread of coronavirus in the country. This came after a top official at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) included the country in a list of states where the authorities' response to the pandemic had raised concerns. Almost 9,000 people have been reported to have lost their lives to Covid-19 in the country of 36 million people. A customer picks up a token that can be exchanged for a beer at the Warpigs Brewpub in Copenhagen A bar in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, has come up with a novel way of tempting its customers back in. In return for 149 kroner (Â£17, $24), punters at Warpigs Brewpub are able to take a test and wait for the result with a free beer. After half an hour, if they test negative, they are allowed inside the bar. It works as part ofthe country's coronapas (corona passport) systemwhich allows Danes to show proof that they are infection-free. Although they can get hold of free government-provided tests, the bar's customers
say the paid-for versions let them avoid the queues at testing centres. Warpigs says it's trying this out in partnership with a medical company to see if there's appetite for the scheme. One customer seemed happy enough: ""It [the test] costs some money, but you get a free beer - paid beer I guess, but you get a beer. And it was worth it. It took two minutes, you did it yourself, it wasn't uncomfortable and I got 'negative', so it's a win-win in my opinion,"" Nicolai Marteens told Reuters news agency. Health authorities in Bangladesh have approved the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, for emergency use amid uncertainty over deliveries from neighbouring India. The director-general of the Bangladeshi Drug Administration, Mahbubur Rahman, said the country was expecting the arrival of about four million doses from Russia next month. Rahman also indicated that Bangladesh could approve China's Sinopharm vaccine shortly. India has halted exports
of the AstraZeneca vaccinein response to a record surge in domestic infections. Assome MPs call for a review of fixed penalty noticesfor Covid lockdown breaches today, we've been hearing from people who were issued fines. One public sector worker told us he has been left in debt after being given a Â£1,000 fine for going to a friend's house for drinks. He and his wife, who was a nurse, met up with friends on the 11th day of self-isolation after a holiday abroad. At the time, the self-isolation period was 14 days. They'd both had Covid earlier in the year and thought the party posed minimal risk. ""It was wrong, I admit it and I came clean about it. But Â£1,000 is a ridiculous amount
of money. I'm still paying it off every month out of my wages, it's an impossible situation,"" the father-of-three explained. And in Manchester, Abe, 29, was fined after he went to a BBQ in January with four friends, and a neighbour called the police. He was issued two fines of Â£200 each, instead of one. After challenging the mistake, both fines were withdrawn, but his friends each paid their fines. ""Most people just pay the fine because theyâre
scared - the letters are alarming and say ""criminal records office"". It also concerned me that police were attending these calls when there are so many other serious issues,"" he said. There have been a further 17 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's latest figures.,external That brings the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,451. There were also a further 2,685 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Over the last few days, Chinese media have been
dominated by reports on the catastrophic scenes in India. State media yesterday
noted that China had sent hundreds of oxygen concentrators, and was vowing to
send 10,000 more. The national Global Times newspaper said that the country
would âkeep in contact with India for urgent supportâ. Today, the Global Times has criticised the US for
not responding in the same way. It says that âUS aid to India is long overdueâ,
and says that âcountries with strong, anti-epidemic capabilities must shoulder
greater responsibilitiesâ. The Xinhua news agency says that only 1.4% of Indiaâs
population have been vaccinated, and that âthe US is hoarding Covid-19
vaccinesâ. It adds that this comes amid other developing nations denouncing US
âvaccine apartheidâ. Chinese media have been keen to highlight
internal divisions between ordinary Indians and the elite. They were critical
of Indiaâs super-rich chartering eight private jets to London ahead of being
included on the UK governmentâs red list,
and The Paper notes that some Bollywood stars have been trolled for taking
holiday photos in the Maldives as the situation continues to escalate. Meanwhile, papers have been speaking to Chinese
nationals who are based in India. One called Niko told Beijing News that she
has tested positive for Covid-19, âbut the hospital said on 13 April that
hospital beds were all occupiedâ¦ so Iâve had no choice but to take medicine at
homeâ. In a video shared by the Global Times, a student,
Ms Chen, says that âthere are no flights; I can only stay at home and protect
myselfâ. An NHS boss has praised the ""heroic efforts"" of all those involved in the vaccine roll out as the UK reaches one-in-four adults having had their second jab. But Ruth Rankine, primary care director at the NHS Confederation, has urged everyone to stick to lockdown rules, warning that the pandemic is not yet over. She says: ""Today we reach another milestone in the UK's vaccination campaign and this is yet more evidence of the heroic efforts of so many people across the NHS, including and especially primary care, to make sure as many people as possible are protected."" ""But at the same time, we need to continue to follow the rules, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks to make sure the progress we have made in recent weeks can continue. ""With growing numbers of cases in the UK of mutant strains of the virus, we must not fall into the trap of believing the crisis is over.""

Assistant head teacher Victoria Day has shared her top tips to help children with their communication. The Brazilian congress is launching an inquiry today into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed almost 400,000 people. The commission could potentially lead to the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro. He's been widely criticised for his anti-lockdown, vaccine-sceptic stance. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Bolsonaro said he's ""not worried"" by the commission - but his chance of re-election next year could be at stake. On Monday, Brazil's health regulator rejected requests from several states to receive batches of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V. The UK has fully vaccinated a quarter of its adult population against coronavirus and is on track to offer a first jab to all adults by the end of July, the government says. Public Health England data shows
vaccines are already having a significant impact in the UK in reducing
hospitalisations and deaths, and saved more than 10,000 lives between December
and March. Data from the ONS and Oxford University shows that
COVID-19 infections fell by 65% after the first dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, and further after the second
dose. The latest vaccine effectiveness data from PHE
show that in those aged over 70, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and
Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines reduce the risk of getting symptomatic disease by
around 60% after a single dose. This protection lasts for several weeks. In
those aged over 80, protection against hospitalisation is around 80% and the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 85% effective at stopping people aged over 80 dying
from COVID-19. Rolling reviews are under way by the MHRA to

Updates were brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright, Paul Kirby, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Holly Wallis and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. Here's a recap of the UK's coronavirus news today:  We're drawing the live page to a close for the day soon. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest developments from around the world today:  A US state says it will offer young people a $100 (Â£72) savings bond if they receive a Covid-19 vaccine. West Virginia saysit hopes the payment for those aged 16 to 35 will ""motivate"" them to get the jab. ""Our kids today probably don't really realise just how important they are in shutting this thing down,"" State Governor Jim Justice said on Monday. West Virginia had been among the top US states for vaccination rates, but progress has slowed in recent weeks. There are particular concerns that younger people may be more hesitant about receiving a jab. The incentive means those who are vaccinated within the age group can retrieve the $100, plus interest, at a later date. It will also be offered to anyone aged 16 to 35 who has already been vaccinated. West Virginia has the 16th highest rate of new coronavirus cases per person among US states, according to the New York Times. Conversely,a Miami school has discouraged teachers from getting the Covid vaccine, saying any vaccinated employees will be barred from interacting with students. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wait to receive vaccines in Ruili over the weekend There is a lot of fanfare today in the Chinese city of
Ruili, where the authorities have lifted stay-at-home orders for people in
low-risk areas. Ruili, in southwestern Yunnan province, has been the site
of Chinaâs one domestic Covid-19 outbreak over the last month. There have been
more than 100 confirmed cases in the China-Myanmar border city since 30 March,
affecting both Chinese and Burmese nationals. The city implemented strict lockdowns in March, with a
number of city districts becoming âmediumâ or âhigh-riskâ. In these areas, people were
under strict orders to stay at home. All but essential businesses closed.
Students began having online classes, and transport links were suspended. Thousands of medical workers from outside of the city were
also sent to the front-line. However, today, media note that they have
âcompleted their missionâ, and footage is circulating showing local residents
dancing and waving to see them off. There were also fireworks set off yesterday evening
following the announcement that in areas that had recently returned to being
âlow-riskâ, home lockdowns were to be lifted. The Yunnan Health Commission says that 59 people are
currently being treated with symptoms,
including 13 who have arrived from overseas. Dr Jerryl Bennett from the Doctors Association of India has spoken to the BBC from Nagpur in Maharsahtra state. He says authorities are trying to step up supplies of oxygen, but it's been a losing battle: ""They are trying to provide us with oxygen, but the demand is so much that whatever amount of supply is there from the government it is not sufficient enough right now,"" he says. ""Patients are in a panic-stricken mode. The entire country is in panic-stricken mode."" He says medical staff are being pushed to the edge. ""We are physically exhausted. We are working over the capacity which a human can work. But it is also very traumatising emotionally and mentally that we are losing patients because of lack of oxygen or lack of beds. ""We are losing patients because they are coming in the hospitals at a very late stage where it is very difficult for us to give them the treatment for them to survive or for them to revive back from Covid,"" he says. ""It becomes very difficult for all the young generation doctors as well as the senior doctors. These patients could have been saved had we intervened a little earlier."" An Isle of Man ferry terminal in Liverpool will be at least Â£5m over budget and a year late due to the impact of coronavirus. Delays to the government-funded project caused by the pandemic are currently costing Â£8,000 per day, says infrastructure minister Tim Baker. The project was originally expected to cost Â£38m and be completed by December 2020, but that waspushed back to March and then July 2021. It will now be finished in March 2022. Baker told the Manx House of Keys: ""Progress is being made day by day, week by week, but it is being heavily impacted by the ongoing impact of coronavirus."" He says: ""I will do absolutely what I can to control the cost and to speed up delivery, but I cannot promise that we have yet met all the challenges that this scheme will bring."" The new facility is being built at the Princes Half Tide Dock about 670m from the existing terminal at Pier Head. BBC Radio 5 Live With a deadly second wave of Covid infections happening in India, BBC Radio 5 Live Drive has been hearing from people whose family and friends have been affected. Harsimrat Kaur lives in London with her husband Jagjit Singh and has relatives in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Her aunt and cousin have both died of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks. Harsimrat said: ""It hit home really hardâ¦ two people from the same family, theyâve got young kids as wellâ¦ I donât have any words, itâs just insane what is happening.â Harsimrat explained that her cousin managed to get a hospital bed ""after fighting for days with the doctors"" but still couldnât get oxygen or treatment there. Her aunt never got into hospital and had been ""struggling for oxygen"" too. Following the recent birth of their baby boy, both Harsimrat and her husband feel jumping on a plane to be with their family on compassionate grounds, would be âtoo much of a riskâ for their sonâs health. She added that her and her husband also âjust canât affordâ to travel to India and then spend two weeks in hotel quarantine. They have applied for a visa to allow some members of their family to come to the UK, when international travel opens up again. Listen back to the conversation on BBC Sounds.

"US police mock dementia sufferer during arrestThe Colorado officers are seen reviewing a clip where the 73-year-old's shoulder goes ""pop"".","This video can not be played Watch the moment officer says: ""I love it"" US police officers are seen mocking a 73-year-old woman with dementia as they watch video of her shoulder going ""pop"" during her forcible arrest, according to footage released by her lawyer. Karen Garner was detained on 26 June last year after she walked out of a Walmart store in the state of Colorado without paying for $13 (Â£9) of items. Her elbow was fractured and shoulder dislocated, says her lawyer. An investigation has been launched into the Loveland Police Department arrest. In the footage released on Monday from the booking area of the police station on the day of the arrest, officers are seen fist-bumping one another as they review body camera video of the incident. Video from inside Ms Garner's nearby holding cell shows the frail-looking grandmother slumped handcuffed to a bench while the officers joke about the incident, says her lawyer. ""Ready for the pop? Hear the pop?"" one of the officers says at one point, referring to Ms Garner's shoulder. As they continue to watch the footage, the same officer says: ""I love it."" Don't shoot, I'm disabled The Garner family hired a sound engineer to enhance audio of the officers' remarks. Their lawyer has filed a federal lawsuit against the department, alleging the officers violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and ""violently assaulted"" Ms Garner. Attorney Sarah Schielke says her client went six hours without medical help while confused and crying in pain after an arrest that amounted to ""torture"". ""They failed Karen Garner,"" Ms Schielke said in a press release. ""They failed the community. And they did it all on camera."" Loveland police said in a statement on Monday they would not be making any comments pending the results of a ""criminal investigation"" launched last week. The Larimer County district attorney is looking into the department's use of force during Ms Garner's arrest. Loveland police chief Robert Ticer has pledged full transparency with the inquiry, which will be led by Fort Collins Police. One officer has been placed on administrative leave and two others moved to administrative duties. The bodycam footage caused public outcry when it was released earlier this month. It shows two police officers stopping Ms Garner as she was picking flowers by the roadside after she left the Walmart store in the town of Loveland, about 50 miles (80km) north of Denver. CCTV from the supermarket shortly beforehand showed members of staff stopping Ms Garner to recover the $13.38 of merchandise, which included cans of fizzy drinks and laundry detergent. After she walks away from the officers, she is thrown to the ground, handcuffed, shoved face down on the bonnet of the police car and has her legs tied together with a hobble. She was left bleeding. Ms Garner's daughter-in-law, Shannon Steward, told the Denver Post the arrest had worsened Ms Garner's dementia. ""She hasn't come back the way she was before,"" Ms Steward told the newspaper. ""It was too much."" The release of the footage comes amid a nationwide reckoning over police brutality, especially against African Americans, although Ms Garner is white.

Premier Inn-owner braces for 'staycation' demand,"Premier Inn owner Whitbread has said it expects strong demand for holidays in the UK throughout the summer as Covid restrictions ease further from mid-May. The hotel and restaurant firm forecasts ""a significant bounce in leisure demand in our tourist locations"". At the same time, Whitbread laid bare the impact of the pandemic on its business as annual losses reached Â£1bn and sales tumbled by more than 70%. The firm said last year was the ""most challenging in our 279 year history"". It revealed that it had benefitted from Â£270m worth of government support during coronavirus, including the furlough scheme. Whitbread, which also owns the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurant chains, said almost all of its 800 UK and Ireland hotels, some 92%, were now open. This compares with just 39 that were opened during the first lockdown when they were used to provide accommodation for essential workers. â¢Lockdown rules have changed again - what's happening? When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Recent lockdowns saw its hotels at just 23% of potential occupancy in January and 29% in February. The company said: ""Strong demand is expected for 'staycations' in UK tourist destinations throughout the summer, with business and event-led leisure demand starting to gradually recover thereafter."" It also plans to invest Â£350m this year, which will go partly toward refurbishments, but also to new advertising, which will again feature comedian and actor Sir Lenny Henry. Despite this investment programme, it still intends to cut Â£100m in costs. Last year, it warned it may have to lay off thousands of staff and approached landlords for a temporary rent cut. It also scrapped its dividend payout to shareholders, while directors and senior management took pay cuts. It employs some 30,000 staff, 27,000 of which were furloughed under the Job Retention Scheme. Whitbread's chief executive, Alison Brittain, said: ""The vaccination programme in the UK means we can look forward to the planned relaxation of government restrictions as we move into summer, with the first major milestone being the return of leisure guests to our hotels, and the full reopening of restaurants from 17 May. ""We expect a significant bounce in leisure demand in our tourist locations during the summer, followed by a gradual recovery in business and event-driven leisure demand."" Julie Palmer from professional services firm, Begbies Traynor, said: ""After having been able to report positive results and sell its profitable Costa arm to focus on hotels in previous years Whitbread, like so many others in this industry, has been rocked by the pandemic. ""It can get back on its feet again, but the Whitbread we saw before the pandemic could be different to the one we see after it. Even after all restrictions are removed change is coming.""

Funding of PM's flat refurbishment to be reviewed,"Boris Johnson lives in Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds The UK's top civil servant says Boris Johnson has asked him to review how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was paid for. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was responding to MPs' questions about how the work was funded. The row escalated after Mr Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the PM once planned to have donors ""secretly pay"" for the revamp. The PM has said any relevant donations will be declared ""in due course"". Labour has called on the Electoral Commission, which regulates political donations in the UK, to launch a formal investigation. The watchdog has said it is talking to the Conservative Party about whether the spending on the flat falls within its remit. PM's flat refurbishment: What is the row about? Johnson's 'bodies pile high' comments prompt criticism Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter Appearing before a Commons committeeon Monday, Mr Case said a review into the refurbishment would look at ""how this has been done"". Asked repeatedly whether he was aware if private donations covered any of the costs, he said he had ""not been involved directly in this"". ""I do not have all of the facts and details at my disposal,"" he said, adding that his review would probably take ""a matter of weeks"". Another day, another denial.  Another 24 hours when rather than making their arguments, the government is embroiled in arguments about the past. Whether it's the prime minister's alleged frustrations about lockdown, attacks from his former adviser Dominic Cummings, or the mystery over his expensive flat renovation, as one senior Tory put it, it matters, because it all relates to Boris Johnson's judgement. Many Conservatives have been confident however that the prime minister's reputation, his enjoyment for pushing convention, is something that many voters are even attracted to. But there's a risk that confidence could turn to complacency. There is a belief in the Labour Party that the unhappy mess is starting to be noticed by voters. And no one knows when, or what might next emerge. One cabinet minister told me ""there's nothing we can do to control it."" The claims about the flat are contained in a blog posted by Mr Cummings on Friday, his first since leaving his role in No 10. In the blog, Mr Cummingsalso deniedhe was behind the leaking of details of November's second coronavirus lockdown in England. Mr Case told MPs that an internal inquiry into that leak was ongoing, but it was ""probable"" officials working on it would fail to identify any sources. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has denied reports he said he would rather ""let the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third lockdown. TheDaily Mail reported,externalthe prime minister made the remarks during heated conversations within government in the autumn over lockdown restrictions. Sources familiar with the conversationhave told the BBCMr Johnson suggested he would rather see ""bodies pile high"" during the discussions. This video can not be played Simon Case was asked whether private donations funded work at the flat Like several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, which is larger than the one above No 10. Speaking earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the prime minister had paid for the revamp ""from his own money"" . He said this came ""on top of"" public money from the annual Â£30,000 taxpayer grant available to all prime ministers for the upkeep of their accommodation. In awritten statement on Friday,external, the government said no money from this grant was spent in the 2019/20 financial year. Figures for this year are expected to be published in the summer. ""At all times the prime minister has complied with the rules. He's paid for it out of his own money, "" he said. Michelle Obama visited Samantha Cameron in the 11 Downing St flat back in 2011 Speaking to reporters on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into the allegations about the Downing Street flat, arguing they risked undermining trust in government. ""It's all very well the prime minister saying now 'I paid for it', the critical question was: what was the original arrangement - and why is it so complicated?"" ""If there's a straightforward answer, well give it. And if there isn't, then there are very serious questions to be asked,"" he added. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."" Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission. The Conservative Party has previously said that all ""reportable donations"" are ""correctly declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them and comply fully with the law"". The party said ""gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity"" are declared in government transparency returns. Mr Case was also asked by MPs about the case of businessman Lex Greensill who was a part-time unpaid government adviser in David Cameron's government. The civil servant boss said that situation was not ""acceptable"" and that it ""looks like there were conflicts"".

US police mock dementia sufferer in 'torture' arrest,"This video can not be played Watch the moment officer says: ""I love it"" US police officers are seen mocking a 73-year-old woman with dementia as they watch video of her shoulder going ""pop"" during her forcible arrest, according to footage released by her lawyer. Karen Garner was detained on 26 June last year after she walked out of a Walmart store in the state of Colorado without paying for $13 (Â£9) of items. Her elbow was fractured and shoulder dislocated, says her lawyer. An investigation has been launched into the Loveland Police Department arrest. In the footage released on Monday from the booking area of the police station on the day of the arrest, officers are seen fist-bumping one another as they review body camera video of the incident. Video from inside Ms Garner's nearby holding cell shows the frail-looking grandmother slumped handcuffed to a bench while the officers joke about the incident, says her lawyer. ""Ready for the pop? Hear the pop?"" one of the officers says at one point, referring to Ms Garner's shoulder. As they continue to watch the footage, the same officer says: ""I love it."" Don't shoot, I'm disabled The Garner family hired a sound engineer to enhance audio of the officers' remarks. Their lawyer has filed a federal lawsuit against the department, alleging the officers violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and ""violently assaulted"" Ms Garner. Attorney Sarah Schielke says her client went six hours without medical help while confused and crying in pain after an arrest that amounted to ""torture"". ""They failed Karen Garner,"" Ms Schielke said in a press release. ""They failed the community. And they did it all on camera."" Loveland police said in a statement on Monday they would not be making any comments pending the results of a ""criminal investigation"" launched last week. The Larimer County district attorney is looking into the department's use of force during Ms Garner's arrest. Loveland police chief Robert Ticer has pledged full transparency with the inquiry, which will be led by Fort Collins Police. One officer has been placed on administrative leave and two others moved to administrative duties. The bodycam footage caused public outcry when it was released earlier this month. It shows two police officers stopping Ms Garner as she was picking flowers by the roadside after she left the Walmart store in the town of Loveland, about 50 miles (80km) north of Denver. CCTV from the supermarket shortly beforehand showed members of staff stopping Ms Garner to recover the $13.38 of merchandise, which included cans of fizzy drinks and laundry detergent. After she walks away from the officers, she is thrown to the ground, handcuffed, shoved face down on the bonnet of the police car and has her legs tied together with a hobble. She was left bleeding. Ms Garner's daughter-in-law, Shannon Steward, told the Denver Post the arrest had worsened Ms Garner's dementia. ""She hasn't come back the way she was before,"" Ms Steward told the newspaper. ""It was too much."" The release of the footage comes amid a nationwide reckoning over police brutality, especially against African Americans, although Ms Garner is white.
