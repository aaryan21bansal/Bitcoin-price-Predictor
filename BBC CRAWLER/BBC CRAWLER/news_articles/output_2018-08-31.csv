Man jailed for plot to kill Theresa May,"A man who plotted to kill the prime minister in a suicide attack has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 30 years. Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, 21, from north London, was convicted last month of preparing acts of terrorism. Rahman had planned to detonate a bomb at the gates of Downing Street and then kill Theresa May with a knife or gun. Sentencing him, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said Rahman ""would have carried out his attack"" had he not been arrested. Rahman was captured by an undercover operation involving the Metropolitan Police, MI5 and FBI. He was arrested moments after collecting a bag and jacket from an undercover operative that he believed had been fitted with explosives. The judge said: ""I am sure that at all material times Rahman believed the devices to be real and capable of causing serious harm."" He added that the undercover officers involved in the case were ""scrupulous"" at all times and Rahman was the ""instigator and author"" of his own actions. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Rahman made contact with IS recruiters via social media - but unbeknown to him the contact was actually an FBI agent. That agent referred Rahman to an MI5 team of online role players who convinced him that they were genuine IS figures. ""I want to do a suicide bomb on Parliament,"" Rahman told the MI5 role players. ""I want to attempt to kill Theresa May. All I need now is a sleeper cell to lay low for now."" Read more from Dominic Casciani Undercover officers gave Rahman a fake bomb Rahman, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said, had been ""told and believed"" that the rucksack bomb given to him was ""capable of causing casualties on a scale comparable to those caused at the Manchester Arena"", where 22 people were killed. Rahman's lawyer argued he had been brainwashed by his uncle - who was later killed in a drone strike while fighting for the Islamic State group in Syria - and said his client had not intended to go through with the plot. But a probation report read to the court by the judge revealed that Rahman had admitted in prison he would have carried out the attack had he been able to. A pre-sentence report described him as a ""clever and cunning"" young man who had the potential to ""operate below the radar to dreadful effect"". Mr Justice Haddon-Cave told Rahman he would have ""plenty of time"" to study the Koran in prison, adding that Islam was ""a religion of peace"". The judge added that Rahman - originally from Birmingham - was a ""very dangerous individual"" and it was hard to predict if he will ever be de-radicalised. The jacket was filled with fake explosives During his Old Bailey trial, Rahman pleaded guilty to a separate charge of engaging in conduct which assisted the preparation of terrorist acts, which related to a ""sponsorship"" video he filmed for an associate who allegedly wanted to join IS in Libya. In addition to the life sentence, Rahman was handed six years in prison for the IS sponsorship video. The sentences will run concurrently, rather than consecutively.

many nights they got my mum through and how many tears she shed listening to Aretha's music'. ""She found a way to inspire us with hope and love and dreams

The Sony Music chief creative officer told the crowd about the time he had dinner with the star - who ""loved her soul food"" - in 1979 ""when she was already, of course, the Queen of Soul"", with an arsenal of hits already. ""We talked into the night about the next five years of recording, when Aretha would be over 40 years old,"" he said. ""Much of music had changed, could she still compete?

have music blasting - and I could tell what my father had done by the music she
was playing. ""If she was playing Respect or Think I knew he had done

While many people will already now about Aretha's lifelong commitment to the US civil rights movement, another cause close to her heart has just been revealed. Retired Detroit judge Greg Mathis has been speaking about the late soul star's support in the fight for justice over the Flint water pipes scandal. In 2014, the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the cheaper Flint River, which resulted in 100,000 of residents drinking water contaminated with lead. Mathis - who noted that his comments might not please one of the service's earlier speakers, underfire Michigan Governor Rick Snyder - said that when he was feeling defeated about the ongoing struggle, Aretha told him: ""You're supposed to be from Detroit - what are you scared of?"" Bottled drinking water for residents of Flint Mathis's mic then briefly cut out, causing him to joke ""somebody's going to jail!.."" He went on to add: ""Her last words were taken from the greatest song she's performed and somehow it made me feel like she respected me. ""'You go back up there and sock it to them ""So that's what I'm going to do - I'm going to sock it to them, sock it to them, sock it to them... ""In honour of my sister Aretha.""

many nights they got my mum through and how many tears she shed listening to Aretha's music'. ""She found a way to inspire us with hope and love and dreams

The event is being held at Greater Grace Temple, the church where the Queen of Soul was a featured performer at US civil rights champion Rosa Parks' funeral. BBC News has picked out some memorable moments so far on video. Watch above. Aretha's old manager - as much as that was possible - Clive Davis has described his former client as a ""true genius of american music."" The Sony Music chief creative officer told the crowd about the time he had dinner with the star - who ""loved her soul food"" - in 1979 ""when she was already, of course, the Queen of Soul"", with an arsenal of hits already. ""We talked into the night about the next five years of recording, when Aretha would be over 40 years old,"" he said. ""Much of music had changed, could she still compete? ""Well there was no doubt in Aretha's mind and frankly there was no doubt in my mind."" They went on to have many more hits in the second half of her career, including Sisters are Doing it for Themselves, alongside the Eurythmics. Allow YouTube content?

She continued: ""She shared that with us, through the soul songs she sang, she spoke to us through her soul and everything she experiences.

have music blasting - and I could tell what my father had done by the music she
was playing. ""If she was playing Respect or Think I knew he had done
something wrong; but if she was playing Dr Feelgood he might have done
something right!"" He finished by re-assuring everybody that ""grief comes in waves and you can make your way through it."" Tyler also attended the tribute show in Detroit on Thursday night.

While many people will already now about Aretha's lifelong commitment to the US civil rights movement, another cause close to her heart has just been revealed. Retired Detroit judge Greg Mathis has been speaking about the late soul star's support in the fight for justice over the Flint water pipes scandal. In 2014, the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the cheaper Flint River, which resulted in 100,000 of residents drinking water contaminated with lead. Mathis - who noted that his comments might not please one of the service's earlier speakers, underfire Michigan Governor Rick Snyder - said that when he was feeling defeated about the ongoing struggle, Aretha told him: ""You're supposed to be from Detroit - what are you scared of?"" Bottled drinking water for residents of Flint Mathis's mic then briefly cut out, causing him to joke ""somebody's going to jail!.."" He went on to add: ""Her last words were taken from the greatest song she's performed and somehow it made me feel like she respected me. ""'You go back up there and sock it to them ""So that's what I'm going to do - I'm going to sock it to them, sock it to them, sock it to them... ""In honour of my sister Aretha.""

George W Bush also sent a letter to Franklin's family; while Bill Clinton spoke from the pulpit, describing himself as an ""Aretha Franklin groupie"" and praising the star's work ethic.

Al Sharpton, who said: ""She represented the best in our community and she fought for our community until the end. ""She gave us pride and she gave us a regal bar to reach. And that's why we're all here. We don't all agree on everything but we agree on Aretha."" He went on to criticise President Trump, whose initial tribute to Franklin two weeks ago said, ""she worked for me on numerous occasions"". ""No, she used to perform for you,"" scolded the pastor. ""Aretha never took orders from nobody but God."" Outside of the Greater Grace Temple, there is an outpouring of love for the Queen of Soul.

In her honour, the streets here were filled with more than 140 pink Cadillacs that will be part of the funeral procession.

How plot to kill PM was foiled,"A college drop-out who sought revenge for his uncle's death in Syria has been convicted of preparing to attack Downing Street and kill the PM. Naa'imur Rahman, 20, was convicted at the Old Bailey after he was trapped in a major undercover operation involving the FBI, MI5 and police. Rahman approached officers posing online as fellow extremists, asking them for help with an attack. He met two and repeatedly asked for bombs - leading to his conviction. He has now been jailed for aminimum of 30 years. Last summer Rahman was homeless in London after falling out with both his mother in the city and close relatives in Walsall, where he grew up. Walsall to Syria: Fighters, travellers and victims? Three years ago he was referred to the national deradicalisation scheme, Channel, amid concerns that the-then teenager could be brainwashed by his uncle. When he was investigated last year over an allegation of sexting with an underage girl, intelligence emerged from his phone that he had maintained contact with his uncle. Rahman's uncle Musadikur Rohaman died in a drone strike in Syria Musadikur Rohaman left the UK for Syria in 2014. The Old Bailey trial heard that he'd been encouraging his nephew to attack the UK and had sent him bomb-making plans and other extremist material. However, in late June 2017, Rohaman was killed in a coalition drone strike on IS fighters near the city of Raqqa. When Rahman learnt of his uncle's death, prosecutors told the trial that he planned his revenge. Rahman made contact with IS recruiters via social media - but unbeknown to him the contact was actually an FBI agent. That agent referred Rahman to an MI5 team of online role players who convinced him that they were genuine IS figures. ""I want to do a suicide bomb on Parliament,"" Rahman told the MI5 role players. ""I want to attempt to kill Theresa May. All I need now is a sleeper cell to lay low for now."" Despite his total lack of skills or training, MI5 was concerned that Rahman would press ahead, so counter-terrorism chiefs launched an elaborate undercover operation to gather evidence of his intent. As Rahman kept asking for help, the MI5 team introduced him to an undercover police officer in London posing as an Islamic State weapons fixer. The jury watched secretly recorded video of Rahman meeting ""Shaq"" in a car and setting out his aspirations. He told the story of his uncle's killing - and asked for a truck bomb and firearms  - before conceding he could neither drive nor fire a gun. Rahman then settled for storming Downing Street in an attempt to kill Theresa May. On 6 November last year, Rahman laid out his final plan to ""Shaq"" - a recording of it was played in court. ""I have drawn up a plan, gone through it in detail in my head. You know at the gate of Downing Street? There are about four men innit? And two men on the door? ""I want to get past that gate and if I can get to the door I want to make a dash for Theresa May. She sleeps there every night."" Undercover officers gave Rahman a fake bomb Shaq asked Rahman to elaborate on how he thought this was possible. ""If I have a backpack with stuff inside and I do that at the gate and I get past the gate... a 10-second sprint to the door."" ""I'll be honest with you,"" replied Shaq. ""I've never looked at it."" ""I wanna drop a bag at the gate, so the gate blows up a bit and I can go through and then like, make a run, like I was thinking taking a human hostage until I get to the actual door. ""Grab a human shield and then once I get close enough to the door, I'll do what I can with them to get inside."" ""You're trying to get to Number 10,"" asked Shaq. ""That's your main objective?"" ""Take her head off, yeah,"" replied Rahman. Rahman said he couldn't fund the attack because he was ""broke and homeless"" - but he handed over a jacket and a rucksack, asking for both to be filled with explosives. The jacket was filled with fake explosives Shaq returned the items with a fake bomb in the bag and the jacket filled with supposed explosives. Rahman took both off him and said: ""Do you know? Now I've seen everything it feels good."" As he walked away from the scene he was surrounded by police, arrested, and later said: ""I'm glad it's over."" Rahman told his trial that none of his plans was serious. When he made contact with men whom he thought were his uncle's comrades in Syria, he had begun showing off, making up schemes to impress them. Prosecutors showed Rahman (circled) had carried out extensive reconnaissance He told jurors that one fantastical proposal had been to build balloons to drop missiles from the edge of space. Rahman claimed he had been set up and tricked by MI5 and the police. But prosecutors showed that Rahman had carried out extensive reconnaissance of Downing Street, Parliament and nearby government buildings. The jury had to be convinced that Rahman had seriously intended to attack Downing Street and had taken the first steps along that course. In sentencing, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: ""I am sure that at all material times Rahman believed the devices to be real and capable of causing serious harm.""

Aretha Franklin's funeral in quotes,"Pastor Charles Ellis was among those who paid tribute to Franklin The funeral for soul legend Aretha Franklin is taking place in Detroit, two weeks after she died of pancreatic cancer, aged 76. The five-hour service has seen tributes and reminiscences from dozens of friends, family members, music legends and dignitaries. Here are some of the most memorable quotes from the Queen of Soul's service. The former president pulled out his phone and played a clip of Aretha's hit single Think ""We started out, not as a president, a first lady, a senator, a secretary of state. We started out as, like, Aretha groupies."" ""When we are getting out of college is when she finally got her big breakthrough. ""It's one thing I want to say to the people in the audience: She had the voice of generation, maybe the voice of a century but she also worked for years, I mean years, when nobody was paying particular attention. ""The secret of her greatness was she took this massive talent and this perfect culture that raised her and decided to be the composer of her own life's song - and what a song it turned out to be."" ""I just loved her."" ""My mother died in 2009 and it was her who introduced me to the voice of Aretha Franklin. We'd be driving up to the country and she'd have music blasting - and I could tell what my father had done by the music she was playing. ""If she was playing Respect or Think I knew he had done something wrong; but if she was playing Dr Feelgood he might have done something right."" ""I didn't know, especially this soon, that I was going to have to say goodbye to you. We talked about it many times that we're the two that were left from all of our neighbourhood friends. ""You're gonna be one of the future voices in the choir of angels because you know you'd have to be. The world is celebrating you and the world is gonna miss you and I know that I'm gonna miss you so much because I miss our talks."" ""She never relied on anyone else to tell her story. She wrote her own script. She handled her own business. ""She understood how to wield power without raising her voice. She was paid in advance if she performed. She'd insist there was no air conditioning if she was to sing.  She refused to be extorted or disrespected."" ""The reason that we are here today is because of love. Because of how much we love this woman. ""The greatest gift we have been given in life itself is love. We can talk about all the things that are wrong - and there are many - but the only thing that can deliver us is love. ""So what needs to happen today, not only in this nation but throughout this world, is that we need to make love great again. That is what Aretha said througout her life. Through the pain, she gave us the joy and said, 'Let's make love great again.'"" ""From a young age, Aretha Franklin rocked the world of anyone who had the pleasure of hearing her voice. ""In the example she set both as an artist and a citizen, Aretha embodied those most revered virtues of forgiveness and reconciliation, while the music she made captured some of our deepest human desires, namely affection and respect. And through her voice, her own voice, Aretha lifted those of millions empowering and inspiring the vulnerable, the downtrodden, and everyone who may have just needed a little love."" ""Laura and I are deeply saddened by the loss of the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. Our hearts ache for you and our prayers are with you. Aretha was a woman of achievement with a deep character and a loving heart. She made important and lasting contributions to American music with her gospel-inspired style and distinctive voice. ""Her remarkable talent helped shape our nation's artistic and cultural heritage and in 2005 it was my privilege to honour her with our country's highest civilian award - the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I am proud to have met Aretha, and am grateful that her music will continue to bring joy to millions for generations to come. As you remember and honour Aretha's life may the almighty comfort you in your grief and sustain you during this difficult time."" Victorie Franklin comforts Jordin Franklin, Aretha's grandson, as he pays tribute ""When I would go to her shows and watch her sing it would be the best feeling in the world. Nothing sounded better to me than the way my grandma sings. Her voice made you feel something. You felt every word, every note, every emotion in the songs she sang. Her voice brought peace. ""It feels amazing to see a woman so fierce, so courageous, gifted, so respected and to be able to call [her] my grandmother; to know that I have that running through my blood and that she's a part of who I am."" ""Behind her God-given natural talent was the drive of a total perfectionist. She privately rehearsed, she practiced, she prepared. And by the time she came into the studio, she literally owned the songs. ""Everyone in the studio would be in awe of her mastery when she stepped up to the microphone. It was a real rarity if she ever were to do more than two takes."" ""Thank you Lord for Aretha: She was strong in her spirit, pure in her heart, generous in her giving, sweet in her compassion, calm in her demeanour, gentle in her touch, powerful in her embrace. ""Thank you for Aretha: She was wise in her advice, bold in her speech, classy in her walk, stylish in her apparel, faithful in her service, loving to her family, loyal to her faith, and submissive to her God. ""Thank you for Aretha: She was a bright and shining star, she was an image of hope larger than life, she was a soldier, a trouper, an encourager, a good and faithful servant. ""Thank you for Aretha: She charmed us, she thrilled us, she entertained us, she inspired us, she motivated us, she helped us, she blessed us, one and all. ""Thank you, Lord, for Aretha: Lord you gave us a Queen, a trouper, a true queen, royalty at its best, and we thank you."" ""Aretha Franklin was given special gifts but she used [them] in a special way. She would not want us to celebrate her without talking about [how] she stood for something. She represented the best in our community and she fought for our community until the end."" ""She was a feminist before feminism was popular. She was a civil rights activist when it wasn't popular. She gave us pride, and she gave us a regal bar to reach. And that's why we're all here. We don't agree on everything, but we agree on Aretha. ""[President] Trump said, 'she used to work for me'. No, she used to perform for you. She worked for us. Aretha never took orders from nobody but God."" ""When Aretha sang, she lifted the downtrodden spirits and challenged presidents to remember the voices of millions. ""Her voice was mixed with the joy and sadness, the tears and screams of her people down through the ages. She sang in our key and she taught the world how to hear it. ""She specialised in singing that moved the soul, stirred the spirit, and made us aware of a divine presence that could not be denied. ""In the midst of our nation's current moral crisis, we need again that gospel that Aretha sang."" ""We have plenty of programs today. Some of them are going to end up on eBay.""

Mother and baby deaths review widened,"This video can not be played Jack Burn died hours after being born at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford An independent review into a series of baby deaths at a hospital is to be expanded after more families came forward with concerns about their care. In 2017 Jeremy Hunt ordered an investigation into maternity care relating to 23 cases at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust (SaTH). This has increased to more than 40, but the trust said these were cases already in the public domain. The trust said it had worked ""openly"" with the investigation. Midlands Live: Man questioned over mum and daughter murders; Tanker crash shuts M6 lanes Senior midwife Donna Ockenden was appointed last year to review 23 cases - including baby deaths, maternal deaths and brain injuries - of alleged poor maternity care at the trust. A spokesperson for NHS Improvement said it had to agreed ""to consider additional historical investigations that have been highlighted since our independent review was announced in April 2017, where women, infants and new-born babies had died or suffered harm in the maternity services provided by Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust"". ""This includes the cases that the trust had considered as part of its legacy review, as well as the finding of the review it commissioned the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to undertake."" Richard Stanton, 48, whose daughter Kate Stanton-Davies died nine years ago, said: ""It doesn't surprise me, it deeply saddens me."" He welcomed the move to bring all the investigations under the umbrella of the Ockenden review, so there could be ""consistency"" with cases looked at ""with the same eye"". ""In my view, there's serious questions for the leadership, management, governance and policies at this trust, as it's been a systemic failure."" Kate Stanton-Davies, pictured with her mother Rhiannon, was born at Ludlow Community Hospital Hayley Matthews's son Jack Burn was born in March 2015 but died of hypoxia and Group B Strep within hours. She said that throughout her 36 hour-long labour at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford she was refused a caesarean section several times and had a natural birth during which her son's shoulder was trapped. ""It makes you angry, all these parents going through what I went through three years ago. They said changes have been made but at the moment we're failing to see any,"" she added. ""I was just another number on a bed."" Devan and Gavin Cadwallade believe their daughter's death was preventable Devan and Gavin Cadwallade's daughter died at the Princess Royal Hospital last December. Devan had complained to staff that her baby's movements had slowed but she was reassured everything was fine. After three days in hospital she was told her daughter had no heartbeat. ""I was just a number to them, it was just a bed and no-one stopped to think, 'hang on, this isn't normal,'"" said Devan. A post-mortem failed to find a cause of death and the couple believe it was preventable. ""I think in our heads, although it's horrible to say, if something had been wrong with her we could maybe deal with that a little bit more,"" said Gavin. Last summer, the trust invited the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists,externalto carry out a review of its maternity services, which revealed a number of problems, It said in a report that a culture of learning from incidents ""was not apparent"" and the lack of staff - particularly midwives and consultants - ""was a patient safety issue"". While the publication of their report was at the trust's discretion, the process did allow the Royal College to ""refer to a regulator in the public interest any matters they consider require this"". Dr Edward Morris, a vice president for the Royal College, said: ""The Care Quality Commission had already performed a visit and a detailed review into the trust as a whole and the maternity services. ""The safety and quality of the care they delivered was largely reported as good, true in two hospitals there were areas that required improvement. ""Therefore we felt there was no additional need to present our findings as an acute safety concern."" Further review into maternity care Parents' anger at baby deaths NHS trust Cluster of baby deaths probe ordered SaTH said it had reviewed 40 cases, 23 of which had no signs of failure of care and five of which the families could not be contacted. It said it had also written to 12 other families to seek permission for their care to be reviewed as there ""may be potential for further learning"". The trust's chief executive Simon Wright added: ""The death of any baby is a terrible ordeal for any family. We take our responsibilities in reviewing these cases very seriously. ""To suggest that there are more cases which have not been revealed when this is simply untrue is irresponsible and scaremongering."" Powys Community Health Council said the issue would be ""worrying"" for people in the county who used the services. In a statement it said: ""Since concerns were first raised, the Community Health Council has sought assurance from Powys Teaching Health Board that the services they commission for Powys residents are safe."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We take any patient safety concerns extremely seriously - we have asked NHS Improvement to investigate whether further cases at Shrewsbury and Telford should be considered as part of the Ockenden Review, as well as assurance that the trust has taken steps to improve maternity services since these issues came to light in 2016.""

Girl murder suspect jailed over password,"Lucy McHugh was found stabbed to death in woodland at Southampton Sports Centre A man arrested on suspicion of murdering a teenager in Southampton has been jailed for withholding his Facebook password from detectives. Lucy McHugh, 13, was found stabbed to death in woodland last month, a day after she disappeared. Stephen-Alan Nicholson, 24, pleaded guilty to failing to comply with an order under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, requiring him to disclose the Facebook password. He was sentenced to 14 months in jail. Nicholson, of no fixed address, appeared by videolink at Southampton Crown Court. He was first arrested on 27 July on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child and subsequently bailed. But he was also charged under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. The court heard the charge related to a court order that Nicholson disclose his Facebook password protecting any private communications with Lucy McHugh. He was described as a family friend and care worker who had been staying in Lucy's home in Mansel Road until shortly before her death. Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Parker did not accept Nicholson's ""wholly inadequate"" excuse that providing his password would expose information relating to cannabis. ""What you have done is obstructed the investigation, and a very serious investigation indeed. It has caused a very significant delay,"" the judge said. ""It means that the task of police investigating the murder of Lucy McHugh is that much more difficult."" Matthew Lawson, prosecuting, said police were following a ""lengthy procedure"" to get the information from Facebook itself.

US ends aid to Palestinian refugee agency,"Unrwa provides critical services, including education and health care The United States is ending all funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, the US State Department says. It described the organisation, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), as ""irredeemably flawed"". The US administration has ""carefully reviewed"" the issue and ""will not make additional contributions to Unrwa,"" spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later said the move was an ""assault"" against his people. ""Such a punishment will not succeed to change the fact that the United States no longer has a role in the region and that it is not a part of the solution,"" Nabil Abu Rudeina told Reuters news agency. He added that the decision was ""a defiance of UN resolutions"". Palestinians fear cost of Trump's aid cut UN alarm as US cuts aid to Palestinians A spokesman for Unrwa, Chris Gunness, defended the agency in a series of tweets. ""We reject in the strongest possible terms the criticism that Unrwa's schools, health centres, and emergency assistance programs are 'irredeemably flawed',"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The latest move comes after the US announced back in January that it would withhold more than half of a tranche of funding for the agency. Unrwa was originally set up to take care of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The agency says it currently supports more than five million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, including providing health care, education and social services. The US has been the largest single donor to Unrwa, providing $364m (Â£283m) in 2017 and funding almost 30% of its operations in the region. The Trump administration had pledged $60m to Unrwa in January, but withheld another $65m. The remaining payment of $65m is now expected to be cancelled. The US disagrees with Unrwa, and Palestinian officials, on a number of issues. US President Donald Trump has previously complained that the US received ""no appreciation or respect"" for the large sums of aid it provided to the region. Earlier this year, he threatened to cut aid to the Palestinians over what he called their unwillingness to negotiate with Israel. The US has said Unrwa needs to become more accountable The US and Israel also disagree with Unrwa on which Palestinians are refugees with a right to return to the homes they fled following the 1948 war. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said earlier this week that Unrwa exaggerated the number of Palestinian refugees, and needed to reform. ""You're looking at the fact that, yes, there's an endless number of refugees that continue to get assistance, but more importantly, the Palestinians continue to bash America,"" she said. The state department says the US is contributing a ""very disproportionate share of the burden of Unrwa's costs"". It complains of a business model and fiscal practices, linked to an ""exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries"", which is ""unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years"". On Friday, the Palestinian representative in Washington, Hossam Zomlot, accused the US of ""endorsing the most extreme Israeli narrative on all issues including the rights of more than five million Palestinian refugees"". The US ""is damaging not only an already volatile situation but the prospects for future peace"", he told AFP. Nikki Haley has criticised Palestinian officials for ""bashing America"" Palestinian officials have already accused the Trump administration of worsening tensions due to its pro-Israel stance. In December, Mr Trump controversially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, despite it being claimed by both sides. His move overturned decades of US neutrality on the issue, attracted international criticism, and led to the Palestinian Authority cutting off dialogue in Washington. Why Trump and Jerusalem was not about peace Palestinian territories profile In May, the US also opened an embassy in Jerusalem, a move described by Palestinian officials as a ""blatant provocation"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously called for Unrwa's funding to be cut gradually and its responsibilities transferred to the UN's global refugee agency, the UNHCR, arguing that it ""perpetuates the Palestinian problem"". However, he said that ""every step taken also contains some risk"". Some Israelis have raised concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism in the region. Earlier on Friday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his country would increase its contributions to the agency because its funding crisis was fuelling uncertainty. ""The loss of this organisation could unleash an uncontrollable chain reaction,"" Mr Maas said. Meanwhile, the UN's secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said he has ""full confidence"" in Unrwa, and called on other countries ""to help fill the remaining financial gap"".

The main opposition party Fianna FÃ¡il says the visit by the US President follows a history of welcoming previous US Presidents to Ireland. Fianna FÃ¡il foreign affairs spokesperson Niall Collins says the occasion gives the government the opportunity to reiterate Ireland's position ""that the need for decency, compassion, respect for international diplomacy has been been as important"". It also emerged during Mr Varadkar's visit to the US that he had made a call to Clare County Council when tourism minister over a proposal to build a wind farm near Trump's golf resort. The council eventually rejected the windfarm application. The US President owns a golf resort in County Clare, Trump Doonbeg,which he bought in February 2014. It is expected the US President will spend some time at his golf course in Doonbeg, County Clare He last visited Doonbeg in May that year and was met off the plane by then finance minister Michael Noonan. Mr Trump was due to visit again just a few months before the US presidential election, in the summer of 2016, but later shelved the plan. The dates and exact itinerary of his upcoming Irish visit have not been released. ""While in Europe, the President will also visit Ireland to renew the deep and historic ties between our two nations,"" the White House said in a statement. A spokesperson for the Department of the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) said: ""The Taoiseach understands that President Trump will stop in Ireland for a brief visit on his way to or from the Armistice commemorations in Paris. ""It will be an opportunity to follow up on the issues discussed in the White House in March including migration, trade, climate change and human rights issues.""

US-Canada trade talks break up without deal,"Donald Trump announced a deal with Mexico this week but Canada remains on the sidelines Talks between the US and Canada about amending the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) have ended for the week without reaching a deal. US officials said they would meet their Canadian counterparts again next week in an effort to reach agreement. For now, the US plans to move forward with a deal with Mexico on terms reached earlier in the week. It's not clear what this means for the trilateral agreement, which governs more than $1tr (Â£770bn) in trade. The White House had faced a Friday deadline to provide Congress with the necessary 90 days' notice that it intended to enter into a new trade agreement and still have the new Nafta deal signed by 1 December, the day Mexico's new left-wing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office. The US wants Canada to open up access to US dairy products, extend patent protections for medicines and agree to eliminate international panels to resolve most disputes between investors and governments. Dairy in particular appeared to be an issue on Friday, with US officials saying Canada had made no concessions on agriculture and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying he was standing firm on the issue. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Friday afternoon that the two countries are making progress and that an agreement is ""within reach"". ""With goodwill and flexibility on all sides we can get there,"" she said. She also said Canada does not feel the same deadline pressure as the US. ""For Canada, the focus is on getting a good deal and once we have a good deal for Canada, we'll be done,"" she said. This video can not be played If Nafta trade deal was a hamburger... President Donald Trump notified Congress on Friday that he intended to sign a new trade agreement with Mexico in 90 days, and Canada ""if it is willing"", US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said. He said talks with Canada this week had been ""constructive"". Officials said the US is on track to present text of the agreement in 30 days. ""Our officials are continuing to work toward agreement.  The USTR team will meet with Minister Freeland and her colleagues Wednesday of next week,"" Mr Lighthizer said. Mr Trump said earlier this week he was willing to cut Canada out of the pact. But it is not clear whether Congress, which has final say over trade agreements, will accept a deal if Canada is not part of it. Several senators have questioned whether the White House has the authority to negotiate a deal without Canada. Business groups have also said it is critical that Canada be part of any agreement. ""Anything other than a trilateral agreement won't win Congressional approval and would lose business support,"" said Thomas Donahue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce. The preliminary agreement announced by the US and Mexico earlier this week included provisions aimed at boosting vehicle production in North America and easing online commerce, among other matters. On Friday, Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo hailed the US decision to notify Congress as a sign of progress. Mexico will continue to press for Canada to remain in the updated accord, he added. This video can not be played Donald Trump speaks with the Mexican leader on the phone through an interpreter Mr Trump has taken a tough-talking approach to Canada and threatened to levy tariffs on car parts exported from Canada to the US if a deal is not reached. In off-the-record comments made to Bloomberg on Thursday and leaked to the Toronto Star, he boasted that any deal with Canada would be ""totally on our terms"". ""Here's the problem. If I say no - the answer's no,"" he said according to the report. The president later acknowledged the remarks in a tweet, saying: ""At least Canada knows where I stand!"" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump has also frequently expressed his distaste for multilateral trade agreements, especially Nafta. In a 2016 presidential debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, he described Nafta as ""the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere"" and a ""killer"" of US jobs. Once in office he said he wanted to renegotiate - not scrap - the accord, triggering the last year of talks. The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts in recent months. It has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium, including from Mexico, Canada and the European Union. It is also engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence and place tariffs on each others' goods. A third round of US tariffs on $200bn (Â£154bn) of Chinese goods could come as soon as next week, according to a Bloomberg report.

EU backs scrapping clock changesTime could be up for the practice of changing clocks in the autumn and spring in the EU.Europe,"The EU Commission is proposing to end the practice of adjusting clocks by an hour in spring and autumn after a survey found most Europeans opposed it. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said millions ""believe that in future, summer time should be year-round, and that's what will happen"". The Commission's proposal requires support from the 28 national governments and MEPs to become law. In the EU clocks switch between winter and summer under daylight saving time. A European Parliament resolution says it is ""crucial to maintain a unified EU time regime"". However, the Commission has not yet drafted details of the proposed change. In a consultation paper,externalit said one option would be to let each member state decide whether to go for permanent summer or winter time. That would be ""a sovereign decision of each member state"", Commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein explained on Friday. He stressed that the proposal was ""to no longer constrain member states into changing clocks twice per year"". The UK is one of the 28 nations, but is due to leave the European Union in March 2019. Any change would be unlikely to happen before then. Mr Winterstein rejected a suggestion the proposal could cause particular difficulties in Ireland: ""I don't see the link between our quest which is undiminished, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and our proposal, which will come in due course, to no longer constrain member states into changing clocks twice per year. ""One pertains to the internal market once adopted, the other initiative is to ensure the Good Friday Agreement and other safeguards remain in place."" The Commission warns that unco-ordinated time changes between member states would cause economic harm. In the public consultation,external, 84% of 4.6 million respondents called for ending the spring and autumn clock change. By far the biggest response was in Germany and Austria (3.79% and 2.94% of the national population respectively). The UK's response was lowest - 0.02% - but few Italians took part, either (0.04%). Changing clocks: a waste of time? How time zones confused the world How do countries swap time zones? Why daylight saving time riles the US Some studies cited by the Commission point to adverse health impacts from the clock changes. ""Findings suggest that the effect on the human biorhythm may be more severe than previously thought,"" it says. Clocks go forward by an hour on the last Sunday in March and switch back to winter time on the last Sunday in October. Finland called for daylight saving to be abolished EU-wide, after a petition gathered more than 70,000 signatures from citizens calling for such a change. The EU made the spring/autumn clock change the rule in all member states in 1996, based on the argument that it would reduce energy costs. But the Commission says the data on energy-saving is inconclusive. There is also no reliable evidence that the clock changes reduce traffic accidents, the Commission says. There are three standard time zones when daylight saving time is not applied: Three states apply GMT (the UK, Ireland and Portugal) 17 have Central European Time, which is GMT+1 Eight have Eastern European Time, which is GMT+2 The current seasonal clock changes are controversial partly because there is a big difference in daylight hours experienced by Scandinavia and by southern Europe. Nordic countries have long, dark nights in winter and short nights in summer. The pattern in the south is more even across the seasons. There are anomalies too. For example, neighbours Portugal and Spain are in different time zones, as are Sweden and Finland. The UK adopted Daylight Saving Time in 1916, along with many other nations involved in World War One, in order to conserve coal. It followedyears of pressure from William Willett, a great-great-grandfather of Coldplay singer Chris Martin. But the UK has had its own debate about time zones. In 2011,the government proposed a three-year trialof moving to Central European Time, so the time would be GMT+1 in winter and GMT+2 in summer. The change would have meant lighter evenings but darker mornings, and one of the arguments was that it would reduce accidents. But it was abandoned after opposition from Scotland and northern England, where some areas would not have seen daylight until 10am under the proposal. Emma in Finland As a Finn who has lived across Scandinavia I wholeheartedly welcome this initiative. There have been times that I have fallen asleep at 16:00 in the afternoon or have not seen sunlight for several days due to the times I started and finished work. Lars in Sweden It would be a much better idea to keep daylight saving but have the change take place on Good Friday each year because most people would then be off work for four days. This would almost certainly reduce the risks of cardiovascular incidents and tiredness. For us in northern Europe scrapping daylight saving and using so called summertime all year round would mean the mornings in wintertime would be incredibly dark until 09:00. Also, using so-called wintertime in summer would mean an end to much of the long, bright summer nights. Andrew in Denmark Whilst I can see the advantages in stopping the change from winter to summertime and vice versa, it may create problems. If Denmark kept summertime in the winter, it would not be daylight in late November-February until 10:00 and beyond. If they keep wintertime in the summer, the sun will rise at about 02:00. This is not an easy problem to resolve. Up until 1996, Denmark went to summertime one month after the UK and returned to wintertime one month before, so that for two months of the year they were on the same time as the UK. Richard in Switzerland This is a great shame. Summertime was introduced in mainland Europe because it gave more daylight in the evenings. I was living in France at the time and it was very popular. Some countries did not follow suit immediately - for example, Italy and Switzerland. This led to a chaotic situation for those close to the borders. Jessica in Spain It's about time this was brought up. I suffer from a vitamin D deficiency and the winter months in particular, are awful. When I lived in Kent and commuted an hour into London for work, I only saw maybe a half-hour of daylight at lunchtime a day, and that's if I managed to get away from my desk. I know some people who only see sunlight at the weekends. If this could be changed so we at least get a bit of sunlight en route to or from work, this would make the tiniest difference but could affect everyone's health in a big way. Also, everyone knows that people are happier and friendlier in the sunshine. Graeme in Scotland I lived through the UK's experiment of having no time change while at school in Scotland. It was almost dark until 10:00 in the winter and that was horrible. I have since worked in south-west Norway, which has a very similar sunshine period. The winter in Scotland and Norway is dark and cold. Do not mess with the status quo.

Body found in loft after eight monthsTeenager Abdi Ali was last seen by his family on 11 December following a family wedding.London,"Abdi Ali was reported missing by his family on 31 December 2017 The body of a teenager has been found in a loft more than eight months after he was reported missing, the Metropolitan Police has said. Abdi Ali was last seen by his family on 11 December following a family wedding. On 27 August he was found dead inside a home on Hartmoor Mews, in Enfield, north London. Gary Hopkins, 36, and Stacey Docharty, 28, have been charged with murder, perverting the course of justice and preventing the lawful burial of a body. The pair appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on 30 August and have been remanded in custody ahead of further court appearances on dates and locations which are yet to be set. A post-mortem examination gave Mr Ali's cause of death as blunt force trauma to the head and stab wounds to the chest. Police say Mr Ali, 18, of Ostell Crescent, was reported missing to them on New Year's Eve. His next of kin have been informed, the Met has confirmed.

Crossrail to miss December opening date,"Crossrail's original budget was set at Â£15.9bn in 2007 but cut to Â£14.8bn in 2010 Londonâs Â£15bn Crossrail project is to open nine months after its scheduled launch to allow more time for testing. Europe's biggest infrastructure project will help ease London's chronic congestion by connecting major landmarks such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. The route, to be known as the Elizabeth line, had been due to open in December, but will now be launched in autumn 2019 ""to ensure a safe and reliable railway"", transport officials said. It is runningalmost Â£600m over budget. The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December 2018 When fully operational, trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. It will operate as three separate services - as previously planned. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes. During the project eight giant tunnel boring machines burrowed below the streets of London to construct 42km of new rail tunnels An estimated 200m passengers will use the new undergound line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Crossrail Limited described the 10-year project as ""hugely complex"". It said ""further time"" was required for testing, and that contractors needed to complete work in the central tunnels and to develop ""railways systems software"". Transport for London (TfL) said more time was needed ""to ensure a safe and reliable railway for customers from day one of passenger service"". Lord Adonis, the former Transport Secretary, accused Crossrail of ""trying to smuggle out a really serious failure on the biggest infrastructure project affecting the country"" when parliament isn't sitting. He said: ""There's no excuse for what has happened on this project, and people need to be held to account."" By Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent I have lost count of the times that Crossrail executives said to me the project would be delivered ""on time and on budget"". Today that disappeared in a puff of smoke, and there is no doubt this is a blow for Crossrail. I'm told it wasn't one specific problem. There were issues with three different signalling systems and also delays to the station fit outs. They simply ran out of time. This will also hit TfL's finances which was  relying on Crossrail to increase its fare take. This flagship project - the biggest construction project in Europe - just lost some of its lustre. This video can not be played How to fly a drone through Crossrail's tunnels The Federation of Small Business (FSB) said it was ""extremely disappointed with the news"". London Policy Chair of the FSB, Sue Terpilowski, said: ""Small businesses, particularly in central London, have been preparing for a December roll out of the new infrastructure and to be told on a Friday in August that the date has now changed is simply not good enough."" A spokesman for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the delay is ""obviously disappointing. ""It is essential that a safe and reliable railway operates from day one, and this has to be the top priority."" 360 video: Tour the London Silver Vaults Autism dog charities call for regulation Is it OK to paint your nails on a train? Simon Wright, Crossrail chief executive, said: ""The Elizabeth line is one of the most complex and challenging infrastructure projects ever undertaken in the UK and is now in its final stages. ""We have made huge progress with the delivery of this incredible project but we need further time to complete the testing of the new railway. ""We are working around the clock with our supply chain and Transport for London to complete and commission the Elizabeth line."" Elizabeth line trains are already operating between Shenfield and Liverpool Street, and between Paddington and Hayes & Harlington.

The almost seven hour service has drawn to a close. Thank you for joining us this afternoon/evening to help bid an official farewell to the Queen of Soul. Scroll down for performances and speeches from Aretha's family, as well as stars including Ariana Grande, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Faith Hill, Jennifer Hudson, Gladys Knight and many many more during the seven and half hour ceremony at the Greater Grace Temple in her hometown Detroit. RIP Aretha. Thank you for the music and for continuing to inspire so many others. A final Lord's Prayer has been said. Now Jennifer Holliday and the Aretha Franklin Celebration Choir are providing the soundtrack to Aretha's gold casket being led out of the church. Everyone inside are now up on their feet and will follow out shortly. After performing an extended harmonica solo, Stevie paid tribute to his friend. ""Without God's goodness and greatness, we would never have known the Queen of Soul, we would have never known the joy she brought to us, someone who could express in song the pain that we felt. ""The reason we are here today is because of love, because of how much we love this woman. ""Across this nation and across the world we need to make love great again, because black lives DO matter, because all lives matter."" The last comment possibly a dig at previous speaker, Reverend Jasper Williams Jr. Stevie then performed his 1976 track, I'll Be Loving You Always, which was later covered by George Michael and Mary J Blige. ""I want everyone to sing along, I'd appreciate it... if you don't, I'll see you later,"" he joked. The 68-year-old was at Aretha's bedside, shortly before her death two weeks ago. The Motown star sang at the last night's official tribute concert but she wasn't listed as a performer tonight. Now she's arrived on stage at the seventh hour of proceedings at Greater Grace Temple. She belted out a  heartfelt rendition of the song from the musical Carousel, which Liverpool and Celtic FC fans reading will know well, as well Paul Simon's Bridge Over Troubled Water. Barring anymore surprises, Stevie Wonder is surely up next. We're coming towards the end of the ceremony now. Rev. Jasper Williams Jr, the Pastor at Salem Baptist
Church, Atlanta, is delivering a rather lengthy official eulogy now. He delivered the eulogy at Aretha's father CL Franklin's funeral too. Some of his views on the role of black women in the home appear to have caused much conjecture online. He should wrap up his half hour speech soon so we can watch a bit of Stevie Wonder.

When he got his big break in basketball with a move to Detroit, he ""got to know Aretha personally. ""It was actually the first family I met when I got to Detroit. ""I know a lot of people are smiling and thinking how I was when you first met me and how naive I was about this thing called celebrity. ""I didn't know how to pay my bills... I knew nothing. And this family took care of me through some very tough times. Aretha Franklin watches Detroit Pistons v Miami Heat in 2011 I was honoured to get to know Aretha and she had a great love of sports. She loved the Detroit Pistons and I know I was her favourite bad boy  He added: ""But I gotta tell you there was nothing more inspiring for me
than to look up and see my mum sitting in the stands sitting next to Aretha,
sandwiched in between Stevie watching a Pistons game. ""I'd always pause during the game and think to myself, 'I wonder how
many nights they got my mum through and how many tears she shed listening to Aretha's music'. ""She found a way to inspire us with hope and love and dreams
through her music ""I'm going to miss you Aretha... the world's going to miss you... but most importantly, Detroit is going to miss you.""

The event is being held at Greater Grace Temple, the church where the Queen of Soul was a featured performer at US civil rights champion Rosa Parks' funeral. BBC News has picked out some memorable moments so far on video. Watch above. Aretha's old manager - as much as that was possible - Clive Davis has described his former client as a ""true genius of american music."" The Sony Music chief creative officer told the crowd about the time he had dinner with the star - who ""loved her soul food"" - in 1979 ""when she was already, of course, the Queen of Soul"", with an arsenal of hits already. ""We talked into the night about the next five years of recording, when Aretha would be over 40 years old,"" he said. ""Much of music had changed, could she still compete?

The almost seven hour service has drawn to a close. Thank you for joining us this afternoon/evening to help bid an official farewell to the Queen of Soul. Scroll down for performances and speeches from Aretha's family, as well as stars including Ariana Grande, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Faith Hill, Jennifer Hudson, Gladys Knight and many many more during the seven and half hour ceremony at the Greater Grace Temple in her hometown Detroit. RIP Aretha. Thank you for the music and for continuing to inspire so many others. A final Lord's Prayer has been said. Now Jennifer Holliday and the Aretha Franklin Celebration Choir are providing the soundtrack to Aretha's gold casket being led out of the church. Everyone inside are now up on their feet and will follow out shortly. After performing an extended harmonica solo, Stevie paid tribute to his friend. ""Without God's goodness and greatness, we would never have known the Queen of Soul, we would have never known the joy she brought to us, someone who could express in song the pain that we felt. ""The reason we are here today is because of love, because of how much we love this woman. ""Across this nation and across the world we need to make love great again, because black lives DO matter, because all lives matter."" The last comment possibly a dig at previous speaker, Reverend Jasper Williams Jr. Stevie then performed his 1976 track, I'll Be Loving You Always, which was later covered by George Michael and Mary J Blige. ""I want everyone to sing along, I'd appreciate it... if you don't, I'll see you later,"" he joked. The 68-year-old was at Aretha's bedside, shortly before her death two weeks ago. The Motown star sang at the last night's official tribute concert but she wasn't listed as a performer tonight. Now she's arrived on stage at the seventh hour of proceedings at Greater Grace Temple. She belted out a  heartfelt rendition of the song from the musical Carousel, which Liverpool and Celtic FC fans reading will know well, as well Paul Simon's Bridge Over Troubled Water. Barring anymore surprises, Stevie Wonder is surely up next. We're coming towards the end of the ceremony now. Rev. Jasper Williams Jr, the Pastor at Salem Baptist
Church, Atlanta, is delivering a rather lengthy official eulogy now. He delivered the eulogy at Aretha's father CL Franklin's funeral too. Some of his views on the role of black women in the home appear to have caused much conjecture online. He should wrap up his half hour speech soon so we can watch a bit of Stevie Wonder.

Blast kills top Ukraine rebel leader,"Alexander Zakharchenko in a 2017 photo A leader of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, Alexander Zakharchenko, has been killed in an explosion at a cafe in Donetsk city. ""The head of the DNR [Donetsk People's Republic]... has died as the result of a terrorist attack,"" Zakharchenko's spokeswoman told AFP news agency. Russia's foreign ministry said it suspected Ukraine of organising the latest killing. The Ukrainian government has denied any involvement. Some observers have attributed previous deaths of rebel leaders in Donetsk to infighting among the rebels, or moves by Moscow to eliminate inconvenient separatist leaders. Rebel and Russian news reports say the separatists' ""finance minister"" Alexander Timofeyev was wounded in the blast at the Separ cafe that killed Zakharchenko. Ukrainians suspected of being behind the blast were arrested nearby, a security source was quoted as saying. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said ""there is every reason to believe that the Kiev regime is behind the murder"". She said the Kiev ""party of war"" was ""violating its pledges about peace and has decided on a bloodbath"". However, recent reports suggested that Zakharchenko had fallen out of favour with Russia. A spokeswoman for Ukraine's state security service, Yelena Gitlyanskaya, rejected Moscow's accusations. She said the killing was a result of ""internal fighting... between the terrorists and their Russian sponsors"". Heavily armed rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk regions refuse to recognise the Ukrainian government in Kiev. The rebels seized large swathes of territory there in an uprising in April 2014. Since then, thousands of people have died in fighting between the rebels and Ukrainian government forces. Moscow denies sending regular troops and heavy weapons to the separatists, but admits that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. The frontline between them and Ukrainian government troops has remained largely static for months, butskirmishes continue despite a fragile ceasefire deal. There has been shooting on the frontline despite a ""back-to-school truce"" that was supposed to take effect on Wednesday. International monitors reported 70 ceasefire violations on that day alone. He played a key role in the Russian-backed separatist military operation from its very beginning. In early 2014, soon after Ukraine's pro-Russian government was toppled by the Maidan revolution, he took part in the seizure of the Donetsk regional administration building by people saying they were protesting against the new pro-Western authorities. Later that year, he was chosen as the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic by its parliament, the ""Supreme Council"". He had been in the role ever since, assuming the title of president, and was among the signatories of the stalled Minsk peace agreement. He was wounded twice in combat, and survived a car bomb blast in August 2014. In October 2016, a Russian-born rebel commander nicknamed""Motorola"" - real name Arsen Pavlov - was killed by a bomb blastin the lift of his apartment block In February 2017 rebel commanderGivi (real name Mikhail Tolstykh) was killed by a rocketthat was fired into his office.

'Paedophile hunter' guilty of false claim,"Stephen Dure, also known as Stevie Trap, featured in a regional edition of a BBC Inside Out programme in 2017 A self-styled ""paedophile hunter"", whose videos have been watched millions of times by Facebook users, has been convicted of falsely accusing a man of grooming teenagers. Stephen Dure, 34, also known as Stevie Trap, pleaded guilty to making an improper communication online. His wrongly-accused victim said he had been sacked and his home had been attacked as a result. Mr Dure, from Southampton, will be sentenced on Monday. The defendant appeared in a BBC Inside Out programme in 2017, when he explained how he posed as children on the internet to ""trap"" sex offenders. His Facebook page, which shows videos of him confronting suspected paedophiles, has more than 200,000 followers. Southampton Magistrates' Court heard he had accused Paul Farhad, 42, of being a ""violent psychopath"" and a ""massive danger to society"" in a Facebook post in November 2017. Mr Farhad, from Eastleigh, said 111,000 people had viewed the message, which he said also implied he was a paedophile. Paul Farhad was falsely accused in a Facebook post of grooming teenagers As a result he lost his job, paint was sprayed on his door and a brick was thrown through his window, he told the court. Alfred Underwood, defending, said Mr Dure accepted that Mr Farhad was not a paedophile, which was ""nowhere suggested"" in the Facebook message read out in court. The victim then produced a screenshot of the post on his mobile phone. It showed the words ""grooming teenagers"" had been deleted from the original published message at some stage. Mr Dure then changed his plea to guilty. Stephen Dure said his online career might be over Judge Lorraine Morgan adjourned sentencing, saying she was imposing conditions on Mr Dure's bail ""in the light of your lack of frankness"". She ordered the defendant to wear an electronic tag, to observe a curfew and not to use social media. Outside court, Mr Dure said his online career might be over but his team would continue his work.

Man stole mother-in-law's corpse,"The unnamed man broke into Butterfly Funeral Services in Rochester A man broke into a funeral parlour to take his mother-in-law's corpse as he feared he would not get it back in time for the service, it has emerged. The man raided Rochester's Butterfly Funeral Services,externalhaving heard it was going bust, Kent Messenger reported. He then took the body to Medway Funeral Directors in Strood which has confirmed it dealt with the service instead. Manager Robert Lawrence told BBC Radio Kent: ""It did happen... It was a very difficult situation to deal with."" Mr Lawrence said his office tried to contact Butterfly Funeral Services without success after ""the client came to us for advice"" about a year ago. He added: ""He told us he had been to police and said he was going to break-in and take his mother-in-law's body away and bring her to us. ""We checked with the police and they confirmed everything. Then he told us the morning he was going to do it and arrived at our office with her. ""It was difficult to watch him go off and do it alone, but unfortunately our hands were tied."" Ellie Gowers saw the body being removed People who worked nearby helped shield the body from the public as it was removed from the building and loaded into a van. Eyewitness Ellie Gowers said the man ""seemed very traumatised, anxious, scared and upset"". ""I went completely white and panicky, because it's not every day you're dealing with someone trying to wheel a dead body out from next door. ""But obviously we were trying to keep him calm as well because he was frantic, saying he was going to smash things. Obviously just trying to get the problem resolved,"" she said. The bereaved man, who wants to remain anonymous, told Kent Messenger he had ""no option"" but ""to get the body out"" after struggling to contact the owner. He said he broke in via a side door of the property in Rochester High Street and then took the corpse to Medway Funeral Directors in a hired van. He said he spent two days at the police station trying to track the owner down, adding that he ""didn't want to bother"" his wife who ""still to this day doesn't know what happened"". Later, bailiffs repossessing the site found about 16 urns of ashes that had not been returned to family members. James Brown, Head of Regulatory Services at Medway Council, said: ""We have been contacted by a funeral director who will be returning a number of urns to Medway Crematorium. ""Once we've received them, where we are able we will contact individual families. ""We know how important it is for families to say goodbye to their loved ones and we will do all we can to reunite families with the urns.""

'Sexsomniac' jailed for raping woman,"Karl Gammon admitted having sex with the woman, but claimed he could not remember it and was asleep when it happened A man who claimed he had sex with a woman while he was asleep has been jailed for five years for rape. Karl Gammon had met the victim and her friend at a bar in Loughborough in March 2016 before attacking her. The 24-year-old, of Albert Street in Loughborough, told a trial he suffered from ""sexsomnia"", a form of non-insane automatism that meant he had sex with her without his knowledge or memory. He was found guilty on 8 August after a trial at Leicester Crown Court. East Midlands Live: Latest updates Gammon, who was sentenced on Friday, has also been placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely. Leicestershire Police said DNA evidence proved he had had sex with the woman. Det Sgt Tom Brenton, who led Leicestershire Police's investigation into the case, said the victim was still ""living with the trauma"" of the attack more than two years later. ""Gammon's victim has shown tremendous courage throughout the judicial process,"" he said. ""Not only did Gammon prey on his victim when she was vulnerable, he claimed not to have knowledge of the rape when questioned by officers and as such she was forced to relive her ordeal in court.""

"Hand over homeless man cash, US pair told","Happier times. Mr Bobbitt (bottom left) lived with the couple but is now back on the streets A New Jersey judge has ordered a couple to turn over the money they raised for a homeless man after he helped one of them out in an emergency. The judge gave Kate McClure and her boyfriend Mark D'Amico until Friday afternoon to transfer what remains of more than $400,000 (Â£307,000). It is to be placed in an account controlled by Johnny Bobbitt's lawyers and frozen pending a new court ruling. The couple deny Mr Bobbitt's claim they helped themselves to the money. The Philadelphia man filed a lawsuit for fraud and conspiracy on Tuesday, saying the couple had used the funds as their own ""piggy bank"". Mr Bobbitt's original Good Samaritan deed went viral last year when he gave his last $20 to Ms McClure after her car ran out of petrol. The couple responded by starting an online appeal on GoFundMe, drawing contributions from more than 14,000 donors, but their relationship with Mr Bobbitt eventually soured as they accused him of using the money to feed a drug habit. Who does crowdfunding for a complete stranger? Crowdfunding halted for car-ram suspect GoFundMe is investigating allegations that its service was misused. Superior CourtJudge Paula T Dow ordered the couple to transfer the money into an escrow account,externaland hire a forensic accountant to review financial records within 10 days, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. The court would decide how the money would eventually be managed, she ruled on Thursday. Neither the couple, who are New Jersey residents, nor Mr Bobbitt were in court for the hearing which took place in Mount Holly, close to the state border with Philadelphia. About $150,000, Mr D'Amico told NBC on Monday. Jacqueline Promislo, a lawyer for Mr Bobbitt, told the BBC her client estimates the couple spent about $75,000 on his care. Lawyers for Mr Bobbitt, 35, allege in the lawsuit that the couple used it to ""fund a lifestyle that they could not otherwise afford"". In interviews, Mr Bobbitt said Ms McClure, 28, and Mr D'Amico, 39, had recently paid for trips to Las Vegas and Florida, and a new BMW. Mr D'Amico works as a carpenter and Ms McClure is a receptionist for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, according to local media. The couple had promised their online supporters the money would go to two financial trusts for Mr Bobbitt, as well as a lawyer and a financial adviser to help him manage all the money. They gave him clothing, allowed him to park his new camper outside their home, but reportedly later asked him to leave. Mr Bobbitt alleges that the couple sold his camper, gambled away some of his money and declined to provide him with any financial records. Mr D'Amico told NBC that ""every dollar"" Mr Bobbitt ""ever touched was used for drugs"". The couple's lawyer, Ernest E Badway, told the court on Thursday that the idea his clients were ""the bad guys â¦ is completely not true"". ""They took time out of their own schedules, their own jobs, brought him to rehab centersâ¦ gave him cash on a daily basis,"" he said. ""My clients tried to help [Mr Bobbitt],"" he said. ""It's going to come down to an accounting. It's going to come down to a demonstration of all the money and where the money went."" Towards the end of the hearing, Mr Badway told the judge that meeting the Friday deadline for handing over the money would be difficult. Judge Dow responded: ""The banks are open Friday, most banks are open Saturday. And if the monies aren't in the bank, they can pull their money out of their pillowcases and have them delivered to you, to be handed over and placed in a trust account."" The US Marine veteran is back living on the streets of Philadelphia with his younger brother. He told the Inquirer that begging for change to buy drugs was better than trying to get money from Mr D'Amico and Ms McClure. Feeding the homeless one slice at a time.

Blast 'kills top Ukraine rebel leader',"Alexander Zakharchenko in a 2017 photo A leader of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, Alexander Zakharchenko, has been killed in an explosion at a cafe in Donetsk city. ""The head of the DNR [Donetsk People's Republic]... has died as the result of a terrorist attack,"" Zakharchenko's spokeswoman told AFP news agency. Russia's foreign ministry said it suspected Ukraine of organising the latest killing. The Ukrainian government has denied any involvement. Some observers have attributed previous deaths of rebel leaders in Donetsk to infighting among the rebels, or moves by Moscow to eliminate inconvenient separatist leaders. Rebel and Russian news reports say the separatists' ""finance minister"" Alexander Timofeyev was wounded in the blast at the Separ cafe that killed Zakharchenko. Ukrainians suspected of being behind the blast were arrested nearby, a security source was quoted as saying. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said ""there is every reason to believe that the Kiev regime is behind the murder"". She said the Kiev ""party of war"" was ""violating its pledges about peace and has decided on a bloodbath"". However, recent reports suggested that Zakharchenko had fallen out of favour with Russia. A spokeswoman for Ukraine's state security service, Yelena Gitlyanskaya, rejected Moscow's accusations. She said the killing was a result of ""internal fighting... between the terrorists and their Russian sponsors"". Heavily armed rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk regions refuse to recognise the Ukrainian government in Kiev. The rebels seized large swathes of territory there in an uprising in April 2014. Since then, thousands of people have died in fighting between the rebels and Ukrainian government forces. Moscow denies sending regular troops and heavy weapons to the separatists, but admits that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. The frontline between them and Ukrainian government troops has remained largely static for months, butskirmishes continue despite a fragile ceasefire deal. There has been shooting on the frontline despite a ""back-to-school truce"" that was supposed to take effect on Wednesday. International monitors reported 70 ceasefire violations on that day alone. He played a key role in the Russian-backed separatist military operation from its very beginning. In early 2014, soon after Ukraine's pro-Russian government was toppled by the Maidan revolution, he took part in the seizure of the Donetsk regional administration building by people saying they were protesting against the new pro-Western authorities. Later that year, he was chosen as the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic by its parliament, the ""Supreme Council"". He had been in the role ever since, assuming the title of president, and was among the signatories of the stalled Minsk peace agreement. He was wounded twice in combat, and survived a car bomb blast in August 2014. In October 2016, a Russian-born rebel commander nicknamed""Motorola"" - real name Arsen Pavlov - was killed by a bomb blastin the lift of his apartment block In February 2017 rebel commanderGivi (real name Mikhail Tolstykh) was killed by a rocketthat was fired into his office.

"Coca-Cola to buy Costa coffee for ÃÂ£3.9bnThe UK's biggest coffee chain is being sold by owner Whitbread, which also owns Premier Inns.BusinessComments","This video can not be played Whitbread boss Alison Brittain tells Today the deal would boost Costa's global expansion Coca-Cola is to buy the Costa coffee chain from owner Whitbread in a deal worth Â£3.9bn. Whitbread had intended to spin off the chain as a separate firm, but said a straight sale was more profitable. Chief executive Alison Brittain said Whitbread would now focus on its Premier Inn business in the UK and Germany. Whitbread bought Costa, which is now the UK's biggest coffee chain, for just Â£19m in 1995. At the time, it had just 39 outlets. It now has more than 2,400 UK coffee shops, as well as some 1,400 outlets in 31 overseas markets. Costa Express has 8,237 vending machines worldwide. Whitbread shares were up 16% in Friday afternoon trading. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Ms Brittain explained that Coca-Cola wanted to buy Costa because ""they want the coffee product, they have no coffee in their range"". She said the money from the sale would be used to expand the Premier Inn chain, return some cash to shareholders, pay down debt and boost the pension fund. Describing the sale as a ""win-win"" for everyone, she said the price paid by Coca-Cola was far higher than if Costa had been demerged into a stand-alone company on the stock market. She said she thought the beverage giant would use Costa to create ""ready to drink, cold brew coffees"". ""You could see Costa absolutely everywhere, in vending machines, hotels, restaurants, pubs, cafes - in all the places you see Coke today,"" she added. Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors on a conference call that Costa was ""a winning company that can go global"". He acknowledged that retail sales were a new area for Coca-Cola, but said Costa already had ""a strong management team"" and that Coca-Cola intended to ""make it attractive for them to stay"". Whitbread announced earlier this year thatit was planning to spin off Costa. Whitbread had been under pressure to consider a break-up of the business after hedge fund Elliott Advisors became the company's largest shareholder. Elliott reportedly put forward a demerger plan after building up a 6% stake in the firm. As well as being the largest UK coffee chain, Costa is also the world's second largest. It is looking to triple its presence in China, where it is second to Starbucks. According to consumer analysts Kantar Worldpanel, the out-of-home coffee market is worth Â£6.3bn a year in the UK alone. Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most? 1742 - Samuel Whitbread forms partnership with Godfrey and Thomas Shewell 1750 - Whitbread creates UK's first mass-production brewery in London 1868 - Begins producing beer in bottles 1968 - Starts brewing Heineken under licence 1974 - Opens first Beefeater steakhouse 1990s - Buys David Lloyd Leisure, Marriott Hotels, TGI Fridays, Pizza Hut, Premier Lodge 1995 -  Buys Costa Coffee from Sergio and Bruno Costa for Â£19m when it had 39 outlets 2000 - Sells brewing business to focus on Premier Inn and Costa Whitbread also owns restaurants Beefeater and Brewers Fayre. Over the years, it has owned well-known brands such as TGI Fridays, Pizza Hut and Marriott Hotels. The deal is subject to the agreement of Whitbread's shareholders and various other approvals, including from anti-trust regulators. It is expected to complete in the first half of next year. For years, demerger was a dirty word at Whitbread. When asked, as they often were, about the logic of having a hotel chain and a coffee chain in the same company, executives would extol the benefits of having two leisure brands under one roof. Shareholders were always less convinced, but were happy to go along with the idea while Whitbread grew its revenue, profits and share price at a steady clip over the last decade. All that changed with the arrival of Alison Brittain as chief executive - and the appearance on the shareholder register of Elliott Management, an aggressive, deep-pocketed US hedge fund with a track record of shaking up big companies. It pushed hard for a demerger, and Ms Brittain, who judged that Costa and Premier had reached sufficient scale to stand on their own feet, opened the door. The plan was that Costa would be spun off at some time in the next two years, but Coca-Cola pre-empted that with a knockout offer. While this is a landmark deal for Whitbread, it is also a significant move for Coca-Cola, taking it into hot beverages for the first time and, it hopes, providing the growth for which its investors have been crying out. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, described the deal as ""a bitter-sweet moment for Whitbread investors"". ""On the one hand, Â£3.9bn is an undeniably rich valuation and likely far better than Costa could achieve as an independently listed company, valuing its earnings higher than those of the mighty Starbucks,"" he said. ""On the other, Costa has long been the jewel in Whitbread's crown and some will be sad to see it go at any price, especially given the growth potential in China and elsewhere.""

Roxanne said the incident made her feel ""uncomfortable"" Ofcom said it had received 11,215 complaints about the episode, adding: ""We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate."" Both Roxanne and Ryan are currently housemates in the latest series of the Channel 5 reality TV show. Pallett made her name as Jo Sugden in ITV soap Emmerdale while Ryan found fame playing Jason Grimshaw in Coronation Street from 2000 to 2016.

The actress made her name playing Jo Sugden in ITV soap Emmerdale After returning to the bedroom, the Emmerdale star added: ""Just been beaten up by Corrie's Jason Grimshaw. Big Brother that hurt."" Roxanne then entered the house's diary room where she demanded to speak to producers. ""Something that's just happened made me feel really uncomfortable,"" she said. ""I'm in shock, I went from upset to angry. A boy has punched me repeatedly, unprovoked and deliberately punched me. Like a boxer punches a bag."" CBB: 1,000 complaints over use of N-word Celebrity Big Brother responds to Stormy Daniels no-show Rodrigo Alves removed from the Big Brother house A producer of the show told her they took the incident very seriously and would be reviewing the footage.

Ryan Thomas starred in Coronation Street for 16 years Big Brother bosses then called Ryan to the diary room where they pointed out that while ""almost play fighting"" he ""punched Roxanne in the ribs"". He was reminded of the show's rules and given a formal warning for his behaviour. ""We both know and Roxanne knows there was no malice, hurt or anger in anything I did during this time. I am sorry and I understand,"" he said. The incident sparked a big debate on social media. Some argued Ryan was being playful and Roxanne was overreacting. Allow Twitter content?

While many people will already now about Aretha's lifelong commitment to the US civil rights movement, another cause close to her heart has just been revealed. Retired Detroit judge Greg Mathis has been speaking about the late soul star's support in the fight for justice over the Flint water pipes scandal. In 2014, the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the cheaper Flint River, which resulted in 100,000 of residents drinking water contaminated with lead. Mathis - who noted that his comments might not please one of the service's earlier speakers, underfire Michigan Governor Rick Snyder - said that when he was feeling defeated about the ongoing struggle, Aretha told him: ""You're supposed to be from Detroit - what are you scared of?"" Bottled drinking water for residents of Flint Mathis's mic then briefly cut out, causing him to joke ""somebody's going to jail!.."" He went on to add: ""Her last words were taken from the greatest song she's performed and somehow it made me feel like she respected me. ""'You go back up there and sock it to them ""So that's what I'm going to do - I'm going to sock it to them, sock it to them, sock it to them... ""In honour of my sister Aretha.""

Watch above Stevie is due to pay a musical tribute to Aretha later in the service. A third former US President has paid his tribute now, describing Aretha as ""the voice of a generaiton, maybe the voice of a century."" Bill Clinton confessed that before he and wife Hillary made their moves into politics, as college sweethearts they were pretty much professional Aretha fans. ""We started out not as the President and First Lady, a senator, a secretary of state. ""We started out like Aretha groupies or something. You
know, she was only about four years older than me, five years older than Hilary
â so when we were getting out of college was when she finally got her big break."" He added: ""She had the voice of a generation, maybe the voice of a century. ""She lived with courage. Not without fear but overcoming her fears. ""She lived with faith. Not without failure but overcoming her failures... ""I just love her."" Allow YouTube content?

While many people will already now about Aretha's lifelong commitment to the US civil rights movement, another cause close to her heart has just been revealed. Retired Detroit judge Greg Mathis has been speaking about the late soul star's support in the fight for justice over the Flint water pipes scandal. In 2014, the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the cheaper Flint River, which resulted in 100,000 of residents drinking water contaminated with lead. Mathis - who noted that his comments might not please one of the service's earlier speakers, underfire Michigan Governor Rick Snyder - said that when he was feeling defeated about the ongoing struggle, Aretha told him: ""You're supposed to be from Detroit - what are you scared of?"" Bottled drinking water for residents of Flint Mathis's mic then briefly cut out, causing him to joke ""somebody's going to jail!.."" He went on to add: ""Her last words were taken from the greatest song she's performed and somehow it made me feel like she respected me. ""'You go back up there and sock it to them ""So that's what I'm going to do - I'm going to sock it to them, sock it to them, sock it to them... ""In honour of my sister Aretha.""

""She wasn't able to speak back but her family felt that she could hear me so I said all things things that I've always said. Watch above Stevie is due to pay a musical tribute to Aretha later in the service. A third former US President has paid his tribute now, describing Aretha as ""the voice of a generaiton, maybe the voice of a century."" Bill Clinton confessed that before he and wife Hillary made their moves into politics, as college sweethearts they were pretty much professional Aretha fans. ""We started out not as the President and First Lady, a senator, a secretary of state. ""We started out like Aretha groupies or something. You
know, she was only about four years older than me, five years older than Hilary

Homebase rescue plan voted through,"Homebase creditors have voted in favour of a rescue plan that will result in 42 stores closing. The chief executive of Homebase said the company voluntary arrangement (CVA) would help turn the business around and return it to profitability. Some landlords had planned to vote against the CVA, complaining that it treated them unfairly. Hilco Capital, which bought the retailer for Â£1 in June, plans to invest Â£25m to revive the DIY chain. ""We now have the platform to turn the business around and return to profitability,"" said Homebase chief executive Damian McGloughlin. ""We can look to the future with great confidence, and we will be working closely with our suppliers to capitalise on the opportunities we see in the home improvement market in the UK and Ireland."" Is your Homebase store closing? DIY disaster ends as Homebase sold for Â£1 This year 16 stores have been shut with another 42 earmarked for closure by early 2019, putting 1,500 jobs at risk. The professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal will carry out the CVA. The rescue deal for Homebase follows a turbulent few years. Australia's Wesfarmers bought the retailer for Â£340m in 2016 and rebranded the chain as Bunnings. It made a series of blunders, including underestimating winter demand for items such as heaters and dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges, sending sales sliding. Wesfarmers took a Â£770m loss after selling Homebase. The new owners of the chain, which has about 250 stores and 11,500 staff, now plans to bring back popular brands and concessions such as Laura Ashley and Habitat. Hilco has revived the fortunes of other retailers and is best known for rescuing music chain HMV from administration in 2013. However, the restructuring specialist also tried to rescue Allders and Allied Carpets, both of which later went into administration. Mark Williams, president of the retail and property organisation Revo, is concerned about the impact that the rescue plan will have on landlords. ""The fact that Homebase is able to proceed with this CVA despite either opposition or a genuine feeling of uncomfortableness from the creditor group most impacted underlines that this legislation is completely broken,"" he said. ""The current process forces property owners, many of which are pension funds investing our money for retirement, to pay for the mistakes of the business owners, and the Government's failure to reform the business rates system."" He added that legal challenges are now the only way for creditors to get a fairer deal with it comes to the use of CVAs, since the government doesn't seem to want to intervene.

Nolan regrets 'ugly' Loose Women row,"Janet Street-Porter attempted to mediate between Coleen Nolan (left) and Kim Woodburn Coleen Nolan has said her on-screen row with Kim Woodburn was ""ugly, upsetting and unpleasant"", and she wishes she could turn back time and undo it. More than 7,000 people have complained to Ofcom about Wednesday's Loose Women, which saw the singer clash with the former How Clean Is Your House? host. Some viewers accused Nolan and the ITV show's other panellists of bullying. Nolan said: ""Anyone that knows me knows I'm not a bully. That would be the most hurtful thing people could call me."" Media regulator Ofcom said it had received 7,015 complaints by 16.00 BST on Friday. The row stems from a public fallout the pair had when they appeared on Celebrity Big Brother last year. The Loose Women appearance was intended as a chance for reconciliation, but ended with Woodburn walking off in tears. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Watchdog sues ticket reseller Viagogo,"Music fans enjoy last weekend's Reading festival Ticket reseller Viagogo is being taken to court by the competition watchdog over concerns it is breaking consumer protection law. The Competition and Markets Authority took action against the big four secondary ticket sites last November. StubHub, Get Me In and Seatwave promised to change their business model but Viagogo has failed to make changes required by the CMA. That failure has resulted in the High Court legal action announced on Friday. Andrea Coscelli, CMA chief executive, said consumers who look for tickets on resellers must be told what seat they will get and whether they risk being denied entry to a venue. ""This applies to Viagogo as much as it does to any other secondary ticketing website. Unfortunately, while other businesses have agreed to overhaul their sites to ensure they respect the law, Viagogo has not,"" he said. ""We will now be pursuing action through the courts to ensure that they comply with the law."" Ticketmaster to close Seatwave and Get Me In Don't buy tickets from Viagogo, minister warns How Ed Sheeran is taking on ticket touts The woman taking on Viagogo The CMA is also seeking an interim enforcement order from the court that would put a stop to some of Viagogo's practices until a full trial takes place. Sharon Hodgson, the MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on ticket abuse, said the CMA's legal action against Viagogo was long overdue. ""For too long fans have been exposed to the risk of ending up with a ticket that did not get them into an event when buying through Viagogo. ""Perhaps Viagogo will now realise that consumer protection legislation passed by Parliament is not a minor inconvenience to be ignored and that they can be held accountable through the courts."" Adam Webb, campaign manager of the FanFair Alliance, said it welcomed the move to tackle Viagogo: ""Hopefully it spells the endgame to this site's misleading and abhorrent practices."" The Alliance said Viagogo could be legally prevented from reselling tickets in the UK because it had an office in Fenchurch Street, in the City of London. In May, digital industries minister Margot James told fans""don't choose Viagogo - they are the worst"". The Arctic Monkeys' manager has called for Viagogo to be shut down The CMA's year-long investigation found some ticket resellers could be breaking the law by failing to tell consumers about restrictions on the tickets they bought. Many in the music industry have criticised resellers. In April the manager of the Arctic Monkeys, Ian McAndrew,called on the government to shut down Viagogoafter tickets for the band's upcoming UK tour appeared on the site for as much as Â£2,200. Viagogo is run by American Eric Baker, who founded StubHub with university classmate Jeff Fluhr. They sold the company to eBay in 2007 for $304m. Mr Baker then moved to London to set up Viagogo, which is owned by his Delaware-based venture called Pugnacious Endeavors. Earlier this month Ticketmaster said it willclose down Seatwave and Get Me In in October. Buyers will then be allowed to put unwanted tickets up for sale directly on Ticketmaster's site. The firm has vowed to be transparent about the difference between ""new"" and resold tickets. Viagogo did not respond to a request for comment.

'Paedophile hunter' guilty of false claimVandals 'attack a man's house' after he is wrongly accused by an online anti-paedophile campaigner.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"Stephen Dure, also known as Stevie Trap, featured in a regional edition of a BBC Inside Out programme in 2017 A self-styled ""paedophile hunter"", whose videos have been watched millions of times by Facebook users, has been convicted of falsely accusing a man of grooming teenagers. Stephen Dure, 34, also known as Stevie Trap, pleaded guilty to making an improper communication online. His wrongly-accused victim said he had been sacked and his home had been attacked as a result. Mr Dure, from Southampton, will be sentenced on Monday. The defendant appeared in a BBC Inside Out programme in 2017, when he explained how he posed as children on the internet to ""trap"" sex offenders. His Facebook page, which shows videos of him confronting suspected paedophiles, has more than 200,000 followers. Southampton Magistrates' Court heard he had accused Paul Farhad, 42, of being a ""violent psychopath"" and a ""massive danger to society"" in a Facebook post in November 2017. Mr Farhad, from Eastleigh, said 111,000 people had viewed the message, which he said also implied he was a paedophile. Paul Farhad was falsely accused in a Facebook post of grooming teenagers As a result he lost his job, paint was sprayed on his door and a brick was thrown through his window, he told the court. Alfred Underwood, defending, said Mr Dure accepted that Mr Farhad was not a paedophile, which was ""nowhere suggested"" in the Facebook message read out in court. The victim then produced a screenshot of the post on his mobile phone. It showed the words ""grooming teenagers"" had been deleted from the original published message at some stage. Mr Dure then changed his plea to guilty. Stephen Dure said his online career might be over Judge Lorraine Morgan adjourned sentencing, saying she was imposing conditions on Mr Dure's bail ""in the light of your lack of frankness"". She ordered the defendant to wear an electronic tag, to observe a curfew and not to use social media. Outside court, Mr Dure said his online career might be over but his team would continue his work.

Man guilty of plotting to kill PM,"A college drop-out who sought revenge for his uncle's death in Syria has been convicted of preparing to attack Downing Street and kill the PM. Naa'imur Rahman, 20, was convicted at the Old Bailey after he was trapped in a major undercover operation involving the FBI, MI5 and police. Rahman approached officers posing online as fellow extremists, asking them for help with an attack. He met two and repeatedly asked for bombs - leading to his conviction. He has now been jailed for aminimum of 30 years. Last summer Rahman was homeless in London after falling out with both his mother in the city and close relatives in Walsall, where he grew up. Walsall to Syria: Fighters, travellers and victims? Three years ago he was referred to the national deradicalisation scheme, Channel, amid concerns that the-then teenager could be brainwashed by his uncle. When he was investigated last year over an allegation of sexting with an underage girl, intelligence emerged from his phone that he had maintained contact with his uncle. Rahman's uncle Musadikur Rohaman died in a drone strike in Syria Musadikur Rohaman left the UK for Syria in 2014. The Old Bailey trial heard that he'd been encouraging his nephew to attack the UK and had sent him bomb-making plans and other extremist material. However, in late June 2017, Rohaman was killed in a coalition drone strike on IS fighters near the city of Raqqa. When Rahman learnt of his uncle's death, prosecutors told the trial that he planned his revenge. Rahman made contact with IS recruiters via social media - but unbeknown to him the contact was actually an FBI agent. That agent referred Rahman to an MI5 team of online role players who convinced him that they were genuine IS figures. ""I want to do a suicide bomb on Parliament,"" Rahman told the MI5 role players. ""I want to attempt to kill Theresa May. All I need now is a sleeper cell to lay low for now."" Despite his total lack of skills or training, MI5 was concerned that Rahman would press ahead, so counter-terrorism chiefs launched an elaborate undercover operation to gather evidence of his intent. As Rahman kept asking for help, the MI5 team introduced him to an undercover police officer in London posing as an Islamic State weapons fixer. The jury watched secretly recorded video of Rahman meeting ""Shaq"" in a car and setting out his aspirations. He told the story of his uncle's killing - and asked for a truck bomb and firearms  - before conceding he could neither drive nor fire a gun. Rahman then settled for storming Downing Street in an attempt to kill Theresa May. On 6 November last year, Rahman laid out his final plan to ""Shaq"" - a recording of it was played in court. ""I have drawn up a plan, gone through it in detail in my head. You know at the gate of Downing Street? There are about four men innit? And two men on the door? ""I want to get past that gate and if I can get to the door I want to make a dash for Theresa May. She sleeps there every night."" Undercover officers gave Rahman a fake bomb Shaq asked Rahman to elaborate on how he thought this was possible. ""If I have a backpack with stuff inside and I do that at the gate and I get past the gate... a 10-second sprint to the door."" ""I'll be honest with you,"" replied Shaq. ""I've never looked at it."" ""I wanna drop a bag at the gate, so the gate blows up a bit and I can go through and then like, make a run, like I was thinking taking a human hostage until I get to the actual door. ""Grab a human shield and then once I get close enough to the door, I'll do what I can with them to get inside."" ""You're trying to get to Number 10,"" asked Shaq. ""That's your main objective?"" ""Take her head off, yeah,"" replied Rahman. Rahman said he couldn't fund the attack because he was ""broke and homeless"" - but he handed over a jacket and a rucksack, asking for both to be filled with explosives. The jacket was filled with fake explosives Shaq returned the items with a fake bomb in the bag and the jacket filled with supposed explosives. Rahman took both off him and said: ""Do you know? Now I've seen everything it feels good."" As he walked away from the scene he was surrounded by police, arrested, and later said: ""I'm glad it's over."" Rahman told his trial that none of his plans was serious. When he made contact with men whom he thought were his uncle's comrades in Syria, he had begun showing off, making up schemes to impress them. Prosecutors showed Rahman (circled) had carried out extensive reconnaissance He told jurors that one fantastical proposal had been to build balloons to drop missiles from the edge of space. Rahman claimed he had been set up and tricked by MI5 and the police. But prosecutors showed that Rahman had carried out extensive reconnaissance of Downing Street, Parliament and nearby government buildings. The jury had to be convinced that Rahman had seriously intended to attack Downing Street and had taken the first steps along that course. In sentencing, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: ""I am sure that at all material times Rahman believed the devices to be real and capable of causing serious harm.""

'A vignette of life in the past',"This video can not be played Bison bones and Tudor bowling balls: Crossrail's archaeological legacy The skeletons of plague victims, a Tudor bowling ball and medieval ice skates fashioned from animal bones are among hundreds of artefacts on display at a new exhibition showcasing the most interesting finds made during the Crossrail excavations. What's been unearthed undoubtedly offers a fascinating insight into London life over the centuries - but what will be the archaeological legacy of what is Europe's largest infrastructure project? Tens of thousands of artefacts have been dug up during work to create the 42km (26-mile)Elizabeth Line,external, which runs from the east to the west of the capital. With careful planning, 20 sites were excavated by archaeologists at locations where ventilation shafts were put in, where railways entered tunnels and where new ticket halls were to be built. For more archaeology stories and features follow us on Pinterest,external ""We've managed to take a slice down through London but also across London,"" said Jackie Keily, the curator of the exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands. One of Ms Keily's favourite exhibits is a bowling ball discovered at the site of a Tudor manor house in Stepney Green. ""It's amazing it survived,"" she said. This Tudor bowling ball was found preserved in the boggy moat of a manor in Stepney Green These objects, found near Liverpool Street station, have been identified as ice skates with the help of the writings of a 12th Century monk, who described young men skating on bones tied to their shoes ""It had been in a moat which was boggy. Henry VIII brought in a ban banning commoners from bowling. It was only for the aristocracy. ""Stepney Green is now part of Greater London but it would have been a weekend retreat in the countryside."" A chamber pot found beneath 19th Century terraced housing, also in Stepney Green, ranks as another highlight for Ms Keily. ""It dates back to when there were no indoor toilets or bathrooms,"" she said. ""This one is fabulous because it has a shocked-looking man saying: 'What I see I will not tell'."" This chamber pot gives an insight into modesty in Victorian times The discoveries made were by no means restricted to those from Victorian, Tudor or medieval times though, with considerably older items being unearthed, including bison bone fragments in the part of the capital we now call Royal Oak. Asked if there had been previous evidence of bison roaming there, Ms Keily said: ""We kind of knew but it's incredible to find the remains. ""There were three fragments of bison bone and one of reindeer from an antler. They were dated back to about 68,000 years ago. ""Some of the bones had traces of gnawing, possibly from wolves."" Scientific analysis of skeletons identified the DNA of the bacteria that caused the 1665 Great Plague Two finds from the Crossrail project have ended up among the 80 million specimens at the Natural History Museum: a piece of 55-million-year-old amber and two parts of a woolly mammoth jawbone. Both were discovered beneath Canary Wharf. The bone find could prove to be important, as Jessica Simpson from the museum explains: ""They can date the woolly mammoth specimen once it is off display and they might be able to determine when they became extinct in our region. ""The last known woolly mammoths were roaming a small part of northern Siberia about 4,000 years ago."" For Ms Keily, the discovery that will perhaps provide the most significant element of Crossrail's archaeological legacy is the human remains found at Liverpool Street. DNA testing on teeth found in the 17th Century Bedlam cemeteryconfirmed the identity of the bacteriabehind London's Great Plague for the first time. ""That's an important discovery,"" she said. And it's not the only one. Don Walker, senior human osteologist at the Museum of London Archaeology, analysed some skeletons found at Charterhouse Square in Farringdon. This leather shoe is believed to date from the 15th or 16th Century He said of the discovery: ""It was important because we found documented evidence of a Black Death cemetery dating to 1348 or 1349."" Isotope, radiocarbon and DNA analysis was performed in an effort to reveal details such as how a person's diet had changed during their lifetime and where they were likely to have lived. Mr Walker said: ""We don't know much about how infectious diseases interacted with people in the past. ""If we can understand the evolution of infectious diseases such as the plague that will help us understand how diseases will behave in the future."" Asked what the impact of the Crossrail excavations would be, he said: ""I think it goes beyond archaeology and I'm certain there will be some benefits for future medical work as well."" Curator Jackie Keily: ""We've managed to take a slice down through London"" Dr Piers Mitchell from Cambridge University is president of the Paleopathology Association and was part of the team that foundRichard III's skullin a Leicester car park. Asked if Crossrail would go on to be viewed as a significant project in British archaeology, he said: ""The problem with Crossrail is you only get a little vertical shaft, a little box to excavate. ""That gives you a little vignette of life in the past. It's a little bit frustrating. ""They've got lots of little circles and they are trying to interpret London from that."" But he added: ""Only time will tell. If interesting papers are published and we learn more about diseases of the past and how they are changing, it's going to be a good resource to teach students with."" Some of the finds as they were reported Rail projects find 'Black Death' pit Crossrail dig unearths Victorian jars Rail dig 'Bronze Age path' find Cause of London Great Plague confirmed In Pictures: Crossrail skeletons Jay Carver, lead Crossrail archaeologist, believes the project will be held up as an example of how developers, engineers and archaeologists can work together and share finds with the community. He said: ""Every 10 years there's a mega-project that involves a lot of archaeology; previously there was the Eurostar tunnel and then Terminal 5 at Heathrow. ""With each project we are developing the way we work with construction and engineering. In the past archaeologists and engineers have been at loggerheads. ""I think it's been a really successful project."" And it's a project that is set to continue, with plans in place forCrossrail 2,external, the proposed north-south line from Epsom in Surrey to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire. Curzon Soho cinema campaigner Stephen Fry has said he is not being a ""numby"" - not under my backyard - but objects to plans to tear down the building But wherever there are huge infrastructure projects of this kind, there are difficult decisions to be taken, such as the possibility theCurzon cinema in Soho might have to make way,externalfor a new ticket hall. Stephen Fry has said he does not want to be a ""numby"" - not under my backyard - but, as a supporter of the Curzon Soho, objects to the plans as they stand. And the Victorian Society warns Wimbledon is among the areas thatface losing important architectureto Crossrail 2's bulldozers - although a Transport for London spokesperson said: ""Demolition is always our last resort."" Back in east London at the Museum of London Docklands - a stone's throw away from where engineers are putting the finishing touches to the Canary Wharf Crossrail station - Jackie Keily reflects happily on the impact of the several years of excavations. ""It's been an amazing project,"" she said. ""To be able to archaeologically take a slice through London east to west is pretty amazing.""

Frank Field may trigger by-election,"This video can not be played Frank Field says Labour should be a 'champion against racism' Veteran MP Frank Field has said he is considering triggering a by-election in his Birkenhead constituency. He resigned the Labour whip over the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism allegations and what he calls ""bullying and intimidation"" in local parties. He says he wants to remain a party member and sit as an ""independent Labour"" MP - Labour says resigning the whip means quitting the party. His critics say he quit because he was facing deselection by local members. Analysis: Field is not leading a Labour breakaway Profile: Who is Frank Field? A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims He recently lost a vote of confidence organised by members angry at his support for the government in Brexit votes. The leader of Wirral Council, Labour's Phil Davies, is demanding Labour investigate allegations of bullying in the local party. He claimed Wirral Labour had been taken over by ""a small group of hard line extremists that are pursuing a narrow ideological agenda and are using tactics like bullying and intimidation to further that agenda."" Mr Field, who has represented his Merseyside seat since 1979 and won in 2017 with a majority of 25,514, has faced previous efforts to de-select him. He denied he had ""jumped before he was pushed"" and said he intended to fight the next general election as an independent Labour candidate. Hetold The Guardian,externalhe had been given two weeks to withdraw his resignation or be kicked out of the party at a meeting with Chief Whip Nick Brown. But Labour sources said this was not the case - and the rules of the party were that if he resigned as a Labour MP, he also resigned his membership of the Labour party at the same time. Mr Field told BBC Breakfast he would spend the ""next few days"" deciding whether to stand down as an MP to trigger a by-election, in which he would stand against an official Labour candidate. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Frank Field's decision to resign the Labour whip once again exposes the divisions at the heart of the Labour Party. Contrast the reaction of Jeremy Corbyn with his deputy Tom Watson. In a 12-word, one-sentence reaction, Mr Corbyn did not devote a single syllable to expressing regret at Mr Field's departure. Mr Watson described Mr Field's announcement as a ""serious loss"" which reflected ""deep divisions,"" a ""sense of drift"" and should act as a ""major wake-up call."" And now Frank Field is entertaining the idea of a by-election. Imagine that: the man who has represented Birkenhead for nearly 40 years, versus the Labour Party. Labour's divisions would be crystallised in one contest, visible to everyone, not just on Merseyside, but much further afield as well. Mr Fieldquit the party's parliamentary group through a letter to chief whip Nick Brown on Thursday, saying the leadership was becoming ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". A Labour Party spokesman has thanked Mr Field for his service to Labour, but the veteran MP told the BBC he had been thanked ""as if I was resigning from a whist club"". The MP also blamed a ""culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation"" in local Labour parties telling the BBC:  ""I do think that it's sad how the party following his election has really been taken over by the hard left. ""The campaign that Jewish people feel against them by factions of the Labour Party is all part of the intolerance which we also see at a local level."" He said he wanted to remain a Labour Party member and it was ""simply crazy"" to suggest his decision was ""part of a plot"". A Labour source said ""Frank has been looking for an excuse to resign for some time"". By BBC North West Political Editor Kevin Fitzpatrick It seems there is an increasingly toxic atmosphere in a number of Labour constituencies on Merseyside. Like Frank Field, Angela Eagle, in Wallasey, and Louise Ellman, in Liverpool Riverside, have claimed they've faced bullying and intimidation at their own meetings, predominantly from new members who've recently joined. For Mr Field, anger over his support for the government in key Brexit votes in July resulted in a no-confidence vote in his local party which he is thought to have lost by 30 votes to 18. This has no official force within the party and Mr Field's supporters say he remains popular with many members locally but they no longer turn up to party meetings, which, they claim, have been taken over by far left opponents of the MP. Before the next general election, whenever that may be, Mr Field would no doubt have a major fight on his hands to get re-selected. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson described the resignation of Mr Field as a ""serious loss to the party"" and a ""major wake up call"". Labour backbencher John Mann - who also backed the government in Brexit votes and has been a fierce critic of the leadership's stance on anti-Semitism - said he would remain in the party to ""fight to the last"" but added: ""If this isn't sorted, I predict others will go"". And, he added, the Labour leader should announce that all Jewish Labour MPs would be automatically re-selected to fight the next general election ""to take this harassment of them off the agenda"". However backbench MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Newsnight: ""He (Mr Field) has obviously lost the confidence of his members and he's now getting his excuses in, it seems to me, and throwing around grotesque slurs, which have no basis in reality. This video can not be played Birkenhead voters react to local MP Frank Field's decision to resign the Labour whip ""The party has taken the issue of anti-Semitism very seriously; far more seriously than any other political party. ""It's so sad to see someone like Frank Field trashing Labour's anti-racist record"". Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. A 2016 inquiry concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Recently, the focus has been on a new code of conduct the party has adopted on anti-Semitism, with critics concerned that it does not go as far as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines. Next Tuesday, Labour's ruling National Executive Committeeis expected to decide whether to adopt the IHRA guidelines in full, with the Parliamentary Labour Party due to be balloted on adopting the complete IHRA document, the day after. Another Labour MP, Mike Gapes,told the Evening Standard,externalhe was ""agonising every day about the situation and the state of the Labour Party"" and was waiting to see what the outcome of the NEC meeting was. ""I will make my own decision about how I deal with this in my own time,"" he told the newspaper. Earlier this month, Mr Corbyn again apologised for hurt caused to Jewish people by anti-Semitism in his party and admitted Labour had been too slow in dealing with disciplinary cases.

CBB's Ryan warned for 'punching' Roxanne,"More than 11,000 complaints have been made to media watchdog Ofcom about the Celebrity Big Brother ""punching"" episode. In Thursday's episode, Ryan Thomas was given a warning for ""punching"" fellow housemate Roxanne Pallett. The former Corrie star said there was ""no anger or malice"" in what happened after Roxanne complained to the show's producers about his behaviour. Big Brother bosses issued him with a formal warning for physical contact. Some viewers have uploadedfootage of the incident,externalto YouTube, arguing that Thomas was play-fighting. Roxanne said the incident made her feel ""uncomfortable"" Ofcom said it had received 11,215 complaints about the episode, adding: ""We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate."" Both Roxanne and Ryan are currently housemates in the latest series of the Channel 5 reality TV show. Pallett made her name as Jo Sugden in ITV soap Emmerdale while Ryan found fame playing Jason Grimshaw in Coronation Street from 2000 to 2016. During last night's show Ryan was seen approaching Roxanne in the kitchen before appearing to use his fist to make contact with her body. She said: ""Ouch that hurt, I was going to wash your clothes but I might shrink them now."" The actress made her name playing Jo Sugden in ITV soap Emmerdale After returning to the bedroom, the Emmerdale star added: ""Just been beaten up by Corrie's Jason Grimshaw. Big Brother that hurt."" Roxanne then entered the house's diary room where she demanded to speak to producers. ""Something that's just happened made me feel really uncomfortable,"" she said. ""I'm in shock, I went from upset to angry. A boy has punched me repeatedly, unprovoked and deliberately punched me. Like a boxer punches a bag.""

""I am now suffering and I am now having to alter my experience because someone was violent. Now I am going to get nominated for being unsociable,"" she said. Ryan Thomas starred in Coronation Street for 16 years Big Brother bosses then called Ryan to the diary room where they pointed out that while ""almost play fighting"" he ""punched Roxanne in the ribs"". He was reminded of the show's rules and given a formal warning for his behaviour. ""We both know and Roxanne knows there was no malice, hurt or anger in anything I did during this time.

Abusive tweets to MPs 'more than double',"The number of abusive tweets about politicians more than doubled between 2015 and 2017, according to analysis of more than one million tweets. Twitter insults targeting politicians rose from about 10,000 during the 2015 general election to just under 25,000 in the snap election two years later. The best-known politicians got a lot of tweets and abuse - but less well-known MPs got proportionally more abuse. Sheffield University's computer science department carried out the research. Project leader Kalina Bontcheva said the increase in abuse towards public figures was ""shocking"". The study,externalsuggests both the volume and proportion of Twitter abuse increased between the two elections. MPs 'advised to quit Twitter' Female politicians speak out over Twitter abuse MPs speak out on 'sinister' election abuse The research showed abusive tweets made up: 6.6% of Boris Johnson's Twitter timeline in 2015 - and 9.3% in 2017 4.6% of Jeremy Hunt's timeline in 2015, rising to 8.6% 2.5% of Diane Abbott's timeline in 2015, rising to 3.4% Abusive tweets to Ed Miliband dropped from 5.6% when he was Labour leader in 2015 to 3.3% when he returned to the back benches. Nearly 600 of the UK's 650 MPs have a Twitter account, which they use to promote their work in their constituencies, show their support for local causes and engage in debate. But MPs have been warning for several years that the level of abuse they receive has got out of control, with female MPs in particular being targeted, and threats of violence becoming common. In July, the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said colleagues were being advised to ""close down"" their accounts by Parliament's Health and Wellbeing Service. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott has spoken about the offensive sexist and racist messages and ""mindless abuse"" she and her staff had to endure every day on social media, not just at election time. Labour's Paula Sheriff has said the 2017 election had been the ""most brutal"" to date. On Thursday, Labour MP Stephen Doughty tweeted an example of a post by Facebook user Philip Price which used offensive language and described him as 'fat' and 'murderous' - and Facebook's response that it did not violate its policies. He said: ""If you wonder why Facebook, Twitter etc are increasingly becoming difficult places, here's another example of abuse we get and the response of the social media companies - who think we deserve a different threshold of abuse 'to allow discourse'."" Responding to the research, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said: ""It is vital that we prevent the rising intimidation of people in public office and those who want to stand for election. ""That is why this government is consulting on new measures that will protect candidates and campaigners standing for public service. We can't let intimidation of people in public life continue unchecked."" Last yeara report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life,externalsaid an ""intensely hostile online environment"" had been created and warned people would be put off from entering politics because of the abuse. Update 3 September 2018: This article has been updated to clarify that the example cited by Labour MP Stephen Doughty related to Facebook rather than Twitter.

Mother and baby deaths review widenedShrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust says it reviewed 40 cases and has contacted 12 families.Shropshire,"This video can not be played Jack Burn died hours after being born at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford An independent review into a series of baby deaths at a hospital is to be expanded after more families came forward with concerns about their care. In 2017 Jeremy Hunt ordered an investigation into maternity care relating to 23 cases at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust (SaTH). This has increased to more than 40, but the trust said these were cases already in the public domain. The trust said it had worked ""openly"" with the investigation. Midlands Live: Man questioned over mum and daughter murders; Tanker crash shuts M6 lanes Senior midwife Donna Ockenden was appointed last year to review 23 cases - including baby deaths, maternal deaths and brain injuries - of alleged poor maternity care at the trust. A spokesperson for NHS Improvement said it had to agreed ""to consider additional historical investigations that have been highlighted since our independent review was announced in April 2017, where women, infants and new-born babies had died or suffered harm in the maternity services provided by Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust"". ""This includes the cases that the trust had considered as part of its legacy review, as well as the finding of the review it commissioned the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to undertake."" Richard Stanton, 48, whose daughter Kate Stanton-Davies died nine years ago, said: ""It doesn't surprise me, it deeply saddens me."" He welcomed the move to bring all the investigations under the umbrella of the Ockenden review, so there could be ""consistency"" with cases looked at ""with the same eye"". ""In my view, there's serious questions for the leadership, management, governance and policies at this trust, as it's been a systemic failure."" Kate Stanton-Davies, pictured with her mother Rhiannon, was born at Ludlow Community Hospital Hayley Matthews's son Jack Burn was born in March 2015 but died of hypoxia and Group B Strep within hours. She said that throughout her 36 hour-long labour at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford she was refused a caesarean section several times and had a natural birth during which her son's shoulder was trapped. ""It makes you angry, all these parents going through what I went through three years ago. They said changes have been made but at the moment we're failing to see any,"" she added. ""I was just another number on a bed."" Devan and Gavin Cadwallade believe their daughter's death was preventable Devan and Gavin Cadwallade's daughter died at the Princess Royal Hospital last December. Devan had complained to staff that her baby's movements had slowed but she was reassured everything was fine. After three days in hospital she was told her daughter had no heartbeat. ""I was just a number to them, it was just a bed and no-one stopped to think, 'hang on, this isn't normal,'"" said Devan. A post-mortem failed to find a cause of death and the couple believe it was preventable. ""I think in our heads, although it's horrible to say, if something had been wrong with her we could maybe deal with that a little bit more,"" said Gavin. Last summer, the trust invited the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists,externalto carry out a review of its maternity services, which revealed a number of problems, It said in a report that a culture of learning from incidents ""was not apparent"" and the lack of staff - particularly midwives and consultants - ""was a patient safety issue"". While the publication of their report was at the trust's discretion, the process did allow the Royal College to ""refer to a regulator in the public interest any matters they consider require this"". Dr Edward Morris, a vice president for the Royal College, said: ""The Care Quality Commission had already performed a visit and a detailed review into the trust as a whole and the maternity services. ""The safety and quality of the care they delivered was largely reported as good, true in two hospitals there were areas that required improvement. ""Therefore we felt there was no additional need to present our findings as an acute safety concern."" Further review into maternity care Parents' anger at baby deaths NHS trust Cluster of baby deaths probe ordered SaTH said it had reviewed 40 cases, 23 of which had no signs of failure of care and five of which the families could not be contacted. It said it had also written to 12 other families to seek permission for their care to be reviewed as there ""may be potential for further learning"". The trust's chief executive Simon Wright added: ""The death of any baby is a terrible ordeal for any family. We take our responsibilities in reviewing these cases very seriously. ""To suggest that there are more cases which have not been revealed when this is simply untrue is irresponsible and scaremongering."" Powys Community Health Council said the issue would be ""worrying"" for people in the county who used the services. In a statement it said: ""Since concerns were first raised, the Community Health Council has sought assurance from Powys Teaching Health Board that the services they commission for Powys residents are safe."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We take any patient safety concerns extremely seriously - we have asked NHS Improvement to investigate whether further cases at Shrewsbury and Telford should be considered as part of the Ockenden Review, as well as assurance that the trust has taken steps to improve maternity services since these issues came to light in 2016.""

'Summer slowdown' in house prices,"Annual UK house price growth continued to slow over the summer with homes now 2% more expensive than a year ago, the Nationwide has said. The building society said that the annual change had fallen from growth of 2.5% in July to 2% in August. Average property prices had actually fallen by 0.5% in August compared to July, but this is considered to be a much more volatile measure. The average home now costs Â£214,745, the Nationwide said.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: ""Looking further ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. ""Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on house price growth and market activity this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low."" Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: ""British holidaymakers weren't the only ones taking a break in August.

Raab attempts to break Brexit deadlock,"The two negotiators will meet again next week Both sides in Brexit talks say progress is being made but without any breakthrough on the crucial issue of the Irish border. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""stubbornly optimistic"" about getting a deal after talks in Brussels. Unresolved issues include intellectual property, data protection and the role of the European Court of Justice. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he needed detail from the UK on its plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. He told journalists that remaining ""bones of contention"" between the two sides were being steadily eliminated with particular progress on issues of security, judicial and defence co-operation after ""long"" talks on Friday. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles Back May's Brexit plan 'or risk no deal' May sticking by 'sensible' Brexit plans Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Both sides are hoping to agree a divorce deal and a statement on future trading relations at a summit of EU leaders on 17 October, although Mr Raab said that deadline could be missed slightly. He told reporters: ""We're committed to resolving the deal by (the October council) and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach."" Mr Barnier said there was a ""measure of flexibility"" and if the process slipped by a ""few days or weeks"" it would still be possible for the UK to leave the EU with a deal, if approved by the UK and EU Parliaments, on schedule. The EU negotiator said the ""building blocks"" of an agreement were falling into place. He repeated his offer of an ""unprecedented"" future partnership with the UK but insisted this depended on an ""orderly"" withdrawal and settling key outstanding issues. May sticking by 'sensible' Brexit plans Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop He said the question of the Irish border had come down to ""minutiae"" and he needed to see the detail of how the UK proposed to manage cross-border trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event of there being no other solution - the so-called backstop - would work in practice. More information on the Irish border is needed as a ""matter of urgency"", Mr Barnier said ""This backstop is critical,"" he said. ""It is essential to concluding the negotiations. Without a backstop, there will be no agreement."" Mr Raab said he had used Friday's talks to explain in more detail the UK's proposal for its future relationship with the EU, the so-called Chequers plan agreed by Theresa May at her country residence in July. The PM's blueprint, which would see the UK follow EU rules on trade in goods, is unpopular with many Tory MPs, with leading Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson calling for it to be ditched. Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July in protest over the PM's proposals, said he agreed with Mrs May's former aide Nick Timothy, who urged her to ditch the plan. Mr Timothy wrote on Thursday,externalthat she would have to make further concessions to get EU backing for it and this would be unacceptable. Allow Twitter content?

And Stuart Jackson, the former Tory MP who until recently was an aide to Dominic Raab's predecessor David Davis, said the Chequers plan ""has not really got any friends"" on either side. ""For the EU, it's outside their core principles and undermines the integrity of the single market,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""In the UK, people believe it is Brexit in name only."" The two sides say they have agreed 80% of the withdrawal agreement. The remaining 20% includes: Irish border:The principle of a backstop was agreed in December but the detail has not. The UK says physical checks are unnecessary but the EU says the single market must be upheld Governance and implementation:What role will the European Court of Justice have in enforcing the agreement, including on citizen's rights, and what penalties can be applied if either side breaks it? Data:How will the data of EU citizens currently stored in the UK be protected? Geographical indications:How will the UK continue protections for regional products such as French champagne and Spanish manchego cheese? Criminal and judicial matters:How will existing co-operation on cross-border crime and money laundering be maintained and extended? Mr Raab vowed to increase the frequency of talks with Mr Barnier when he took over the job. But Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the outcome of the negotiations, said ""nothing had changed"" since then. ""Dominic Raab may say he is more confident about reaching agreement but he can offer nothing concrete,"" he said. ""He knows the EU27 are not buying the Chequers car crash - a proposal designed around the need to hold a fractured government together and not on the economic interest and well-being of either the UK or the EU.""

"Nolan regrets 'ugly' Loose Women rowThe TV panellist says her on-screen clash with Kim Woodburn was ""ugly, upsetting and unpleasant"".Entertainment & Arts","Janet Street-Porter attempted to mediate between Coleen Nolan (left) and Kim Woodburn Coleen Nolan has said her on-screen row with Kim Woodburn was ""ugly, upsetting and unpleasant"", and she wishes she could turn back time and undo it. More than 7,000 people have complained to Ofcom about Wednesday's Loose Women, which saw the singer clash with the former How Clean Is Your House? host. Some viewers accused Nolan and the ITV show's other panellists of bullying. Nolan said: ""Anyone that knows me knows I'm not a bully. That would be the most hurtful thing people could call me."" Media regulator Ofcom said it had received 7,015 complaints by 16.00 BST on Friday. The row stems from a public fallout the pair had when they appeared on Celebrity Big Brother last year. The Loose Women appearance was intended as a chance for reconciliation, but ended with Woodburn walking off in tears. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"Over-85s in 24-hour care 'set to double'The social care system is ""at breaking point"", a local government official warns.Health","This video can not be played ""I'll be broke if I live to 100"" The number of people aged 85 and over needing 24-hour care is set to double, says a new study, as an expert warns the care system is ""at breaking point"". The study, published in the Lancet Public Health journal, analysed the projected health needs of the elderly in England between 2015 and 2035. It found that the number of 65-year-olds and over needing round-the-clock care is also set to rise by a third. The government says adult social care reforms will be set out in the autumn. Social care shouldn't depend upon your bank balance Cases of cancer in elderly to surge by 2035, report says Tax over-40s for old age care, say MPs The modelling study, carried out by Newcastle University and the London School of Economics and Political Science, highlighted the fact that the fastest growing demographic in the UK is elderly people over 85, whose numbers are projected to more than double by 2035, increasing by 1.5 million. Many of these elderly will develop multiple long-term health conditions, such as dementia and diabetes, leading to increasingly complex care needs. The number of over-85s requiring help throughout the day with tasks such as dressing, bathing and going to the toilet is estimated to almost double to 446,000 by 2035. By the same time, the experts predict that a million over-65s will need similar 24-hour care. Rachel Goble's 86-year-old mother has dementia but lives in her own property. The family pays over Â£3,000 a month for private care. Rachel says she still has to provide a lot of care for her mother, and the situation is having a significant impact on her too. ""NHS care is for three half hour slots, leaving no time to bathe her or prepare meals. ""I do have a good care system in place but I am mindful of the fact these circumstances could change in an instant. ""My mother didn't qualify for some things until she was over 85 because she wasn't physically disabled, and there's too much form filling to see if you do qualify for anything. ""She also doesn't get taken to hospital or GP appointments - something that would be really helpful."" 'Fire-fighting' Rachel says the lack of help is affecting both her and her mother - and she worries about the future. ""I feel utterly alone and helpless.  She is in her own home, as she wishes, but it is her prison. She is lonely and depressed. ""I try and visit as often as I can, but we live 13 miles apart, and I have a job and family of my own. ""I have to manage her household bills, repair things in her home, and block cold calls on the phone and front door. I'm constantly fire-fighting. ""Not only does all of that cost money, but it's affecting my own mental health too."" Prof Carol Jagger, from the Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and senior author of the study, said the number of unpaid carers is in decline. She warned that relying on unpaid family carers was not sustainable and said: ""The challenge is considerable. ""Our study suggests that older spouse carers are increasingly likely to be living with disabilities themselves. ""On top of that, extending the retirement age of the UK population is likely to further reduce the informal carer pool, who have traditionally provided for older family members."" Nick Forbes, senior vice-chair of the Local Government Association, warned that more investment was needed to avoid a crisis. ""Adult social care services face a Â£3.5bn funding gap by 2025, just to maintain existing standards of care,"" he said. ""The system is at breaking point, ramping up pressures on unpaid carers. ""There is an urgent need to plug the immediate funding gap and find a long-term solution to how we pay for adult social care."" The study also noted that there were increasing numbers of adults aged over 65 living independently, with a rise of 60% forecast by 2035. However, as they got older men were more likely to remain independent, whereas women will spend almost half of their remaining life with low dependency needs and more years needing intensive 24-hour care. The researchers categorised elderly people's care needs as high dependency if they need round-the-clock care, medium dependency if they need help at regular times daily, or low-dependency if they require support less than daily and are generally looked after in the community. Prof Jagger said this highlighted the importance of focusing on disabling long-term conditions, such as arthritis, that were more common in women than men. ""The rise in obesity is hitting women harder than men, and men have probably benefitted more from the reductions in cardiovascular disease. ""Women also suffer from a decline in muscle mass, and so I am stressing the importance of physical activity and maintaining strength and balance."" She added: ""This expanding group will have more complex care needs that are unlikely to be met adequately without improved co-ordination between different specialities."" The report also predicts that the number of people aged over 65 with dementia and at least two other diseases will double by 2025 and treble by 2035. The report comes as the government is considering how to reform social care in England. In June, a funding rise was agreed for the NHS, in which its budget will increase by Â£20bn a year by 2023. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""In the autumn we will set out our plans to reform adult social care alongside our long-term plan for the NHS, so we can address the challenge of our growing ageing population head on and ensure services are sustainable for the future."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, urged the government to meet the challenge head-on, and said the burden on families was too great. ""The problem is that today there are far too few really effective joined-up services, and social care is in sharp decline,"" she said. ""The government's top priority must be to steady the ship and then produce a great set of proposals later this year to give our older population confidence they can get the help they need.""

Frank Field may trigger by-electionVeteran MP who quit Labour group at Westminster over anti-Semitism considers electoral challenge.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Frank Field says Labour should be a 'champion against racism' Veteran MP Frank Field has said he is considering triggering a by-election in his Birkenhead constituency. He resigned the Labour whip over the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism allegations and what he calls ""bullying and intimidation"" in local parties. He says he wants to remain a party member and sit as an ""independent Labour"" MP - Labour says resigning the whip means quitting the party. His critics say he quit because he was facing deselection by local members. Analysis: Field is not leading a Labour breakaway Profile: Who is Frank Field? A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims He recently lost a vote of confidence organised by members angry at his support for the government in Brexit votes. The leader of Wirral Council, Labour's Phil Davies, is demanding Labour investigate allegations of bullying in the local party. He claimed Wirral Labour had been taken over by ""a small group of hard line extremists that are pursuing a narrow ideological agenda and are using tactics like bullying and intimidation to further that agenda."" Mr Field, who has represented his Merseyside seat since 1979 and won in 2017 with a majority of 25,514, has faced previous efforts to de-select him. He denied he had ""jumped before he was pushed"" and said he intended to fight the next general election as an independent Labour candidate. Hetold The Guardian,externalhe had been given two weeks to withdraw his resignation or be kicked out of the party at a meeting with Chief Whip Nick Brown. But Labour sources said this was not the case - and the rules of the party were that if he resigned as a Labour MP, he also resigned his membership of the Labour party at the same time. Mr Field told BBC Breakfast he would spend the ""next few days"" deciding whether to stand down as an MP to trigger a by-election, in which he would stand against an official Labour candidate. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Frank Field's decision to resign the Labour whip once again exposes the divisions at the heart of the Labour Party. Contrast the reaction of Jeremy Corbyn with his deputy Tom Watson. In a 12-word, one-sentence reaction, Mr Corbyn did not devote a single syllable to expressing regret at Mr Field's departure. Mr Watson described Mr Field's announcement as a ""serious loss"" which reflected ""deep divisions,"" a ""sense of drift"" and should act as a ""major wake-up call."" And now Frank Field is entertaining the idea of a by-election. Imagine that: the man who has represented Birkenhead for nearly 40 years, versus the Labour Party. Labour's divisions would be crystallised in one contest, visible to everyone, not just on Merseyside, but much further afield as well. Mr Fieldquit the party's parliamentary group through a letter to chief whip Nick Brown on Thursday, saying the leadership was becoming ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". A Labour Party spokesman has thanked Mr Field for his service to Labour, but the veteran MP told the BBC he had been thanked ""as if I was resigning from a whist club"". The MP also blamed a ""culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation"" in local Labour parties telling the BBC:  ""I do think that it's sad how the party following his election has really been taken over by the hard left. ""The campaign that Jewish people feel against them by factions of the Labour Party is all part of the intolerance which we also see at a local level."" He said he wanted to remain a Labour Party member and it was ""simply crazy"" to suggest his decision was ""part of a plot"". A Labour source said ""Frank has been looking for an excuse to resign for some time"". By BBC North West Political Editor Kevin Fitzpatrick It seems there is an increasingly toxic atmosphere in a number of Labour constituencies on Merseyside. Like Frank Field, Angela Eagle, in Wallasey, and Louise Ellman, in Liverpool Riverside, have claimed they've faced bullying and intimidation at their own meetings, predominantly from new members who've recently joined. For Mr Field, anger over his support for the government in key Brexit votes in July resulted in a no-confidence vote in his local party which he is thought to have lost by 30 votes to 18. This has no official force within the party and Mr Field's supporters say he remains popular with many members locally but they no longer turn up to party meetings, which, they claim, have been taken over by far left opponents of the MP. Before the next general election, whenever that may be, Mr Field would no doubt have a major fight on his hands to get re-selected. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson described the resignation of Mr Field as a ""serious loss to the party"" and a ""major wake up call"". Labour backbencher John Mann - who also backed the government in Brexit votes and has been a fierce critic of the leadership's stance on anti-Semitism - said he would remain in the party to ""fight to the last"" but added: ""If this isn't sorted, I predict others will go"". And, he added, the Labour leader should announce that all Jewish Labour MPs would be automatically re-selected to fight the next general election ""to take this harassment of them off the agenda"". However backbench MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Newsnight: ""He (Mr Field) has obviously lost the confidence of his members and he's now getting his excuses in, it seems to me, and throwing around grotesque slurs, which have no basis in reality. This video can not be played Birkenhead voters react to local MP Frank Field's decision to resign the Labour whip ""The party has taken the issue of anti-Semitism very seriously; far more seriously than any other political party. ""It's so sad to see someone like Frank Field trashing Labour's anti-racist record"". Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. A 2016 inquiry concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Recently, the focus has been on a new code of conduct the party has adopted on anti-Semitism, with critics concerned that it does not go as far as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines. Next Tuesday, Labour's ruling National Executive Committeeis expected to decide whether to adopt the IHRA guidelines in full, with the Parliamentary Labour Party due to be balloted on adopting the complete IHRA document, the day after. Another Labour MP, Mike Gapes,told the Evening Standard,externalhe was ""agonising every day about the situation and the state of the Labour Party"" and was waiting to see what the outcome of the NEC meeting was. ""I will make my own decision about how I deal with this in my own time,"" he told the newspaper. Earlier this month, Mr Corbyn again apologised for hurt caused to Jewish people by anti-Semitism in his party and admitted Labour had been too slow in dealing with disciplinary cases.

Over-85s in 24-hour care 'set to double',"This video can not be played ""I'll be broke if I live to 100"" The number of people aged 85 and over needing 24-hour care is set to double, says a new study, as an expert warns the care system is ""at breaking point"". The study, published in the Lancet Public Health journal, analysed the projected health needs of the elderly in England between 2015 and 2035. It found that the number of 65-year-olds and over needing round-the-clock care is also set to rise by a third. The government says adult social care reforms will be set out in the autumn. Social care shouldn't depend upon your bank balance Cases of cancer in elderly to surge by 2035, report says Tax over-40s for old age care, say MPs The modelling study, carried out by Newcastle University and the London School of Economics and Political Science, highlighted the fact that the fastest growing demographic in the UK is elderly people over 85, whose numbers are projected to more than double by 2035, increasing by 1.5 million. Many of these elderly will develop multiple long-term health conditions, such as dementia and diabetes, leading to increasingly complex care needs. The number of over-85s requiring help throughout the day with tasks such as dressing, bathing and going to the toilet is estimated to almost double to 446,000 by 2035. By the same time, the experts predict that a million over-65s will need similar 24-hour care. Rachel Goble's 86-year-old mother has dementia but lives in her own property. The family pays over Â£3,000 a month for private care. Rachel says she still has to provide a lot of care for her mother, and the situation is having a significant impact on her too. ""NHS care is for three half hour slots, leaving no time to bathe her or prepare meals. ""I do have a good care system in place but I am mindful of the fact these circumstances could change in an instant. ""My mother didn't qualify for some things until she was over 85 because she wasn't physically disabled, and there's too much form filling to see if you do qualify for anything. ""She also doesn't get taken to hospital or GP appointments - something that would be really helpful."" 'Fire-fighting' Rachel says the lack of help is affecting both her and her mother - and she worries about the future. ""I feel utterly alone and helpless.  She is in her own home, as she wishes, but it is her prison. She is lonely and depressed. ""I try and visit as often as I can, but we live 13 miles apart, and I have a job and family of my own. ""I have to manage her household bills, repair things in her home, and block cold calls on the phone and front door. I'm constantly fire-fighting. ""Not only does all of that cost money, but it's affecting my own mental health too."" Prof Carol Jagger, from the Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and senior author of the study, said the number of unpaid carers is in decline. She warned that relying on unpaid family carers was not sustainable and said: ""The challenge is considerable. ""Our study suggests that older spouse carers are increasingly likely to be living with disabilities themselves. ""On top of that, extending the retirement age of the UK population is likely to further reduce the informal carer pool, who have traditionally provided for older family members."" Nick Forbes, senior vice-chair of the Local Government Association, warned that more investment was needed to avoid a crisis. ""Adult social care services face a Â£3.5bn funding gap by 2025, just to maintain existing standards of care,"" he said. ""The system is at breaking point, ramping up pressures on unpaid carers. ""There is an urgent need to plug the immediate funding gap and find a long-term solution to how we pay for adult social care."" The study also noted that there were increasing numbers of adults aged over 65 living independently, with a rise of 60% forecast by 2035. However, as they got older men were more likely to remain independent, whereas women will spend almost half of their remaining life with low dependency needs and more years needing intensive 24-hour care. The researchers categorised elderly people's care needs as high dependency if they need round-the-clock care, medium dependency if they need help at regular times daily, or low-dependency if they require support less than daily and are generally looked after in the community. Prof Jagger said this highlighted the importance of focusing on disabling long-term conditions, such as arthritis, that were more common in women than men. ""The rise in obesity is hitting women harder than men, and men have probably benefitted more from the reductions in cardiovascular disease. ""Women also suffer from a decline in muscle mass, and so I am stressing the importance of physical activity and maintaining strength and balance."" She added: ""This expanding group will have more complex care needs that are unlikely to be met adequately without improved co-ordination between different specialities."" The report also predicts that the number of people aged over 65 with dementia and at least two other diseases will double by 2025 and treble by 2035. The report comes as the government is considering how to reform social care in England. In June, a funding rise was agreed for the NHS, in which its budget will increase by Â£20bn a year by 2023. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""In the autumn we will set out our plans to reform adult social care alongside our long-term plan for the NHS, so we can address the challenge of our growing ageing population head on and ensure services are sustainable for the future."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, urged the government to meet the challenge head-on, and said the burden on families was too great. ""The problem is that today there are far too few really effective joined-up services, and social care is in sharp decline,"" she said. ""The government's top priority must be to steady the ship and then produce a great set of proposals later this year to give our older population confidence they can get the help they need.""

In Thursday's episode, Ryan Thomas was given a warning for ""punching"" fellow housemate Roxanne Pallett. The former Corrie star said there was ""no anger or malice"" in what happened after Roxanne complained to the show's producers about his behaviour. Big Brother bosses issued him with a formal warning for physical contact. Some viewers have uploadedfootage of the incident,externalto YouTube, arguing that Thomas was play-fighting. Roxanne said the incident made her feel ""uncomfortable"" Ofcom said it had received 11,215 complaints about the episode, adding: ""We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate."" Both Roxanne and Ryan are currently housemates in the latest series of the Channel 5 reality TV show. Pallett made her name as Jo Sugden in ITV soap Emmerdale while Ryan found fame playing Jason Grimshaw in Coronation Street from 2000 to 2016. During last night's show Ryan was seen approaching Roxanne in the kitchen before appearing to use his fist to make contact with her body. She said: ""Ouch that hurt, I was going to wash your clothes but I might shrink them now."" The actress made her name playing Jo Sugden in ITV soap Emmerdale After returning to the bedroom, the Emmerdale star added: ""Just been beaten up by Corrie's Jason Grimshaw. Big Brother that hurt."" Roxanne then entered the house's diary room where she demanded to speak to producers. ""Something that's just happened made me feel really uncomfortable,"" she said. ""I'm in shock, I went from upset to angry. A boy has punched me repeatedly, unprovoked and deliberately punched me. Like a boxer punches a bag."" CBB: 1,000 complaints over use of N-word Celebrity Big Brother responds to Stormy Daniels no-show Rodrigo Alves removed from the Big Brother house A producer of the show told her they took the incident very seriously and would be reviewing the footage. ""I can't believe you're letting somebody stay that has done that, it's not okay,"" Roxanne replied. In another visit to the the diary room, the 35-year-old refused to sleep in the same room as Ryan and was allowed to sleep in a spare room. ""I am now suffering and I am now having to alter my experience because someone was violent. Now I am going to get nominated for being unsociable,"" she said. Ryan Thomas starred in Coronation Street for 16 years Big Brother bosses then called Ryan to the diary room where they pointed out that while ""almost play fighting"" he ""punched Roxanne in the ribs"". He was reminded of the show's rules and given a formal warning for his behaviour. ""We both know and Roxanne knows there was no malice, hurt or anger in anything I did during this time. I am sorry and I understand,"" he said. The incident sparked a big debate on social media. Some argued Ryan was being playful and Roxanne was overreacting. Allow Twitter content?

'Rugby union missing out on black talent',"One of the most famous black players in the Premiership says rugby union isn't doing enough to get ethnic minority children from state schools into the game. England and Wasps wing Christian Wade says the sport still suffers from a ""white, public school"" image. He believes that big clubs are ignoring a large pool of untapped talent. The 27-year-old told Newsbeat he wants to set up a foundation to give state school players more opportunities. ""I think there is probably a lot more that can be done to integrate everyone and make it more diverse,"" Christian said. ""There is a lot of talent out there in normal secondary schools that can be transferred across."" Wasps wing Christian was top try-scorer in Rugby Union's Premiership last season with 17 The winger, who passed an exam to go to a grammar school, says he regularly receives messages from black kids struggling to get a break. ""The amount of Instagram DMs and posts from kids who look up to me and want to play rugby, but don't know how they can get into good clubs that will give them an opportunity to get scouted, is endless."" He says clubs are still attracted to private schools where rugby is played more often than in the state system. According to the Independent School Council, only 7% of children in England under the age of 16 are privately educated, but 68% of players in the England squad for the last Rugby World Cup in 2015 went to fee-paying schools (21 out of 31). This compares to just 13% of the England squad at the 2018 football World Cup in Russia (three out of 23). ""Rugby union definitely has a private school image,"" Christian agrees. ""We need to reach out a lot more."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Not a lot of state secondary schools have a full rugby programme like the private schools do,"" says Christian, who finished last season as the Premiership's top try-scorer. He believes clubs tend to target private schools to work with instead of secondary schools ""because a lot of the work has been done by the school already"". ""Although I went to a grammar school, we were lucky enough to be on the same circuit as the private schools. I feel that was my way of getting into the system."" Christian wants to see more students from non fee-paying schools given opportunities by Premiership rugby clubs All five of the English born, black or mixed-race players selected by England to tour South Africa this summer were at least partly educated in private schools. Harlequins prop Kyle Sinckler went to state schools until the age of 16, but moved to the fee-paying Epsom College shortly after the London club signed the tight-head to their academy. Sinckler went on to make his full England debut in 2016 and has since won 13 caps for his country. ""You can't just hand out hundreds of scholarships all the time,"" Christian argues. ""There will only ever be a handful who can benefit from that. ""To get kids into private school you obviously need money, which not everybody has. I was lucky, because I'm not from a wealthy background. ""Luckily I had a little bit of brains to get into a grammar school but, if I didn't, then it could have been a different story for me.""

Premiership Rugby points to its ""Hitz Programme"", which works with more than 2000 14 to 18-year-olds every year, as evidence it is trying to make the sport more accessible. It says its ""Project Rugby"" initiative, in partnership with the RFU, is also aimed at increasing rugby participation from under-represented groups such as the black and Asian communities and those from poorer backgrounds. Christian, who made his England debut in 2013 and toured with the British and Irish Lions to Australia in the same year, now wants to set up his own foundation to help those less fortunate. ""I want to do it while I'm still playing, as that will probably be when I'm most powerful as a rugby player. ""I try to get myself involved in any events where I can help these guys and speak to them about what they could do. Christian has toured with the British and Irish Lions and wants to share his experiences with those struggling to get a break in rugby Christian acknowledges there are efforts being made to break the public school stranglehold in rugby union, but believes the pathways to the professional game remain very difficult for the vast majority of children from lower income backgrounds. It's this reliance on the private school system that he wants to try to challenge. ""I'm always open to giving advice and helping them get into clubs. ""I want to give them my experience, mentor them and hopefully maybe even help them out financially as well."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

Astronauts tackle leak on space station,"The Russian Soyuz spacecraft (L) brought a new crew to the International Space Station (ISS) in June Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) are having to deal with an air leak from a possible collision. It has been traced to a small hole in a capsule that was used to deliver a new crew to the laboratory 400km (250 miles) above the Earth in June. It is thought the damage was caused by the impact of a high-speed rocky fragment flying through space. Mission controllers in Houston, Texas, and Russia's capital, Moscow, say the six-strong crew are in no danger. Impacts from tiny meteoroids are a permanent threat to the orbiting platform and it was built to withstand the constant bombardment from the dusty fragments that whizz about above the Earth.

The astronauts were asleep at the time, but when they rose for their day's work on Wednesday they were instructed to search for the leak. They found it inthe Russian Soyuz vehicle used to bring three crewmen to the station on 8 June, among them Europe's Alexander Gerst, who is set to take command of the outpost. ""Overnight and in the morning there was an abnormal situation - a pressure drop, an oxygen leak at the station,"" chief of the federal space agency Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. ""A micro-fracture was found; most likely it is damage from the outside. The design engineers believe it is the result of a micrometeorite,"" he said. German astronaut Alexander Gerst will be the second European to command the ISS Germany's Gerst confirmed the presence of the hole by running his finger over it. An immediate fix was implemented using a sealant and tape to cover the hole, which is said to measure a couple of millimetres in diameter. Allow Twitter content?

CBB's Ryan warned for punching RoxanneProducers issue the ex-Corrie star with a warning after an incident with fellow housemate Roxanne Pallett.Newsbeat,"More than 11,000 complaints have been made to media watchdog Ofcom about the Celebrity Big Brother ""punching"" episode. In Thursday's episode, Ryan Thomas was given a warning for ""punching"" fellow housemate Roxanne Pallett. The former Corrie star said there was ""no anger or malice"" in what happened after Roxanne complained to the show's producers about his behaviour. Big Brother bosses issued him with a formal warning for physical contact. Some viewers have uploadedfootage of the incident,externalto YouTube, arguing that Thomas was play-fighting. Roxanne said the incident made her feel ""uncomfortable"" Ofcom said it had received 11,215 complaints about the episode, adding: ""We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate."" Both Roxanne and Ryan are currently housemates in the latest series of the Channel 5 reality TV show. Pallett made her name as Jo Sugden in ITV soap Emmerdale while Ryan found fame playing Jason Grimshaw in Coronation Street from 2000 to 2016. During last night's show Ryan was seen approaching Roxanne in the kitchen before appearing to use his fist to make contact with her body. She said: ""Ouch that hurt, I was going to wash your clothes but I might shrink them now."" The actress made her name playing Jo Sugden in ITV soap Emmerdale After returning to the bedroom, the Emmerdale star added: ""Just been beaten up by Corrie's Jason Grimshaw. Big Brother that hurt."" Roxanne then entered the house's diary room where she demanded to speak to producers. ""Something that's just happened made me feel really uncomfortable,"" she said. ""I'm in shock, I went from upset to angry. A boy has punched me repeatedly, unprovoked and deliberately punched me. Like a boxer punches a bag."" CBB: 1,000 complaints over use of N-word Celebrity Big Brother responds to Stormy Daniels no-show Rodrigo Alves removed from the Big Brother house A producer of the show told her they took the incident very seriously and would be reviewing the footage. ""I can't believe you're letting somebody stay that has done that, it's not okay,"" Roxanne replied. In another visit to the the diary room, the 35-year-old refused to sleep in the same room as Ryan and was allowed to sleep in a spare room. ""I am now suffering and I am now having to alter my experience because someone was violent. Now I am going to get nominated for being unsociable,"" she said. Ryan Thomas starred in Coronation Street for 16 years Big Brother bosses then called Ryan to the diary room where they pointed out that while ""almost play fighting"" he ""punched Roxanne in the ribs"". He was reminded of the show's rules and given a formal warning for his behaviour. ""We both know and Roxanne knows there was no malice, hurt or anger in anything I did during this time. I am sorry and I understand,"" he said. The incident sparked a big debate on social media. Some argued Ryan was being playful and Roxanne was overreacting. Allow Twitter content?

Trump threatens to pull US out of WTO,"Mr Trump has been embroiled in tit-for-tat trade battles on several fronts in recent months President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw the US from the World Trade Organization (WTO), claiming it treats his country unfairly. ""If they don't shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO,""Mr Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News,external. The WTO was established to provide rules for global trade and resolve disputes between countries. Mr Trump says the body too often rules against the US, although he concedes it has won some recent judgments. He claimed on Fox News earlier this year that the WTO was set up ""to benefit everybody but us"", adding: ""We lose the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits in the WTO."" However,some analysis shows the US wins about 90% when it is the complainant,externaland loses about the same percentage when it is complained against. Mr Trump's warning about a possible US pull-out from the WTO highlights the conflict between his protectionist trade policies and the open trade system that the WTO oversees. US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Is Trump the WTO's biggest threat? Is Trump right about trade? Washington has recently blocked the appointment of new judges to the WTO's Geneva-based dispute settlement body, which could potentially paralyse its ability to issue judgments. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has also accused the WTO of interfering with US sovereignty. It comes as President Trump set a Friday deadline for Canada to sign a new agreement with the US and Mexico. He has threatened to tax the country's automotive sector or cut it out entirely. The US president has been sounding off about unfair trade since even before he became president. Mr Trump said on Thursday that the 1994 agreement to establish the WTO ""was the single worst trade deal ever made"". The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts in recent months. The one creating the most interest is with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence. Mr Trump has introduced tariffs on a number of goods imported into the US. Early victims of Trump's trade war What is a trade war and should I worry? Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war A third round of tariffs on $200bn (Â£154bn) of Chinese goods could come as soon as a public-comment period concludes next week, according to a Bloomberg report citing various sources. Asked to confirm this during the Bloomberg interview, President Trump said that it was ""not totally wrong"". China has responded to US tariffs by imposing retaliatory taxes on the same value of US products and has filed complaints against the tariffs at the WTO. China's commerce ministry has said it ""clearly suspects"" the US of violating WTO rules. An initial complaint at the WTO was filed by China in July after Mr Trump imposed his first round of tariffs. This video can not be played Donald Trump speaks with the Mexican leader on the phone through an interpreter The WTO is at the heart of the system of rules for international trade.  It is the forum for sorting disputes between countries about breaches of global trade rules and for negotiating new trade liberalisation. The EU, meanwhile, is trying to steer the US towards reforming the WTO rather than abandoning it. Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's trade committee, told Politico magazine that it would submit plans to overhaul the organisation in September,external. He said it would test whether the US was really interested in reform. ""This is certainly about calling [America's] bluff,"" he said. Mr Trump has not been a fan of multilateral trade agreements. In a 2016 presidential debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump described the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico and Canada as ""the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere"" and a ""killer"" of US jobs. Once in office he said he wanted to renegotiate - not scrap - the accord, triggering a year of talks. On Monday, Mr Trump announced that the US and Mexico had agreed to revamp Nafta, calling it a ""really good deal"" that was ""much more fair"" for both countries. Canada is yet to agree to the new terms. Clock is ticking for Canada in US trade negotiations What is Nafta? What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? On Thursday, Mr Lighthizer held talks in Washington with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland aimed at reaching a new deal. Following four separate meetings, which continued late into the night, Ms Freeland told reporters that a deal could not be reached, adding that talks would resume on Friday. Also during his election campaign Mr Trump railed against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation trade deal that was a linchpin of former President Barack Obama's Asia policy. Mr Trump said the deal was a ""potential disaster for our country"". One of his first acts as president was to withdraw the US from the TTP, althoughhe has since said he might consider rejoiningif the terms were ""substantially better"".

Breaking|Breaking newsCrossrail to miss December opening dateLondonâs new Crossrail underground line will not open until autumn 2019 - nine months after its scheduled launchLondon,"Crossrail's original budget was set at Â£15.9bn in 2007 but cut to Â£14.8bn in 2010 Londonâs Â£15bn Crossrail project is to open nine months after its scheduled launch to allow more time for testing. Europe's biggest infrastructure project will help ease London's chronic congestion by connecting major landmarks such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. The route, to be known as the Elizabeth line, had been due to open in December, but will now be launched in autumn 2019 ""to ensure a safe and reliable railway"", transport officials said. It is runningalmost Â£600m over budget. The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December 2018 When fully operational, trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. It will operate as three separate services - as previously planned. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes. During the project eight giant tunnel boring machines burrowed below the streets of London to construct 42km of new rail tunnels An estimated 200m passengers will use the new undergound line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Crossrail Limited described the 10-year project as ""hugely complex"". It said ""further time"" was required for testing, and that contractors needed to complete work in the central tunnels and to develop ""railways systems software"". Transport for London (TfL) said more time was needed ""to ensure a safe and reliable railway for customers from day one of passenger service"". Lord Adonis, the former Transport Secretary, accused Crossrail of ""trying to smuggle out a really serious failure on the biggest infrastructure project affecting the country"" when parliament isn't sitting. He said: ""There's no excuse for what has happened on this project, and people need to be held to account."" By Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent I have lost count of the times that Crossrail executives said to me the project would be delivered ""on time and on budget"". Today that disappeared in a puff of smoke, and there is no doubt this is a blow for Crossrail. I'm told it wasn't one specific problem. There were issues with three different signalling systems and also delays to the station fit outs. They simply ran out of time. This will also hit TfL's finances which was  relying on Crossrail to increase its fare take. This flagship project - the biggest construction project in Europe - just lost some of its lustre. This video can not be played How to fly a drone through Crossrail's tunnels The Federation of Small Business (FSB) said it was ""extremely disappointed with the news"". London Policy Chair of the FSB, Sue Terpilowski, said: ""Small businesses, particularly in central London, have been preparing for a December roll out of the new infrastructure and to be told on a Friday in August that the date has now changed is simply not good enough."" A spokesman for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the delay is ""obviously disappointing. ""It is essential that a safe and reliable railway operates from day one, and this has to be the top priority."" 360 video: Tour the London Silver Vaults Autism dog charities call for regulation Is it OK to paint your nails on a train? Simon Wright, Crossrail chief executive, said: ""The Elizabeth line is one of the most complex and challenging infrastructure projects ever undertaken in the UK and is now in its final stages. ""We have made huge progress with the delivery of this incredible project but we need further time to complete the testing of the new railway. ""We are working around the clock with our supply chain and Transport for London to complete and commission the Elizabeth line.""

"New asthma treatment set for wider useThe new 'melting muscle' treatment has proved to be safe and effective, health experts say.Health","A new treatment for severe asthma is set to be made more widely available on the NHS in the UK by the end of 2018. The procedure, bronchial thermoplasty, ""melts"" away excess muscle tissue in the lungs using radio frequency, making breathing easier. Previously there were strict criteria about who was eligible to receive it. But theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice),externalsays it can be offered more routinely, after it was proved to be safe and effective. Some people may still not be able to receive it because the final decision about whether to offer the procedure lies with local health bodies. Some 5.4 million people in the UK have asthma - but for more than 200,000 of them (3.7%) the asthma is so severe, it can be life-threatening. In fact, the most recent figures from Asthma UK show that 1,410 people died from asthma in 2016. However, this ""life-changing"" treatment will be used only if a patient's symptoms cannot be adequately controlled with drugs, and is only suitable for adults. Joe Farrington-Douglas, the charity's head of policy and external affairs, said: ""This debilitating form of asthma is resistant to regular treatments, meaning many have to cope with terrifying asthma symptoms, such as gasping for breath, as well repeated trips to Accident & Emergency. ""Until now, this treatment has only been available for specific patients at some specialist centres, but these new guidelines could mean more people with the condition could reap the benefits."" Coughing Wheezing Shortness of breath Chest tightness They might only happen when you react to a trigger, like pollen, dust, cigarette smoke, cold air or pets. Source:Asthma UK,external Severe asthma causes inflammation and constriction of the smooth muscle in the walls of the small tubes - the bronchi - impeding the passage of air through to the deep tissue of the lungs. Bronchial thermoplasty tackles this by reducing this muscle mass, thus decreasing the constriction of the bronchi that can take place during an asthma attack. As a result, patients experience fewer and less severe asthma attacks. The procedure takes place under sedation or general anaesthetic and involves a wire probe being inserted into the lungs. Diagram of bronchial thermoplasty Ten-second bursts of radio waves are sent along the airway wall, heating the lining of the lungs to 65C. Two further sessions will be needed, each three weeks apart. The estimated cost of the procedure per patient is thought to be between Â£7,099 and Â£7,257. Nice's programme director and clinical adviser, Prof Kevin Harris, said: ""This is a procedure which is innovative and it does work. ""Asthma is a common disease and the vast majority of patients won't require this treatment. ""But for people with severe asthma this procedure could be life-changing. ""The committee was convinced it was safe enough and works well enough for use with standard arrangements in the NHS.""

Raab prepares for six-hour Brexit talks,"The two negotiators will meet again next week Both sides in Brexit talks say progress is being made but without any breakthrough on the crucial issue of the Irish border. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""stubbornly optimistic"" about getting a deal after talks in Brussels. Unresolved issues include intellectual property, data protection and the role of the European Court of Justice. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he needed detail from the UK on its plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. He told journalists that remaining ""bones of contention"" between the two sides were being steadily eliminated with particular progress on issues of security, judicial and defence co-operation after ""long"" talks on Friday. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles Back May's Brexit plan 'or risk no deal' May sticking by 'sensible' Brexit plans Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Both sides are hoping to agree a divorce deal and a statement on future trading relations at a summit of EU leaders on 17 October, although Mr Raab said that deadline could be missed slightly. He told reporters: ""We're committed to resolving the deal by (the October council) and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach."" Mr Barnier said there was a ""measure of flexibility"" and if the process slipped by a ""few days or weeks"" it would still be possible for the UK to leave the EU with a deal, if approved by the UK and EU Parliaments, on schedule. The EU negotiator said the ""building blocks"" of an agreement were falling into place. He repeated his offer of an ""unprecedented"" future partnership with the UK but insisted this depended on an ""orderly"" withdrawal and settling key outstanding issues. May sticking by 'sensible' Brexit plans Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop He said the question of the Irish border had come down to ""minutiae"" and he needed to see the detail of how the UK proposed to manage cross-border trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event of there being no other solution - the so-called backstop - would work in practice. More information on the Irish border is needed as a ""matter of urgency"", Mr Barnier said ""This backstop is critical,"" he said. ""It is essential to concluding the negotiations. Without a backstop, there will be no agreement."" Mr Raab said he had used Friday's talks to explain in more detail the UK's proposal for its future relationship with the EU, the so-called Chequers plan agreed by Theresa May at her country residence in July. The PM's blueprint, which would see the UK follow EU rules on trade in goods, is unpopular with many Tory MPs, with leading Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson calling for it to be ditched. Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July in protest over the PM's proposals, said he agreed with Mrs May's former aide Nick Timothy, who urged her to ditch the plan. Mr Timothy wrote on Thursday,externalthat she would have to make further concessions to get EU backing for it and this would be unacceptable. Allow Twitter content?

And Stuart Jackson, the former Tory MP who until recently was an aide to Dominic Raab's predecessor David Davis, said the Chequers plan ""has not really got any friends"" on either side. ""For the EU, it's outside their core principles and undermines the integrity of the single market,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""In the UK, people believe it is Brexit in name only."" The two sides say they have agreed 80% of the withdrawal agreement. The remaining 20% includes: Irish border:The principle of a backstop was agreed in December but the detail has not. The UK says physical checks are unnecessary but the EU says the single market must be upheld Governance and implementation:What role will the European Court of Justice have in enforcing the agreement, including on citizen's rights, and what penalties can be applied if either side breaks it? Data:How will the data of EU citizens currently stored in the UK be protected? Geographical indications:How will the UK continue protections for regional products such as French champagne and Spanish manchego cheese? Criminal and judicial matters:How will existing co-operation on cross-border crime and money laundering be maintained and extended? Mr Raab vowed to increase the frequency of talks with Mr Barnier when he took over the job. But Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the outcome of the negotiations, said ""nothing had changed"" since then. ""Dominic Raab may say he is more confident about reaching agreement but he can offer nothing concrete,"" he said. ""He knows the EU27 are not buying the Chequers car crash - a proposal designed around the need to hold a fractured government together and not on the economic interest and well-being of either the UK or the EU.""

Field wanted 'broad debate' within Labour,"This video can not be played Frank Field says Labour should be a 'champion against racism' Veteran MP Frank Field has said he is considering triggering a by-election in his Birkenhead constituency. He resigned the Labour whip over the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism allegations and what he calls ""bullying and intimidation"" in local parties. He says he wants to remain a party member and sit as an ""independent Labour"" MP - Labour says resigning the whip means quitting the party. His critics say he quit because he was facing deselection by local members. Analysis: Field is not leading a Labour breakaway Profile: Who is Frank Field? A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims He recently lost a vote of confidence organised by members angry at his support for the government in Brexit votes. The leader of Wirral Council, Labour's Phil Davies, is demanding Labour investigate allegations of bullying in the local party. He claimed Wirral Labour had been taken over by ""a small group of hard line extremists that are pursuing a narrow ideological agenda and are using tactics like bullying and intimidation to further that agenda."" Mr Field, who has represented his Merseyside seat since 1979 and won in 2017 with a majority of 25,514, has faced previous efforts to de-select him. He denied he had ""jumped before he was pushed"" and said he intended to fight the next general election as an independent Labour candidate. Hetold The Guardian,externalhe had been given two weeks to withdraw his resignation or be kicked out of the party at a meeting with Chief Whip Nick Brown. But Labour sources said this was not the case - and the rules of the party were that if he resigned as a Labour MP, he also resigned his membership of the Labour party at the same time. Mr Field told BBC Breakfast he would spend the ""next few days"" deciding whether to stand down as an MP to trigger a by-election, in which he would stand against an official Labour candidate. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Frank Field's decision to resign the Labour whip once again exposes the divisions at the heart of the Labour Party. Contrast the reaction of Jeremy Corbyn with his deputy Tom Watson. In a 12-word, one-sentence reaction, Mr Corbyn did not devote a single syllable to expressing regret at Mr Field's departure. Mr Watson described Mr Field's announcement as a ""serious loss"" which reflected ""deep divisions,"" a ""sense of drift"" and should act as a ""major wake-up call."" And now Frank Field is entertaining the idea of a by-election. Imagine that: the man who has represented Birkenhead for nearly 40 years, versus the Labour Party. Labour's divisions would be crystallised in one contest, visible to everyone, not just on Merseyside, but much further afield as well. Mr Fieldquit the party's parliamentary group through a letter to chief whip Nick Brown on Thursday, saying the leadership was becoming ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". A Labour Party spokesman has thanked Mr Field for his service to Labour, but the veteran MP told the BBC he had been thanked ""as if I was resigning from a whist club"". The MP also blamed a ""culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation"" in local Labour parties telling the BBC:  ""I do think that it's sad how the party following his election has really been taken over by the hard left. ""The campaign that Jewish people feel against them by factions of the Labour Party is all part of the intolerance which we also see at a local level."" He said he wanted to remain a Labour Party member and it was ""simply crazy"" to suggest his decision was ""part of a plot"". A Labour source said ""Frank has been looking for an excuse to resign for some time"". By BBC North West Political Editor Kevin Fitzpatrick It seems there is an increasingly toxic atmosphere in a number of Labour constituencies on Merseyside. Like Frank Field, Angela Eagle, in Wallasey, and Louise Ellman, in Liverpool Riverside, have claimed they've faced bullying and intimidation at their own meetings, predominantly from new members who've recently joined. For Mr Field, anger over his support for the government in key Brexit votes in July resulted in a no-confidence vote in his local party which he is thought to have lost by 30 votes to 18. This has no official force within the party and Mr Field's supporters say he remains popular with many members locally but they no longer turn up to party meetings, which, they claim, have been taken over by far left opponents of the MP. Before the next general election, whenever that may be, Mr Field would no doubt have a major fight on his hands to get re-selected. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson described the resignation of Mr Field as a ""serious loss to the party"" and a ""major wake up call"". Labour backbencher John Mann - who also backed the government in Brexit votes and has been a fierce critic of the leadership's stance on anti-Semitism - said he would remain in the party to ""fight to the last"" but added: ""If this isn't sorted, I predict others will go"". And, he added, the Labour leader should announce that all Jewish Labour MPs would be automatically re-selected to fight the next general election ""to take this harassment of them off the agenda"". However backbench MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Newsnight: ""He (Mr Field) has obviously lost the confidence of his members and he's now getting his excuses in, it seems to me, and throwing around grotesque slurs, which have no basis in reality. This video can not be played Birkenhead voters react to local MP Frank Field's decision to resign the Labour whip ""The party has taken the issue of anti-Semitism very seriously; far more seriously than any other political party. ""It's so sad to see someone like Frank Field trashing Labour's anti-racist record"". Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. A 2016 inquiry concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Recently, the focus has been on a new code of conduct the party has adopted on anti-Semitism, with critics concerned that it does not go as far as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines. Next Tuesday, Labour's ruling National Executive Committeeis expected to decide whether to adopt the IHRA guidelines in full, with the Parliamentary Labour Party due to be balloted on adopting the complete IHRA document, the day after. Another Labour MP, Mike Gapes,told the Evening Standard,externalhe was ""agonising every day about the situation and the state of the Labour Party"" and was waiting to see what the outcome of the NEC meeting was. ""I will make my own decision about how I deal with this in my own time,"" he told the newspaper.

Manager spent Grenfell cash on Dubai tripCouncil worker Jenny McDonagh took cash meant for survivors and spent it on holidays and gambling.London,"Jenny McDonagh was ordered to surrender her passport and will be sentenced at a later date A council worker has admitted defrauding around Â£60,000 from the Grenfell Tower victim fund. Jenny McDonagh, 39, took cash meant for survivors of the tragedy and victims' grieving family members using pre-paid cards. The Kensington and Chelsea Council finance manager spent the funds on trips to Dubai and Los Angeles, expensive dinners and online gambling. McDonagh, described as a ""serial fraudster"", admitted fraud and theft. She obtained the money ""while being neither a survivor or bereaved family member"", Scotland Yard said. After the fire, McDonagh withdrew Â£62,000 over 10 months, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. The tower block fire in June 2017 killed 72 people Prosecutor Robert Simpson described her as a ""serial fraudster"" who ""lives beyond her means and gambles"". He said she used the stolen funds for a ""trip to Dubai, Los Angeles, meals in expensive restaurants, hair appointments and personal luxuries for herself"". He added: ""She spent quite a lot of money on online gambling. She spent Â£32,000, of which Â£16,000 was winnings and lost roughly Â£16,000 in online gambling."" McDonagh's marriage has since broken down, the court heard. Jenny McDonagh is one of several people to have been convicted of fraud offences relating to funds meant for Grenfell survivors McDonagh, of Abbey Wood, south-east London, pleaded guilty to two offences of fraud, one of theft and another of concealing criminal property. She was released on conditional bail with an electronic tag and will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court at a date to be set. Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot said ""custody is the obvious place to go"" and ordered a pre-sentence report. McDonagh was also ordered to quit her current job as finance officer at a mental health charity and inform the police before taking on any further work. Following her conviction a Kensington and Chelsea Council spokesman said the authority was ""shocked"" by the fraud and found McDonagh's actions ""unforgivable"". ""We take fraud very seriously and we have always taken action to root out Grenfell fraud wherever it takes place. ""On this occasion it was one of our own members of staff who managed to defraud the council by getting past our own systems and processes. This is both shocking and unforgivable. ""We discovered the fraud and took action straight away, including strengthening our internal processes. ""We apologise to the survivors and families for any distress this may cause.""

Raab prepares for six-hour Brexit talksThe Brexit secretary will meet the EU's chief negotiator as work on a divorce deal continues.,"The two negotiators will meet again next week Both sides in Brexit talks say progress is being made but without any breakthrough on the crucial issue of the Irish border. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""stubbornly optimistic"" about getting a deal after talks in Brussels. Unresolved issues include intellectual property, data protection and the role of the European Court of Justice. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he needed detail from the UK on its plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. He told journalists that remaining ""bones of contention"" between the two sides were being steadily eliminated with particular progress on issues of security, judicial and defence co-operation after ""long"" talks on Friday. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles Back May's Brexit plan 'or risk no deal' May sticking by 'sensible' Brexit plans Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Both sides are hoping to agree a divorce deal and a statement on future trading relations at a summit of EU leaders on 17 October, although Mr Raab said that deadline could be missed slightly. He told reporters: ""We're committed to resolving the deal by (the October council) and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach."" Mr Barnier said there was a ""measure of flexibility"" and if the process slipped by a ""few days or weeks"" it would still be possible for the UK to leave the EU with a deal, if approved by the UK and EU Parliaments, on schedule. The EU negotiator said the ""building blocks"" of an agreement were falling into place. He repeated his offer of an ""unprecedented"" future partnership with the UK but insisted this depended on an ""orderly"" withdrawal and settling key outstanding issues. May sticking by 'sensible' Brexit plans Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop He said the question of the Irish border had come down to ""minutiae"" and he needed to see the detail of how the UK proposed to manage cross-border trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event of there being no other solution - the so-called backstop - would work in practice. More information on the Irish border is needed as a ""matter of urgency"", Mr Barnier said ""This backstop is critical,"" he said. ""It is essential to concluding the negotiations. Without a backstop, there will be no agreement."" Mr Raab said he had used Friday's talks to explain in more detail the UK's proposal for its future relationship with the EU, the so-called Chequers plan agreed by Theresa May at her country residence in July. The PM's blueprint, which would see the UK follow EU rules on trade in goods, is unpopular with many Tory MPs, with leading Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson calling for it to be ditched. Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July in protest over the PM's proposals, said he agreed with Mrs May's former aide Nick Timothy, who urged her to ditch the plan. Mr Timothy wrote on Thursday,externalthat she would have to make further concessions to get EU backing for it and this would be unacceptable. Allow Twitter content?

And Stuart Jackson, the former Tory MP who until recently was an aide to Dominic Raab's predecessor David Davis, said the Chequers plan ""has not really got any friends"" on either side. ""For the EU, it's outside their core principles and undermines the integrity of the single market,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""In the UK, people believe it is Brexit in name only."" The two sides say they have agreed 80% of the withdrawal agreement. The remaining 20% includes: Irish border:The principle of a backstop was agreed in December but the detail has not. The UK says physical checks are unnecessary but the EU says the single market must be upheld Governance and implementation:What role will the European Court of Justice have in enforcing the agreement, including on citizen's rights, and what penalties can be applied if either side breaks it? Data:How will the data of EU citizens currently stored in the UK be protected? Geographical indications:How will the UK continue protections for regional products such as French champagne and Spanish manchego cheese? Criminal and judicial matters:How will existing co-operation on cross-border crime and money laundering be maintained and extended? Mr Raab vowed to increase the frequency of talks with Mr Barnier when he took over the job. But Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the outcome of the negotiations, said ""nothing had changed"" since then. ""Dominic Raab may say he is more confident about reaching agreement but he can offer nothing concrete,"" he said. ""He knows the EU27 are not buying the Chequers car crash - a proposal designed around the need to hold a fractured government together and not on the economic interest and well-being of either the UK or the EU.""

"Field wanted 'broad debate' within LabourFrank Field says he backed Jeremy Corbyn for leader to be ""inclusive"", but the party is now intolerant.UK Politics","This video can not be played Frank Field says Labour should be a 'champion against racism' Veteran MP Frank Field has said he is considering triggering a by-election in his Birkenhead constituency. He resigned the Labour whip over the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism allegations and what he calls ""bullying and intimidation"" in local parties. He says he wants to remain a party member and sit as an ""independent Labour"" MP - Labour says resigning the whip means quitting the party. His critics say he quit because he was facing deselection by local members. Analysis: Field is not leading a Labour breakaway Profile: Who is Frank Field? A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims He recently lost a vote of confidence organised by members angry at his support for the government in Brexit votes. The leader of Wirral Council, Labour's Phil Davies, is demanding Labour investigate allegations of bullying in the local party. He claimed Wirral Labour had been taken over by ""a small group of hard line extremists that are pursuing a narrow ideological agenda and are using tactics like bullying and intimidation to further that agenda."" Mr Field, who has represented his Merseyside seat since 1979 and won in 2017 with a majority of 25,514, has faced previous efforts to de-select him. He denied he had ""jumped before he was pushed"" and said he intended to fight the next general election as an independent Labour candidate. Hetold The Guardian,externalhe had been given two weeks to withdraw his resignation or be kicked out of the party at a meeting with Chief Whip Nick Brown. But Labour sources said this was not the case - and the rules of the party were that if he resigned as a Labour MP, he also resigned his membership of the Labour party at the same time. Mr Field told BBC Breakfast he would spend the ""next few days"" deciding whether to stand down as an MP to trigger a by-election, in which he would stand against an official Labour candidate. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Frank Field's decision to resign the Labour whip once again exposes the divisions at the heart of the Labour Party. Contrast the reaction of Jeremy Corbyn with his deputy Tom Watson. In a 12-word, one-sentence reaction, Mr Corbyn did not devote a single syllable to expressing regret at Mr Field's departure. Mr Watson described Mr Field's announcement as a ""serious loss"" which reflected ""deep divisions,"" a ""sense of drift"" and should act as a ""major wake-up call."" And now Frank Field is entertaining the idea of a by-election. Imagine that: the man who has represented Birkenhead for nearly 40 years, versus the Labour Party. Labour's divisions would be crystallised in one contest, visible to everyone, not just on Merseyside, but much further afield as well. Mr Fieldquit the party's parliamentary group through a letter to chief whip Nick Brown on Thursday, saying the leadership was becoming ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". A Labour Party spokesman has thanked Mr Field for his service to Labour, but the veteran MP told the BBC he had been thanked ""as if I was resigning from a whist club"".

""The leadership is doing nothing substantive to address this erosion of our core values. It saddens me that we are increasingly seen as a racist party."" Mr Field has been a Labour MP since 1979 and is a specialist on welfare issues. He had a spell as welfare reform minister after Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997, but his brief to ""think the unthinkable"" ended with his resignation a year later. Since then he has been a backbencher, and has chaired the Commons Work and Pensions Committee for the past three years. Mr Field said he expected Jeremy Corbyn to lead the party into the next election Perhaps the biggest question raised by Frank Field's resignation from Labour's group at Westminster is: Will there be more? Could this even be the beginning of a much wider schism, taking some of the significant minority of Labour MPs who oppose Jeremy Corbyn, not just over the issue of anti-Semitism but wider political issues including Europe, over the edge? The stresses and strains in the party over anti-Semitism, over Europe and in particular the idea of a fresh referendum - a so-called People's Vote - on Brexit will dominate Labour's annual conference in Liverpool in late September. Talk of a new centrist grouping in politics has been rumbling for months. But those dissident MPs have, so far, been deeply reluctant to translate their private dissent into open insurrection. They say it's about deep-rooted loyalty. Their enemies say it's a lack of nerve. Both loyalty and nerve will be tested in the coming days and weeks. Last month, Mr Field lost a confidence vote by his constituency party after voting with the government over Brexit plans. In his letter to Nick Brown, Mr Field complained that intimidation and intolerance were now ""sadly manifest within my own Constituency Labour Party"" and referred to a complaint he had made ""on a specific bullying issue"" going back 18 months that, he said, ""no decisive action"" had been taken on. He said he intended to remain MP for Birkenhead, as an independent Labour MP, adding: ""Few events would give me greater pleasure than to apply to the Parliamentary Labour Party for the whip. ""But great changes in the leadership's stance on the issues outlined in this letter will need to take place before I will be able to do so."" Iain Watson: Can Labour detoxify anti-Semitism row? Jeremy Corbyn apologises for hurt caused by anti-Semitism Later he told BBC News that his decision was intended as a ""wake-up call to the Labour Party"" and he had not spoken to other Labour MPs about it: ""It is not part of a wider plot, Jeremy will see us into the next election."" Asked if he was ""jumping before being pushed"" following the confidence vote, he replied: ""No, they're 30-odd people who voted against me... the idea that 30-odd people could decide the fate of what will be the choice that Labour Party voters get next time is absurd."" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson described Mr Field's resignation as a ""serious loss to the party"" which ""reflects both the deep divisions in the party and the sense of drift engulfing us"". He added: ""It is a major wake up call. We cannot afford to lose people of such weight and stature."" But backbench Labour MP Chris Williamson told BBC Newsnight: ""He's obviously lost the confidence of his members and he's now getting his excuses in, it seems to me, and throwing around grotesque slurs that have no basis in reality - and that is a very regrettable end to Frank's long career in the House of Commons."" And Labour's Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said Mr Field should face a by-election. He tweeted: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He had a spell as welfare reform minister after Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997, but his brief to ""think the unthinkable"" ended with his resignation a year later. Since then he has been a backbencher, and has chaired the Commons Work and Pensions Committee for the past three years. Mr Field said he expected Jeremy Corbyn to lead the party into the next election Perhaps the biggest question raised by Frank Field's resignation from Labour's group at Westminster is: Will there be more? Could this even be the beginning of a much wider schism, taking some of the significant minority of Labour MPs who oppose Jeremy Corbyn, not just over the issue of anti-Semitism but wider political issues including Europe, over the edge? The stresses and strains in the party over anti-Semitism, over Europe and in particular the idea of a fresh referendum - a so-called People's Vote - on Brexit will dominate Labour's annual conference in Liverpool in late September. Talk of a new centrist grouping in politics has been rumbling for months. But those dissident MPs have, so far, been deeply reluctant to translate their private dissent into open insurrection. They say it's about deep-rooted loyalty. Their enemies say it's a lack of nerve. Both loyalty and nerve will be tested in the coming days and weeks. Last month, Mr Field lost a confidence vote by his constituency party after voting with the government over Brexit plans. In his letter to Nick Brown, Mr Field complained that intimidation and intolerance were now ""sadly manifest within my own Constituency Labour Party"" and referred to a complaint he had made ""on a specific bullying issue"" going back 18 months that, he said, ""no decisive action"" had been taken on. He said he intended to remain MP for Birkenhead, as an independent Labour MP, adding: ""Few events would give me greater pleasure than to apply to the Parliamentary Labour Party for the whip. ""But great changes in the leadership's stance on the issues outlined in this letter will need to take place before I will be able to do so."" Iain Watson: Can Labour detoxify anti-Semitism row? Jeremy Corbyn apologises for hurt caused by anti-Semitism Later he told BBC News that his decision was intended as a ""wake-up call to the Labour Party"" and he had not spoken to other Labour MPs about it: ""It is not part of a wider plot, Jeremy will see us into the next election."" Asked if he was ""jumping before being pushed"" following the confidence vote, he replied: ""No, they're 30-odd people who voted against me... the idea that 30-odd people could decide the fate of what will be the choice that Labour Party voters get next time is absurd."" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson described Mr Field's resignation as a ""serious loss to the party"" which ""reflects both the deep divisions in the party and the sense of drift engulfing us"". He added: ""It is a major wake up call. We cannot afford to lose people of such weight and stature."" But backbench Labour MP Chris Williamson told BBC Newsnight: ""He's obviously lost the confidence of his members and he's now getting his excuses in, it seems to me, and throwing around grotesque slurs that have no basis in reality - and that is a very regrettable end to Frank's long career in the House of Commons."" And Labour's Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said Mr Field should face a by-election. He tweeted: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former Conservative Party chairman Lord Pickles was among Conservatives who praised Mr Field, writing on Twitter: ""Massive blow to Labour. Well respected in Parliament and by the public."" Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. A 2016 inquiry, carried out by Shami Chakrabarti, concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Recently, the focus has been on a new code of conduct the party has adopted on anti-Semitism, with critics concerned that it does not go as far as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines. Earlier this month, Mr Corbyn again apologised for hurt caused to Jewish people by anti-Semitism in his party and admitted Labour had been too slow in dealing with disciplinary cases. Mr Corbyn also stressed that people who hold anti-Semitic views ""have no place in the Labour Party"" and said people who use ""anti-Semitic poison"" are not his supporters, nor do they speak for him or the party.

"Trump threatens to pull US out of WTOThe US president says he will abandon the global trade body ""if they don't shape up"".US & Canada","Mr Trump has been embroiled in tit-for-tat trade battles on several fronts in recent months President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw the US from the World Trade Organization (WTO), claiming it treats his country unfairly. ""If they don't shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO,""Mr Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News,external. The WTO was established to provide rules for global trade and resolve disputes between countries. Mr Trump says the body too often rules against the US, although he concedes it has won some recent judgments. He claimed on Fox News earlier this year that the WTO was set up ""to benefit everybody but us"", adding: ""We lose the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits in the WTO."" However,some analysis shows the US wins about 90% when it is the complainant,externaland loses about the same percentage when it is complained against. Mr Trump's warning about a possible US pull-out from the WTO highlights the conflict between his protectionist trade policies and the open trade system that the WTO oversees. US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Is Trump the WTO's biggest threat? Is Trump right about trade? Washington has recently blocked the appointment of new judges to the WTO's Geneva-based dispute settlement body, which could potentially paralyse its ability to issue judgments. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has also accused the WTO of interfering with US sovereignty. It comes as President Trump set a Friday deadline for Canada to sign a new agreement with the US and Mexico. He has threatened to tax the country's automotive sector or cut it out entirely. The US president has been sounding off about unfair trade since even before he became president. Mr Trump said on Thursday that the 1994 agreement to establish the WTO ""was the single worst trade deal ever made"". The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts in recent months. The one creating the most interest is with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence. Mr Trump has introduced tariffs on a number of goods imported into the US. Early victims of Trump's trade war What is a trade war and should I worry? Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war A third round of tariffs on $200bn (Â£154bn) of Chinese goods could come as soon as a public-comment period concludes next week, according to a Bloomberg report citing various sources. Asked to confirm this during the Bloomberg interview, President Trump said that it was ""not totally wrong"". China has responded to US tariffs by imposing retaliatory taxes on the same value of US products and has filed complaints against the tariffs at the WTO. China's commerce ministry has said it ""clearly suspects"" the US of violating WTO rules. An initial complaint at the WTO was filed by China in July after Mr Trump imposed his first round of tariffs. This video can not be played Donald Trump speaks with the Mexican leader on the phone through an interpreter The WTO is at the heart of the system of rules for international trade.  It is the forum for sorting disputes between countries about breaches of global trade rules and for negotiating new trade liberalisation. The EU, meanwhile, is trying to steer the US towards reforming the WTO rather than abandoning it. Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's trade committee, told Politico magazine that it would submit plans to overhaul the organisation in September,external. He said it would test whether the US was really interested in reform. ""This is certainly about calling [America's] bluff,"" he said. Mr Trump has not been a fan of multilateral trade agreements. In a 2016 presidential debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump described the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico and Canada as ""the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere"" and a ""killer"" of US jobs. Once in office he said he wanted to renegotiate - not scrap - the accord, triggering a year of talks. On Monday, Mr Trump announced that the US and Mexico had agreed to revamp Nafta, calling it a ""really good deal"" that was ""much more fair"" for both countries. Canada is yet to agree to the new terms. Clock is ticking for Canada in US trade negotiations What is Nafta? What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? On Thursday, Mr Lighthizer held talks in Washington with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland aimed at reaching a new deal. Following four separate meetings, which continued late into the night, Ms Freeland told reporters that a deal could not be reached, adding that talks would resume on Friday. Also during his election campaign Mr Trump railed against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation trade deal that was a linchpin of former President Barack Obama's Asia policy. Mr Trump said the deal was a ""potential disaster for our country"". One of his first acts as president was to withdraw the US from the TTP, althoughhe has since said he might consider rejoiningif the terms were ""substantially better"".

Mr Trump's clash with Mr Bernstein comes as fellow-Watergate reporter Bob Woodward is set to release a book next month detailing life inside the Trump White House. US man 'threatened to shoot' reporters Mr Bernstein co-wrote an article that had multiple anonymous sources claiming Cohen said the president was aware of the June 2016 meeting. That meeting involved Mr Trump's son, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. In the27 July article,external, CNN stated Mr Davis had declined to comment, and quoted multiple anonymous sources. The next day, the Washington Post also reported on the claims and cited Mr Davis as a source. On Monday, however, Mr Davis confirmed toBuzzfeed News,externalthat he was CNN's anonymous source and retracted his claims. ""I made a mistake,"" he said, adding that he should have been clearer to reporters that he could not personally verify the information he gave. When Mr Davis appeared on CNN with presenter Anderson Cooper, last week, he said ""the reporting of the story got mixed up"". CNN stands by its story. Trump supporters argue Mr Davis' statements undermine the original article. Cohen's case has stoked speculation he could testify against Mr Trump in Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling two years ago in the US elections. He pleaded guilty to eight counts of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance crimes last week.

No charges for 'slave auction' studentsTwo boys are understood to have chained a black student to a lamppost.Somerset,"The school, which has more than 1,300 pupils, was rated as inadequate by Ofsted after an inspection in July. No criminal action will be taken against two pupils understood to have chained a black student to a lamppost in a ""mock slave auction"". The Crown Prosecution Service said it had enough evidence to charge one of the boys but Avon and Somerset Police suggested a Community Resolution. It is used for less serious crimes and involved the boys admitting their part in what happened and apologising. The incident took place at Beechen Cliff School in Bath in January. In a statement, Avon and Somerset Police said they would continue to try to stamp out offences motivated by prejudice or hate. ""We take hate crime extremely seriously and recognise the devastating impact it can have on victims and their lives,"" it said. ""There's no room for this type of crime in Avon and Somerset."" The schoolwas rated as inadequate by Ofstedafter an inspection in July. Ofsted found staff had failed to report the case and that their response to it was ""insufficient and too slow"". The chair and deputy chair of the board of governors resigned last month. Head teacher Andrew Davies said an action plan has been put in place to raise standards at the school.
