YouTube faces legal battle over children's privacy,"YouTube is facing a legal battle for allegedly breaching the privacy and data rights of under-13s in the UK. A claim lodged with the High Court against parent company Google accuses the firm of collecting children's data without parental consent. Privacy expert Duncan McCann, who is bringing the action, argues this is a breach of UK and European (EU) law. A YouTube spokesperson said it does not comment on pending litigation and the platform is not for use by under-13s. Mr McCann, a father of three children under the age of 13, believes that if the case is successful, damages of between Â£100 and Â£500 could be payable to those whose data was breached. ""When the internet first emerged, we used to be worried about how children used the internet, said Mr McCann. ""That is still a problem, but now it's a two-way street. We need to focus on how the internet is using our children, and ask ourselves if we're comfortable with them becoming a product for these digital platforms?"" ""That's the future I don't want,"" he added. Community captions 'benefit everyone' YouTube video removals doubled during lockdown He told the BBC that the class action is the first in Europe brought against a technology firm on behalf of children. He says that estimated damages of more than Â£2bn are being sought for about five million British children as well as their parents or guardians. He will argue that YouTube and Google have breached the UK's Data Protection Act and the EU's General Data Protection Regulations. The case will focus on children who have watched YouTube since May 2018, when the new Data Protection Act became law. ""I think we're at the stage, where the only way we can move forward and hold these companies accountable is through the legal process,"" Mr McCann said. A YouTube spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on pending litigation. YouTube is not for children under the age of 13. ""We launched the YouTube Kids app as a dedicated destination for kids and have made further changes that allow us to better protect kids and families on YouTube,"" they added. The video platform has also previously said that it does not sell its users' personal information to advertising companies. The case is not expected before next autumn. Mr McCann also told the BBC that it will also depend on the outcome of another data and privacy case being brought against Google. Campaign group Foxglove and law firm Hausfeld have also said they would support Mr McCann's case.

British chip designer ARM sold to US firm Nvidia,"UK-based computer chip designer ARM Holdings is being sold to the American graphics chip specialist Nvidia. The deal values ARM at $40bn (Â£31.2bn), four years after it was bought by Japanese conglomerate Softbank for $32bn. ARM's technology is at the heart of most smartphones, among many other devices. Nvidia has promised,externalto keep the business based in the UK, to hire more staff, and to retain ARM's brand. It added that the deal would create ""the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence"" (AI). ""ARM will remain headquartered in Cambridge,"" said Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang. ""We will expand on this great site and build a world-class AI research facility, supporting developments in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars and other fields."" This video can not be played WATCH: Nvidia chief explains why he wants to buy ARM A number of business leaders have signed anopen letter calling on the Prime Minister to stop the merger,external. A senior government source told the BBC that it would not block the sale, but said conditions could be imposed on the takeover. Softbank made commitments to secure jobs and keep ARM's headquarters in the UK until September next year. ""So far, when you read the announcement coming from Nvidia they said they will honour that Softbank has made at the time,"" said Sonja Laud, chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management. ""But with the expiry about to happen and obviously the Brexit negotiations under way it will be very interesting to see how this develops in the future."" This appears to address concerns that British jobs would be lost and decision-making shifted to the US. Last week,the Labour Party had urged the government to intervene. But two of ARM's co-founders have raised other issues about the takeover. Hermann Hauser and Tudor Brown had suggested ARM should remain ""neutral"", rather than be owned by a company like Nvidia, which produces its own processors. The concern is that there would be a conflict of interest since ARM's clients would become dependent on a business with which many also compete for sales. Moreover, the two co-founders also claimed that once ARM was owned by an American firm, Washington could try to block Chinese companies from using its knowhow as part of a wider trade clash between the countries. Hermann Hauser (left) and Tudor Brown (right) have warned the takeover would have negative consequences ""If ARM becomes a US subsidiary of a US company, it falls under the Cfius [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] regulations,"" Mr Hauser told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""[That] means that if hundreds of UK companies that incorporate ARM's [technology] in their products, want to sell it, and export it to anywhere in the world including China - which is a major market - the decision on whether they will be allowed to export it will be made in the White House and not in Downing Street."" He added that he believed the pledge to retain and increase the number of UK jobs was ""meaningless"" unless UK ministers stepped in to make it legally enforceable. ARM: Can 'crown jewel' of UK technology be protected? ARM's sale could put tech sector 'in jeopardy' Chinese chip giant 'in shock' after US trade ban threat But ARM's chief executive played down the threat of export bans. ""It isn't to do with the ownership of the company, it's all to do with analysis of the product itself,"" Simon Segars told the BBC. ""The majority of our products are designed in the UK or outside the US, and the majority of our products don't fall under much of the US export control set of rules."" Mr Huang added that ARM had ""some of the finest computer scientists in the world"" in Cambridge and he intended to both retain them and attract others to what would become Nvidia's largest site in Europe. The UK prime minister's spokesman said ""ministers have spoken to both companies"", adding that the government would be scrutinising the deal ""including what it means for the Cambridge HQ"". ARM creates computer chip designs that others then customise to their own ends. It also develops instruction sets, which define how software controls processors. It is based in Cambridge but also has offices across the world, including a joint venture in Shenzhen, China. Hundreds of companies license its innovations including Apple, Samsung, Huawei and Qualcomm. To date, ARM says 180 billion chips have been made based on its solutions. When Softbank acquired ARM, it promised to keep the company's headquarters in the UK and to increase the number of local jobs, which it did. Softbank's founder Masayoshi Son described the firm as being a ""crystal ball"" that would help him predict where tech was heading. But losses on other investments, including the office rental company WeWork, prompted a rethink. California-headquartered Nvidia overtook Intel to become the world's most valuable chipmaker in July. Until now, it has specialised in high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). These are commonly used by gamers to deliver more detailed visuals, as well as by professionals for tasks including scientific research, machine learning, and cryptocurrency ""mining"". Nvidia is also one of ARM's clients, using its designs to create its line-up of Tegra central processing units (CPUs). Under the terms of the deal, Nvidia will pay Softbank $21.5bn in its own stock and $12bn in cash. It will follow with up to a further $5bn in cash or stock if certain targets are met. Nvidia will also issue $1.5bn in equity to ARM's employees. Mr Huang has already said that one of the changes he wants to make is to accelerate development of ARM's designs for CPUs used in computer servers - a rapidly growing sector. Amazon is amongcompanies that are already betting on the tech,external. The use of internet-based services has led to ever-growing demand for computer servers But experts say one risk Nvidia faces is that the takeover could encourage ARM's wider client list to shift focus to a rival type of chip technology, which lags behind in terms of adoption but has the benefit of not being controlled by one company. ""ARM is facing growing competition from RISC-V, an open-source architecture,""wrote CCS Insight's Geoff Blaber in a recent research note,external. ""If its partners believed that ARM's integrity and independence was compromised, it would accelerate the growth of RISC-V and in the process devalue ARM."" Mr Blaber also suggested regulators might block the deal. ""This process will take months if not years with a high chance of failure,"" he told the BBC. Mr Huang has said that he expects it to take more than a year to ""educate"" regulators and answer all their questions, but said he had ""every confidence"" they would ultimately approve the investment. It's a deal which the man who founded ARM says is a disaster. And many in the UK's technology industry will agree with Hermann Hauser. He opposed the 2016 sale of the chip designer to Softbank but accepted that the Japanese firm stood by its guarantees to boost employment and research in Cambridge. But a takeover by Nvidia, one of the many firms that licences ARM's designs, appears to pose a threat to its business model - why will its hundreds of other customers now have faith that they will have equal access to its technology? In recent days leading figures in the Cambridge technology sector have lobbied Downing Street, calling for ministers to intervene to bring ARM back under UK ownership. There have been signs that the government is considering a more active industrial policy. Dominic Cummings, who has talked of the need for the UK to have a trillion dollar tech company, is leading the drive for a more interventionist approach. Now, with Hermann Hauser and others warning that this deal will make Britain a US vassal state, the government is under pressure to step in and ensure that control over vital home-grown technology is not lost to a foreign power.

Israel announces second national virus lockdown,"Israel - with a population of nine million - has been seeing some 4,000 new cases a day Israel is to impose a new national lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus - with tough restrictions coming into effect on Jewish new year. The country's second lockdown begins on Friday and lasts at least three weeks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the measures would ""exact a heavy price on us all"", but the country faced a surge with 4,000 new daily infections. A minister has resigned to protest against the restrictions that overlap with important Jewish festivals. Housing Minister Yaakov Litzman, who leads an ultra-Orthodox Jewish party, said the measures would prevent Jewish people from celebrating their religious festivals, including Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, on 27 September. He also threatened to pull his party out of the governing coalition. The country has seen 1,108 deaths from Covid-19 and more than 153,000 confirmed infections, according to a global tally kept by US university Johns Hopkins. Israel, which has a population of about nine million, has reported more than 3,000 new cases a day in recent weeks. This video can not be played Recovered Covid-19 patients volunteer in Israel pilot In a televised address on Sunday, the prime minister said this had grown to 4,000 daily. The measures he announced will be the most extensive imposed in Israel since the first lockdown, which ran from late March until early May, and include: No more than 10 people can meet indoors while groups of 20 are allowed outdoors Schools and shopping centres will close, and Israelis must stay within 500 metres of their homes with the exception of travelling to workplaces Non-governmental offices and businesses can stay open but must not accept customers However supermarkets and pharmacies can remain open to the public. Mr Netanyahu acknowledged the disruption the lockdown would cause to Jewish communities celebrating religious holidays that normally see families come together. ""This is not the kind of holiday we are used to. And we certainly won't be able to celebrate with our extended families,"" he said. The restrictions on indoor gatherings will severely impact prayers in synagogues. The second lockdown will cost the economy, which is in recession due to the pandemic, an estimated 6.5bn shekels ($1.88bn), the finance ministry says. Mr Litzman said in his resignation letter on Friday: ""This wrongs and scorns hundreds of thousands of citizens. ""Where were you until now? Why have the Jewish holidays become a convenient address for tackling the coronavirus?"" Yaakov Litzman said the lockdown would prevent Orthodox Jews from being able to celebrate religious festivals Interior Minister Aryeh Deri - who leads another ultra-Orthodox party - said in a video posted on Twitter that he supported the planned restrictions, and that not abiding by them would be tantamount to murder. Addressing the cabinet as it convened to vote on the lockdown on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said he regretted Mr Litzman's resignation. He added: ""We have to move on, to make the decisions necessary for Israel in the coronavirus era, and that is what we will do in this session."" This video can not be played Many ultra-Orthodox Jews opposed Israel's first lockdown Mr Netanyahu has faced criticism for his handling of the outbreak. Critics say his failure to tackle the virus effectively has led to another national lockdown. Many nations are experiencing second surges of the virus.

Chancellor urged to 'stand by working families',"The Trades Union Congress made a direct appeal to the chancellor on Monday The TUC's leader is asking for government action to avert ""mass unemployment"" amid the pandemic. Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances O'Grady has told its annual meeting the chancellor must ""stand by working families"" as the furlough scheme nears its end. She said: ""If the government doesn't act, we face a tsunami of job losses."" A government spokesperson said supporting jobs was ""an absolute priority"". Under the government's furlough scheme, workers placed on leave have been able to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Take-up has been significant,with 9.6 million workers furloughed since March.,external The scheme is due to finish at the end of October andChancellor Rishi Sunakhas repeatedly ruled out an extension to it. Speaking at the trade union body's congress in London on Monday, Ms O'Grady said time is running out to prevent huge job losses as the job retention scheme (JRS) comes to a close: ""Millions of livelihoods were saved [by the scheme] - both employees and the self-employed. From this Thursday, it will be just 45 days before the JRS ends. ""That's the notice period that companies have to give if they intend to make mass redundancies. The TUC also called for a new ""job protection and skills deal"" ""Rishi Sunak, stand by working families - don't walk away. It's so much better to keep people working, paying their taxes, spending and helping to rebuild the economy."" Furlough wind down: 'We prepared for the worst' Extend furlough scheme 'or risk second wave of job cuts' What happens when the furlough scheme ends? The trade unions body is also calling for a new ""job protection and skills deal"", which would include mandatory training and ""up-skilling"" for workers placed on furlough, for example. A government spokesperson said: ""Supporting jobs is an absolute priority which is why we've set out a comprehensive 'Plan for Jobs' to protect, create and support jobs across the UK by providing significant, targeted support where it is needed the most. ""We are continuing to support livelihoods and incomes through our Â£2bn Kickstart scheme, creating incentives for training and apprenticeships, a Â£1,000 retention bonus for businesses that can bring furloughed employees back to work, and doubling the number of frontline work coaches to help people find work.

Killer drivers could face life sentences,"Drivers who kill others after speeding, racing or using a phone could receive life sentences under new legislation. Those who cause death by careless driving under the influence of drink or drugs could also get a life sentence. The current maximum sentence for each crime is 14 years. The sentencing reforms announced this week will be introduced in Parliament early next year. A new offence of causing serious injury by careless driving is also being proposed. Currently, without that specific offence, drivers who cause injuries under such circumstances can only be convicted of careless driving - which has the maximum penalty of a fine. Theproposed law change was first announced in 2017, with Monday's announcement setting a timescale for when the legislation would come into force. The increase will apply to offences in England, Scotland and Wales, but not Northern Ireland, which has separate road safety laws. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland - also the Lord Chancellor - said: ""This government has been clear that punishments must fit the crime, but too often families tell us this isn't the case with killer drivers. ""So, today I am announcing that we will bring forward legislation early next year to introduce life sentences for dangerous drivers who kill on our roads, and ensure they feel the full force of the law."" The new legislation forms part of major sentencing reforms being announced in a White Paper this week. Teenagers convicted of murder in England and Walescould also receive whole-life terms under the proposals. This order means the criminal is kept in prison for the rest of their life without ever becoming eligible for parole. With a life sentence, a prisoner is given a number of years they must spend in jail after which they will be eligible to apply for parole. Last year, 174 people were sentenced for causing death by dangerous driving A consultation carried out in 2016 gave support for the new driving offence measures from victims, road safety campaigners and people who had lost loved ones. Of the 9,000 who responded, 90% thought there should be a new offence of causing serious injury by careless driving. In addition, 70% of those who responded agreed the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving should be increased to life imprisonment. Last year, 174 people were sentenced for causing death by dangerous driving, and another 19 for causing death by careless driving while under the influence.

Wind warning prompts fears for US West Coast fires,"The Almeda fire, which caused this damage, is only 50% contained The US National Weather Service has issued a ""red flag warning"" for areas of the West Coast, as high winds threaten to spread devastating wildfires still further. Gusts of up to 40 mph (64 km/h) are expected in parts of southern Oregon, with no rain. Fires have been raging for three weeks in Oregon, California and Washington, burning land and destroying homes. Tens of thousands of people have had to flee and at least 33 have died. Dozens of people are missing in Oregon alone, with one emergency official saying the state should be preparing for a ""mass fatality incident"". Cooler, moister conditions on Saturday allowed firefighters to make some progress with the fires. However,the forecast for Sunday prompted a warning of winds,externalof 15-25 mph and gusts of 30-40 mph in the Shasta Valley and east of the Southern Oregon cascades. A red flag warning is the highest alert for events which could result in major fires, and which demands extreme caution by residents. This area includes Jackson County, Oregon, where the Almeda fire has destroyed hundreds of homes and remains only 50% contained.

Jobs 'crisis' twice as bad as previous recession,"A number of household names have announced redundancy plans since the pandemic began Employers in Britain are planning more than twice as many redundancies than they did at the height of the last recession, new figures show. About 180,000 job cuts were planned from January to March 2009, while 380,000 were planned from May to July this year. Completed redundancies could reach 735,000 this autumn, researchers say. The figures were obtained by an Institute for Employment Studies (IES) Freedom of Information request. Social distancing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 brought large parts of the UK economy to a standstill, forcing workers to stay at home, closing shops and bringing transport to a halt. As a result, many businesses have been forced to consider reducing their workforces by making employees redundant. Employers in England, Scotland and Wales must notify the Insolvency Service if they plan to make 20 or more workers redundant in any single ""establishment"" using a form called HR1. This information is not usually published, but on 8 September aFreedom of Information request by the BBCrevealed that employers had listed more than 380,000 positions as at risk between May and July 2020. The IES has now obtained and analysed data stretching back as far as 2008. This shows that the current redundancy wave is more than double the previous three-monthly peak of 180,000 from January to March 2009. Then the crisis, which had begun in the finance industry, was affecting most of the economy - and forcing many employers to reduce their staff. ""Comparing what is happening now with what was happening in the last recession shows us we are experiencing a jobs crisis unlike anything we have seen before,"" said Tony Wilson, Director of the IES. The IES is calling for extra support for viable firms to help them retain staff, as well as training and advice to help those who lose their jobs find new employment rapidly. A government spokesperson said: ""Supporting jobs is an absolute priority which is why we've set out a comprehensive 'Plan for Jobs' to protect, create and support jobs across the UK by providing significant, targeted support where it is needed the most."" Have you been furloughed and subsequently lost your job? Get in touch with us. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Government measures include the Â£2bn ""kickstart scheme"" to encourage employers to create new training placements and apprenticeships, extra work coaches in job centres, and a Â£1,000 incentive to encourage employers to bring staff back from furlough. Because they are filed at the start of the redundancy process, HR1 forms give an early indication of what is happening in the labour market. The HR1 redundancy figures don't pick up employers cutting fewer than 20 jobs, so the final total of redundancies is usually higher. The Office for National Statistics also publishes a redundancy count based on the Labour Force Survey, which is used to calculate the monthly unemployment rate. This is always published a few months after the data is gathered, so it hasn't yet picked up a big spike in redundancies or unemployment. However, Labour Force Survey redundancy figures have been around 20% higher than HR1 figures in recent years. On this basis, the IES estimates that 445,000 jobs could be made redundant between July and September, considerably worse than the three-month peak in the previous recession. During that recession, however, actual redundancies were 80% higher than notified redundancies - which could lead to as many as 735,000 positions being cut at the height of the coronavirus crisis. However, companies sometimes announce plans redundancies which they don't actually make, because circumstances change. Early 2019, for example, saw a big spike in redundancy plans which were never completed. Mr Wilson believes they could have been linked tofears of a no-deal Brexit, which did not happen. The 2018 spike could be linked to the collapse of theconstruction company Carillion, which had a lesser impact on jobs than initially feared. Companies in Northern Ireland file HR1 forms with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and they are not included in these figures.

Melbourne police arrest 74 at lockdown protest,"About 250 people attended the illegal protests More than 70 people have been arrested in Melbourne, Australia, for flouting the state's stay-at-home orders to attend an anti-lockdown protest. About 250 people went to the illegal protest - the second one this weekend. Police said ""many protestors were aggressive and threatened violence towards officers"". The demonstrations come as the state of Victoria prepares to ease its lockdown restrictions, which have been in place since early July. Victoria has been the epicentre of Australia's Covid-19 outbreak, accounting for 75% of cases and 90% of deaths. Why is Melbourne seeing more cases during lockdown? Australia 'anti-lockdown' arrest stirs controversy 'I grew up in a war - I'm not dying in a pandemic' The state has extended a state of disaster for another month, giving the police extra powers to enforce public health orders. Victoria's State Parliament building has also been forced to close ""until further notice"" after a security guard tested positive for the virus. Australia has had a total of 26,600 confirmed cases and more than 800 deaths from the virus. The two demonstrations were promoted in social media groups dedicated to sharing conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic. On Sunday, about 250 people gathered at the central Queen Victoria market, and demanded an end to lockdown in the city. They were met with a heavy police presence, and clashes broke out. Police said they arrested 74 people at Sunday's protest, and fined 176 others. On Saturday they had arrested 14 people. Police said many protesters were ""aggressive and threatened violence"" The force added in a statement that a man believed to be a ""primary agitator"" is facing charges of incitement, while another was charged with assaulting police. Last weekend, protesters - including some conspiracy theorists - held ""Freedom Day"" events across Australia to rally against what they labelled the country's ""overblown"" response to the pandemic. While delivering his coronavirus update on Saturday, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said the protesters were ""selfish, unlawful and wrong"". ""It's not smart, it's not right ... it's not the time for protest,"" he said. ""No one has the right to make choices like that, that potentially puts at risk everything we are working towards."" While the entire state of Victoria has been in lockdown since early July, Melbourne - the state's capital - has been under tighter restrictions. From Monday, some restrictions in Melbourne are being lifted gradually. People in the city can exercise outdoors for two hours, and people who live alone can form small ""social bubbles"" that allow one person to visit their home. From 28 September, people will be allowed to exercise outdoors with a personal trainer and one other person. GLOBAL TRACKER:The world's hotspots VACCINE:When will we have one? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The curfew will also be reduced by an hour from Monday, and will be in place from 21:00 to 05:00. Previously, it began at 20:00. If there are fewer than five new cases per day, the curfew and exercise limits will be lifted on 26 October. On Sunday, Mr Andrews said the state couldn't afford to reopen too quickly. ""No one is enjoying the reality we face, but none of us have the option of ignoring the reality that we face,"" he said. ""We cannot open up now and stay open. It would not be safe, it would not be smart."" There's currently an inquiry into failings within Victoria's hotel quarantine system, which has been linked to many of the cases in the state's second wave. Mr Andrews has now confirmed that he will appear before the inquiry to answer questions on 23 September. He set up the inquiry and has previously said he, as Premier, ultimately holds responsibility for the scheme. Why is Melbourne seeing more cases during lockdown?

Restaurants at 'critical risk' of eviction,"Food firms have written to the government asking for support as a stand-off with landlords looms over rent holidays. Companies such as Deliveroo called for a targeted extension of the commercial evictions ban, which was introduced at the height of the pandemic. Revo, which represents landlords, said well-known firms were ""getting away with not paying their rent"". The government said it was ""working closely"" with landlords and tenants. In April the governmentintroduced a moratorium on evictionsfor non-payment of rent, which was then extended until 30 September. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, chief executives of these firms called for a targeted extension of the rent holiday for restaurants in city centres and for those in areas under lockdown. ""There is a critical risk that many restaurants will face eviction proceedings from 1 October,"" the signatories said. UK economy continues recovery in July Furlough 'must be extended and targeted', say MPs The bosses, including Will Shu of Deliveroo, Alasdair Murdoch, the UK chief executive of Burger King, and Julian Metcalfe of Itsu, also said landlords should not be able to claim full back-rent when the moratorium ends. Instead, rent arrears repayments should be spread across 12 months, they said. Will Shu of Deliveroo was one of the signatories of the letter ""From our experiences of negotiations with landlords, around 30% have indicated their intention to evict, issue final demands for full payment, or otherwise indicated they will not support any restructure of Covid-19-incurred rent debt,"" the signatories said. In addition, they asked for tax breaks for empty properties to be changed to discourage evictions. But Revo, an industry body for commercial landlords, said: ""The blanket moratorium means strongly backed, well known High Street companies are getting away with not paying their rent."" Vivienne King, chief executive of Revo, said that ""this is at the cost of vulnerable occupiers, since the revenue shortfall makes it that much harder for property owners to support those occupiers in genuine need."" She added that any extensions to rent holidays should not be funded by the private sector. ""The moratoria were meant to be short-term, emergency measures to protect businesses at a time when they could not trade. They too have served their purpose,"" she said. Who should foot the rent bill during the pandemic is a Mexican stand-off between the businesses who are struggling and their landlords who've got bills to pay, including mortgage payments to their banks. Will Shu - the founder and chief executive of Deliveroo, which delivers food from 35,000 UK restaurants - says the pandemic means restaurants and landlords are ""in it together"" and that ""landlords understand that without these tenants it's a very different situation on the High Street"". But clearly not all do. Rent negotiations are incredibly complex, especially for restaurant chains with multiple outlets and thus multiple landlords. This is because landlords come in all shapes and sizes, from the big funds which use property to pay our pensions to individuals who rely on the rental income. Landlords argue that without the stick of eviction, tenants have a free pass to not pay up, even when they can, and that changing the rules in this way undermines the UK's reputation as a safe place to invest. As the next quarter's rent bill looms and the eviction ban expires at the end of this month, this debate is a ticking time bomb. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the huge challenges faced by commercial tenants and landlords during this period and we're working closely with them to ensure they are supported. ""We've taken unprecedented action to protect jobs and livelihoods, with a package of around Â£160bn of support, including loans, rates relief and grants for businesses."" Some landlords and commercial tenants have managed to come to agreements, and tenants should pay what they can under a government code of practice. Government loans are available to landlords along with VAT and rates deferrals, the spokesperson added.

Brexit bill powers 'insurance policy' for UK,"This video can not be played Robert Buckland: ""If I see the rule of law being broken in a way that I find unacceptable then of course I will go"" Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has defended plans to potentially override the EU Withdrawal Agreement as an emergency Brexit ""insurance policy"". He told the BBC he hoped powers being sought by ministers in the Internal Market Bill would never be needed, as a solution could be found with the EU. He said he would resign if the UK ended up breaking international law ""in a way I find unacceptable"". But he made clear he did ""not believe we will get to that stage"". The UK has insisted there must be no new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain when it leaves the EU's single market and customs union on 1 January. UK 'behaving in extraordinary way' over Brexit Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? The Internal Market Bill, to be debated by MPs on Monday, would give ministers the power to reduce the amount of paperwork that Northern Irish firms have to fill in on goods bound for the mainland, such as export and exit declarations, or to remove the need for them entirely. It would also allow the UK to modify or re-interpret ""state aid"" rules on subsidies for firms in Northern Ireland, in the event of the two sides not agreeing a future trade deal. It is controversial because it would change the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a crucial part of the legally-binding Withdrawal Agreement agreed by both sides prior to the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the EU is interpreting the Protocol in a way that would impose a customs border in the Irish Sea, separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU could not have been ""clearer"" when the two sides agreed the Brexit withdrawal agreement last year what the implications would be for Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Buckland said the government would only invoke the powers in the Bill if the two sides could not reach agreement through their dispute resolution process and if the EU then went on to act in an ""unreasonable"" way. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves: ""It's the wrong thing to do for our moral standing in the world"" ""I believe with our determination to seek an agreement, we will get a position where we don't need to invoke these provisions. This is all about insurance planning, if you like, a break-the-glass-in-an-emergency provision"". He acknowledged there was a ""dichotomy"" between the UK's positions in domestic and international law but insisted he believed these would be resolved. Pressed on whether he would quit if the UK did end up breaking international law, he replied: ""If I see the rule of law being broken in a way which I find unacceptable, then of course I will go. We are not at that stage."" He added: ""I don't believe we will get to that stage. I know in my mind what we have to do... We have to resolve any conflict and that is what we will do."" But Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said the UK would be ""reneging"" on legally-binding commitments if the bill passed and rejected as ""completely bogus"" claims the Withdrawal Agreement was a threat to its territorial integrity and the Northern Irish peace process. A further rift has opened up between the UK and EUover the issue of food exports to the continentfrom 1 January - when the current post-Brexit transition period ends. Mr Barnier said it was not true the EU was threatening to effectively block products of animal origin from crossing the channel by withholding the ""third country"" licence granted to nations outside the bloc.

However, his British counterpart David Frost said the UK had not been given a guarantee that trade would continue as now.

Although the government has a comfortable majority of 80 in the House of Commons, it is facing a rebellion from Tory backbenchers over the Internal Market Bill, and its passage through the Lords is far from guaranteed. Pressure is mounting on those Conservative MPs who are sceptical about the legislation to oppose it in the Commons as well, with former prime ministersTony Blair and Sir John Majorcalling it ""shaming and embarrassing"". Labour's Brexit spokeswoman, Rachel Reeves, told the BBC the party could not support the bill ""as it stands"" because it would be ""deliberately and consciously breaking international law"". She told the Andrew Marr programme it would be ""counter-productive"" to the UK trying to achieve a free trade agreement with the EU and others around the world. He added: ""I don't believe we will get to that stage. I know in my mind what we have to do... We have to resolve any conflict and that is what we will do."" A 'third country' basically refers to any country outside the EU, and in this case outside its economic structures - the single market and the customs union. Businesses in a third country have to fill in customs declarations, for example, when they import from and export to the EU - whether there is a trade agreement or not. The EU also has a formal list of third countries that are approved for food imports - this is what third country listing means. The UK government says the EU is threatening not to put the UK on that list. And because under the terms of the EU withdrawal agreement Northern Ireland will stay within the rules of the EU single market, but the rest of the UK will not, that could mean no food imports from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU says it is not refusing to put the UK on the third country list - it says it is simply waiting to find out what the UK's import rules will be before it makes a decision. The row over third country listing has become linked to the row over the government's Internal Market Bill, even though the proposed legislation doesn't mention third country listing directly.

NHS tells GPs to offer face-to-face appointments,"GP practices are being told they must make sure patients can be seen face to face when they need such appointments. NHS England is writing to all practices to make sure they are communicating the fact doctors can be seen in person if necessary, as well as virtually. It's estimated half of the 102 million appointments from March to July were by video or phone call, NHS Digital said. The Royal College of GPs said any implication GPs had not been doing their job properly was ""an insult"". NHS England said research suggested nearly two thirds of the public were happy to have a phone or video call with their doctor - but that, ahead of winter, they wanted to make sure people knew they could see their GP if needed. Nikki Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, said GPs had adapted quickly in recent months to offer remote consultations and ""safe face-to-face care when needed"". How GPs are changing the way they work UK faces 'balancing act' Who would get a vaccine - and how? She added: ""While many people, particularly those most vulnerable to Covid-19, want the convenience of a consultation over the phone or video, the NHS has been and will continue to offer face-to-face appointments and I would urge anyone who feels they need medical support to come forward so they can get the care, support and advice they need - the NHS is here for you."" NHS England said it would be reminding GPs they faced enforcement action if they failed to offer face-to-face appointments when necessary on medical grounds. Failure to do so was a breach of their contract, it said. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said general practice was ""open and has been throughout the pandemic"", with a predominantly remote service to help stop the spread of coronavirus. This video can not be played Dr Debbie Noland wears full PPE when seeing patients and cleans the examination room between patients He said: ""The college does not want to see general practice become a totally, or even mostly, remote service post-pandemic. ""However, we are still in the middle of a pandemic. We need to consider infection control and limit footfall in GP surgeries - all in line with NHS England's current guidance."" He said most patients had understood the changes and that clinical commissioning groups had been asked to work with GP practices where face-to-face appointments were not possible - for example, if all GPs were at a high risk from coronavirus. ""Any implication that they have not been doing their job properly is an insult to GPs and their teams who have worked throughout the pandemic, continued delivering the vast majority of patient care in the NHS and face an incredibly difficult winter ahead,"" he said. Research from the college indicated that routine GP appointments were back to near-normal levels for this time of year, after decreasing at the height of the pandemic. ""Each and every day last week an estimated third of a million appointments were delivered face to face by general practices across the country,"" added Prof Marshall.

TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? It comes as thousands of doctors say a second peak is likely this winter - and is their greatest fear. The British Medical Association survey of more than 8,000 doctors and medical students found that 86% of them believed a second peak was likely, or very likely, in the next six months. The survey indicated doctors thought the two most important measures to help prevent such a peak were having a fit-for-purpose test-and-trace system and a ""coherent, rapid and consistent approach to local outbreaks"". BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""We, as a profession, want, above all, to avoid a return to the scenes we saw in April, when hospitals were full with Covid-19 patients, and hundreds were dying every day. Meanwhile, thousands of others missed out on vital appointments and procedures as routine care was put on hold. ""But while the forecast in this survey may be bleak, it is not an inevitability if the government takes decisive, robust and timely action to stamp down the spread of the infection."" He called on the government to focus on ""sorting out the test-and-trace debacle once and for all"", adding: ""We are at a critical crossroads in the fight against this deadly virus.""

Ex-PMs urge MPs to reject Brexit bill,"Sir John Major and Tony Blair have joined critics opposing the government's proposed Internal Market Bill Ex-Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major have urged MPs to reject the ""shameful"" attempt to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. The two have accused the government of ""embarrassing"" the UK by seeking the power to change the details of a treaty agreed last year with the EU. MPs will begin debating the contentious Internal Market Bill on Monday. A senior minister said the ex-PMs weren't ""close"" to the process and the UK was in a unprecedented situation. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the powersbeing sought by ministers to amend aspects of the Northern Ireland Protocol were an ""insurance policy"" to be used only if attempts to settle differences in other ways failed. The Protocol, a key part of the Withdrawal Agreement signed by both sides last year, is designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK and Japan in first major post-Brexit trade deal How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? If the bill becomes law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. Writing in the Sunday Times,,externalSir John and Mr Blair - former Conservative and Labour prime ministers respectively - said the government's actions were ""irresponsible, wrong in principle and dangerous in practice"". ""It raises questions that go far beyond the impact on Ireland, the peace process and negotiations for a trade deal - crucial though they are. It questions the very integrity of our nation,"" they said. The former leaders, both vehement opponents of Brexit, said that respecting treaty obligations was ""just as important"" as domestic law, and called for MPs to reject the legislation. ""As the world looks on aghast at the UK - the word of which was once accepted as inviolable - this government's action is shaming itself and embarrassing our nation,"" they added. By Leila Nathoo, political correspondent Tony Blair and Sir John Major say Boris Johnson knew the full consequences of the Brexit divorce deal he struck with Brussels last year - that new barriers to trade would arise between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. They say the government's plans to now override parts of the deal would imperil the Good Friday Agreement, undermine the UK's credibility in future trade deals and could prompt a damaging retaliation from the EU. They accuse ministers of embarrassing the UK, by negotiating with what they call ""cavalier bombast posing as serious diplomacy"" - an approach they say questions the very integrity of the nation. Their intervention is, however, unlikely to sway Mr Johnson, who's insisted the Internal Market Bill is a necessary safety net to protect the union and peace process - and has defied EU demands to withdraw the contentious clauses before the end of the month. The prime minister's appealed to MPs to back the legislation - his predecessors say it's Parliament's job to stop his plan going any further. The two former leaders were in office during key periods of the Northern Ireland peace process. In December 1993, Sir John helped negotiate the Downing Street Declaration in an attempt to secure paramilitary ceasefires in Northern Ireland. Less than a year later, the IRA called its first ceasefire. It helped pave the way for all-party talks which culminated with the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998 when Tony Blair was in No 10 - a deal that is widely seen as marking the effective end of Northern Ireland's ""Troubles"". This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""What we can't have... is the EU disrupting or putting at threat the integrity of the UK"" The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. The Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, whose party opposed the Withdrawal Agreement, said Mr Blair and Sir John were talking ""utter bunkum"". He said the former leaders should be focusing on the risk of a ""trade border"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and the damage this would do to NI's economy. ""The suggestion by the hero of the peace process brigade that the bill rips apart the Belfast Agreement is complete and utter bunkum without any factual basis,"" he said. ""They need to explain how making it easier for Northern Ireland to do business with our biggest market undermines the Belfast Agreement. ""They need to explain how Northern Ireland companies having less paperwork undermines the Belfast Agreement."" TASTE AND SMELL:How are they connected?

Care homes in England warned of rise in infections,"The government has written to care home providers in England to warn them of a rise in new coronavirus infections within the sector. A letter from the Department of Health,externalurged care bosses to take ""necessary action to prevent and limit outbreaks"". Cases were mainly among staff but risked spreading to residents, it said. It comes asa further 3,330 positive cases were recorded in the UK,external- the third consecutive day in which cases have been over 3,000. It brings the total number of confirmed cases to 368,504. Five more deaths of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days were also reported. This brings the UK total to 41,628. UK 'must avoid party weekend' ahead of new rules Coronavirus testing system 'falling over' R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told the BBC the key to preventing mass outbreaks was to ensure availability of testing for care homes. Friday's letter from the Department of Health and Social Care said testing data had revealed an increase in the number of positive results in care homes and called on the care sector to work with the government. ""You will know already that we are experiencing a rise in confirmed Covid-19 cases across the UK population,"" wrote Stuart Miller, director of adult social care delivery. ""I need to alert you to the first signs this rise is being reflected in care homes too. ""I am writing at the earliest opportunity, so we can work in partnership to prevent further spread of the disease. The rapid flow of data and information, to and from care providers, is vital to this effort."" Mr Miller said the infections had been detected chiefly among staff but had been transmitted to residents in some cases. He went on to stress ""the importance of regular testing and consistent use of PPE"". Speaking to the BBC, social care provider Mike Padgham - who runs four care homes in North Yorkshire - said the letter ""doesn't tell us anything we didn't know already"". He said there were currently no cases of coronavirus in any of his care homes, but called for clarity around visiting, as the R number - the reproduction rate of Covid-19 - has recently increased. ""At present, things are fairly calm, but we are looking over our shoulder at what is coming next,"" he said. Mr Padgham, regional chairman of the Independent Care Group, said one of his homes had reopened to visitors only last week for the first time since March, but since receiving the letter, he was now wondering if visits were a good idea. He said his ""natural instinct was to allow visits"" - in keeping with families' wishes - but added he ""would like more guidance"". ""You're damned if you do, damned if you don'tâ¦"" he added. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland commented onan article in the Sunday Times,external, citing a leaked report, that positive cases of coronavirus had been identified in 43 care homes across England. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme the key to preventing mass outbreaks was to ensure ""availability of testing"" for care homes. ""With that combination of testing and the rules that are applied by the care homes we can do justice to the elderly people in our care,"" Mr Buckland said. It comes after the UK recorded more than 3,000 new cases of coronavirus for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, warned the UK ""must act now"" to keep coronavirus transmission under control. He told Sky's Sophie Ridge: ""It's starting to appear in people more vulnerable and that, inevitably, is going to be followed by hospital admissions and deaths so we need to act quickly."" TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? A DHSC spokeswoman said: ""Throughout our coronavirus response we have been doing everything we can to ensure all staff and residents in care homes are protected. ""We are testing all residents and staff, have provided 200 million items of PPE and ring-fenced Â£600m to prevent infections in care homes, with a further Â£3.7bn available to councils to address pressures caused by the pandemic, including in adult social care. ""There is a high demand for tests and our laboratories continue to turn test results around as quickly as possible and we plan to rapidly expand it in the coming weeks as well as bringing in new technology to process tests faster.""

Illegal house party host fined Â£10k apologises,"In the letter sent to his neighbours, the party host said the ""foolish gathering"" was a ""major lapse of judgement"" A student who was fined Â£10,000 for an illegal house party of more than 50 people has apologised. The 19-year-old was issued with the fixed penalty notice after ignoring warnings to shut down the party at his Nottingham home on Friday night. In a letter sent to his neighbours, he said the ""foolish gathering"" was a ""major lapse of judgement"". Nottinghamshire Police said the group was breaking social distancing rules and the fine should serve as a warning. It said about 50 people found at the address on Harlaxton Drive, in Lenton, refused to leave and the host was issued with the fine. About 50 people were found at an address on Harlaxton Drive, in Lenton The party host wrote in the letter that friends were hoping to have a party of 25 people - adhering to Covid-19 restrictions - to celebrate two housemates recently turning 21. ""However, it quickly became out of hand,"" he said. ""It was never our intention to disrupt your evening. It was a major lapse in judgement on our end. ""We are eager to make amends."" The force said it used its full powers to deal with the ""reckless"" organiser who ""deliberately flouted"" the rules. But one neighbour told the BBC the Â£10,000 fine was ""absolutely ridiculous... fine the guys, but we were all students once"". Another resident said there had been large student parties in the Lenton area during the coronavirus pandemic and hoped lessons had been learned. Chief Constable Craig Guildford said fines were issued as a last resort Chief Constable Craig Guildford said: ""The individual had their chance and that chance wasn't heeded. ""The officers acted correctly and proportionately. ""In extremes, if people aren't following the rules, after we've tried our best... we will enforce and issue fines as a last resort.""

Belarus opposition keeps up anti-Lukashenko protest,"This video can not be played Police made dozens of arrests as opposition supporters gathered for the march Tens of thousands of people have been marching in the capital Minsk and other cities, in the latest of several weeks of mass protest against President Alexander Lukashenko. Large numbers of police have been deployed, blocking key areas. Police said they arrested about 400 people ahead of and during the protests, dubbed the March of Heroes. The protests have been triggered by a widely disputed election a month ago and subsequent brutal police crackdown. Demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after alleging widespread ballot-rigging. But the Belarusian leader - in power for 26 years - has denied the allegations and accuses Western nations of interfering. The 66-year-old has promised to defend Belarus. Most opposition leaders are now under arrest or in exile. It is the fifth successive Sunday of mass protests, with about 100,000 rallying each week. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonah Fisher reports from Minsk as police turn their sights on female protesters Eyewitnesses said the centre of Minsk was flooded with people. They marched on the elite residential area of Drozdy, where the country's top officials including President Lukashenko live, but were blocked by police. Rallies are also being held in Brest, Gomel, Mogilyev and other cities. Europe's longest-serving ruler under fire What's happening in Belarus? 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change However, the Interior Ministry said that as of 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) the protests involved no more than 3,000 people across the country. Mr Lukashenko has refused to make any concessions to the opposition The ministry said arrests were made in various districts of the capital, and that those detained were carrying flags and placards ""of an insulting nature"". Analysis by BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher In many ways Sunday's demonstration was similar to previous weeks. When the march was at full strength the riot police had little choice but to watch on as the protesters filled the streets and waved their red and white flags. The now famous ""Goose for a free Belarus"" was there, a bow tie round its neck, flapping its wings and posing for selfies. Plenty of families came too, determined to enjoy the warm weather. It's on the side streets, and in the exposed moments when people arrive and disperse in smaller groups that the security forces strike. It's not dignified or disciplined. The police, their faces usually covered, launch crude tackles at the protesters before dragging them kicking and screaming into waiting minivans. After five Sundays of huge demonstrations there's still no sign of enthusiasm dwindling or that the threat of violence is stopping people from coming. Video footage showedmen in balaclavas pulling people out of the crowds,externalgathering for the start of the march and taking them to unmarked minibuses. Protests were triggered by elections on 9 August, in which Mr Lukashenko was handed an overwhelming victory amid widespread reports of vote-rigging. Why Poland is backing the opposition in Belarus Belarus election: 'He threatened to burn us alive' 'If we step back now we will become slaves' Violent clashes on several nights following the poll led to thousands of arrests, and details emerged of severe beatings by police and overcrowding in detention centres. This produced a new wave of demonstrations, with weekend rallies drawing tens of thousands. Mr Lukashenko has said he may establish closer ties with Russia, his main ally. On at least two occasions in the past few weeks, he has been photographed near his residence in Minsk carrying a gun and being surrounded by his heavily armed security personnel.

Greece welcomes withdrawal of Turkish ship,"The Oruc Reis seismic research ship was surveying drilling prospects in disputed waters A Turkish research ship at the centre of a row with Greece over oil and gas exploration in a disputed area of the Eastern Mediterranean has returned to waters near southern Turkey. Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis welcomed the move as a ""positive first step"". Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said the move did not mean Turkey was ""giving up on our rights there"". Tensions flared when Ankara sent the research ship to survey an area claimed by Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. Ankara has since faced potential sanctions from the European Union, which supports Greece and Cyprus. Ratcheting pressure up further on Saturday,Mr Mitsotakis announced Greece was ""reinforcing its armed forces""and would buy 18 French Rafale fighter jets, four frigates and four navy helicopters. He said the Greek military would increase by troop numbers by 15,000 over the next five years. Greece and Turkey are both Nato members, but have a history of border disputes and competing claims over maritime rights. On 10 August, Turkey sent the seismic research ship Oruc Reis, accompanied by two auxiliary vessels, to search for potentially rich oil and gas deposits south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo. At the time, the Greek foreign ministry called the move a ""new serious escalation"" which ""exposed"" Turkey's ""destabilising role"". There are also tensions around Cyprus over rival exploration rights. The Republic of Cyprus and Greece do not accept any such rights for Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus in the region. On Sunday, Mr Akar confirmed that the Oruc Reis had returned to Turkish waters. Ship-tracking websites showed it near the port of Antalya. Why Turkey-Greece tensions have flared in Med The Eastern Mediterranean tinderbox ""There will be planned movements backwards and forwards,"" Mr Akar told state news agency Anadolu. Last week, Turkey's navy said that the Oruc Reis would continue operations in the area until 12 September. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said exploratory work would continue but there were no plans so far for an extension to the ship's mission. The Turkish pro-government newspaper, Yeni Safak, said the decision not to extend the ship's mission was ""a step towards giving diplomacy a chance"". France has deployed Rafale fighters to the Eastern Mediterranean ""This is a positive first step. I hope there will be more of them,"" Greek PM Mitsotakis told a news conference in Thessaloniki on Sunday. France - which is at odds with Turkey over the crisis in Libya - recently deployed two Rafale fighter jets and a naval frigate in the Eastern Mediterranean because of the tensions between Greece and Turkey. President Emmanuel Macron said the French military would monitor the situation. He also urged Turkey to halt oil and gas exploration in disputed waters.

Arcadia 'extremely sorry' after pay row,"Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire has apologised after claims it would pay some head office staff only half of their notice pay. Arcadia, whose High Street brands include Topman, Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, said it was ""extremely sorry"". All affected employees would get full pay, the firm said. The Unite union, which had threatened legal action, said billionaire Sir Philip should not have allowed the situation to happen in the first place. High Street retail is one sector of the UK economy that has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, with shop closures during lockdown followed by reduced footfall in shops. While retail sales rebounded in July,rising above pre-pandemic levels, the ONS said clothing shops had been the worst hit during the pandemic and the volume of sales remained 25.7% lower than in February. Arcadia, which is cutting 300 jobs from its head office in response to the effects of the pandemic, said on Saturday: ""We recently implemented a policy for those employees who are working their notice on furlough to receive their furlough pay instead of their full pay. ""We got this decision wrong and the board has today amended this policy to ensure all affected employees will receive their full pay. ""We are extremely sorry to all those individuals [affected] for the distress that we have caused and apologise unreservedly."" To try to soften the coronavirus blow to the economy, in March the government put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. That scheme has been winding down and, from the beginning of September, companies using the scheme have had to start contributing to workers' wages. Arcadia Group became part of Taveta Investments, owned by Sir Philip and his family, in 2002. The statement said it had been forced to make ""many tough decisions"" during the coronavirus pandemic, including the restructuring of its offices. The Unite union had threatened legal action on behalf of more than 40 head-office staff over pay after claims it was paying them only 50% of their notice pay. It hailed the ""U-turn"" by Arcadia as a victory for employees. Unite regional officer Debbie McSweeney said it was ""almost without precedent for Arcadia to apologise for such behaviour towards employees"". ""But this situation should have never been allowed to happen in the first place by Sir Philip Green, one of the country's richest men,"" she said. Unite said it would examine the Arcadia statement in detail before finally deciding to withdraw its legal action.

Two LA police officers shot in 'ambush',"This video can not be played Police described video of the incident which shows a figure approach the officers' car, before opening fire Two Los Angeles police officers are recovering in hospital after being shot in what police are calling an ambush. Video of the incident shows a figure approach the officers' vehicle, before opening fire and running away. Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva called the act ""cowardly"". The suspect remains at large. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has announced a $100,000 (Â£78,000) reward for any information leading to the gunman's arrest. Almost 40 US police officers were killed in the line of duty in 2020,external, FBI statistics show - eight of them were victims of an ambush. Protesters shouted anti-police slogans and blocked the entrance to the emergency room where the two officers were being treated, police and witnesses said. Two people were arrested, including a journalist who police said tried to interfere with the arrest of the other detainee and did not identify herself as a member of the press. The reporter, Josie Huang, tweeted she had ""thoughts and videos"" to share, while her employer, NPR, said they were ""appalled"" by her arrest. The officers involved in the shooting have not been named but were described as a 31-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man. The female officer was shot in the jaw and arms and was in a critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery, authorities said on Sunday. The male officer was hit in the forehead, an arm and a hand and was described as alert, ABC News reported. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Australia collapse hands England victory,"This video can not be played Chris Woakes & Jofra Archer trigger tourists' collapse Second one-day international, Emirates Old Trafford England 231-9 (50 overs):Morgan 42, T Curran 37, Zampa 3-36 Australia 207 (48.4 overs):Finch 73, Woakes 3-32, Archer 3-34, Curran 3-35 England won by 24 runs; series level at 1-1 Scorecard World champions England claimed an astonishing 24-run victory as Australia crumbled in the second one-day international at Emirates Old Trafford. Chasing 232 to win the series, Australia were cruising at 144-2 before Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer induced a collapse of four wickets for three runs in 21 balls. A reeling Australia lost their final eight wickets for 63 runs as they were bowled out for 207, despite a valiant last-wicket partnership of 31 between Alex Carey and Josh Hazlewood. England earlier collapsed to 149-8, with leg-spinner Adam Zampa taking 3-36 before Adil Rashid and Tom Curran pushed them to 231-9. 'We've got the belief we can win from any position' Watch highlights on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: Incredible England comeback sets up series decider Captain Eoin Morgan said he wanted his side to learn how to ""win ugly"" and will be pleased with how they dragged themselves back into the game. Archer was as hostile as he has been for England, disrupting the opening batsmen first up before returning to the attack with Woakes and triggering a collapse. As good as England were, this was an almost unbelievable collapse from Australia, who gifted wickets with poor shots, no foot movement and a generally bewildered air. England now have a chance to keep their five-year unbeaten run in home one-day series in the final match of the series at the same ground on Wednesday. England v Australia - fixtures & results This video can not be played England v Australia: Chris Woakes bowls Aaron Finch and Glenn Maxwell When Archer and Woakes returned to the attack, with Marnus Labuschagne and Aaron Finch sharing a 107-run stand, it felt like the game was over. However, the two stifled the run-rate before Woakes trapped Labuschagne lbw, and six balls later Mitchell Marsh chopped Archer on to his stumps. When captain Finch, who had led the way with 73, was bowled by Woakes in the next over, England upped their intensity, and it paid off as Glenn Maxwell played a wild slog and was bowled. It was the speed with which the collapse happened that was so surprising, with Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc falling to consecutive Sam Curran deliveries as the left-armer used all his variations. Australia had this match within their grasp and,for the second time on this tour, they let it slip. This video can not be played England v Australia: Eoin Morgan given out lbw to Adam Zampa after Australia review Australia created their own downfall, as the partnership between Finch and Labuschagne had highlighted England's struggle to take middle-order wickets - a skill that Liam Plunkett led the way in for so long. Rashid could not find the right length on a pitch that offered some turn, while the Curran brothers, replacing Moeen Ali and Mark Wood, could not make the breakthrough. Finch and Labuschagne countered a tricky pitch with aggression and calm running, although Finch was dropped on 58 by Rashid in his follow-through. But Australia twice had the chance to close this match out, the first coming with the ball when they failed to clean up England's tail, and secondly as they cruised past the halfway stage with the bat. They will hope that Steve Smith, who again missed this match as a precaution following a blow to the head in the nets on Friday, will return to offer some stability to a slightly fragile line-up. This was a far from vintage performance with the bat by England, who were suffocated by Australia's bowlers. Root epitomised the struggles. He was hit three times by the pace bowlers - at one point requiring treatment after a blow to the knee from Starc - and in his desperation to rotate the strike, ran out Jason Roy via a superb throw from Marcus Stoinis at cover. This video can not be played England v Australia: Jason Roy run out for 21 by  direct hit from Marcus Stoinis Despite looking uncomfortable, Root and Morgan guided England to 90-2, Root just beginning to cut loose with back-to-back boundaries before he edged Zampa to slip in his first over. With the run-rate going nowhere, wickets fell regularly. Jos Buttler was trapped lbw by Pat Cummins, Morgan fell in similar fashion to Zampa, Sam Billings chopped the leg-spinner on to his stumps and Sam Curran edged Starc behind. Chris Woakes played a handy cameo but it was Rashid and Tom Curran who helped England finish strongly. The final six overs went for 67 runs, including 18 off the otherwise excellent Cummins. Rashid slapped Cummins over deep mid-wicket for just the second six of England's innings as the two shared a 72-run stand. Australia were clearly frustrated as they left the field, but that was nothing compared to how they will feel after the batting performance that was to follow. This video can not be played Watch Tom Curran's five boundaries in quick-fire 37 England captain Eoin Morgan on BBC Test Match Special:""It was an outstanding win - not from nowhere but having the bowlers execute plans as well as we did, particularly when Australia started to gather momentum in the Aaron Finch and Marnus Labuschagne partnership. ""Once we broke into partnerships it was very tough for batsmen to come in and get going. That was certainly the case when we were batting."" On his decision to bowl Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes out early:""The game was getting away from us - there was no point Jofra having two or three overs left, and the same with Chris Woakes, if Australia are going to chase it down in the 42nd over. We went all in and the plan was to bowl Australia out."" Australia captain Aaron Finch:""At the end of the day England were just too good. England scored 81 runs in the last 10 overs, which wasn't ideal. ""It was getting more difficult as the match went on but that's no excuse for the collapse. It probably wasn't the greatest viewer match but it was good to see an equal match between bat and ball."" England bowler Chris Woakes:""It's great to have someone like Jofra Archer in your team because when you're up against it you can give him the ball and you get that little bit of X-factor from him, which is brilliant."" Ex-England spinner Phil Tufnell on TMS:""England never know when they are beaten. They always feel like they can drag it out of the fire.""

Wind warning prompts fears for US West Coast firesGusts of up to 40 mph could lead to a further spread of fires in Oregon and northern California.US & Canada,"The Almeda fire, which caused this damage, is only 50% contained The US National Weather Service has issued a ""red flag warning"" for areas of the West Coast, as high winds threaten to spread devastating wildfires still further. Gusts of up to 40 mph (64 km/h) are expected in parts of southern Oregon, with no rain. Fires have been raging for three weeks in Oregon, California and Washington, burning land and destroying homes. Tens of thousands of people have had to flee and at least 33 have died. Dozens of people are missing in Oregon alone, with one emergency official saying the state should be preparing for a ""mass fatality incident"". Cooler, moister conditions on Saturday allowed firefighters to make some progress with the fires. However,the forecast for Sunday prompted a warning of winds,externalof 15-25 mph and gusts of 30-40 mph in the Shasta Valley and east of the Southern Oregon cascades. A red flag warning is the highest alert for events which could result in major fires, and which demands extreme caution by residents. This area includes Jackson County, Oregon, where the Almeda fire has destroyed hundreds of homes and remains only 50% contained. In pictures: Oregon fires force thousands to flee Smoke from California wildfires turns skies orange False claims about Oregon fires spread online The fires have so far scorched an area of land the size of New Jersey, officials say. Oregon's Molalla is now an ash-covered ghost town after a mass evacuation The smoke pollution from the wildfires has left Oregon's largest city, Portland, with the worst air quality in the world, followed by San Francisco and Seattle,according to IQAir.com,external. A really simple guide to climate change In Oregon, where firefighters are battling 16 large blazes, 40,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders. Oregon's Office of Emergency Management (OEM) says the fires have killed 10 people, but officials warn the final death toll could be much higher. Oregon's Fire Marshal Jim Walker resigned on Saturday, shortly after he had been placed on leave amid a personnel investigation. There are hopes that a chance of rain on Monday could alleviate smoke problems and dampen the fires. This video can not be played Drone footage shows homes completely wiped out by wildfires The Almeda fire is being treated as suspected arson. In Washington state, firefighters are tackling 15 large fires. A one-year-old boy died earlier this week as his family tried to escape a blaze. His parents remain in a critical condition. US President Donald Trump is due to visit the community of McClellan Park on Monday to be briefed on the fires, amid a row over their cause. Democrats have warned of the existential threat of climate change and accuse Mr Trump of denying ""that reality"", while the president blames the fires on poor forest management.

Twelve bodies have been found so far and a number of people are still missing. California has seen at least 22 deaths in total from fires since 15 August.

"French Covid cases leap past 10,000 in a day","France has seen a surge in new infections over the last month France has reported a record daily increase in coronavirus cases as the country struggles to contain a fresh surge in infections. On Saturday health authorities said there were 10,561 new cases, rising by more than 1,000 from Friday's figures. The numbers of people admitted to hospital and intensive care are also increasing. A group of doctors have urged people to avoid private gatherings amid the fresh outbreak. ""After the joy of reuniting this summer, it's time to be careful in the private world,"" the doctors said in a column published in Le Journal du Dimanche on Sunday. ""The smaller a room, the more people it contains, the less airy it is, the more you increase the risks."" The coronavirus hotspots around the globe Behind the UK rise in Covid cases in five charts Infection rates have risen for all age groups since June, but officials say the increase is particularly significant among young adults. France is one of several European countries to see a surge in new cases. As authorities across the continent eased stringent lockdowns imposed in March to tackle the outbreak, new cases began to creep up in June and jumped significantly in the last month. Saturday's figures reported 2,432 people sent to hospital, 75 more than on Friday. Of these, 417 were sent to intensive care, an increase of 28. An additional 17 people died of the virus. France has recorded more than 30,000 deaths since the pandemic began, the seventh highest total worldwide. Face masks are now mandatory in public throughout Paris Officials have now designated 42 regions as ""red zones"", where virus circulation is active and where stricter mask requirements and gathering restrictions are in force. This includes Paris, Lyon, and almost the entire Mediterranean coastline. The nudists spreading coronavirus in French resort France launches huge coronavirus recovery plan Prime Minister Jean Castex - who recently tested negative after possible exposure to the virus - has asked local authorities in Bordeaux, Marseille and the island of Guadeloupe to suggest ""a set of new additional measures"" on Monday to contain the spread. Tour de France organisers meanwhile have banned spectators from starts and finishes of stages passing through the red zones. Several other European countries are tackling fresh outbreaks. On Sunday the Czech Republic recorded a daily record rise for the third day in a row, with 1,541 new infections. Neighbouring countries have begun to restrict entry for Czechs, with Germany announcing it would require a negative test for arrivals from Prague on Wednesday. Spain also recorded its highest ever daily increase on Thursday, reporting 10,764 new infections - though the health ministry said new cases were ""stabilising"". The country has the highest number of cases in Europe. Why Spain is seeing second Covid wave Princess Leonor, the 14-year-old heir to the Spanish throne, has gone into quarantine after one of her classmates tested positive for Covid-19. She and other pupils at Madrid's Santa MarÃ­a de los Rosales school will be tested. And in the UK, new cases rose by 3,497 on Saturday.Rules on gatherings have been tightened in much of the country- with only six people allowed to meet indoors or outdoors in England and Scotland.

Israeli minister resigns over second lockdown,"Israel - with a population of nine million - has been seeing some 4,000 new cases a day Israel is to impose a new national lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus - with tough restrictions coming into effect on Jewish new year. The country's second lockdown begins on Friday and lasts at least three weeks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the measures would ""exact a heavy price on us all"", but the country faced a surge with 4,000 new daily infections. A minister has resigned to protest against the restrictions that overlap with important Jewish festivals. Housing Minister Yaakov Litzman, who leads an ultra-Orthodox Jewish party, said the measures would prevent Jewish people from celebrating their religious festivals, including Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, on 27 September. He also threatened to pull his party out of the governing coalition. The country has seen 1,108 deaths from Covid-19 and more than 153,000 confirmed infections, according to a global tally kept by US university Johns Hopkins. Israel, which has a population of about nine million, has reported more than 3,000 new cases a day in recent weeks. This video can not be played Recovered Covid-19 patients volunteer in Israel pilot In a televised address on Sunday, the prime minister said this had grown to 4,000 daily. The measures he announced will be the most extensive imposed in Israel since the first lockdown, which ran from late March until early May, and include: No more than 10 people can meet indoors while groups of 20 are allowed outdoors Schools and shopping centres will close, and Israelis must stay within 500 metres of their homes with the exception of travelling to workplaces Non-governmental offices and businesses can stay open but must not accept customers However supermarkets and pharmacies can remain open to the public. Mr Netanyahu acknowledged the disruption the lockdown would cause to Jewish communities celebrating religious holidays that normally see families come together. ""This is not the kind of holiday we are used to. And we certainly won't be able to celebrate with our extended families,"" he said. The restrictions on indoor gatherings will severely impact prayers in synagogues. The second lockdown will cost the economy, which is in recession due to the pandemic, an estimated 6.5bn shekels ($1.88bn), the finance ministry says. Mr Litzman said in his resignation letter on Friday: ""This wrongs and scorns hundreds of thousands of citizens. ""Where were you until now? Why have the Jewish holidays become a convenient address for tackling the coronavirus?"" Yaakov Litzman said the lockdown would prevent Orthodox Jews from being able to celebrate religious festivals Interior Minister Aryeh Deri - who leads another ultra-Orthodox party - said in a video posted on Twitter that he supported the planned restrictions, and that not abiding by them would be tantamount to murder. Addressing the cabinet as it convened to vote on the lockdown on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said he regretted Mr Litzman's resignation. He added: ""We have to move on, to make the decisions necessary for Israel in the coronavirus era, and that is what we will do in this session."" This video can not be played Many ultra-Orthodox Jews opposed Israel's first lockdown Mr Netanyahu has faced criticism for his handling of the outbreak. Critics say his failure to tackle the virus effectively has led to another national lockdown. Many nations are experiencing second surges of the virus.

"Belarus opposition keeps up anti-Lukashenko protestAt least 250 people are arrested, ahead of the latest of several weeks of mass protest.","This video can not be played Police made dozens of arrests as opposition supporters gathered for the march Tens of thousands of people have been marching in the capital Minsk and other cities, in the latest of several weeks of mass protest against President Alexander Lukashenko. Large numbers of police have been deployed, blocking key areas. Police said they arrested about 400 people ahead of and during the protests, dubbed the March of Heroes. The protests have been triggered by a widely disputed election a month ago and subsequent brutal police crackdown. Demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after alleging widespread ballot-rigging. But the Belarusian leader - in power for 26 years - has denied the allegations and accuses Western nations of interfering. The 66-year-old has promised to defend Belarus. Most opposition leaders are now under arrest or in exile. It is the fifth successive Sunday of mass protests, with about 100,000 rallying each week. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonah Fisher reports from Minsk as police turn their sights on female protesters Eyewitnesses said the centre of Minsk was flooded with people. They marched on the elite residential area of Drozdy, where the country's top officials including President Lukashenko live, but were blocked by police. Rallies are also being held in Brest, Gomel, Mogilyev and other cities. Europe's longest-serving ruler under fire What's happening in Belarus? 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change However, the Interior Ministry said that as of 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) the protests involved no more than 3,000 people across the country. Mr Lukashenko has refused to make any concessions to the opposition The ministry said arrests were made in various districts of the capital, and that those detained were carrying flags and placards ""of an insulting nature"". Analysis by BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher In many ways Sunday's demonstration was similar to previous weeks. When the march was at full strength the riot police had little choice but to watch on as the protesters filled the streets and waved their red and white flags. The now famous ""Goose for a free Belarus"" was there, a bow tie round its neck, flapping its wings and posing for selfies. Plenty of families came too, determined to enjoy the warm weather. It's on the side streets, and in the exposed moments when people arrive and disperse in smaller groups that the security forces strike. It's not dignified or disciplined. The police, their faces usually covered, launch crude tackles at the protesters before dragging them kicking and screaming into waiting minivans. After five Sundays of huge demonstrations there's still no sign of enthusiasm dwindling or that the threat of violence is stopping people from coming. Video footage showedmen in balaclavas pulling people out of the crowds,externalgathering for the start of the march and taking them to unmarked minibuses. Protests were triggered by elections on 9 August, in which Mr Lukashenko was handed an overwhelming victory amid widespread reports of vote-rigging. Why Poland is backing the opposition in Belarus Belarus election: 'He threatened to burn us alive' 'If we step back now we will become slaves' Violent clashes on several nights following the poll led to thousands of arrests, and details emerged of severe beatings by police and overcrowding in detention centres. This produced a new wave of demonstrations, with weekend rallies drawing tens of thousands. Mr Lukashenko has said he may establish closer ties with Russia, his main ally. On at least two occasions in the past few weeks, he has been photographed near his residence in Minsk carrying a gun and being surrounded by his heavily armed security personnel.

'Firm and strong' EU response expected - Irish PM,"Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has cautioned against ""playing politics"" with the Brexit negotiations Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said the UK should expect a ""firm and strong"" response from the EU to the proposed Internal Markets Bill. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Martin also cautioned against ""playing politics"" with negotiations. The proposed bill would go against the Withdrawal Agreement, signed by the UK and EU earlier this year. Mr Martin also stated categorically there would be ""no return of a hard border"" on the island of Ireland. During the week, Boris Johnson said part of the reason for the Internal Markets Bill was to protect the Good Friday Agreement and Northern Ireland peace process. ""There's a very firm and strong view emanating from Brussels in how to manage and deal with this,"" said Mr Martin, speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÃ's Week in Politics programme. ""Whatever ploy or strategic approach is intended for the UK side, will be met with a very measured, firm and strong response from the European Union side,"" he said. He described the way the proposed law had been introduced as ""no way to do business"". Speaking earlier in the week, Mr Martin said he was not optimistic ofa Brexit deal in light of the UK proposal to override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement. His comments followed earlier remarks by Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, who said said the UK government was behaving in an ""extraordinary way"" over Brexit. Despite this, Mr Coveney said a free trade deal was still a possibility. Speaking to BBC's Andrew Marr programme, he suggested it would be difficult for trade talks between the two sides to continue if the Internal Markets Bill passes through parliament. Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill ""How then can the EU proceed with these negotiations, and put a new agreement in place, which will be the basis for a new relationship, if existing agreements, which aren't even a year old, are being legislated against?"" he said. This video can not be played Simon Coveney: ""The reputation of the UK... is being damaged in a very serious way"" Boris Johnson has said the European Union is threatening to impose a customs border in the Irish Sea, separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Mr Coveney rejected the suggestion that the EU's position on having a customs border between Northern Ireland and Britain had hardened after the agreement was signed, calling this a ""completely bogus argument"". Prime Minister Johnson has said an agreement on trade must be done by 15 October, to be ready in time for the conclusion of the transition periodat the end of this year. ""In my view it is possible to get a trade agreement, it will probably be a basic, pretty thin trade agreement, but it is possible to do that,"" said Mr Coveney. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 On Sunday there was further local and international reaction. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the UK's admission it could breach international law was ""completely outrageous"" and that the proposed legislation could be damaging to Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the British government was ""acting in bad faith and shows clear intent to disregard the protocol in the withdrawal agreement"". The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU could not have been ""clearer"" when the two sides agreed the Brexit withdrawal agreement last year what the implications would be for Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Responding to Mr Barnier's comments, the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, tweeted: ""On the Protocol, we indeed negotiated a careful balance in order to preserve peace and the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. ""It is precisely to ensure this balance can be preserved in all circumstances that the government needs powers in reserve to avoid it being disrupted."" Earlier on Sunday,former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major urged Parliament to reject Boris Johnson's attempt to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Writing in the Sunday Times, Sir John and Mr Blair - former Conservative and Labour prime ministers respectively - said the government's actions were ""irresponsible, wrong in principle and dangerous in practice"" The DUP's East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson dismissed their claims as ""nonsense"", but said his party will table amendments to the Internal Markets Bill. ""The Internal Market Bill as published is not the finished product but it is a massive step forward for business in Northern Ireland,"" he added. Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken described the Irish government and EU concerns as ""self-serving hypocrisy"". He said they were ""content to raise the spectre of a land border as anti-Belfast Agreement, whilst at the same time ignoring the anti-agreement reality of an Irish Sea Border"".

It is the second day in a row that the figure has exceeded 200 and the highest number of confirmed cases since 6 May. However, there were far fewer tests being carried out at that stage of the pandemic meaning many people with the virus did not appear in the statistics. On Saturday there were221 cases reported- the highest daily figure since 8 May.

"Care homes in England warned of rise in infectionsCases are mainly among staff but risk spreading to residents, a government letter says.UK","The government has written to care home providers in England to warn them of a rise in new coronavirus infections within the sector. A letter from the Department of Health,externalurged care bosses to take ""necessary action to prevent and limit outbreaks"". Cases were mainly among staff but risked spreading to residents, it said. It comes asa further 3,330 positive cases were recorded in the UK,external- the third consecutive day in which cases have been over 3,000. It brings the total number of confirmed cases to 368,504. Five more deaths of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days were also reported. This brings the UK total to 41,628. UK 'must avoid party weekend' ahead of new rules Coronavirus testing system 'falling over' R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told the BBC the key to preventing mass outbreaks was to ensure availability of testing for care homes. Friday's letter from the Department of Health and Social Care said testing data had revealed an increase in the number of positive results in care homes and called on the care sector to work with the government. ""You will know already that we are experiencing a rise in confirmed Covid-19 cases across the UK population,"" wrote Stuart Miller, director of adult social care delivery. ""I need to alert you to the first signs this rise is being reflected in care homes too. ""I am writing at the earliest opportunity, so we can work in partnership to prevent further spread of the disease. The rapid flow of data and information, to and from care providers, is vital to this effort."" Mr Miller said the infections had been detected chiefly among staff but had been transmitted to residents in some cases. He went on to stress ""the importance of regular testing and consistent use of PPE"". Speaking to the BBC, social care provider Mike Padgham - who runs four care homes in North Yorkshire - said the letter ""doesn't tell us anything we didn't know already"". He said there were currently no cases of coronavirus in any of his care homes, but called for clarity around visiting, as the R number - the reproduction rate of Covid-19 - has recently increased. ""At present, things are fairly calm, but we are looking over our shoulder at what is coming next,"" he said. Mr Padgham, regional chairman of the Independent Care Group, said one of his homes had reopened to visitors only last week for the first time since March, but since receiving the letter, he was now wondering if visits were a good idea. He said his ""natural instinct was to allow visits"" - in keeping with families' wishes - but added he ""would like more guidance"". ""You're damned if you do, damned if you don'tâ¦"" he added. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland commented onan article in the Sunday Times,external, citing a leaked report, that positive cases of coronavirus had been identified in 43 care homes across England. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme the key to preventing mass outbreaks was to ensure ""availability of testing"" for care homes. ""With that combination of testing and the rules that are applied by the care homes we can do justice to the elderly people in our care,"" Mr Buckland said. It comes after the UK recorded more than 3,000 new cases of coronavirus for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, warned the UK ""must act now"" to keep coronavirus transmission under control. He told Sky's Sophie Ridge: ""It's starting to appear in people more vulnerable and that, inevitably, is going to be followed by hospital admissions and deaths so we need to act quickly."" TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? A DHSC spokeswoman said: ""Throughout our coronavirus response we have been doing everything we can to ensure all staff and residents in care homes are protected. ""We are testing all residents and staff, have provided 200 million items of PPE and ring-fenced Â£600m to prevent infections in care homes, with a further Â£3.7bn available to councils to address pressures caused by the pandemic, including in adult social care. ""There is a high demand for tests and our laboratories continue to turn test results around as quickly as possible and we plan to rapidly expand it in the coming weeks as well as bringing in new technology to process tests faster.""

Disposable masks 'causing enormous plastic waste',"The government has been urged to do more to get people to switch from disposable masks to reusable coverings. The Liberal Democrats said single-use surgical masks caused ""enormous"" plastic waste and that environmentally friendly alternatives must be promoted. And the Green Party wants ministers to push the media to show them less, to stop their use becoming ""normalised"". Disposable masks contain plastics which pollute water and can harm wildlife who eat them or become tangled in them. The UK government said it was investigating whether personal protective equipment (PPE) could be ""reused in safe ways"". Face covering use expanded in England and Scotland Coverings now compulsory for NI shoppers Masks in shops rule to be introduced in Wales Bird found tangled in discarded Covid-19 face mask To help prevent the spread of coronavirus, face coverings - disposable or reusable - are now mandatory on public transport, in shops and in some other enclosed spaces in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The rule only applies on public transport in Wales, but it will be extended to shops and other indoor spaces from Monday. The latest figures for Britain from the Office for National Statistics suggested96% of adults,externalwho had left their homes in the past week had worn a face covering. The official guidance for England is to wear a reusable, washable one where possible. It also states that used disposable face coverings -often containing the plastic,externalpolypropylene - should be put in ""black bag"" waste bins ""or a litter bin if you're outside"". It adds that people should ""not put them in a recycling bin as they cannot be recycled through conventional recycling facilities"" and ""take them home... if there is no litter bin - do not drop them as litter"". Sea birds can become tangled up in masks But with the public being told to cover their faces, environmental groups say hundreds of thousands, even millions, of single-use masks are being dumped outdoors, blighting towns and the countryside. As part of its Great British Beach Clean, running from 18 to 25 September, the Marine Conservation Society is asking volunteers to record how many they pick up. Laura Foster, the organisation's head of clean seas, said: ""Just look at rivers such as the Thames and you'll see them floating by. ""When they're whole, wildlife's going to get tangled in it or the plastic's going to be ingested. They aren't going to biodegrade either, although they will break up, introducing more microplastics into the sea and the food chain."" The RSPCA is encouraging people with disposable masks to""snip the straps"",externalafter use to prevent animals getting caught in them. The Liberal Democrats are calling on UK ministers to do more to ""encourage people to use reusable masks, as well as provide guidance about how best to keep them clean"". Climate and business spokeswoman Sarah Olney told the BBC: ""As we face the Covid-19 crisis, we all want to do our bit to keep others safe. Wearing face coverings is a vital part of that, but it shouldn't cost the earth. ""It's clear that single-use face masks are creating an enormous amount of waste. Outside of essential clinical settings, there are plenty of environmentally friendly, reusable alternatives that people can choose to use."" The Lib Dems say disposable masks should be reserved mostly for people working in healthcare Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said the surge in disposable mask use came ""at a time when we are clearly drowning in plastic"". She called for ""stronger government guidance"", with the public potentially being asked to wear coverings ""for years"" if the pandemic continues. The media should be discouraged from showing masks in ""normal"", non-clinical, situations, Ms Womack added, also arguing that the government should impose a ban on its own websites, leaflets and films doing so. A government spokesperson said: ""Our priority is rightly to protect public health, but government and the NHS are actively looking at how PPE can be reused in safe ways, including decontamination."" They added: ""We have published guidance on how to wear and make a cloth face covering and how to safely dispose of PPE. ""Over the next couple of months, we are considering how we can inform the UK's longer-term PPE use strategy into the future, including taking into account environmental concerns.""

Working from home is 'long term ambition',"Ministers believe remote working can reduce congestion and improve flexibility Nearly a third of people should still be working from homes, even when coronavirus restrictions have eased, says the Welsh Government. Ministers said its ambition is to see about 30% of the workforce in Wales staying at or near home in the long term. They said it was a chance to adopt culture that ""supports remote working"". The move could reduce congestion and pollution, and improve work-life balance, they argue. ""The UK government instruction for everyone to go back to the office is not one we are repeating in Wales,"" said Deputy Minister for Transport and Economy, Lee Waters. ""We believe many people will want to continue to work remotely in the longer term and this could be a step-change in the way we work in Wales."" Why I hate working from home What does my boss do to keep me safe? Working from home: How to cut your tax bill The Welsh Government said it wanted to give workers ""more flexibility to work remotely"" and claimed this could ""drive regeneration and economic activity in communities"". The ministers also suggested it would recognise ""the importance of learning lessons on issues such as mental health support, childcare arrangements and more innovative housing design"". As part of its policy, officials said they were exploring how to develop a network of ""community-based working hubs"". The hubs would be office-like environments within walking or cycling distance of homes, and shared by public, private and voluntary bodies. ""The intention is to develop a hybrid workplace model, where staff can work in the office, at home, or in a hub location,"" stated Welsh Government officials. Many workers say they do not want to go back to their old offices A recent report by academics at Cardiff and Southampton universities suggested the majority of people working from home are as productive as those working in office bases, if not more productive. TheUnderstanding Society Covid-19 Study,externalalso said nine out of 10 those who had worked from home during lockdown would like to continue in some form. The UK government has pushed for people to return to office, with a campaign asking employers to reassure staff it is safe to return by highlighting measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The employers' organisation the CBI has warned city centrescould become ""ghost towns""if the prime minister does not do more to encourage staff back, with businesses relying on passing trade from office workers. However, there has been suggestions that the shift could converselyboost local neighbourhoods and independent businesses. Last week, the new chief executive of Wales' largest building society, Principality, saidhome working has been so successful many staff would not return to the office. Julie-Ann Haines said: ""Colleagues have demonstrated they can be as productive, and in some cases more productive, working from home than they were in the office"". Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said there were ""real benefits but some other concerns"" with some workers saying home-working had had an effect on their mental health, along with fewer breaks and less socialising. ""We do need to get the balance right,"" she said. Ms Taj said more home-working could also affect jobs in the hospitality sector which was ""built around office spaces"", adding that her organisation was working with the government to mitigate the risks. ""We do really need to think what is going to happen there,"" she said. The Deputy Minister for Housing and Local Government, Hannah Blythyn added: ""Home working will change how we use our town centres and high streets. ""As part of our work to support and revitalise our high streets and town centres we will be asking organisations, businesses and individuals to contribute to a major piece of work aimed at ensuring more people are living, working, shopping and learning there.""

"Belarus opposition keeps up anti-Lukashenko protestAt least 250 people are arrested, ahead of the latest of several weeks of mass protest.Europe","This video can not be played Police made dozens of arrests as opposition supporters gathered for the march Tens of thousands of people have been marching in the capital Minsk and other cities, in the latest of several weeks of mass protest against President Alexander Lukashenko. Large numbers of police have been deployed, blocking key areas. Police said they arrested about 400 people ahead of and during the protests, dubbed the March of Heroes. The protests have been triggered by a widely disputed election a month ago and subsequent brutal police crackdown. Demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after alleging widespread ballot-rigging. But the Belarusian leader - in power for 26 years - has denied the allegations and accuses Western nations of interfering. The 66-year-old has promised to defend Belarus. Most opposition leaders are now under arrest or in exile. It is the fifth successive Sunday of mass protests, with about 100,000 rallying each week. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonah Fisher reports from Minsk as police turn their sights on female protesters Eyewitnesses said the centre of Minsk was flooded with people. They marched on the elite residential area of Drozdy, where the country's top officials including President Lukashenko live, but were blocked by police. Rallies are also being held in Brest, Gomel, Mogilyev and other cities. Europe's longest-serving ruler under fire What's happening in Belarus? 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change However, the Interior Ministry said that as of 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) the protests involved no more than 3,000 people across the country. Mr Lukashenko has refused to make any concessions to the opposition The ministry said arrests were made in various districts of the capital, and that those detained were carrying flags and placards ""of an insulting nature"". Analysis by BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher In many ways Sunday's demonstration was similar to previous weeks. When the march was at full strength the riot police had little choice but to watch on as the protesters filled the streets and waved their red and white flags. The now famous ""Goose for a free Belarus"" was there, a bow tie round its neck, flapping its wings and posing for selfies. Plenty of families came too, determined to enjoy the warm weather. It's on the side streets, and in the exposed moments when people arrive and disperse in smaller groups that the security forces strike. It's not dignified or disciplined. The police, their faces usually covered, launch crude tackles at the protesters before dragging them kicking and screaming into waiting minivans. After five Sundays of huge demonstrations there's still no sign of enthusiasm dwindling or that the threat of violence is stopping people from coming. Video footage showedmen in balaclavas pulling people out of the crowds,externalgathering for the start of the march and taking them to unmarked minibuses. Protests were triggered by elections on 9 August, in which Mr Lukashenko was handed an overwhelming victory amid widespread reports of vote-rigging. Why Poland is backing the opposition in Belarus Belarus election: 'He threatened to burn us alive' 'If we step back now we will become slaves' Violent clashes on several nights following the poll led to thousands of arrests, and details emerged of severe beatings by police and overcrowding in detention centres. This produced a new wave of demonstrations, with weekend rallies drawing tens of thousands. Mr Lukashenko has said he may establish closer ties with Russia, his main ally. On at least two occasions in the past few weeks, he has been photographed near his residence in Minsk carrying a gun and being surrounded by his heavily armed security personnel.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe trial postponed in IranThe British-Iranian woman was expecting fresh charges in court - four years after her initial arrest.UK,"Richard Ratcliffe has campaigned for Nazanin's release for several years Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, has not been taken to court to face new charges as expected, her husband has said. Iranian state media had said she would be required to face fresh charges four years after her initial conviction. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe said: ""For Nazanin, the uncertainty is deeply traumatic, as we await the next move. ""This remains a game of cat and mouse between governments, with us living life as a piece of bait."" The Foreign Office reacted to the news of the postponement by calling on Iran to permanently release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Iran country profile Director of Amnesty International UK Kate Allen said it was ""a nonsense"" she had ever faced the new court date. Ms Allen said there had already been a ""deeply unfair trial"" leading to her being ""unjustly convicted"". She added: ""It appears the Iranian authorities are playing cruel political games with Nazanin. The situation has gone on long enough. Nazanin has continued to suffer in Iran away from her husband and young daughter. ""The UK government has had four and a half years to secure her unconditional release and have failed to do so. Securing Nazanin's release should be an absolute priority. ""As a matter of urgency, ministers now need to step up their efforts to get Nazanin home in time for Christmas and provide a clear plan on how they will do this."" Nazanin's prison leave extended Be tougher with Iran, Nazanin's husband urges PM Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in Tehran in April 2016. She had been visiting her parents with her young British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six. The dual national was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations of plotting against the Iranian government, which she denies, and no official charges have ever been made public. Gabriellahas now returned to the UK. Earlier this year,Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was given temporary leave from prisonbecause of the coronavirus outbreak and has been living at her parents' house in Tehran with an ankle tag. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""We welcome the deferral of this groundless court hearing, and call on Iran to make Nazanin's release permanent so that she can return to her family in the UK."" This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffeâs husband describes how his daughter Gabriella is coping without her mother Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said she had been ""terrified"" about the expected court appearance and had suffered the latest in a series of panic attacks. Explaining the process surrounding Sunday's postponed court appearance, he said: ""Nazanin's lawyer went to court early this morning as appointed. When he got there, he was told by the Court Office that there would be no hearing today. ""He had been given no indication that the trial would not be happening until this point. We have not been given a rescheduled date for the court hearing. It is perhaps early to understand why today's sudden postponement happened, or what it means."" He said he believed the postponement might been to do with efforts made by the British Embassy to attend the hearing. Mr Ratcliffe added: ""The Foreign Office had been requesting access to attend Nazanin's trial. ""The Iranian authorities were clearly reluctant to say yes, though likely mindful of the legal consequences of saying no in the context of diplomatic protection having been invoked. ""The current uncertainty of this period, on the back of all that has happened these past four years, is a kind of psychological torture."" He believes his wife and other dual nationals are being held hostage because Iran wants the UK to pay a decades-old debt over an arms deal that was never fulfilled. The UK owes Iran about Â£400m for Chieftain tanks ordered by the former Shah of Iran which were never delivered because of the 1979 Islamic revolution. The UK government says it will repay the money, but it cannot do so until a legal path is found because of international sanctions against Iran that currently make payment impossible.

Police called to large student beach gathering,"Officers were called to the beach at St Andrews Castle A gathering of about 50 young people on a Fife beach sparked a police response. Officers were called to the beach at St Andrews Castle at about 21:50 on Friday. It is understood that the group was made up of students who were adhering to social distancing guidelines and left the area when requested. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: ""Officers attended, gave advice and the group dispersed."" No fines were issued or arrests made. Current Scottish government coronavirus guidance limits outdoor gatherings to 15 people from five other households. However, restrictions are due to change on Monday when people will only be able tomeet in groups of no more than six. Children aged under 12 will not be subject to the new ""rule of six"". A spokesman for the University of St Andrews said students, local young people and visitors often held parties and barbecues on local beaches at this time of year. He said the vast majority were observing public health guidelines, remaining in small household groups and behaving responsibly. ""This is an incredibly difficult period for students, not just in St Andrews but across the country,"" he added. ""They have experienced a year like no other, far more than their fair share of disruption, and are facing a very different university experience from the one which tradition might have liked to promise. ""It is so important that while we remain cautious and prudent, and encourage our students to observe safe behaviour, we empower and support them to show what they can do during these enormously restrictive times.

Rest and Be Thankful closed by second landslide,"The A83 at the Rest and Be Thankful has been hit by another landslide A trunk road through Argyll has been closed by a ""significant landslide"" for the second time in six weeks. The A83 at the Rest and Be Thankful was covered in earth and debris as 75mm (3in) of rain fell in 24 hours. Road operator Bear Scotland said the A83 and the nearby old military road would remain closed on Sunday night. It added that the landslide had continued through the day and engineers were unable to conclude safety assessments. The route only reopened on Monday following a 10,000 tonne landslide at the beginning of August. The infamous road through 'a mountain in torment' About 1,000 tonne of debris is thought to have moved down the hillside on Sunday morning, according to Bear Scotland. The roads firm said it happened at the same place as the earlier landslide. Much of it was ""caught"" in temporary mitigation measures including a pit and a rockfall barrier. Eddie Ross, the road operator's north west representative, said: ""This is another major landslide event and the on-going nature of it and the continued heavy rain has meant we are unable to conclude a full safety assessment."" He said the roads have been closed because a ""safety-first approach"" was required. The closures mean motorists will have to follow a 59-mile (95km) diversion. A Met Officeyellow warning for rain,externalis in place across parts of the west of Scotland until midnight on Sunday. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said 75mm (3in) of rain fell in 24 hours at the Rest and Be Thankful over the weekend.

Arcadia 'extremely sorry' after pay rowThe group agrees to pay full salaries for head office staff facing redundancy after legal threat.Business,"Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire has apologised after claims it would pay some head office staff only half of their notice pay. Arcadia, whose High Street brands include Topman, Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, said it was ""extremely sorry"". All affected employees would get full pay, the firm said. The Unite union, which had threatened legal action, said billionaire Sir Philip should not have allowed the situation to happen in the first place. High Street retail is one sector of the UK economy that has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, with shop closures during lockdown followed by reduced footfall in shops. While retail sales rebounded in July,rising above pre-pandemic levels, the ONS said clothing shops had been the worst hit during the pandemic and the volume of sales remained 25.7% lower than in February. Arcadia, which is cutting 300 jobs from its head office in response to the effects of the pandemic, said on Saturday: ""We recently implemented a policy for those employees who are working their notice on furlough to receive their furlough pay instead of their full pay. ""We got this decision wrong and the board has today amended this policy to ensure all affected employees will receive their full pay. ""We are extremely sorry to all those individuals [affected] for the distress that we have caused and apologise unreservedly."" To try to soften the coronavirus blow to the economy, in March the government put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. That scheme has been winding down and, from the beginning of September, companies using the scheme have had to start contributing to workers' wages. Arcadia Group became part of Taveta Investments, owned by Sir Philip and his family, in 2002. The statement said it had been forced to make ""many tough decisions"" during the coronavirus pandemic, including the restructuring of its offices. The Unite union had threatened legal action on behalf of more than 40 head-office staff over pay after claims it was paying them only 50% of their notice pay. It hailed the ""U-turn"" by Arcadia as a victory for employees. Unite regional officer Debbie McSweeney said it was ""almost without precedent for Arcadia to apologise for such behaviour towards employees"". ""But this situation should have never been allowed to happen in the first place by Sir Philip Green, one of the country's richest men,"" she said. Unite said it would examine the Arcadia statement in detail before finally deciding to withdraw its legal action.

RAF intercepts Russian aircraft off Scottish coast,"The Typhoon in the foreground intercepting the Russian Bear F aircraft off the Scottish coast UK fighter jets have intercepted two Russian aircraft off the Scottish coast, defence chiefs have said. The Ministry of Defence said the RAF Typhoons were scrambled after the Russian aircraft ""entered the UK's controlled zone of international airspace"". The Russian planes were identified as TU-142 Bear F maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft. The RAF aircraft are currently operating from Leuchars in Fife. An MoD spokesman said monitoring of the controlled zone ensured safe passage for other aircraft, including civilian transatlantic liners. The Russian Bear F aircraft are used for maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare The former Leuchars RAF base is now a British Army station, home to the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. However, the Typhoons have temporarily relocated from their base at RAF Lossiemouth while part of a runway is resurfaced.

M5 closed after 'serious collision',"Police were called to the M5 between Gloucester and Tewkesbury at about 05:20 BST A stretch of the M5 has been closed in Gloucestershire after a serious crash involving several vehicles. Police were called at about 05:20 BST following reports of a Ford Fiesta leaving the northbound carriageway between junctions 9 and 11. Police said as a lorry parked behind the Fiesta to offer help, a second lorry crashed into the first one. Highways England (HE) reported a vehicle on fire. Details of any casualties were not disclosed. Ray Knight's farm is about two miles from the M5 and he said he heard a ""great big bang"" before 06:00 BST Farmer Ray Knight, who lives near to the M5, said he heard ""a great big bang"" at about 05:40 BST when he was feeding his cattle. ""I looked outside, didn't know what it was so carried on as normal and then a few minutes later, there was a second one."" Mr Knight said his son said ""there's something strange going on"" and mentioned ""black smoke billowing up in the distance"". ""Ten minutes later we heard a third one [bang] and by that point you could see the black smoke and there was a glow in the sky, which I presume was a fire,"" Mr Knight added. The crash happened on a stretch of the motorway near Tewkesbury and Gloucester. Both carriageways between junctions 9 and 11 were affected. HE said the southbound lanes between junctions 9 and 11 had reopened ""with a lane-three closure past the scene"". It asked drivers to ""please approach with care"". It added the northbound lanes were expected to remain closed until ""at least 6am"" on Monday. It said the surface of the road had been ""extensively damaged and must be resurfaced"".

Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill,"Sir John Major and Tony Blair have joined critics opposing the government's proposed Internal Market Bill Ex-Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major have urged MPs to reject the ""shameful"" attempt to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. The two have accused the government of ""embarrassing"" the UK by seeking the power to change the details of a treaty agreed last year with the EU. MPs will begin debating the contentious Internal Market Bill on Monday. A senior minister said the ex-PMs weren't ""close"" to the process and the UK was in a unprecedented situation. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the powersbeing sought by ministers to amend aspects of the Northern Ireland Protocol were an ""insurance policy"" to be used only if attempts to settle differences in other ways failed. The Protocol, a key part of the Withdrawal Agreement signed by both sides last year, is designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK and Japan in first major post-Brexit trade deal How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? If the bill becomes law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. Writing in the Sunday Times,,externalSir John and Mr Blair - former Conservative and Labour prime ministers respectively - said the government's actions were ""irresponsible, wrong in principle and dangerous in practice"". ""It raises questions that go far beyond the impact on Ireland, the peace process and negotiations for a trade deal - crucial though they are. It questions the very integrity of our nation,"" they said. The former leaders, both vehement opponents of Brexit, said that respecting treaty obligations was ""just as important"" as domestic law, and called for MPs to reject the legislation. ""As the world looks on aghast at the UK - the word of which was once accepted as inviolable - this government's action is shaming itself and embarrassing our nation,"" they added. By Leila Nathoo, political correspondent Tony Blair and Sir John Major say Boris Johnson knew the full consequences of the Brexit divorce deal he struck with Brussels last year - that new barriers to trade would arise between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. They say the government's plans to now override parts of the deal would imperil the Good Friday Agreement, undermine the UK's credibility in future trade deals and could prompt a damaging retaliation from the EU. They accuse ministers of embarrassing the UK, by negotiating with what they call ""cavalier bombast posing as serious diplomacy"" - an approach they say questions the very integrity of the nation. Their intervention is, however, unlikely to sway Mr Johnson, who's insisted the Internal Market Bill is a necessary safety net to protect the union and peace process - and has defied EU demands to withdraw the contentious clauses before the end of the month. The prime minister's appealed to MPs to back the legislation - his predecessors say it's Parliament's job to stop his plan going any further. The two former leaders were in office during key periods of the Northern Ireland peace process. In December 1993, Sir John helped negotiate the Downing Street Declaration in an attempt to secure paramilitary ceasefires in Northern Ireland. Less than a year later, the IRA called its first ceasefire. It helped pave the way for all-party talks which culminated with the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998 when Tony Blair was in No 10 - a deal that is widely seen as marking the effective end of Northern Ireland's ""Troubles"". This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""What we can't have... is the EU disrupting or putting at threat the integrity of the UK"" The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. The Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, whose party opposed the Withdrawal Agreement, said Mr Blair and Sir John were talking ""utter bunkum"". He said the former leaders should be focusing on the risk of a ""trade border"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and the damage this would do to NI's economy. ""The suggestion by the hero of the peace process brigade that the bill rips apart the Belfast Agreement is complete and utter bunkum without any factual basis,"" he said. ""They need to explain how making it easier for Northern Ireland to do business with our biggest market undermines the Belfast Agreement. ""They need to explain how Northern Ireland companies having less paperwork undermines the Belfast Agreement."" TASTE AND SMELL:How are they connected?

UK and Japan agree trade deal,"State for International Trade Liz Truss speaking to Japan""s Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshimitsu Motegi at the Department for International Trade The UK has struck its first major post-Brexit trade pact after signing a deal with Japan that aims to boost trade between the countries by about Â£15bn. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was a ""historic moment"". She said it would bring ""new wins"" for British businesses in manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries. Critics said while the deal may be of symbolic importance it would boost UK GDP by only 0.07%, a fraction of the trade that could be lost with the EU. Friday's deal still needs approval by Japan's parliament, which the country's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi forecast would be passed by January. How many trade deals has the UK done? Ms Truss said the UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement means 99% of exports to Japan will be tariff-free. ""The agreement we have negotiated - in record time and in challenging circumstances - goes far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries,"" she said. ""From our automotive workers in Wales to our shoemakers in the North of England, this deal will help build back better as we create new opportunities for people throughout the whole of the UK and help level up our country."" She added that, strategically, the deal was an important step towards joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership and placing Britain at the centre of a network of free trade agreements. Major Japanese investors in the UK such as Nissan and Hitachi would benefit from reduced tariffs on parts coming from Japan and streamlined regulatory procedures, the UK's trade department statement said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Brexit gives Britain the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries around the world. Business leaders welcomed the agreement, but stressed that securing a deal with the EU remained the most important goal. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, called the announcement a milestone, but added: ""Whilst this agreement is undoubtedly cause for celebration, securing a Free Trade Agreement with the EU remains critical to the future of businesses in the UK. ""We urge ministers to redouble their efforts to reach a comprehensive partnership with our largest trading partner at a crucial time in the negotiations."" The CBI also hailed the agreement, with director general Carolyn Fairbairn saying this ""breakthrough moment"" can be the first of many. ""It's a huge opportunity to secure new Japanese investment across a wider range of sectors and UK regions,"" she said. You can almost hear the sighs of relief echoing around Westminster and within the business community. After weeks of wrangling, the first deal of the Brexit era has been struck, which ensures that 99% of British goods can enter Japan without tariffs, or extra charges. But ultimately, this deal largely mirrors the agreement which already exists between the EU and Japan. And with trade with Japan accounting for just 2% of the UK's total, the expected boost to GDP of 0.07% over the long term  is a tiny fraction of what might be lost from leaving the EU. And there is good reason for Japan cooperating to ensure this deal was secured in record time. It stands to get the lions share, 80%, of the total estimated Â£15bn boost to trade for both countries. Even then, the talks haven't been as speedy or straightforward as initially hoped - which may not bode well for  negotiations elsewhere. About 99% of exports between the two nations will be tariff-free under the deal, with a particular focus on the food and drink, finance and tech sectors. Manufacturing parts coming from Japan will benefit from reduced tariffs, as will British pork, beef and salmon travelling in the opposite direction. Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said: ""It was a very tough negotiation, but we reached the agreement in principle in about three months, at an unusually fast pace. ""While maintaining the high levels of access to the British market under the Japan-EU EPA, we improved our access to the British market on train cars and some auto parts.""

UK 'behaving in extraordinary way' over Brexit,"Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has cautioned against ""playing politics"" with the Brexit negotiations Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said the UK should expect a ""firm and strong"" response from the EU to the proposed Internal Markets Bill. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Martin also cautioned against ""playing politics"" with negotiations. The proposed bill would go against the Withdrawal Agreement, signed by the UK and EU earlier this year. Mr Martin also stated categorically there would be ""no return of a hard border"" on the island of Ireland. During the week, Boris Johnson said part of the reason for the Internal Markets Bill was to protect the Good Friday Agreement and Northern Ireland peace process. ""There's a very firm and strong view emanating from Brussels in how to manage and deal with this,"" said Mr Martin, speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÃ's Week in Politics programme. ""Whatever ploy or strategic approach is intended for the UK side, will be met with a very measured, firm and strong response from the European Union side,"" he said. He described the way the proposed law had been introduced as ""no way to do business"". Speaking earlier in the week, Mr Martin said he was not optimistic ofa Brexit deal in light of the UK proposal to override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement. His comments followed earlier remarks by Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, who said said the UK government was behaving in an ""extraordinary way"" over Brexit. Despite this, Mr Coveney said a free trade deal was still a possibility. Speaking to BBC's Andrew Marr programme, he suggested it would be difficult for trade talks between the two sides to continue if the Internal Markets Bill passes through parliament. Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill ""How then can the EU proceed with these negotiations, and put a new agreement in place, which will be the basis for a new relationship, if existing agreements, which aren't even a year old, are being legislated against?"" he said. This video can not be played Simon Coveney: ""The reputation of the UK... is being damaged in a very serious way"" Boris Johnson has said the European Union is threatening to impose a customs border in the Irish Sea, separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Mr Coveney rejected the suggestion that the EU's position on having a customs border between Northern Ireland and Britain had hardened after the agreement was signed, calling this a ""completely bogus argument"". Prime Minister Johnson has said an agreement on trade must be done by 15 October, to be ready in time for the conclusion of the transition periodat the end of this year. ""In my view it is possible to get a trade agreement, it will probably be a basic, pretty thin trade agreement, but it is possible to do that,"" said Mr Coveney. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 On Sunday there was further local and international reaction. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the UK's admission it could breach international law was ""completely outrageous"" and that the proposed legislation could be damaging to Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the British government was ""acting in bad faith and shows clear intent to disregard the protocol in the withdrawal agreement"". The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU could not have been ""clearer"" when the two sides agreed the Brexit withdrawal agreement last year what the implications would be for Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Responding to Mr Barnier's comments, the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, tweeted: ""On the Protocol, we indeed negotiated a careful balance in order to preserve peace and the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. ""It is precisely to ensure this balance can be preserved in all circumstances that the government needs powers in reserve to avoid it being disrupted."" Earlier on Sunday,former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major urged Parliament to reject Boris Johnson's attempt to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Writing in the Sunday Times, Sir John and Mr Blair - former Conservative and Labour prime ministers respectively - said the government's actions were ""irresponsible, wrong in principle and dangerous in practice"" The DUP's East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson dismissed their claims as ""nonsense"", but said his party will table amendments to the Internal Markets Bill. ""The Internal Market Bill as published is not the finished product but it is a massive step forward for business in Northern Ireland,"" he added. Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken described the Irish government and EU concerns as ""self-serving hypocrisy"". He said they were ""content to raise the spectre of a land border as anti-Belfast Agreement, whilst at the same time ignoring the anti-agreement reality of an Irish Sea Border"".

How could NI Brexit deal change?,"The government has said it is willing to drop parts of a controversial piece of legislation - the Internal Market Bill - which had the potential to further complicate the already tense trade talks between the UK and the EU. It contains measures relating to the way trade will be done between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the future. They would only come into force if the UK and the EU failed to reach a trade deal. But they would overrule parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement the UK signed with the EU last year. The House of Lordsvoted to remove the offending clausesfrom the bill in November but the House of Commons then voted to reinstate them. The government now says it is willing to withdraw them because of an ""agreement in principle"" on a range of issues affecting Northern Ireland. So, what is the controversy about? The withdrawal agreement (also known as the Brexit ""divorce deal"") includes a section - or protocol - on Northern Ireland, and it is now an international treaty. Article 4 of the agreement says the provisions of the treaty take legal precedence over anything in the UK's domestic law. So if any of the proposals in theInternal Market Bill,externalthat contradict the withdrawal agreement actually became law, it would breach the government's international obligations. That is what the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis referred to in September when he spoke about breaking international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". Breaking the law, though, is still breaking the law. The overall aim of the Northern Ireland protocol was to avoid the return of a ""hard"" land border between Northern Ireland, in the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, in the EU. All sides agreed they did not want the return of border checks - or other physical infrastructure - that could become a target. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? One of the solutions in the treaty was to keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 It promised to maintain unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK but also introduced new bureaucracy for trade across the Irish Sea. The way these measures will be implemented on the ground have been negotiated by UK and EU officials, who have been meeting in a joint committee for the past few months. If there was no agreement by the end of the transition period, on 31 December 2020, and there was no free-trade deal, that is when parts of this new proposed legislation would have come into play. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. For example, the protocol states that companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) would have to fill out export declaration forms. But the government's Internal Market Bill would give ministers the right to overrule or ignore this part of EU customs law. Another part of the protocol says the UK has to follow EU rules on state aid - the financial support governments give to businesses - for goods related to Northern Ireland. But the Internal Market Bill would give ministers power to interpret what that means and says this should not be done in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Justice. The EU said this was trying to change parts of a recently-agreed international treaty unilaterally. And when the legislation was first published, US President-elect Joe Biden warned that the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland ""cannot become a casualty of Brexit"". But on 8 December, the UK and EU announced an""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts, the supply of food and medicines and clarification around state aid in Northern Ireland. As a result, the government said it would drop the controversial clauses in the bill. The Internal Market Bill only deals with trade from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, but the debate about goods moving in the opposite direction is equally sensitive. The protocol says the joint committee is supposed to determine which goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are ""at risk"" of being exported over the Irish border to the EU and should therefore have tariffs - taxes on imports - imposed on them. If there was no agreement between the two sides, then the default position would be tariffs paid on all goods. The UK had plans, due to be introduced in a Taxation Bill, to allow UK ministers to make unilateral decisions on which goods could be deemed as ""at risk"" - after 1 January. But, as a result of the ""agreement in principle"" - the government says these measures won't now be introduced. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Working from home is 'long-term ambition',"Ministers believe remote working can reduce congestion and improve flexibility Nearly a third of people should still be working from homes, even when coronavirus restrictions have eased, says the Welsh Government. Ministers said its ambition is to see about 30% of the workforce in Wales staying at or near home in the long term. They said it was a chance to adopt culture that ""supports remote working"". The move could reduce congestion and pollution, and improve work-life balance, they argue. ""The UK government instruction for everyone to go back to the office is not one we are repeating in Wales,"" said Deputy Minister for Transport and Economy, Lee Waters. ""We believe many people will want to continue to work remotely in the longer term and this could be a step-change in the way we work in Wales."" Why I hate working from home What does my boss do to keep me safe? Working from home: How to cut your tax bill The Welsh Government said it wanted to give workers ""more flexibility to work remotely"" and claimed this could ""drive regeneration and economic activity in communities"". The ministers also suggested it would recognise ""the importance of learning lessons on issues such as mental health support, childcare arrangements and more innovative housing design"". As part of its policy, officials said they were exploring how to develop a network of ""community-based working hubs"". The hubs would be office-like environments within walking or cycling distance of homes, and shared by public, private and voluntary bodies. ""The intention is to develop a hybrid workplace model, where staff can work in the office, at home, or in a hub location,"" stated Welsh Government officials. Many workers say they do not want to go back to their old offices A recent report by academics at Cardiff and Southampton universities suggested the majority of people working from home are as productive as those working in office bases, if not more productive. TheUnderstanding Society Covid-19 Study,externalalso said nine out of 10 those who had worked from home during lockdown would like to continue in some form. The UK government has pushed for people to return to office, with a campaign asking employers to reassure staff it is safe to return by highlighting measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The employers' organisation the CBI has warned city centrescould become ""ghost towns""if the prime minister does not do more to encourage staff back, with businesses relying on passing trade from office workers. However, there has been suggestions that the shift could converselyboost local neighbourhoods and independent businesses. Last week, the new chief executive of Wales' largest building society, Principality, saidhome working has been so successful many staff would not return to the office. Julie-Ann Haines said: ""Colleagues have demonstrated they can be as productive, and in some cases more productive, working from home than they were in the office"". Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said there were ""real benefits but some other concerns"" with some workers saying home-working had had an effect on their mental health, along with fewer breaks and less socialising. ""We do need to get the balance right,"" she said. Ms Taj said more home-working could also affect jobs in the hospitality sector which was ""built around office spaces"", adding that her organisation was working with the government to mitigate the risks. ""We do really need to think what is going to happen there,"" she said. The Deputy Minister for Housing and Local Government, Hannah Blythyn added: ""Home working will change how we use our town centres and high streets. ""As part of our work to support and revitalise our high streets and town centres we will be asking organisations, businesses and individuals to contribute to a major piece of work aimed at ensuring more people are living, working, shopping and learning there.""

"Subdued Proms concludes after Rule, Britannia! row","This video can not be played The 2020 Proms season went ahead despite restrictions. Here are some of the highlights. A subdued version of The Last Night of the Proms has been held in London, after a row over Rule, Britannia! threatened to overshadow the event. It saw a pared-down version of the BBC Symphony Orchestra play to an empty Royal Albert Hall, in order to comply with coronavirus restrictions. After a very public row, the patriotic songs Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory were sung by a small choir. The BBC was criticised for plans to omit the lyrics last month. Critics said the words evoked a British colonial, imperialist past that is at odds with the values of modern Britain and the Black Lives Matter movement. Last Night of the Proms will play Rule, Britannia Proms concerts will change depending on Covid rules Proms to open with Beethoven 'mash-up' The BBC insisted its original decision had been driven less by politics than by the limitations imposed on musicians, and choirs in particular, during the pandemic. But after a backlash in the press, and an intervention by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, it reinstated the lyrics, saying socially-distanced members of the BBC Singers would perform in the Royal Albert Hall's otherwise empty stalls. After the possible omission, and then the indecision, followed by the controversy, and the accusations of wetness - Britannia finally did rule the airwaves. And so tradition prevailed over those who thought the words too imperialistic for this day and age. But it wasn't quite business as usual at this year's Last Night: it was a Prom without promenaders, with a pared down, socially distanced BBC Symphony Orchestra led by the Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, and barely a flag or a hat in sight. The Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti - a late replacement for a poorly soloist - played Vaughan Williams's romantic pastoral favourite, The Lark Ascending The talking point of the night is likely to be composer Errollyn Wallen's radical re-working of Hubert Parry's Prom favourite Jerusalem, to which she introduced dissonance and blues references - a tribute, she said, to the Windrush generation of migrants who came to Britain. It was sung, brilliantly, by the South African soprano Golda Schultz. It has been a very strange year; the Pandemic Proms quite different without a live audience, particularly this evening's Last Night in which even Edward Elgar's Land of Hope and Glory seemed subdued. The 2020 Proms season was drastically curtailed by the coronavirus epidemic, with the usual eight-week season cut down to a fortnight of live shows, performed without an audience. The programme was simplified in other ways, too - mostly featuring smaller works, with UK-based soloists and orchestras. A reduced orchestra of 65 instead of the usual 300 performed live at the Royal Albert Hall - with the singers stood in the stalls to ensure social distancing. However, there were some successful attempts to make the best of the situation. On the opening weekend, Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra positioned their brass players in boxes around the Albert Hall, answering and colliding with each other as they played Giovanni Gabrieli's brass Canzons.

Folk singer Laura Marling also made her Proms debut, playing an intimate set of songs accompanied by an un-conducted string orchestra the 12 Ensemble. And the Aurora Orchestra played Beethoven's 7th Symphony from memory while standing (as has become their trademark)  drawing praise and admiration on social media. Allow Twitter content?

Their performance was paired with a new work by Richard Ayres who, like Beethoven, has suffered from hearing loss for the last 20 years. In three separate pieces - subtitled ""dreaming, hearing loss and saying goodbye"" - the players evoked the experience of degraded hearing, with string lines infiltrated by the high-pitched whine of tinnitus, and musical motifs blurring and breaking down. Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska said she ""played no role in deciding the traditional elements of the programme"" following the controversy over the Last Night. The Last Night opened with Mozart's perennially popular The Marriage Of Figaro, and featured South-African soprano Golda Schultz singing Sondheim's The Glamorous Life, and a new arrangement of Jerusalem, by composer Errollyn Wallen. The British composer, who was born in Belize, said her arrangement of the ""treasured hymn... created a lot of strong feelings"" among the Proms audience ""which, as a composer, is what you want"". She said the opportunity to arrange it for the Proms had been ""amazing"", as she had grown up with the original and loved it. She dedicated her version to the Windrush generation - ""I could have been one of those people sent home again,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Describing the socially distanced Last Night as ""magical"", she said: ""The spirit of people who love music was definitely in the hall."" Violinist Nicola Benedetti was a last-minute replacement for Lisa Batiashvili, who pulled out due to illness, playing Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending. In a pre-recorded video segment, the conductor, Dalia Stasevska, said: ""During these challenging times, we musicians have been longing so much to be able to play together again and to play live. ""Being able to play together again during these last two weeks has felt like drinking water after a long thirst."" BBC Proms - official site The BBC said next year's Proms would see Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory sung in full, replicating a tradition that dates back at least to the 1950s. Rule, Britannia! was set to music by Thomas Arne in 1740, and its lyrics were based on a poem by James Thomson. It contains verses such as:""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves / Britons never will be slaves."" Land Of Hope And Glory makes similar reference to the ""might"" of the former British Empire, which some people today find problematic. Speaking in August, Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke!, an orchestra that has performed at the Proms and whose musicians are majority black, Asian and ethnically diverse, said Rule, Britannia! was ""offensive"". She added that any black person ""aware of their history, the empire and colonialism"" would ""struggle to enjoy the patriotic jingoism of these songs"". Chi-chi Nwanoku's Chineke! Foundation is about ""championing change and celebrating diversity in classical music"" Broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby said he had always found that part of the last night ""uncomfortable"", suggesting the ""delusory"" second line be changed to: ""Britons never, never, never shall be knaves"". The BBC said it had originally planned to play the songs in an orchestral version due to coronavirus restrictions - although singers were due to perform on other nights of the Proms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson voiced his objection to the original decision, telling MPs: ""People love our traditions and our history with all its imperfections"", adding attempts to ""censor"" it were ""crazy"". The BBC later reversed the decision, saying: ""Both pieces will now include a select group of BBC Singers"", explaining the words would be sung in the Hall, with audiences free to sing along at home. It came after director-general Lord Hall was succeeded in the role by Tim Davie, the former chief executive of commercial arm BBC Studios.

Russia polls test Kremlin party's grip on power,"The opposition made gains in Novosibirsk and Tomsk Opposition candidates have won council seats in two Siberian cities where anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny campaigned before being poisoned. The pro-Kremlin United Russia party lost its majorities on the city councils in Novosibirsk - Russia's third largest city - and in Tomsk. But it has claimed a clear win overall in the local polls, seen as a big test of its popularity. Mr Navalny collapsed on a flight from Tomsk on 20 August. Most results in the elections have now been counted. But there have been many reports of irregularities. The independent monitoring group Golos said observers had been obstructed by officials at some polling stations and there were reports of ballot-stuffing. Voting was spread across three days; this was defended by the organisers as necessary to curb coronavirus infections. The opposition, however, argued  that the extra time made it easier for results to be fabricated. Alexei Navalny campaigned for ""smart voting"" to weaken United Russia Economic hardship, exacerbated by the pandemic, has eroded support for United Russia in opinion polls. The party did get its candidates elected governor in most of the regions where elections took place. But in Novosibirsk, the party dropped to 44% on the city council, with 22 seats out of 50, whereas before it had 33. Sergei Boiko and four other allies of Mr Navalny won seats there, along with nine other independent candidates. In Tomsk, two Navalny supporters won seats. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? His team had been urging Russians to vote tactically against United Russia. The Anti-Corruption Foundation had pledged support for candidates it saw as best placed to unseat incumbents of the ruling party, which it describes as the ""party of crooks and thieves"". Mr Navalny's camp believes this campaign could be why he was attacked, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says. His team allege he was poisoned on the orders of President Vladimir Putin - the Kremlin denies any involvement. The German government says labs in France and Sweden have confirmed that the poison was Novichok nerve agent. He remains in intensive care in Berlin's CharitÃ© hospital, but is no longer in a medically induced coma and he has been reacting to speech, the doctors say. These are the first elections since controversial constitutional reforms were approved in a July referendumallowing Mr Putin to stay in power until 2036. They are also seen as a dry run for elections to the national parliament next year. Last year,mass protests were held in the capital Moscow, following the exclusion of many opposition candidates from a local election. The authorities were then accused of a heavy-handed response to the rallies, which saw some of more than 1,000 people arrested receive sentences of up to four years in prison. The far-eastern city of Khabarovsk has seen regular anti-Putin rallies since July, afterthe arrest of a popular governor fuelled resentment against Moscow's rule.

Teen murderers could face 'life means life' terms,"The proposals also incude longer sentences for 15 to 17-year-olds who commit murder Teenagers convicted of murder in England and Wales could receive whole-life terms under sentencing reforms described by the government as the most radical in almost 20 years. Currently, a whole-life tariff can only be given to someone aged over 21 but ministers plan to reduce this to 18 for exceptional cases, such as terrorism. A White Paper outlining further details will be published this week. But Labour said the Tories had pushed the justice system ""to the brink"". The proposals will also include whole-life sentences for those who kill children. And there would be new powers to prevent the automatic release of offenders who have become radicalised behind bars while serving non-terror related sentences. A whole-life - or so-called ""life means life"" - order means the criminal is in prison for the rest of their life without ever becoming eligible for parole. It differs from a life sentence, under which the prisoner is given a number of years they must spend in jail after which they will be eligible to apply for parole. Whole-life tariffs are reserved for offenders judged to be the most dangerous to society. The planned reforms come after Hashem Abedi, who helped his brother Salman plan the Manchester Arena bombing, was jailed in August for life and ordered to serve at least 55 years in prison. Manchester bomber's brother jailed for 55 years 'There is always that empty chair where she should be' He was under the age of 21 at the time of the murders so a whole-life order was not an option open to the courts. Sentencing Abedi, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said a whole-life order would have been a ""just sentence"" in the ""exceptional circumstances"" but said he still ""may never be released"". Writing in the Sunday Express,,externalBoris Johnson cited Abedi's case, saying if someone plots to deliberately kill dozens of people ""then it doesn't matter if you're 'only' 18, 19 or 20 when you do so"". ""We're going to remove a loophole that lets some truly despicable criminals avoid such a sentence because they're under 21 at the time of their crime,"" Mr Johnson added. Under the proposals, there will also be longer sentences for 15 to 17-year-olds who commit murder. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said: ""From longer jail time for dangerous criminals to new measures to improve rehabilitation and cut reoffending - we are delivering a system that is more equipped than ever to crack down on crime, which the public can have confidence in to keep them safe."" But shadow justice secretary David Lammy accused the government of failures, citing a Prison Reform Trust report which stated there was a reoffending rate of 64% for those who spend fewer than 12 months in prison. And shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh said increasing sentences for younger terrorist offenders was ""quite low down the list"" of issues facing the criminal justice system. Speaking on Sky's Ridge On Sunday, she added: ""The criminal justice system is in complete disarray because of years of cuts, of privatisation of the probation system and of undermining of the courts and of the police."" A White Paper is expected to be published mid-week before legislation is laid before parliament in the new year. TASTE AND SMELL:How are they connected?

Death toll rises as fires rage on US West Coast,"Wildfires swept through the town of Berry Creek in California More than 30 people have been killed by wildfires that are sweeping through US West Coast states, officials say. Dozens of people are missing in Oregon alone, with one emergency official saying the state should be preparing for a ""mass fatality incident"". Fires have been raging in Oregon, California and Washington for three weeks, burning millions of acres of land and destroying thousands of homes. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden warned on Saturday that ""climate change poses an imminent, existential threat to our way of life"" and  accused President Donald Trump, a climate sceptic, of denying ""that reality"". Mr Trump, who is due to visit California on Monday to be briefed on the latest situation, blames the wildfires on poor forest management. In pictures: Oregon fires force thousands to flee Smoke from California wildfires turns skies orange False claims about Oregon fires spread online The fires have now scorched an area of land the size of New Jersey, officials say. Oregon's Molalla is now an ash-covered ghost town after a mass evacuation The smoke pollution from the wildfires has left Oregon's largest city, Portland, with the worst air quality in the world, followed by San Francisco and Seattle,according to IQAir.com,external. A really simple guide to climate change In Oregon, where firefighters are battling 16 large blazes, 40,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders. Oregon's Office of Emergency Management (OEM) says the fires have killed 10 people, but officials warn the final death toll could be much higher. Oregon's Fire Marshal Jim Walker resigned on Saturday, shortly after he had been placed on leave amid a personnel investigation. Earlier this week, Governor Kate Brown implored householders to stay out of the fire zones despite reports of looting. ""Let me assure you that we have the Oregon National Guard and Oregon State Police monitoring the situation and preventing looting,"" she said. This video can not be played Drone footage shows homes completely wiped out by wildfires Beatriz Gomez Bolanos, 41, told Reuters news agency of her family's frightening drive to safety through fires burning on both sides of their car. She told her four children to close their eyes as they made their escape. ""Everything is gone. We have to start again from nothing, but we are alive,"" she told the news agency. At least one blaze in Oregon - the Almeda Fire, one of the most destructive in the state - is being treated as suspected arson. In Washington state, firefighters are tackling 15 large fires. A one-year-old boy died earlier this week as his family tried to escape a blaze. His parents remain in a critical condition. Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Friday inspected damage from the North Complex Fire, near Oroville in Northern California. ""The debate is over, around climate change,"" Mr Newsom told reporters. ""This is a climate damn emergency. This is real and it's happening."" He acknowledged failings in forest management in recent decades, but added: ""That's one point, but it's not the point."" Highlighting the states effort to combat climate change, he said the record heat waves and unprecedented fires were the sort of problems long forecast by scientists.

""You've got to clean your forests - there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they're like, so flammable,"" he told a rally last month. ""I've been telling them this now for three years. But they don't want to listen."" The North Complex Fire, which has been burning since 18 August, is among the deadliest in history. Twelve bodies have been found so far and a number of people are still missing. California has seen at least 22 deaths in total from fires since 15 August. Tens of thousands of people are under evacuation orders as 14,800 firefighters continue to combat 28 major fires in the state. Have you been affected by the US wildfires?

Thousands set for virtual Great North Run,"Almost 17,000 people are taking part in the virtual event Almost 17,000 people will be taking part in a virtual Great North Run across 57 countries and six continents, organisers have said. The official event was cancelled because of coronavirus and a virtual run is taking its place later with a free app to accompany runners. Run founder Brendan Foster said the aim was to recoup money for charities. More than 60,000 runners were due to take part in the half-marathon in what would have been its 40th year. Big pink dress man Colin Burgin-Plews will walk around South Shields in his costume to raise money for charity Mr Foster said: ""This year has been testing for everyone so we had to re-imagine the event and take it out to the people. ""At least we will be able to keep people active and that's our mission. ""Thousands of charities have lost their income in recent times and we want to address this. ""Through the app those taking part can experience the sights and sounds of previous runs and hear encouraging words from the likes of Ant and Dec and Mo Farah."" He said he would do the run setting off from Bamburgh Castle and along the Northumberland coast taking breaks and walking part of the way. Founder Brendan Foster said participants will be ""together in spirit"" He added: ""I want to urge people to take their time and experience the day on the app and wherever you are, there are thousands of others from every postcode in the UK. ""We won't be physically together but we will be in spirit."" Organisers said they had not taken the decision to cancel the run, from Newcastle to South Shields, lightly and participants could apply for refunds or transfer their entry to next year. Big pink dress man Colin Burgin-Plews, who has raised thousands of pounds for charity, was due to take part but will now walk roughly 13 miles around South Shields in his costume. He is raising money for St Benedict's Hospice in Sunderland and the Kayaks club for children and young adults in South Tyneside. He said: ""I'm going to set off in the morning - no idea what route I'll take. Hopefully I'll meet people on the way socially-distancing obviously. ""I feel good about it, but it's going to be weird and different not seeing thousands of people.""

'Reckless' house party host fined Â£10K,"Police said the man who hosted the party in Harlaxton Drive ""deliberately flouted"" the rules A man has been fined Â£10,000 for hosting a large house party in Nottingham. The 19-year-old was issued with the fixed penalty notice after he allowed more than 50 people into his home on Harlaxton Drive, in Lenton, on Friday. Nottinghamshire Police said it used its full powers to deal with the ""reckless"" organiser who ""deliberately flouted"" the rules after an initial warning. The new""rule of six"" coronavirus restrictionscome into force on Monday. The tighter laws limit gatherings to six people indoors and outdoors in England. People have been warnednot to treat this weekend as a ""party""after one scientist warned the UK was ""on the edge of losing control"" of the virus. Nottinghamshire Police said officers attended the house party after Nottingham City Council officers were met with ""hostility from the organiser"" at 22:20 BST. About 50 people were found at the address, who were all ordered to leave, and the host was issued with the fine, it added. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cooper said: ""This party was a clear example of a householder who deliberately flouted the rules without a care for anyone else and as a result we have used the full powers we have to deal with this. ""Under current rules we can issue fines to anyone hosting gatherings of more than 30 people which can result in fines of up to Â£10,000. And now we are on the eve of rules becoming even tighter so there can be gatherings of no more than six."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? TESTING:What tests are available?

Covid debt leaves small business 'vulnerable',"Businesses in Wales face challenges preparing for a potential no-deal Brexit because of debt taken on to deal with coronavirus, according to leaders. Nine out of 10 members report cashflow problems over the pandemic, says the Federation of Small Businesses Wales. It comes astensions in the trade talks between the UK and the EU increased this week- leading some to believe a no-deal Brexit is more likely. Joshua Miles from FSB Wales said cashflow was firms' ""main issue"". ""One in five of our members have had government backed loans, others have gone into debt, used credit cards, some borrowed money from friends and relatives, and others have used their own life savings,"" he said. ""All of that means they just haven't had the time or money to prepare for something like a no-deal Brexit. ""That's going to be a real challenge for us going forward. ""It puts us in a very vulnerable position."" Gym boss Wendy Morris said she was worried about the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit Carwyn Jones, the Labour MS for Bridgend and former first minister, said Brexit makes the UK economy particularly vulnerable. ""Every other country in the world has to deal with Covid, but the UK is the only country that has to deal with Brexit. ""It means the UK as a whole is uniquely disadvantaged."" Bridgend Conservative MP Dr Jamie Wallis said: ""A Brexit deal is still a priority for the government, however, it must centre around free trade with other EU states. ""What's important is that any deal that we strike does not sacrifice the promise we made to the British to take back control of our money, borders and laws. Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill Analysis: Despite bitter row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal ""That is what the people who voted to leave the European Union expect."" Wendy Morris, who runs Energie Fitness gym in Bridgend, said she was worried about the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit but just wants the government to ""get on with it"". ""I think quite honestly that any kind of deal, including a no-deal is better than the state of flux we're in at the moment,"" she said. ""We need certainty. It impacts on everybody and I'm concerned that because of coronavirus the government is looking in two different directions."" Views are mixed among her clients. Lisa Driscoll said: ""I know Brexit's coming but I think we should focus on coronavirus."" Daniel Bayliss said: ""If, hopefully, we can get coronavirus under control, get some kind of certainty on the negotiations for Brexit, then things can start to look a bit more hopeful.

Cate Blanchett was the jury president in the lagoon city Australian actress Cate Blanchett, who headed the jury at the 77th edition of the festival, said the winner had been chosen after ""healthy and robust"" deliberations by the jury members. ""Good discussion is good discussion with a mask or not,"" she said. Zhao, who is the first woman to win the festival's top award, the Golden Lion, in 10 years, and McDormand were speaking via Zoom from California. ""Thank you so much for letting us come to your festival in this weird, weird, weird world and way,"" McDormand said. ChloÃ© Zhao at the drive-in premier of Nomadland on Friday The festival's Grand Jury prize went to Franco's film, while Kurosawa was named the best director. They were jointly given the Silver Lions. Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky was given the Special Jury prize for Dear Comrades!, a film about the massacre of protesters in the USSR in 1962.

Dig reveals 'one of largest' Roman Britain temples,"The temple would have been a ""major landmark in the region"", according to archaeologist Will Bowden A dig has revealed ""one of the largest"" temple buildings in Roman Britain. The 2nd Century temple site at Caistor St Edmund, near Norwich, has been known about since 1957, but its true scale has only just emerged. It was built by the Iceni tribe, best known for their leaderBoudiccawho rebelled against the Romans in AD61. Archaeologist Prof Will Bowden said its size, 20m by 20m (65ft by 65ft), showed ""how important this cult was to the Iceni"". The depth of the foundations indicates a substantial masonry building up to 15m (49ft) high Thecommunity archaeology group Caistor Roman Project,externalspent three weeks at the temple site in 2019, working in partnership with the University of Nottingham. Prof Bowden, the project director, said the post-excavation process had since been completed and this ""confirmed that we were looking at a building that was exceptional"". He said it was ""one of the largest of its type in Roman Britain"" which ""indicates not only the importance with which the site was regarded but also that the Iceni had the resources to construct major public buildings should they choose to"". Who was Boudicca? It has remained unknown which gods were worshipped there. Evidence of the worship of Roman gods has been found but the Iceni could have also dedicated the temple to a local deity,as happened at Bath,external. The 2nd Century building, which was built on the site of an earlier Romano-Celtic temple, was surrounded by a precinct with two gates Boudicca led her Iceni tribe in a revolt against the Romans between AD60 and AD61 Caistor was the site of Venta Icenorum, the smallest Roman regional capital in Britain. Its forum - the main public building - was less than a quarter of the size of Verulamium, now known as St Albans. Historians saw its small scale as a sign of the Iceni's impoverishment after Queen Boudicca led the Iceni tribe against the Romans.

Teens guilty of terrorism could be jailed for life,"The proposals also incude longer sentences for 15 to 17-year-olds who commit murder Teenagers convicted of murder in England and Wales could receive whole-life terms under sentencing reforms described by the government as the most radical in almost 20 years. Currently, a whole-life tariff can only be given to someone aged over 21 but ministers plan to reduce this to 18 for exceptional cases, such as terrorism. A White Paper outlining further details will be published this week. But Labour said the Tories had pushed the justice system ""to the brink"". The proposals will also include whole-life sentences for those who kill children. And there would be new powers to prevent the automatic release of offenders who have become radicalised behind bars while serving non-terror related sentences. A whole-life - or so-called ""life means life"" - order means the criminal is in prison for the rest of their life without ever becoming eligible for parole. It differs from a life sentence, under which the prisoner is given a number of years they must spend in jail after which they will be eligible to apply for parole. Whole-life tariffs are reserved for offenders judged to be the most dangerous to society. The planned reforms come after Hashem Abedi, who helped his brother Salman plan the Manchester Arena bombing, was jailed in August for life and ordered to serve at least 55 years in prison. Manchester bomber's brother jailed for 55 years 'There is always that empty chair where she should be' He was under the age of 21 at the time of the murders so a whole-life order was not an option open to the courts. Sentencing Abedi, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said a whole-life order would have been a ""just sentence"" in the ""exceptional circumstances"" but said he still ""may never be released"". Writing in the Sunday Express,,externalBoris Johnson cited Abedi's case, saying if someone plots to deliberately kill dozens of people ""then it doesn't matter if you're 'only' 18, 19 or 20 when you do so"". ""We're going to remove a loophole that lets some truly despicable criminals avoid such a sentence because they're under 21 at the time of their crime,"" Mr Johnson added. Under the proposals, there will also be longer sentences for 15 to 17-year-olds who commit murder. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said: ""From longer jail time for dangerous criminals to new measures to improve rehabilitation and cut reoffending - we are delivering a system that is more equipped than ever to crack down on crime, which the public can have confidence in to keep them safe."" But shadow justice secretary David Lammy accused the government of failures, citing a Prison Reform Trust report which stated there was a reoffending rate of 64% for those who spend fewer than 12 months in prison. And shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh said increasing sentences for younger terrorist offenders was ""quite low down the list"" of issues facing the criminal justice system. Speaking on Sky's Ridge On Sunday, she added: ""The criminal justice system is in complete disarray because of years of cuts, of privatisation of the probation system and of undermining of the courts and of the police."" A White Paper is expected to be published mid-week before legislation is laid before parliament in the new year. TASTE AND SMELL:How are they connected?

Migrants tear-gassed in Greek camp protest,"This video can not be played Thousands of migrants and refugees are demanding more permanent housing elsewhere Police on the Greek island of Lesbos fired tear gas at protesting migrants who were left homeless when their camp burned down on Wednesday. Around 13,000 migrants and refugees had been living in squalor in the overcrowded Moria camp, and are desperate to leave the island. The clashes broke out near a temporary camp built by Greek authorities. A fire was set there earlier in the day, near a police blockade, and had to be extinguished by firefighters. A new camp, Kara Tepe, has now been set up. Police said about 200 people had checked in at the new camp, while dozens - mostly families - queued outside, waiting for hygiene and safety checks. This video can not be played Migrants and refugees arrive at a new tent camp in Lesbos Families have been sleeping in fields and on roads after fleeing the blaze on Wednesday. The Moria camp was initially designed to house 3,000 migrants. People from 70 countries had been sheltered there, most from Afghanistan. â¢'Europe does not exist. This is hell' - migrants on Lesbos: How the migrant crisis changed Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts On Friday, migrants and refugees approached police barriers blocking the road out of Moria camp, holding signs calling for ""freedom"" and opposing the construction of a new camp. There is also strong resistance from the island's permanent residents for a new camp, and they have been blocking roads to stop aid deliveries. Riot police fired tear gas on Saturday The question of how to deal with the mass arrivals of migrants, mainly to Italy and Greece, has divided the EU for years. Italy and Greece have accused wealthier northern countries of failing to do more, while a number of central and eastern nations are openly resistant to the idea of taking in a quota of migrants. The new camp will begin hosting some of those left without shelter from Saturday, Greece's Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said. On Friday, Germany announced that 10 European countries had agreed to take 400 unaccompanied minors who had been living in Moria. The fire at Moria was ""a sharp reminder to all of us for what we need to change in Europe"", Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said. But a group of charities and NGOs have written to the German government saying more has to be done for all of the migrants, not just those minors. This video can not be played Migrants are struggling to cope out in the open ""The shameful situation in the camp and the fire disaster are the direct result of a failed European refugee policy - now the EU must finally help the people affected,""the open letter reads,external. Fires broke out in more than three places overnight on Tuesday, according to local fire chief Konstantinos Theofilopoulos. Further fires left the camp almost completely destroyed. The fires started hours after reports that 35 people had tested positive for Covid-19 at the camp. Authorities placed the facility under quarantine last week after a Somali migrant was confirmed to have contracted coronavirus. Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp Fleeing Lesbos fire: 'Daddy, are we going to die?' Eight of the 35 who tested positive for Covid-19 are since believed to have been found and isolated. Mr Mitarachi said the fires ""began with the asylum seekers because of the quarantine imposed"". Some of those infected with the virus had reportedly refused to move into isolation with their families. He did not say, however, that the fires were a deliberate act of arson aimed at destroying the camp. Meanwhile, some migrants told BBC Persian that the fire had broken out after scuffles between migrants and Greek forces at the camp. 'Europe does not exist.

'Working from home' is long term ambition,"Ministers believe remote working can reduce congestion and improve flexibility Nearly a third of people should still be working from homes, even when coronavirus restrictions have eased, says the Welsh Government. Ministers said its ambition is to see about 30% of the workforce in Wales staying at or near home in the long term. They said it was a chance to adopt culture that ""supports remote working"". The move could reduce congestion and pollution, and improve work-life balance, they argue. ""The UK government instruction for everyone to go back to the office is not one we are repeating in Wales,"" said Deputy Minister for Transport and Economy, Lee Waters. ""We believe many people will want to continue to work remotely in the longer term and this could be a step-change in the way we work in Wales."" Why I hate working from home What does my boss do to keep me safe? Working from home: How to cut your tax bill The Welsh Government said it wanted to give workers ""more flexibility to work remotely"" and claimed this could ""drive regeneration and economic activity in communities"". The ministers also suggested it would recognise ""the importance of learning lessons on issues such as mental health support, childcare arrangements and more innovative housing design"". As part of its policy, officials said they were exploring how to develop a network of ""community-based working hubs"". The hubs would be office-like environments within walking or cycling distance of homes, and shared by public, private and voluntary bodies. ""The intention is to develop a hybrid workplace model, where staff can work in the office, at home, or in a hub location,"" stated Welsh Government officials. Many workers say they do not want to go back to their old offices A recent report by academics at Cardiff and Southampton universities suggested the majority of people working from home are as productive as those working in office bases, if not more productive. TheUnderstanding Society Covid-19 Study,externalalso said nine out of 10 those who had worked from home during lockdown would like to continue in some form. The UK government has pushed for people to return to office, with a campaign asking employers to reassure staff it is safe to return by highlighting measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The employers' organisation the CBI has warned city centrescould become ""ghost towns""if the prime minister does not do more to encourage staff back, with businesses relying on passing trade from office workers. However, there has been suggestions that the shift could converselyboost local neighbourhoods and independent businesses. Last week, the new chief executive of Wales' largest building society, Principality, saidhome working has been so successful many staff would not return to the office. Julie-Ann Haines said: ""Colleagues have demonstrated they can be as productive, and in some cases more productive, working from home than they were in the office"". Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said there were ""real benefits but some other concerns"" with some workers saying home-working had had an effect on their mental health, along with fewer breaks and less socialising. ""We do need to get the balance right,"" she said. Ms Taj said more home-working could also affect jobs in the hospitality sector which was ""built around office spaces"", adding that her organisation was working with the government to mitigate the risks.

Can deal be done despite row?,"EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is in London this week for Brexit talks When it comes to Brexit, all negotiations are inter-linked: EU-UK trade talks, the process to implement their divorce deal, negotiations on fishing rights and Brussels' deliberation on UK financial service. What happens in one area very much affects progress in the others. You cannot separate them entirely. Which is why this week, as the war of words and wills between Brussels and Downing Street raged over the government's threat to throw a grenade at key parts of the divorce deal, everyone's thoughts turned immediately to the trade talks between the two sides. Could they survive? In fact, they limp on. Negotiations are set to resume in Brussels on Monday. This, despite the EU ending the week by threatening Downing Street with legal action unless it rowed back on its threats to the Withdrawal Agreement by the end of the month. Latest story: Brexit trade talks set to resume despite fallout The government insists it will not budge. So it is significant that the EU stopped short of threatening to press the nuclear button - shutting down trade talks altogether. Why is that, when we know the EU is furious? First of all, Brussels still wants a deal with the UK, if at all possible, this autumn. Secondly, the sense in Brussels is that the government is trying to provoke the EU into abandoning the trade negotiations. ""We're not going to give them that satisfaction,"" a high-level EU diplomat told me. ""We refuse to be manipulated."" This video can not be played UK vs EU: Johnson and Michel Barnier set out competing visions on trade So, despite bitter arguments over legislation on the one hand, and a huge list of outstanding issues still to be ironed out in bilateral trade talks; despite time and trust running out on both sides; neither the EU nor the UK seem to want to be the first ones to walk out the door. It is still possible, of course, that the government's bill is stopped in the House of Lords or even beforehand by rebel MPs. Deal stand-off threatens trade talks What are the sticking points in trade talks? What do I need to know about Brexit now? A simple guide It is possible for the EU and UK to iron out their differences over the divorce deal and in trade talks. Concessions can always be ""dressed-up"" to look like victories, after all. It has been done before. Remember last autumn? Finding agreement on the divorce deal seemed nigh on impossible - until it was not and a deal was signed. But, right now that feels like a long shot. The chatter on both sides of the Channel is that ""no deal"" is becoming more likely by the day.

UK and Japan agree post-Brexit deal,"State for International Trade Liz Truss speaking to Japan""s Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshimitsu Motegi at the Department for International Trade The UK has struck its first major post-Brexit trade pact after signing a deal with Japan that aims to boost trade between the countries by about Â£15bn. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was a ""historic moment"". She said it would bring ""new wins"" for British businesses in manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries. Critics said while the deal may be of symbolic importance it would boost UK GDP by only 0.07%, a fraction of the trade that could be lost with the EU. Friday's deal still needs approval by Japan's parliament, which the country's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi forecast would be passed by January. How many trade deals has the UK done? Ms Truss said the UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement means 99% of exports to Japan will be tariff-free. ""The agreement we have negotiated - in record time and in challenging circumstances - goes far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries,"" she said. ""From our automotive workers in Wales to our shoemakers in the North of England, this deal will help build back better as we create new opportunities for people throughout the whole of the UK and help level up our country."" She added that, strategically, the deal was an important step towards joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership and placing Britain at the centre of a network of free trade agreements. Major Japanese investors in the UK such as Nissan and Hitachi would benefit from reduced tariffs on parts coming from Japan and streamlined regulatory procedures, the UK's trade department statement said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Brexit gives Britain the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries around the world. Business leaders welcomed the agreement, but stressed that securing a deal with the EU remained the most important goal. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, called the announcement a milestone, but added: ""Whilst this agreement is undoubtedly cause for celebration, securing a Free Trade Agreement with the EU remains critical to the future of businesses in the UK. ""We urge ministers to redouble their efforts to reach a comprehensive partnership with our largest trading partner at a crucial time in the negotiations."" The CBI also hailed the agreement, with director general Carolyn Fairbairn saying this ""breakthrough moment"" can be the first of many. ""It's a huge opportunity to secure new Japanese investment across a wider range of sectors and UK regions,"" she said. You can almost hear the sighs of relief echoing around Westminster and within the business community. After weeks of wrangling, the first deal of the Brexit era has been struck, which ensures that 99% of British goods can enter Japan without tariffs, or extra charges. But ultimately, this deal largely mirrors the agreement which already exists between the EU and Japan. And with trade with Japan accounting for just 2% of the UK's total, the expected boost to GDP of 0.07% over the long term  is a tiny fraction of what might be lost from leaving the EU. And there is good reason for Japan cooperating to ensure this deal was secured in record time. It stands to get the lions share, 80%, of the total estimated Â£15bn boost to trade for both countries. Even then, the talks haven't been as speedy or straightforward as initially hoped - which may not bode well for  negotiations elsewhere. About 99% of exports between the two nations will be tariff-free under the deal, with a particular focus on the food and drink, finance and tech sectors. Manufacturing parts coming from Japan will benefit from reduced tariffs, as will British pork, beef and salmon travelling in the opposite direction. Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said: ""It was a very tough negotiation, but we reached the agreement in principle in about three months, at an unusually fast pace. ""While maintaining the high levels of access to the British market under the Japan-EU EPA, we improved our access to the British market on train cars and some auto parts.""
