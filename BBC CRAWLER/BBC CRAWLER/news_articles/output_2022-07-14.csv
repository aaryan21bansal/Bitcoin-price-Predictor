"Doctor knifed surgeon after arson bid, court told","Prosecutors allege Jonathan Peter Brooks (pictured) hated Graeme Perks, as he was a witness in ongoing disciplinary proceedings against him A doctor tried to kill a fellow plastic surgeon by stabbing him in his home after the victim stopped his bid to set the house on fire, a jury has heard. Nottingham Crown Court heard Jonathan Peter Brooks hated Graeme Perks as he was a witness in disciplinary proceedings, which had begun three days before the stabbing. The court heard Mr Brooks broke in but abandoned the arson bid and stabbed Mr Perks, who was disturbed by a noise. Mr Brooks denies attempted murder. Jurors were told consultant surgeon Mr Brooks dressed himself in camouflage gear before cycling to Mr Perks's home armed with a crowbar, cans of petrol, matches and a kitchen knife on 14 January 2021. Prosecutors allege the 58-year-old, who specialised in burns and plastics, hated Mr Perks and wanted him ""out of the way"" due to him being a witness in the disciplinary proceedings. Mr Brooks broke into the 66-year-old's home in Halam, Nottinghamshire, through the conservatory, the court was told, before dousing the ground floor of the house in petrol. The court heard Mr Perks made his way downstairs after being disturbed by a noise, which then led Mr Brooks to abandon the arson attempt and stab him in the abdomen. In a police interview played to the court, Mr Perks said he felt a ""blow"" to his body, touched his abdomen where he felt ""something poking out"", and realised he ""must have been stabbed"". The court was told he was left with an incision, about 8cm, under his rib cage. Mr Perks has been described as ""one of the most highly regarded and respected surgeons in the profession"" Mr Perks's wife Beverley and son Henry were in the property at the time, prosecutor Tracy Ayling QC said. ""They raised the alarm and soon police and ambulance attended,"" she said. The jury heard Mr Perks was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre, in Nottingham. The father-of-four was transferred to critical care in a medically-induced coma, underwent three operations and lost six litres of blood before he was discharged from hospital on 15 February. Ms Ayling said: ""Because of quick action and amazing surgical skill, Graeme Perks lives. ""His surgeon's opinion is that 95% of people suffering the injury inflicted on Mr Perks would have died."" The court heard Mr Perks was stabbed in his own home in Halam Hill Addressing the disciplinary proceedings against Mr Brooks, Ms Ayling said: ""There is no question but that by 14 January, the defendant had had enough of those proceedings. ""Just as clearly, the crown say, he decided that instead of following the law he was going to take the law into his own hands. ""The prosecution does not have to prove a motive for any crime, let alone the crimes you will be considering. However, it is clear that the defendant hated Graeme Perks and you can conclude on the evidence that he wanted him out of the way."" The prosecutor said the evidence showed it was the defendant who broke into Mr Perks's home and ""therefore must have been the defendant that stabbed Graeme Perks"". She told the court Mr Brooks ""does not dispute this"", although he has never formally admitted it. Ms Ayling added Mr Brooks was armed with a kitchen knife, two 10 litre jerry cans of fuel, which were ""contained in supermarket bags for life which had been carefully prepared"", a lighter, matches and a crowbar. ""He was, you can be sure, armed with the intention to kill,"" she said. Mr Brooks, of Landseer Road, Southwell, denies attempted murder, three counts of arson with intent to endanger life, and possession of a knife in a public place. The trial continues.

BBC sets out plans for TV news channel merger,"The plans include putting popular radio shows on TV, starting with the BBC Radio 5 Live Nicky Campbell programme The BBC has said it is investing in ""new capability to cover breaking news stories"" for a TV news channel which is expected to launch in April 2023. The channel, which will be called BBC News, isreplacing the corporation's two existing, separate UK and global news channels. It is part of plans for a ""digital-led, streamlined organisation"". About 70 UK-based BBC staff will lose their jobs as a result of the merger, it is understood. But in Washington DC, about 20 jobs will be created. BBC News digital director Naja Nielsen said the way people consume current affairs is changing. ""In recent years we've seen a huge surge in audiences coming to our live coverage, with tens of millions following live pages when big stories and events unfold,"" she said. ""As the world's most trusted source of news, with a huge depth and breadth of expertise, the BBC is uniquely placed to offer audiences the best analysis and explanation as these stories are unfolding."" She said investing in this would mean ""our news channel and digital teams will work hand-in-hand to bring the best journalism to audiences both at home and abroad"". A new feature will be the BBC investing in ""visualising"" programmes based on popular radio shows, starting with the BBC Radio 5 Live Nicky Campbell programme, which will be broadcast on BBC Two on weekday mornings, as well as on the UK stream of the new channel. The move is part of cost-saving measures - in January, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries confirmed the BBC licence fee is to be frozen at Â£159 for two years. In May, the corporation announced that as well as merging its two news channels, it would stop airing CBBC and BBC Four as traditional broadcast channels. It also said it would axe its regional TV news programmes in Oxford and Cambridge. You don't close 70 roles including the posts of 14 chief presenters and ask an entire workforce to apply for a smaller number of new jobs (as BBC sources have confirmed to me is the situation) if you don't believe that radical change is needed. With linear TV audiences falling, the BBC is signalling it must take its programming to where those news consumers are now heading. Digital first has been a buzz phrase for some time.  In a sense, this announcement is a reaction to the big surges seen on the live pages offered online by BBC News. Most recently, audiences have flocked to the website's live page - for stories as wide-ranging as Boris Johnson's departure and the glorious weather over the Glastonbury long weekend. Today's plans drive greater crossover between digital and TV. I've been told that Â£4m will be reinvested in new ""future-facing"" plans, financed from the Â£12.5m being saved by merging the channels. Those include a live and breaking news team it's believed will significantly increase the BBC's capacity to offer breaking stories across all its platforms, including, crucially, BBC iPlayer. There'll be more roles for journalists who will also do presenting, there'll be programmes based around particular chief presenters and there will be a beefed-up presence in Washington. But the news of the changes come at huge cost, not least to nearly 200 BBC colleagues who now face very unsettling times.  Sources I've spoken to say that by creating one channel broadcast globally, the BBC is in fact giving up on UK rolling news at quality and depth.  With plans for opt-out coverage when big UK stories break, that's disputed by the BBC. The plans are an answer to forecasts about dwindling TV audiences.  As with everything in the competitive media environment, there is no guarantee of success. The new news channel will be broadcast globally, with advert-free access for licence fee payers in the UK, who will also be shown more international coverage. The corporation said it will also feature ""new, flagship programmes built around high-profile journalists"" and UK viewers will receive specific content at certain times of the day. A live and breaking news team will offer global coverage of global breaking news stories, plus a domestic-only stream for UK-specific news events. Other plans announced include: The channel broadcasting from London during UK daytime hours, and then Singapore and Washington DC Sports programming will be a mixture of the UK-facing Sportsday and new global-facing sports programmes BBC Studios will carry on securing commercial revenues from the channel outside the UK, primarily through advertising, returning funding to the BBC that can be reinvested in public service journalism.

Italy lurches into crisis as PM offers resignation,"Mario Draghi was appointed last year by President Mattarella to lead Italy's post-Covid recovery Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has tendered his resignation after populist coalition partner Five Star withdrew its support in a confidence vote. The former head of the European Central Bank has led a unity government since February 2021. In a statement, he said the pact of trust that had sustained the unity government had gone. However, the president refused to accept his resignation. President Sergio Mattarella appointed Mr Draghi to lead Italy's post-Covid pandemic recovery, and save the country from endemic instability. He has now called on Mr Draghi to address parliament to provide a clear picture of the political situation. The effect of President Mattarella's intervention is not entirely clear. Mr Draghi is expected to go to parliament next Wednesday - and with sufficient backing could remain in office. The extraordinary developments in Rome capped a day of drama triggered when Five Star leader Giuseppe Conte refused to back the government's â¬23bn (Â£19.5bn) package of economic aid for families and businesses, arguing Mr Draghi was not doing enough to tackle the cost of living crisis. Giuseppe Conte's party said the government's economic package was insufficient to tackle a looming social crisis Even though the government comfortably won Thursday's vote in the Senate with the help of other parties, the man dubbed ""Super Mario"" had warned repeatedly that without Five Star's support the government could not continue. Mr Draghi paid a first, hour-long visit to President Mattarella and, after reflecting on his future, issued his statement of resignation. ""Today's votes in Parliament are very significant from a political point of view. The national unity majority that supported this government since its creation no longer exists,"" he said. After addressing ministers he returned to the Quirinale palace to tender his resignation to the president. Avoiding the cameras, he did not use the main door. Elections were already due early in 2023 and, if the government does collapse, a vote is likely to take place this autumn. Several parties on the right are keen on early elections, but a period of political uncertainty will jeopardise Italy's efforts to tackle a looming energy crisis and pass next year's budget to secure EU funding. Right up to the Senate vote, attempts were made to resolve the coalition crisis. Milan's stock market tumbled 3.4% as nervousness spread to investors in the eurozone's third biggest economy. European Union Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, who is himself a former Italian prime minister, said earlier the EU's executive was watching developments in Rome ""with worried astonishment"". The head of Italy's industry group Confindustria said Five Star's decision had shown ""total irresponsibility"". Five Star was originally the biggest party in Mr Draghi's broad-based coalition, but the movement has seen a string of defections and falling support. The other main parties are the far-right League, centre-right Forza Italia, centre-left Democratic Party and liberal Italia Viva. Former party leader Luigi di Maio accused Five Star of a cynical plan to bring down the Draghi government to revive its own support, while dragging Italy to economic and social collapse. Giorgia Meloni and other leaders on the right have an early election in their sights Parties across the political spectrum have had next year's general election in their sights, especially on the right. League leader Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni of Brothers of Italy are competing for leadership of a potential right-wing coalition. Ms Meloni called for elections, immediately announcing: ""I'm ready to govern."" Mr Salvini said a period of political paralysis was unthinkable. Politicians on the left are less prepared for elections and Democratic Party Secretary Enrico Letta said the focus now had to be on reconstructing a coalition in parliament so that the Draghi government could restart.

"EU energy rationing can't be ruled out, Shell says","Rationing of energy in Europe cannot be ruled out, the boss of energy giant Shell has warned, due to worries over the supply of gas from Russia. Speaking at an energy conference, Ben van Beurden said a ""really tough winter in Europe"" was ahead, with energy prices set to see ""significant"" rises. Energy prices jumped earlier this year after Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia has also been accused of using gas ""as a weapon"" by limiting supplies in response to EU sanctions. Last month, Germany moved closer to gas rationing after it triggered the ""alarm"" stage of an emergency gas plan to deal with shortages, amidst fears of tighter supplies. The highest level of the plan would allow the state to intervene and prioritise energy allocation to households and emergency services. This week, Russian natural gas supplies to Germany via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 were halted for 10 days of annual maintenance work, but there are fears that supplies may not restart. Italy has also reported shortages in gas supply, with Italian energy giant Eni revealing last month it was only getting half of the 63 million cubic metres per day it had requested from Gazprom. Germany fears Russia gas cut may become permanent Italy says Russian gas supply cut by half Speaking at the Aurora Spring Conference in Oxford, Mr van Beurden said: ""It will be a really tough winter in Europe. ""Some countries will fare better than others but we will all be facing a very significant escalation in energy prices."" The EU is heavily reliant on Russian fossil fuels, with Russia supplying 40% of its natural gas. It also supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil, receiving around â¬400bn ($430bn; Â£341bn) a year in return. The bloc has made moves to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in response to war Ukraine, banning most oil imports by the end of 2022. It has committed toreducing gas imports but it's proved harder to agree further measures, such as an outright ban. Member states have been been trying to store gas during the summer ahead of higher winter demand for fuel, but Russia's latest moves to reduce supply have deepened concerns the continent may struggle to build up sufficient reserves. Europe's gas stocks are 62.6% full and there are fears that meeting the target of at least 80% for winter will be difficult. Several countries, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands had their Russian gas deliveries suspended after they refused a Russian demand to pay in roubles. The UK imports less than 5% of its natural gas from Russia, but is reliant on Norway for a third of supplies. There are concerns that if Russia cuts supplies to the European Union further, or the bloc boycotts purchasing gas, then competition for supplies would increase. So while the UK would not be as badly hit by supply disruption as the EU, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand increases. Earlier this week, the head of the UK's energy watchdog, Ofgem,warned that domestic energy bills would rise faster this winterthan previously forecast. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year to UK domestic bills in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The government is in talks with energy firm Centrica about re-opening a giant gas storage facility in case European supplies from Russia are cut off.

President resigns after fleeing Sri Lanka,"Protesters in Colombo celebrated at news of the resignation Sri Lanka's parliament has accepted ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation, ending rule by a family that wielded power for nearly 20 years. Mr Rajapaksa quit after fleeing to Singapore amid mass protests over his mismanagement of the economy. Sri Lanka is in the grip of economic chaos as it faces an acute shortage of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Mr Rajapaksa's resignation paves the way for the country to begin the process of electing a new president. Sri Lanka's speaker of parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said on Friday that he accepted Mr Rajapaksa's resignation, which he received late on Thursday. He has called for parliament to convene on Saturday to start the process of electing a new leader. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has been sworn in as acting president. Parliament has up to a month to elect a new leader, who could be Mr Wickremesinghe. Mr Rajapaksa fled to Singapore on Thursday from the Maldives, as huge protests roiled Sri Lanka. He is believed to have wanted to leave Sri Lanka before stepping down in order to avoid the possibility of arrest under a new administration. The embattled leader arrived in Singapore earlier on Thursday after first flying to the Maldives on Tuesday night. Reports say he is accompanied by his wife and two bodyguards. Singapore's foreign ministry said Mr Rajapaksa had not asked for asylum or been granted asylum. ""Singapore generally does not grant requests for asylum,"" it added. In the capital Colombo on Thursday, delighted demonstrators greeted news of the president's departure with dancing. ""We are beyond happy, but also beyond relieved so we can take a break and go back to our lives,"" Viraga Perera told the BBC. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa defied calls for his resignation for months but has now fled But the crowds appeared smaller than before after Mr Wickremesinghe imposed a fresh round of curfews on Thursday to quell protests. The streets of Colombo were calmer as anti-government demonstrators began leaving some of the official buildings they had occupied. ""We are peacefully withdrawing from the presidential palace, the presidential secretariat and the prime minister's office with immediate effect, but will continue our struggle,"" said a spokeswoman for the protesters. One person died and 84 others were injured during Wednesday's protests, which took place at key landmarks around the capital, Colombo, including the prime minister's office. Protesters broke into the presidential palace on Saturday and set fire to the prime minister's private home. Police fired tear gas at protesters attempting to break down the gates of the prime minister's office in Colombo, before finally forcing their way in. They later headed for parliament but did not get in. Wednesday saw some of the biggest demonstrations since the protests first began in April. by Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo The resignation letter Sri Lankans have been waiting for since people power toppled Gotabaya Rajapaksa has finally arrived. The letter does several things. Firstly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's position as acting president is legitimised. Under Sri Lanka's constitution the prime minister becomes caretaker leader in the event of the president resigning. Secondly, it clears obstacles blocking the holding of an election in parliament for a new president. MPs had been due to meet on 15 July and start this process, with a vote promised a week later. That was delayed by the lack of a resignation letter but now it has arrived the Speaker will be able to reconvene parliament. The two main candidates so far are likely to be Mr Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. But given the governing party has a majority, its MPs are likely to back Mr Wickremesinghe - who has close links with the Rajapaksas. Whether Sri Lanka's public would accept this is another matter. The prime minister's resignation, along with that of Mr Rajapaksa, has been a key demand of protesters. Thirdly, the resignation means Gotabaya Rajapaksa no longer has legal immunity as a head of state and his position is now more precarious as he tries to find a safe country to shelter in. This video can not be played Watch: Police fire tear gas at Sri Lanka protesters as they storm PM's office By Thursday, protesters had handed back the president's official residence to the authorities when the BBC visited. There were no protesters at parliament on Thursday afternoon, a BBC correspondent confirmed. ""We captured this building to show people power. We give it back the way we captured it and leave. We will come back in the next minute if needed,"" Danish Ali, a protester at the prime minister's office, told BBC Tamil.

Additional reporting by Zubaidah Abdul Jalil Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

Disabled woman fined for parking in disabled spot,"This video can not be played Cerys Gemma cannot get out of her car when she uses the space outside her home A disabled woman faces fines of more than Â£1,000 for using a disabled car parking space outside her flat. Cerys Gemma, who lives in Cardiff Bay, said the space allocated to her flat is inaccessible for her. Instead, she has been using one of the parking spaces reserved for visitors with disabilities. Her property firm said it understood her allocated space was being used by a friend while she was attempting to park another car in a space for visitors. New Generation Parking Management, which manages the bays on behalf of Prospect Place Management, said the spaces have to be kept free for disabled visitors, not residents. The property management firm Ringley Group manages the building and homes at Prospect Place, but not the parking bays. Ringley Group said visitor spaces are available on a ""first-come-first-served"" basis and free to use - but vehicles must be booked in. Wheelchair user describes daily life as a battle Blind drag queen finds performing empowering The woman whose life is spent staring at a ceiling It also said a friend of Ms Gemma has been using the space that comes with her apartment, and she has been ""attempting on a continuous basis"" to use an additional visitor's space. Ringley Group added that with a short supply of spaces, it has been working with the local council to try and find a solution, which could be a ""space swap"", where Ms Gemma trades the one allocated to the apartment for another. Ms Gemma, 34, said she cannot use the space allocated to her waterside flat in Prospect Place. She explained that there is a pillar on one side, and another car parking space close on the other side. Ms Gemma says she cannot use the space allocated to her flat as there is a pillar on one side, and another car parking space close on the other side Ms Gemma said she had been in contact with the property management and parking companies, trying to explain why she needed to use a wheelchair accessible space. ""This has plagued me for two years and I just can't go on like this. ""I'm at breaking point and I've had conversations with people, and I've said this is the end, because I can't do this any more - something has to change. ""I'm not willing to be pushed out of my home because I'm in a wheelchair,"" she said. Ms Gemma has now been ordered to pay by the County Court. Cerys Gemma has been using a wheelchair since sustaining serious spinal injuries following a car accident when she was 17. She said the situation with the fines was now ""desperate"" and she is seeing a counsellor. ""It's hard enough anyway, and I try and be as graceful and patient with people who don't have accessible buildings, and I understand that it's hard, but I'm not being pushed out of my home because of a parking space when they've got eight accessible bays,"" she added. New Generation Parking Management said the eight spaces have to be kept free for disabled visitors, not residents. Disability rights lawyer Chris Fry, from legal firm Scott Montcrieff & Associates, said there is an obligation to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act. ""The reality is that if the space allocated to her is inaccessible to her because of her disability, then they're under obligation to make a reasonable adjustment, to maybe move that space or change it to a closer spot to the front door. ""If they don't, they're in breach of the Equality Act."" Ms Gemma said she worries every day that there will be another parking fine Mr Fry said a breach of the act could result in a company having to pay compensation for ""impact of the injury to feelings that the tenant has faced"", and that could mean fines of more than Â£1,000. New Generation Parking Management said: ""We want to make clear, if we allow one resident to utilise a disabled visitor space as their own, we would need to allow all requests from residents, which we have received over the years. ""This would no doubt reduce the availability of disabled spaces for disabled visitors."" Mr Fry thinks the firm may have misunderstood the Equality Act. ""That sounds like a typical misinterpretation of what equality means, it doesn't mean applying the same policy to everybody - equality means providing the same opportunity for outcomes. ""There is no disadvantage to them changing their policy, and prioritising, in fact legally, prioritising disabled people above other people is legal. ""It is within their gift to cancel those fines, that should be the first step they should take in terms of trying to rebuild the relationship,"" he said. New Generation Parking Management said it was simply enforcing the rules to which Prospect Place agreed when it was instructed to manage the site. Ms Gemma said she had been battling with the property and parking firms for two years and was at ""breaking point"" It said: ""We cannot make changes to these rules unless agreed by the board of directors, therefore in light of the continued distress that this is causing Ms Gemma we will take steps to ensure this is discussed at the next board meeting"". Ms Gemma said she simply wants to be able to live happily in her flat with the knowledge that she is able to park in an accessible space without the worry of more fines. ""Literally every day when I come down to my car I think 'here we go, is there going to be another ticket?', and it's awful"". A Ringley Group spokesman said New Generation Parking Limited was appointed by its client Prospect Place Management and has taken Ms Gemma to county court for parking fines, not Ringley. ""The lady in question has one car parking space that comes with a relative's apartment, but we understand from NGP that use of the parking space that comes with the apartment is currently being used by a friend,"" it said in a statement. ""This means that she has been attempting on a continuous basis to park an additional car on-site in a visitor space, despite already having been allocated one resident's car parking space. ""Residents' car parking spaces form part of the leasehold agreement and are not allocated by Ringley."" The company has met with council officials to try and solve the issue, and the statement added: ""One solution is for her to return her space back to the freeholder and then to sit down with the site team and identify spaces that might be suitable for her and for us to arrange a space swap with another owner.

NHS facing surge in demand as temperatures soar,"The NHS is preparing for a surge in demand from people affected by rising temperatures in England and Wales. An extreme heat weather warning applies from Sunday to Tuesday as temperatures are due to peak in excess of 35C (95F) in south, central and east England. It means there could be a danger to life or potential serious illness. Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse said the first line of defence was ""behavioural change"" and the key thing was to ""prepare"" government services. Speaking after a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee, he said it was critical that people look out for ""the most vulnerable groups"". Weather forecasts suggest mid to high-30s for the weekend but Mr Malthouse warned there was a ""smaller possibility that we could exceed that and possibly hit 40 which would be an all-time record"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The key thing we can do is prepare the government services for what may be a surge in demand - not least the health service and elsewhere"". Ice in hats, ventilated suits - keeping cool at work What does hot weather do to the body? Extreme weather warning extended to Tuesday Is the UK getting hotter? Temperatures in the wider area covered by the warning are more widely predicted to be as high as 35C, peaking on Tuesday, the Met Office said. Forecasters say they could be as high as 39C in parts of southern and eastern England. People are being urged to stay hydrated, look out for vulnerable people, keep curtains closed and stay out of the sun in the middle of the day. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the latter half of the 18th century, and experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments make steep cuts to emissions. The Met Office said the hot weather was caused by high pressure over the UK and hot air flowing from southern Europe. A heatwave spreading across Europe has fuelledwildfires in Portugal, France and Spain. Pressures are already high onNHS services, with patients in England waiting longer for ambulances. Figures from June show that it took an average of 51 minutes for ambulances to respond to emergencies such as heart attacks and strokes - the target is 18. Emily Shuckburgh, professor of environmental data science at the University of Cambridge, described extreme heat as a ""silent killer"". More than 2,500 heat-related deaths were recorded in the summer of 2020, with the elderly especially vulnerable, she said. People are advised to find shade and avoid exposure to the sun during the middle of the day Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said older people who already struggle with significant health issues are ""going to find the coming heatwave a challenge"". She urged people to check on elderly relatives and friends during the high heat. Rail firm Avanti West Coast has warned of disrupted journeys over the coming days because of the extreme weather and staff shortages. It tweeted that services might be cancelled at short notice at the weekend, with amended timetables and extended journey times expected on Monday and Tuesday. Network Rail said it was preparing the railway to keep passengers safe ""ahead of next week's very high temperatures"". Meanwhile, teachers' leaders fear schools may have to cancel sports days to protect students and staff during the heatwave. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU teaching union, said: ""It is extremely dangerous to take part in vigorous physical activity in extreme heat, with the risk of heat exhaustion and even heat stroke."" James Bowden, policy director for school leaders' union NAHT, also called on the government to ""give urgent thought"" to improving school buildings, saying poorly ventilated classrooms are ""inconducive to work"". In other developments: Runners in the Rabbit Run trail race in Bridgend county on Saturdayhave been advised to go slowlyamid concerns about extreme heat. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned that the extreme heat and months of below average rainfall is causing concern. Richard Bramley from the NFU said the agriculture sector was ""way behind"" with water management and had not yet adapted to the changing climate. Hammersmith Bridge in west London, which was closed in 2020 due to a heatwave, has beenwrapped in giant pieces of foil to stop it from overheating. Plus, animals at a wildlife park in Oxfordshirehave been given frozen smoothiesmade from ingredients including pears and carrots to keep them cool.

Sturgeon wants to meet new PM for indyref2 talks,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said she was open to negotiation with Boris Johnson's successor. Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to meet the next prime minister for talks over her plan to hold an independence referendum next year. The first minister said she would potentially be willing to compromise on some of the details of the plan. But she said whoever replaces Boris Johnson would have no democratic endorsement from Scotland. Mr Johnson has repeatedly said that now is not the time for another vote on independence. And he has argued that the result of the last referendum in 2014 - when voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45% - should be respected. None of the candidates in the race to succeed him have shown any signs that they are likely to take a different approach. Speaking as she launched thelatest in a series of papers,externalmaking the case for independence, Ms Sturgeon predicted that the UK government would ""shift even further to the right"" regardless of who the next prime minister is when the result is announced on 5 September. She claimed that this could lead to a ""race to the bottom"" on issues such as tax, cuts to public services, support for families and Brexit. Where do Tory candidates stand on indyref2? Is there a mandate for an independence referendum? BBC iPlayer - Independence: Why Scotland Could Vote Again Ms Sturgeon added: ""Not once in my entire lifetime have the Tories won a majority, or even a plurality of seats in Scotland. Yet for around two thirds of my lifetime Scotland has had Tory prime ministers and policies. That is not democracy."" She argued that independence was the only way to end the ""starker than ever"" democratic deficit in Scotland. Mr Johnsonrejected her callfor another referendum to be held on 19 October 2023 shortly before being forced to announce he would be standing down as prime minister. The first minister said her preferred option was still for the two governments to come together to agree a process, as happened before the 2014 referendum, and said she would potentially be willing to compromise on some of the details. She said: ""If the new prime minister is open to that, I will be open to sitting down, and in a spirit of compromise, seeking to come to an agreement."" But she added: ""I'm not going to allow Scottish democracy to be the prisoner of a UK prime minister."" Supreme Court judges have been asked to rule on whether Holyrood has the power to hold an independence referendum Ms Sturgeon had earlier said that ""a prime minister with no democratic endorsement from Scotland is about to be replaced by yet another prime minister that Scotland hasn't voted for - and wouldn't vote for even if we were given the chance. ""All Scotland ever hears from UK politicians these days is democracy denial. They trade opinions on how many years it should be before Westminster might 'allow' us to make a democratic choice about our own future. ""Parties and policies that we reject are to be forced upon us - but the democratic right to choose an alternative is to be denied to us"". And she accused Labour of ""teaming up with the Tories to frustrate the will of the Scottish people"". The first paper in the series waspublished last month. It was described as a ""scene setter"", with the latest document making the ""democratic case"" for independence. Subsequent papers will look at areas including currency, tax and spend, defence, social security and pensions, EU membership and trade. There is pragmatism behind the politics from Nicola Sturgeon here. She is clear that she is no fan of any of the Tory leadership candidates, and that she doesn't think Scots would endorse any of them as prime minister. But equally, she would love to be able to thrash out a deal with whoever ends up in Downing Street, for an agreed referendum in the style of 2014. She does not hold all the cards on the process side of independence, and her backup plans of going to court or seeking to use a general election as a ""de facto"" plebiscite are fraught with difficulty. If the opportunity arose, she would grab the chance to enter talks and negotiate a way forward - even if it meant compromising on details. Anything would be better than the brick wall Boris Johnson has thrown up. But equally, none of the candidates are likely to want to plunge into a campaign at the very beginning of their time in office, alongside all of the other pressures they face. So even if she is still expecting another flat ""no"", Ms Sturgeon will hold out hope for a deal - and knows that looking reasonable in the face of intractable opposition will only help her cause. Ms Sturgeon has asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether Holyrood has the powers to hold a referendum if the UK government continues to refuse to give the formal consent that was put in place ahead of the last referendum in 2014. The Scottish government's top law officer, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain, has already said she""does not have the necessary degree of confidence""that it does. And the UK government hasurged judges to throw out the case, arguing that there is not yet any legislation for them to rule on and that it is clear that issues relating to the constitution are reserved to Westminster. If the Scottish government wins the case, Ms Sturgeon intends to quickly introduce and pass a referendum bill at Holyrood that would allow a vote to happen in October of next year. But if the Supreme Court ruling goes against her, she has said she would use the next election as a ""de facto referendum"" and attempt to use the result to trigger independence negotiations. Both the Conservatives and Labour have dismissed this plan - arguing that people would be voting on many different issues in an election, and not just on independence. Will there be another Scottish independence referendum? And they have said that Ms Sturgeon should be focusing on issues such as the cost of living crisis, health and education rather than another referendum. Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Donald Cameron said the first minister ""knows the vast majority of people in Scotland don't want another divisive independence referendum next year"". He added: ""They want her government focused on tackling the global cost-of-living crisis, helping our NHS to get through the ever-increasing backlogs in treatment and supporting our post-pandemic recovery. ""Yet, instead of getting on with the job at hand, she is using her official residence to spout SNP propaganda, which will only paralyse Scotland with years of bitter division and distraction. ""The nationalists are typically only interested in standing up for the democratic rights of those who agree with them."" Scottish Labour MSP Sarah Boyack said the first minister's ""increasingly desperate attacks"" on Labour were a ""tell-tale sign that her worst fear is a Labour government booting out the Tories out of office and building a better UK for everyone"". Ms Boyack said: ""When people across Scotland are crying out for help with the cost of living crisis, precious government time and energy is being poured into the SNP's endless attempts to whip up division. ""The last paper was nothing but fantasy economics and baseless promises of jam tomorrow, without a shred of clarity on the unanswered questions plaguing the SNP's reckless plans or any attempt to use the powers they have now."" According to polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice, recent polls have - on average - put support for independence at 48%, with 52% against, once ""don't know"" votes are excluded.

"Energy rationing cannot be ruled out, warns Shell","Rationing of energy in Europe cannot be ruled out, the boss of energy giant Shell has warned, due to worries over the supply of gas from Russia. Speaking at an energy conference, Ben van Beurden said a ""really tough winter in Europe"" was ahead, with energy prices set to see ""significant"" rises. Energy prices jumped earlier this year after Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia has also been accused of using gas ""as a weapon"" by limiting supplies in response to EU sanctions. Last month, Germany moved closer to gas rationing after it triggered the ""alarm"" stage of an emergency gas plan to deal with shortages, amidst fears of tighter supplies. The highest level of the plan would allow the state to intervene and prioritise energy allocation to households and emergency services. This week, Russian natural gas supplies to Germany via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 were halted for 10 days of annual maintenance work, but there are fears that supplies may not restart. Italy has also reported shortages in gas supply, with Italian energy giant Eni revealing last month it was only getting half of the 63 million cubic metres per day it had requested from Gazprom. Germany fears Russia gas cut may become permanent Italy says Russian gas supply cut by half Speaking at the Aurora Spring Conference in Oxford, Mr van Beurden said: ""It will be a really tough winter in Europe. ""Some countries will fare better than others but we will all be facing a very significant escalation in energy prices."" The EU is heavily reliant on Russian fossil fuels, with Russia supplying 40% of its natural gas. It also supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil, receiving around â¬400bn ($430bn; Â£341bn) a year in return. The bloc has made moves to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in response to war Ukraine, banning most oil imports by the end of 2022. It has committed toreducing gas imports but it's proved harder to agree further measures, such as an outright ban. Member states have been been trying to store gas during the summer ahead of higher winter demand for fuel, but Russia's latest moves to reduce supply have deepened concerns the continent may struggle to build up sufficient reserves. Europe's gas stocks are 62.6% full and there are fears that meeting the target of at least 80% for winter will be difficult. Several countries, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands had their Russian gas deliveries suspended after they refused a Russian demand to pay in roubles. The UK imports less than 5% of its natural gas from Russia, but is reliant on Norway for a third of supplies. There are concerns that if Russia cuts supplies to the European Union further, or the bloc boycotts purchasing gas, then competition for supplies would increase. So while the UK would not be as badly hit by supply disruption as the EU, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand increases. Earlier this week, the head of the UK's energy watchdog, Ofgem,warned that domestic energy bills would rise faster this winterthan previously forecast. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year to UK domestic bills in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The government is in talks with energy firm Centrica about re-opening a giant gas storage facility in case European supplies from Russia are cut off.

Sunak wins first round of Tory leadership vote,"This video can not be played Watch: Hunt and Zahawi out of Tory leadership contest Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak has won the first round of voting by MPs to choose the next Conservative leader and prime minister. He got 88 votes, with Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt in second place on 67 and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss third on 50. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt were eliminated from the race. Those still in the contest face another round of voting on Thursday. The field is expected to be narrowed to two by the end of next week, and then around 160,000 Tory members decide which candidate they want to become the next party leader and prime minister. The result will be announced on 5 September. The remaining six hopefuls are now scrambling for support from the MPs who backed Mr Hunt and Mr Zahawi. Mr Hunttold the BBChe would be supporting Mr Sunak in the race. Mr Sunak, who quit as chancellor last week in protest at Boris Johnson's running of the government, told the BBC he felt ""great"" about the result. Leaving the Commons room where the vote was announced, Ms Mordaunt said she was ""very honoured"" by her showing. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? A spokeswoman for Ms Truss said: ""Now is the time for colleagues to unite behind the candidate who will cut taxes, deliver the real economic change we need from day one and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine. ""Liz has the experience to deliver the benefits of Brexit from day one, grow our economy and support working families."" Mr Tugendhat, a senior backbench MP, tweeted: ""This is a fantastic result. I'm delighted to be going through to the next round with the momentum we need to change this country for the better. Our country needs a clean start."" Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawi are both out of the race Meanwhile, Mr Hunt, who came second in the last Tory leadership contest, in 2019, said he had already had his ""big shot"" at getting the top job, adding that the Conservative Party had an ""exciting future"". But, amid accusations that the contest is becoming more bad-tempered and underhand, he added: ""A gentle word of advice to the remaining candidates: smears and attacks may bring short-term tactical gain but always backfire long-term."" Mr Zahawi, who took over as chancellor after Mr Sunak quit, said that role was now his ""priority"", adding: ""I don't plan any further intervention, but I wish all the candidates in the leadership contest the very best of luck."" The contest follows Mr Johnson announcing his resignation last week, after months of criticism over lockdown parties in Downing Street and other issues.

The big government plans put on ice,"The government's flagship Online Safety Bill - aimed at protecting children from harmful content - has been put on hold until the autumn when a new prime minister will be in place. Opposition parties have accused ministers of ""giving up on governing"" while Conservative MPs battle it out to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. Government sources have blamed the delay of the bill on Labour for using up limited Parliamentary time with a no confidence vote in the government. Labour has rejected the accusation arguing the government is in charge of the timetable. The bill is setto return to Parliament in the autumn,but a new prime minister may want to rethink the legislation or appoint a new culture secretary. One leadership contender, Kemi Badenoch, has said the bill is ""in no fit state to become law"" and that she would ensure it ""doesn't overreach"". Other big policy decisions are also in limbo, including: Tax has become a major battleground in the Tory leadership contest. Broadly speaking, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is arguing for no tax cuts until inflation is under control. The other contenders are all saying they would cut taxes if they become PM. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Tom Tugendhat - chairman of the foreign affairs committee - want to reverse a rise in National Insurance. Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt has promised to increase income tax thresholds for basic and middle income earners in line with inflation. The thresholds - the point at which people start paying the tax or paying it at a higher rate - are currently frozen for four years from April 2022. Next year, corporation tax is due to rise from 19% to 25%. However, some leadership hopefuls, including Mrs Badenoch have said they want to see corporate tax lowered. What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Boris Johnson freely admits that the cost of living crisis is the biggest domestic challenge his government faces. Before he announced his resignation, he had been expected to hold regular press conferences to highlight what the government was doing to help. These will not now happen, Downing Street said. Labour has urged the government to cut VAT on energy bills to help ease the cost of living crisis, while some of the Conservative leadership candidates - including Suella Braverman - have proposed a VAT cut on fuel. Asked whether the government would intervene if the cost of living crisis worsened, the PM's spokesman said it would not seek to introduce fiscal measures that would have a ""significant impact"" on the next prime minister. Food prices fall but bills may still keep rising The rising price of things like food and petrol, have led to demands for wage increases. Some sectors - rail workers and barristers - have gone on strike for better pay, while unions representing teachers and nurses have suggested they could also take action. When chancellor, Mr Sunak pledged public sector workers would see ""fair and affordable pay rises"" and a public sector pay review is still going ahead, despite his resignation. In past years, many of the decisions about the annual pay settlements have been made in the final days of July. Pay rises below inflation could lead to strikes, but there are questions over whether a temporary government would have the power to offer above inflation increases. With inflation at a 40-year high and heading for double digits, any decisions on this, including whether the Treasury provides the funds for rises higher than 2-3%, will not wait for the months' long completion of a leadership contest. Should public sector workers get bigger pay rises? The government has introduced a bill to scrap parts of its deal with the EU on post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland. The EU were very critical arguing the bill was illegal and would not work. Tim Durrant, of the Institute for Government think tank, says: ""There are strong feelings in the Tory party that the NI Protocol issue needs to be sorted and it will be a key topic during the leadership contest."" The government is hoping that the legislation will clear its Commons stages by the end of next week. But if a new prime minister wanted to rewrite the bill, they will have ample opportunity to do so when it goes through its Lords stages in the autumn, which may take several months, says the BBC's parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy. MPs reject changes to Northern Ireland Protocol Bill What Tory candidates think about Northern Ireland The plan to privatise Channel 4 - announced in May - delighted some Conservative MPs, but made others feel deeply uneasy. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has argued that government ownership is holding the channel back. But the move was also likely to face opposition in Parliament, particularly the House of Lords. A bill has not yet been introduced to Parliament and a new prime minister might decide to can it rather than face a potentially tricky battle. What could privatising Channel 4 mean? In office but not in power? What can and can't a ""caretaker government"" do? The basic principle is that the continuity Johnson administration can't pre-empt big decisions for their successor. So no major new policies, laws, public appointments... The trouble is - an unexpected event. Even caretaker governments still have to govern, and possibly take urgent actions - and this one has a cost of living crisis, a war in Ukraine and a continuing pandemic crowding its in-tray. And it may have to do quite big things in response. But non-urgent policy changes are now on hold. The key text on this is the Cabinet Manual (the rulebook for senior ministers) which will leave top civil servants to police the grey areas around what is urgent and what can await the new leadership. ""It becomes about responsible decision-making,"" says Dr Catherine Haddon of the Institute for Government think tank. It's a situation senior civil servants have to navigate when prime ministers step down, or lose a confidence vote, or call an election.

Green Man couldn't afford farm site - government,"Green Man returned to Glan Usk last summer Green Man festival had to rely on Welsh ministers to buy a farm on its behalf because the owners had ""insufficient funds"", government officials say. With events hit by Covid, a civil servant said it was ""unbelievably challenging to raise funds on the private market"". Ministers spent Â£4.25m on buying Gilestone Farm in Powys to help develop the wider Green Man business. Questions have been asked why it was bought without a full business plan. An outline business plan was submitted to the government in October 2021 and a full business plan presented at the end of June. Green Man festival is one of five large outdoor independent festivals in the UK. Held for 20 years at the Glan Usk estate in Powys, the festival attracts over 25,000 visitors annually and is estimated to generate over Â£10m a year to the region's economy. The festival is not expected to move from Glan Usk to the new site. Green Man bosses to run Welsh government farm Watchdog asked to probe Â£4m festival farm purchase Tears and joy as Green Man returns against odds Duringa Senedd committee hearing,external, Plaid Cymru MS Rhys ab Owen asked Welsh government officials: ""Is it usual practice to spend over Â£4m before having a detailed business plan?"" Andrew Slade, director general of the government's economy department, said an ""outline case"" was necessary but that it was ""perfectly possible, feasible, legal, properâ¦for government to engage in property purchases where we think that is going to deliver on Welsh government's policy delivery objectives."" ""It's not the first time we've done something of this sort,"" Mr Slade added. Mr ab Owen earlier accused Mr Slade of using ""a lot of buzzwords"" but not providing clarity as to the ""purpose of buying Gilestone Farm."" Mr Slade said it was about ""the wider business and development of the wider Green Man business"", adding it would include sustainable development work, farming activities and a ""range of other things that would allow them to keep the operation in Wales."" This video can not be played Festival crowds return with 25,000 at Green Man in 2021 Labour MS Mike Hedges asked why Green Man did not buy the farm itself: ""That would've cut out the middle man."" Mr Slade replied that the festival had ""insufficient funds to do that themselves"" with either ""not enough money to go ahead or the possibility of borrowing to go ahead to get the property needed to develop the business"". ""If our due diligence discovers that, unexpectedly, Green Man has the ability to fund all of this and do it off their own bat then there's no need for Welsh government to be involved. ""But that's not the basis on which we've had discussions over many years,"" he added. Fellow civil servant Jason Thomas, director of the government's culture department, said: ""At the time, February, when we were looking at all of this, for somebody running an incredibly large event, [it was] unbelievably challenging to raise funds on the private market. ""The event sector - absolutely decimated by Covid - even raising things like commercial insurance to protect you for an event was unbelievably difficult."" He said the Welsh government felt ""there was overwhelming merit in doing everything we could to retain them in Wales"". Swansea East MS Mike Hedges asked how much money Glastonbury and Notting Hill Carnival got from the Westminster government. Officials said they would have to find out. Mr Hedges told them it was ""not unadjacent to zero"". Tory MS Natasha Asghar asked why Gilestone Farm had been valued at Â£3.25m in February 2020 and Â£4.325m earlier this year. Mr Slade replied that land value had ""spiked very significantly - across the area as a whole it went up by a fifth in the succeeding 18 months or so"". He said added that ""further developments on the site to develop the business"" which made it more valuable. The Welsh government says it undergoing ""full due diligence and assessment"" on the Green Man business plan, submitted by business owner Fiona Stewart on 29 June 2022. If the plan is rejected, the Welsh government aims to sell or rent Gilestone Farm. Mr Slade told the committee he was ""confident"" it would retrieve ""most if not all of the value back on the purchase and maybe more"" if the project fell through. Ms Asghar also said a letter had been shared with the committee from a man who said he had ""ownership rights on sports...on the land and the property itself"". Mr Slade said they were aware of it when the purchase was made and they are in discussions with him. ""Rights of this sort apply on many properties, especially in rural areas and over large areas of land"". He said it might be the case if the brand was used for sporting events in the future more money could be spent on sporting events, but Mr Slade said it was ""subject to negotiation"". Inwritten evidence published ahead of the committee meeting,external, the Welsh government said it has been in discussion since 2019 about the ""need for Green Man to identify and establish a permanent base in Wales"". Green Man had received ""numerous approaches by various corporations to buy the brand in which case it could end up in moving from Wales"", according to the government. Supporting Green Man to this site ""would secure its future in Wales"", the document said. Green Man is said to have submitted an ""outline business plan"" in October 2021 and notified the Welsh government of the potential upcoming sale of Gilestone Farm in February 2022. The government said it paid Â£100,000 less than the farm's market value, assessed by the property company Knight Frank - a figure confirmed to BBC Wales. The property has been leased back to the previous owner until the end of October 2022 ""at a peppercorn rent in order to maintain and manage the property, harvest existing crops and honour existing [event] bookings."" ""The aim of the plan,"" the government said, ""is to provide the rationale and basis upon which the expanded activities and related business activities (food and drink and tourism) and retained agricultural uses will be financed, operated and expanded in due course. ""Green Man have provided assurances that the land would continue to be farmed and information on these plans has been included in the full business plan,"" it said. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said before the hearing: ""Many people trying to get into the agriculture business will look on with dismay as Welsh government buy up a productive farm which most farmers could only dream of."" Plaid Cymru's agriculture spokesman Mabon ap Gwynfor said: ""It seems that a business plan is being created retrospectively to fit the purchase of the land. This is completely at odds with what others have to do when applying for government assistance."" Fiona Stewart was asked to comment ahead of Wednesday's hearing.

'Being able to bond with my baby saved my life',"Kerry described the team at Uned Gobaith - which includes psychologists and midwives - as ""fantastic"" ""My baby wouldn't have had a mum to look after him had I not been here... this unit saved my life."" Like many first-time mothers, Kerry Nash was overjoyed when she became pregnant with her first baby. However, when her son Arwyn was born in December, she soon became ""completely consumed by sadness and depression"". ""I was so emotional and physically drained. I felt overwhelming sadness and emptiness,"" she said. Kerry and her baby were given a place at Uned Gobaith two days before Christmas. It is a specialist NHS unit near Neath that offers in-patient care to women across Wales who experience serious mental health problems during pregnancy. ""Even though you have this amazing bundle and have waited 9 months to meet them -  I was completely consumed by sadness and depression because the tiredness took over,"" Kerry added. ""It was the loneliest I've ever been."" More mental health help for new mothers unveiled 'I could feel myself getting worse and worse' 'I was in a psychiatric unit after I had my baby' This video can not be played Uned Gobaith: Unit at Tonna hospital looks after new mums The midwives who visited Kerry after she came home realised something was wrong, and after a discussion with the local mental health team, it was suggested she needed more specialised help. ""They said 'Kerry - you're not well, you really need to bond with your baby. ""There's this amazing new mother and baby unit - we really want you to go there',"" Kerry added. Kerry and Arwyn stayed at Uned Gobaith for 4 months. ""When I first came here it was really scary being in a place I didn't know. But straight away staff were here to help with every need. ""They cared for Arwyn as many hours as I needed so I could rest."" Uned Gobaith offers patients a shared living room, kitchen, nursery, garden and also a sensory and music room Uned Gobaith opened just over a year ago. It is the only specialist unit in Wales to offer in-patient care for mothers to stay with their babies. They can be admitted between 32 weeks of pregnancy and up to 12 months following birth. It offers help for women from across Wales who might have previously had to travel to England for care for conditions like post-partum psychosis, depression and anxiety. Uned Gobaith's service manager Anita Rees explained that ""prior to having the Unit here women experiencing severe mental illness during the perinatal period were forced to make really challenging choices"", such as travelling to England or being admitted to an adult mental health unit without their babies. Service manager Anita Rees said previously mothers would have had to travel to England, or be admitted to a mental health centre without their babies ""This is giving women access to the right care at the right time much closer to home,"" Ms Rees added. Uned Gobaith is designed to be a ""home from home"" for mothers and babies, explained ward manager Kirsten Pearce. ""When you walk into the unit it looks bright, colourful and appealing"" said Ms Pearce. Ward manager Kirsten Pearce said pregnancy can be one of the most challenging things for many woman ""There is a rose-tinted glasses view that having a baby is the best thing you'll ever do - it's wonderful amazing and there's nothing quite like it,"" she explained. ""Whilst that often is true we also know it's one of the most challenging and hardest things even for people who have a normal pregnancy."" In the communal lounge, Sarah and her baby Anakin, and Lauren and her baby Dexter, are listening to a harpist play songs ranging from Disney favourites to Welsh folk tunes. As part of this weekly session mothers and babies also have the chance to compose their own lullabies. Sarah says her baby Anakin loves the music played at the unit ""He is very much enjoying it,"" said Sarah as Anakin waved his arms to the tune, adding: ""Every baby seems to be drawn to music, he even sings along. ""This place gives me a sense of security where you can trust staff and make friendships with staff."" ""Dexter adores the music and also the sensory room,"" added Lauren. ""This place gives you the space to focus on your baby and yourself. It's given me back the joy of having Dexter."" Lauren said Dexter's social skills developed far quicker on the unit than they would have at home The unit looked after 34 mums and their babies on 39 different occasions in the year up until May 2022. A review of the service, provided by Swansea Bay University Health Board, is under way which will help determine its future. The Children's Charity NSPCC - insists the service should be retained and strengthened. ""The previous mother and baby unit closed in Wales in 2013. So we need to make sure it continues"" said Cecile Gwilym of NSPCC Wales. ""If the review shows the number of beds isn't sufficient to meet the need, we need this extended so more women are able to access the support they need."" Meanwhile Kerry Nash is no doubt of the value of Uned Gobaith. ""If I didn't have that help our story would have been very different ... I wouldn't have been able to do it. ""To be really honest Arwyn wouldn't have had a mum to look after him. This unit saved my life.""

"Disabled woman fined Â£1,000 for using disabled spot","This video can not be played Cerys Gemma cannot get out of her car when she uses the space outside her home A disabled woman faces fines of more than Â£1,000 for using a disabled car parking space outside her flat. Cerys Gemma, who lives in Cardiff Bay, said the space allocated to her flat is inaccessible for her. Instead, she has been using one of the parking spaces reserved for visitors with disabilities. Her property firm said it understood her allocated space was being used by a friend while she was attempting to park another car in a space for visitors. New Generation Parking Management, which manages the bays on behalf of Prospect Place Management, said the spaces have to be kept free for disabled visitors, not residents. The property management firm Ringley Group manages the building and homes at Prospect Place, but not the parking bays. Ringley Group said visitor spaces are available on a ""first-come-first-served"" basis and free to use - but vehicles must be booked in. Wheelchair user describes daily life as a battle Blind drag queen finds performing empowering The woman whose life is spent staring at a ceiling It also said a friend of Ms Gemma has been using the space that comes with her apartment, and she has been ""attempting on a continuous basis"" to use an additional visitor's space. Ringley Group added that with a short supply of spaces, it has been working with the local council to try and find a solution, which could be a ""space swap"", where Ms Gemma trades the one allocated to the apartment for another. Ms Gemma, 34, said she cannot use the space allocated to her waterside flat in Prospect Place. She explained that there is a pillar on one side, and another car parking space close on the other side. Ms Gemma says she cannot use the space allocated to her flat as there is a pillar on one side, and another car parking space close on the other side Ms Gemma said she had been in contact with the property management and parking companies, trying to explain why she needed to use a wheelchair accessible space. ""This has plagued me for two years and I just can't go on like this. ""I'm at breaking point and I've had conversations with people, and I've said this is the end, because I can't do this any more - something has to change. ""I'm not willing to be pushed out of my home because I'm in a wheelchair,"" she said. Ms Gemma has now been ordered to pay by the County Court. Cerys Gemma has been using a wheelchair since sustaining serious spinal injuries following a car accident when she was 17. She said the situation with the fines was now ""desperate"" and she is seeing a counsellor. ""It's hard enough anyway, and I try and be as graceful and patient with people who don't have accessible buildings, and I understand that it's hard, but I'm not being pushed out of my home because of a parking space when they've got eight accessible bays,"" she added. New Generation Parking Management said the eight spaces have to be kept free for disabled visitors, not residents. Disability rights lawyer Chris Fry, from legal firm Scott Montcrieff & Associates, said there is an obligation to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act. ""The reality is that if the space allocated to her is inaccessible to her because of her disability, then they're under obligation to make a reasonable adjustment, to maybe move that space or change it to a closer spot to the front door. ""If they don't, they're in breach of the Equality Act."" Ms Gemma said she worries every day that there will be another parking fine Mr Fry said a breach of the act could result in a company having to pay compensation for ""impact of the injury to feelings that the tenant has faced"", and that could mean fines of more than Â£1,000. New Generation Parking Management said: ""We want to make clear, if we allow one resident to utilise a disabled visitor space as their own, we would need to allow all requests from residents, which we have received over the years. ""This would no doubt reduce the availability of disabled spaces for disabled visitors."" Mr Fry thinks the firm may have misunderstood the Equality Act. ""That sounds like a typical misinterpretation of what equality means, it doesn't mean applying the same policy to everybody - equality means providing the same opportunity for outcomes. ""There is no disadvantage to them changing their policy, and prioritising, in fact legally, prioritising disabled people above other people is legal. ""It is within their gift to cancel those fines, that should be the first step they should take in terms of trying to rebuild the relationship,"" he said. New Generation Parking Management said it was simply enforcing the rules to which Prospect Place agreed when it was instructed to manage the site. Ms Gemma said she had been battling with the property and parking firms for two years and was at ""breaking point"" It said: ""We cannot make changes to these rules unless agreed by the board of directors, therefore in light of the continued distress that this is causing Ms Gemma we will take steps to ensure this is discussed at the next board meeting"". Ms Gemma said she simply wants to be able to live happily in her flat with the knowledge that she is able to park in an accessible space without the worry of more fines. ""Literally every day when I come down to my car I think 'here we go, is there going to be another ticket?', and it's awful"". A Ringley Group spokesman said New Generation Parking Limited was appointed by its client Prospect Place Management and has taken Ms Gemma to county court for parking fines, not Ringley. ""The lady in question has one car parking space that comes with a relative's apartment, but we understand from NGP that use of the parking space that comes with the apartment is currently being used by a friend,"" it said in a statement. ""This means that she has been attempting on a continuous basis to park an additional car on-site in a visitor space, despite already having been allocated one resident's car parking space. ""Residents' car parking spaces form part of the leasehold agreement and are not allocated by Ringley."" The company has met with council officials to try and solve the issue, and the statement added: ""One solution is for her to return her space back to the freeholder and then to sit down with the site team and identify spaces that might be suitable for her and for us to arrange a space swap with another owner. ""There is a short supply of visitor spaces, which are for use for all, which is why we cannot provide her permanent use of a disabled visitor parking space.""

NHS facing surge in demand as temperatures soarPeople are being urged to stay hydrated and look out for vulnerable people as the heat builds.,"The NHS is preparing for a surge in demand from people affected by rising temperatures in England and Wales. An extreme heat weather warning applies from Sunday to Tuesday as temperatures are due to peak in excess of 35C (95F) in south, central and east England. It means there could be a danger to life or potential serious illness. Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse said the first line of defence was ""behavioural change"" and the key thing was to ""prepare"" government services. Speaking after a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee, he said it was critical that people look out for ""the most vulnerable groups"". Weather forecasts suggest mid to high-30s for the weekend but Mr Malthouse warned there was a ""smaller possibility that we could exceed that and possibly hit 40 which would be an all-time record"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The key thing we can do is prepare the government services for what may be a surge in demand - not least the health service and elsewhere"". Ice in hats, ventilated suits - keeping cool at work What does hot weather do to the body? Extreme weather warning extended to Tuesday Is the UK getting hotter? Temperatures in the wider area covered by the warning are more widely predicted to be as high as 35C, peaking on Tuesday, the Met Office said. Forecasters say they could be as high as 39C in parts of southern and eastern England. People are being urged to stay hydrated, look out for vulnerable people, keep curtains closed and stay out of the sun in the middle of the day. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the latter half of the 18th century, and experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments make steep cuts to emissions. The Met Office said the hot weather was caused by high pressure over the UK and hot air flowing from southern Europe. A heatwave spreading across Europe has fuelledwildfires in Portugal, France and Spain. Pressures are already high onNHS services, with patients in England waiting longer for ambulances. Figures from June show that it took an average of 51 minutes for ambulances to respond to emergencies such as heart attacks and strokes - the target is 18. Emily Shuckburgh, professor of environmental data science at the University of Cambridge, described extreme heat as a ""silent killer"". More than 2,500 heat-related deaths were recorded in the summer of 2020, with the elderly especially vulnerable, she said. People are advised to find shade and avoid exposure to the sun during the middle of the day Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said older people who already struggle with significant health issues are ""going to find the coming heatwave a challenge"". She urged people to check on elderly relatives and friends during the high heat. Rail firm Avanti West Coast has warned of disrupted journeys over the coming days because of the extreme weather and staff shortages. It tweeted that services might be cancelled at short notice at the weekend, with amended timetables and extended journey times expected on Monday and Tuesday. Network Rail said it was preparing the railway to keep passengers safe ""ahead of next week's very high temperatures"". Meanwhile, teachers' leaders fear schools may have to cancel sports days to protect students and staff during the heatwave. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU teaching union, said: ""It is extremely dangerous to take part in vigorous physical activity in extreme heat, with the risk of heat exhaustion and even heat stroke."" James Bowden, policy director for school leaders' union NAHT, also called on the government to ""give urgent thought"" to improving school buildings, saying poorly ventilated classrooms are ""inconducive to work"". In other developments: Runners in the Rabbit Run trail race in Bridgend county on Saturdayhave been advised to go slowlyamid concerns about extreme heat. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned that the extreme heat and months of below average rainfall is causing concern. Richard Bramley from the NFU said the agriculture sector was ""way behind"" with water management and had not yet adapted to the changing climate. Hammersmith Bridge in west London, which was closed in 2020 due to a heatwave, has beenwrapped in giant pieces of foil to stop it from overheating. Plus, animals at a wildlife park in Oxfordshirehave been given frozen smoothiesmade from ingredients including pears and carrots to keep them cool.

Sturgeon wants to meet new PM for indyref2 talksThe first minister said she would potentially be willing to compromise on some details of her referendum plan.Scotland politicsComments,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said she was open to negotiation with Boris Johnson's successor. Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to meet the next prime minister for talks over her plan to hold an independence referendum next year. The first minister said she would potentially be willing to compromise on some of the details of the plan. But she said whoever replaces Boris Johnson would have no democratic endorsement from Scotland. Mr Johnson has repeatedly said that now is not the time for another vote on independence. And he has argued that the result of the last referendum in 2014 - when voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45% - should be respected. None of the candidates in the race to succeed him have shown any signs that they are likely to take a different approach. Speaking as she launched thelatest in a series of papers,externalmaking the case for independence, Ms Sturgeon predicted that the UK government would ""shift even further to the right"" regardless of who the next prime minister is when the result is announced on 5 September. She claimed that this could lead to a ""race to the bottom"" on issues such as tax, cuts to public services, support for families and Brexit. Where do Tory candidates stand on indyref2? Is there a mandate for an independence referendum? BBC iPlayer - Independence: Why Scotland Could Vote Again Ms Sturgeon added: ""Not once in my entire lifetime have the Tories won a majority, or even a plurality of seats in Scotland. Yet for around two thirds of my lifetime Scotland has had Tory prime ministers and policies. That is not democracy."" She argued that independence was the only way to end the ""starker than ever"" democratic deficit in Scotland. Mr Johnsonrejected her callfor another referendum to be held on 19 October 2023 shortly before being forced to announce he would be standing down as prime minister. The first minister said her preferred option was still for the two governments to come together to agree a process, as happened before the 2014 referendum, and said she would potentially be willing to compromise on some of the details. She said: ""If the new prime minister is open to that, I will be open to sitting down, and in a spirit of compromise, seeking to come to an agreement."" But she added: ""I'm not going to allow Scottish democracy to be the prisoner of a UK prime minister."" Supreme Court judges have been asked to rule on whether Holyrood has the power to hold an independence referendum Ms Sturgeon had earlier said that ""a prime minister with no democratic endorsement from Scotland is about to be replaced by yet another prime minister that Scotland hasn't voted for - and wouldn't vote for even if we were given the chance. ""All Scotland ever hears from UK politicians these days is democracy denial. They trade opinions on how many years it should be before Westminster might 'allow' us to make a democratic choice about our own future. ""Parties and policies that we reject are to be forced upon us - but the democratic right to choose an alternative is to be denied to us"". And she accused Labour of ""teaming up with the Tories to frustrate the will of the Scottish people"". The first paper in the series waspublished last month. It was described as a ""scene setter"", with the latest document making the ""democratic case"" for independence. Subsequent papers will look at areas including currency, tax and spend, defence, social security and pensions, EU membership and trade. There is pragmatism behind the politics from Nicola Sturgeon here. She is clear that she is no fan of any of the Tory leadership candidates, and that she doesn't think Scots would endorse any of them as prime minister. But equally, she would love to be able to thrash out a deal with whoever ends up in Downing Street, for an agreed referendum in the style of 2014. She does not hold all the cards on the process side of independence, and her backup plans of going to court or seeking to use a general election as a ""de facto"" plebiscite are fraught with difficulty. If the opportunity arose, she would grab the chance to enter talks and negotiate a way forward - even if it meant compromising on details. Anything would be better than the brick wall Boris Johnson has thrown up. But equally, none of the candidates are likely to want to plunge into a campaign at the very beginning of their time in office, alongside all of the other pressures they face. So even if she is still expecting another flat ""no"", Ms Sturgeon will hold out hope for a deal - and knows that looking reasonable in the face of intractable opposition will only help her cause. Ms Sturgeon has asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether Holyrood has the powers to hold a referendum if the UK government continues to refuse to give the formal consent that was put in place ahead of the last referendum in 2014. The Scottish government's top law officer, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain, has already said she""does not have the necessary degree of confidence""that it does. And the UK government hasurged judges to throw out the case, arguing that there is not yet any legislation for them to rule on and that it is clear that issues relating to the constitution are reserved to Westminster. If the Scottish government wins the case, Ms Sturgeon intends to quickly introduce and pass a referendum bill at Holyrood that would allow a vote to happen in October of next year. But if the Supreme Court ruling goes against her, she has said she would use the next election as a ""de facto referendum"" and attempt to use the result to trigger independence negotiations. Both the Conservatives and Labour have dismissed this plan - arguing that people would be voting on many different issues in an election, and not just on independence. Will there be another Scottish independence referendum? And they have said that Ms Sturgeon should be focusing on issues such as the cost of living crisis, health and education rather than another referendum. Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Donald Cameron said the first minister ""knows the vast majority of people in Scotland don't want another divisive independence referendum next year"". He added: ""They want her government focused on tackling the global cost-of-living crisis, helping our NHS to get through the ever-increasing backlogs in treatment and supporting our post-pandemic recovery. ""Yet, instead of getting on with the job at hand, she is using her official residence to spout SNP propaganda, which will only paralyse Scotland with years of bitter division and distraction. ""The nationalists are typically only interested in standing up for the democratic rights of those who agree with them."" Scottish Labour MSP Sarah Boyack said the first minister's ""increasingly desperate attacks"" on Labour were a ""tell-tale sign that her worst fear is a Labour government booting out the Tories out of office and building a better UK for everyone"". Ms Boyack said: ""When people across Scotland are crying out for help with the cost of living crisis, precious government time and energy is being poured into the SNP's endless attempts to whip up division. ""The last paper was nothing but fantasy economics and baseless promises of jam tomorrow, without a shred of clarity on the unanswered questions plaguing the SNP's reckless plans or any attempt to use the powers they have now."" According to polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice, recent polls have - on average - put support for independence at 48%, with 52% against, once ""don't know"" votes are excluded.

Italian PM quits as coalition collapses,"Mario Draghi was appointed last year by President Mattarella to lead Italy's post-Covid recovery Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has tendered his resignation after populist coalition partner Five Star withdrew its support in a confidence vote. The former head of the European Central Bank has led a unity government since February 2021. In a statement, he said the pact of trust that had sustained the unity government had gone. However, the president refused to accept his resignation. President Sergio Mattarella appointed Mr Draghi to lead Italy's post-Covid pandemic recovery, and save the country from endemic instability. He has now called on Mr Draghi to address parliament to provide a clear picture of the political situation. The effect of President Mattarella's intervention is not entirely clear. Mr Draghi is expected to go to parliament next Wednesday - and with sufficient backing could remain in office. The extraordinary developments in Rome capped a day of drama triggered when Five Star leader Giuseppe Conte refused to back the government's â¬23bn (Â£19.5bn) package of economic aid for families and businesses, arguing Mr Draghi was not doing enough to tackle the cost of living crisis. Giuseppe Conte's party said the government's economic package was insufficient to tackle a looming social crisis Even though the government comfortably won Thursday's vote in the Senate with the help of other parties, the man dubbed ""Super Mario"" had warned repeatedly that without Five Star's support the government could not continue. Mr Draghi paid a first, hour-long visit to President Mattarella and, after reflecting on his future, issued his statement of resignation. ""Today's votes in Parliament are very significant from a political point of view. The national unity majority that supported this government since its creation no longer exists,"" he said. After addressing ministers he returned to the Quirinale palace to tender his resignation to the president. Avoiding the cameras, he did not use the main door. Elections were already due early in 2023 and, if the government does collapse, a vote is likely to take place this autumn. Several parties on the right are keen on early elections, but a period of political uncertainty will jeopardise Italy's efforts to tackle a looming energy crisis and pass next year's budget to secure EU funding.

Italian government in crisis over confidence vote,"Giuseppe Conte has told the prime minister that his populist Five Star party will walk out during Thursday's confidence motion Italy's government under Prime Minister Mario Draghi is close to collapse after populist coalition partner Five Star pulled out of a major confidence vote. The ex-head of the European Central Bank has led a unity government since February 2021. But Five Star leader Giuseppe Conte accused him of not doing enough to tackle the cost of living crisis. Despite comfortably winning Thursday's vote in the Senate, Mr Draghi's political future is now in doubt. The prime minister has insisted repeatedly that the government will not continue without Five Star. After the vote he immediately set off to see President Sergio Mattarella, who was expected to ask him to remain in office. The two leaders spoke for an hour and Italian reports suggested Mr Draghi was reflecting on his future but had not submitted his resignation. A cabinet meeting was due to take place during the evening. If the man dubbed ""Super Mario"" does decide to stand down for lack of political support, Italians may be asked to go to the polls as early as this autumn. Thursday's vote was tied to a vote on a multi-billion package of economic aid for families and businesses. The â¬23bn (Â£19.5bn) package cleared the lower house last week but Mr Conte has warned that Italy is facing a serious social crisis that will erupt in September: ""We have to face the uncomfortable reality of our citizens."" Right up to the vote, attempts were made to resolve the crisis. Milan's stock market tumbled 3% as nervousness spread to investors. ""We are not taking part in the vote under this provision,"" announced Five Star Senate leader Mariolina Castellone. The populist party was initially the biggest in the coalition but has seen a string of defections. Its support has fallen over the last year and it is scrambling to regain ground. Former party leader Luigi di Maio accused Five Star of a cynical plan to bring down the Draghi government to revive its own support, while dragging Italy to economic and social collapse. The former ECB chief was appointed last year by President Sergio Mattarella to save Italy from its endemic instability and lead the post-pandemic recovery. But now Mr Draghi has been cornered by political turmoil in Italy's fragmented parliament. Italy's 'Super Mario' answers call of duty Elections are not due until next year, but parties across the political spectrum have the vote in their sights, especially on the right. Matteo Salvini of the far-right League and Giorgia Meloni of Brothers of Italy are competing for leadership of a potential right-wing coalition.

Bill Gates vows to drop off world's rich list,"Bill Gates and his ex-wife Melinda have donated billions to charitable causes Billionaire Bill Gates has pledged again to give his wealth away, adding that he will eventually ""drop off"" the world's rich list. It came as the Microsoft co-founder announced he would make a $20bn (Â£17bn) donation to his philanthropic fund. The world's fourth richest man said he had an ""obligation"" to return his resources to society. Mr Gates first pledged to give away his wealth in 2010 but his net worth has more than doubled since then. He is currently worth $118bn, according to Forbes magazine, but that will fall significantly after his donation in July to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the charitable fund he set up with his ex-wife in 2000.

In a Twitter thread, Mr Gates said the foundation would boost its spending from $6bn a year to $9bn by 2026 due to recent ""global setbacks"" including the pandemic, Ukraine and the climate crisis. ""As I look to the future, I plan to give virtually all of my wealth to the foundation,"" he said. ""I will move down and eventually off of the list of the world's richest people. ""I have an obligation to return my resources to society in ways that have the greatest impact for reducing suffering and improving lives.

Gates divorce puts spotlight on their foundation Solving Covid easy compared with climate - Gates How Bill Gates became 'voodoo doll' of Covid-19 The Gates Foundation works in countries to eradicate diseases such as Malaria, improve education and tackle poor sanitation. It was thought to be the world's second largest charitable foundation in 2020, holding $49.8bn in assets and is backed by other wealthy benefactors such as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Although the foundation has done good work, some have raised concerns about the ethics of a private endeavour wielding such great influence. The foundation is the largest private donor to the World Health Organization, second only to the US with its annual donation in 2018. Concerns about this became more pointed after former President Donald Trump threatened to pull US funding. Mr Gates held Forbes' title of the richest person in the world between 1995 and 2010, and again from 2013 to 2017.

Fleeing Sri Lankan leader lands in Singapore,"Protesters in Colombo celebrated at news of the resignation Sri Lanka's parliament has accepted ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation, ending rule by a family that wielded power for nearly 20 years. Mr Rajapaksa quit after fleeing to Singapore amid mass protests over his mismanagement of the economy. Sri Lanka is in the grip of economic chaos as it faces an acute shortage of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Mr Rajapaksa's resignation paves the way for the country to begin the process of electing a new president. Sri Lanka's speaker of parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said on Friday that he accepted Mr Rajapaksa's resignation, which he received late on Thursday. He has called for parliament to convene on Saturday to start the process of electing a new leader. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has been sworn in as acting president. Parliament has up to a month to elect a new leader, who could be Mr Wickremesinghe. Mr Rajapaksa fled to Singapore on Thursday from the Maldives, as huge protests roiled Sri Lanka. He is believed to have wanted to leave Sri Lanka before stepping down in order to avoid the possibility of arrest under a new administration. The embattled leader arrived in Singapore earlier on Thursday after first flying to the Maldives on Tuesday night. Reports say he is accompanied by his wife and two bodyguards. Singapore's foreign ministry said Mr Rajapaksa had not asked for asylum or been granted asylum. ""Singapore generally does not grant requests for asylum,"" it added. In the capital Colombo on Thursday, delighted demonstrators greeted news of the president's departure with dancing. ""We are beyond happy, but also beyond relieved so we can take a break and go back to our lives,"" Viraga Perera told the BBC. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa defied calls for his resignation for months but has now fled But the crowds appeared smaller than before after Mr Wickremesinghe imposed a fresh round of curfews on Thursday to quell protests. The streets of Colombo were calmer as anti-government demonstrators began leaving some of the official buildings they had occupied. ""We are peacefully withdrawing from the presidential palace, the presidential secretariat and the prime minister's office with immediate effect, but will continue our struggle,"" said a spokeswoman for the protesters. One person died and 84 others were injured during Wednesday's protests, which took place at key landmarks around the capital, Colombo, including the prime minister's office. Protesters broke into the presidential palace on Saturday and set fire to the prime minister's private home. Police fired tear gas at protesters attempting to break down the gates of the prime minister's office in Colombo, before finally forcing their way in. They later headed for parliament but did not get in. Wednesday saw some of the biggest demonstrations since the protests first began in April. by Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo The resignation letter Sri Lankans have been waiting for since people power toppled Gotabaya Rajapaksa has finally arrived. The letter does several things. Firstly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's position as acting president is legitimised. Under Sri Lanka's constitution the prime minister becomes caretaker leader in the event of the president resigning. Secondly, it clears obstacles blocking the holding of an election in parliament for a new president. MPs had been due to meet on 15 July and start this process, with a vote promised a week later. That was delayed by the lack of a resignation letter but now it has arrived the Speaker will be able to reconvene parliament. The two main candidates so far are likely to be Mr Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. But given the governing party has a majority, its MPs are likely to back Mr Wickremesinghe - who has close links with the Rajapaksas. Whether Sri Lanka's public would accept this is another matter. The prime minister's resignation, along with that of Mr Rajapaksa, has been a key demand of protesters. Thirdly, the resignation means Gotabaya Rajapaksa no longer has legal immunity as a head of state and his position is now more precarious as he tries to find a safe country to shelter in. This video can not be played Watch: Police fire tear gas at Sri Lanka protesters as they storm PM's office By Thursday, protesters had handed back the president's official residence to the authorities when the BBC visited. There were no protesters at parliament on Thursday afternoon, a BBC correspondent confirmed. ""We captured this building to show people power. We give it back the way we captured it and leave. We will come back in the next minute if needed,"" Danish Ali, a protester at the prime minister's office, told BBC Tamil.

Additional reporting by Zubaidah Abdul Jalil Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

Heard loses bid for new trial over wrong juror,"Amber Heard and Johnny Depp were in court in Virginia during the televised six-week trial Amber Heard has lost her attempt to have the verdict in her trial with ex-husband Johnny Depp thrown out because one juror served instead of his father, in a case of mistaken identity. A judge has denied Heard's request to declare a mistrial and hold a new one. Heard said the US defamation trial was flawed because a jury summons meant for one man was fulfilled by his son, who shares the same name and address. Judge Penney Azcarate said there was ""no evidence of fraud or wrongdoing"". The latest ruling comes six weeks after the jury in Fairfax, Virginia,decided that Heard had defamed Depp, the star of the Pirates of the Caribbean films, when she wrote an article saying she had been a victim of domestic abuse. He was awarded $10.35m (Â£8.2m) damages. The Aquaman actress won one of her counter-claims against him, awarding her $2m (Â£1.5m). Amber Heard speaks about online 'hate and vitriol' Depp gigs in Gateshead after Heard libel case win Ten moments that defined the Depp-Heard trial Judge Azcarate said the unnamed juror who did serve ""met the statutory requirements for service"" and had been questioned and approved by both sides in advance. ""The juror was vetted, sat for the entire jury, deliberated, and reached a verdict,"" she said. The televised six-week trial was one of the most high-profile celebrity cases for years. It came two years after Depp lost a libel trial in London against the Sun newspaper over similar domestic abuse allegations. That was decided by a judge and not a jury.

Deal in sight to end Ukrainian grain standoff,"Ukraine fears a big harvest shortfall if its stockpiles cannot be shipped abroad Talks aimed at resuming Ukrainian grain exports blocked by Russia in the Black Sea have produced a deal, Turkey said. It raises hopes for an end to the standoff, which left millions at increased risk of starvation. Turkey's defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said both sides had agreed on ways to ensure the safety of shipping routes for grain ships. He said the agreement would be signed next week, when more talks are set to be held in Turkey. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres called Wednesday's progress a ""critical step forward"". He said more work was needed to finalise the deal, which would require ""a lot of goodwill and commitments by all parties"". The intense fighting in Ukraine has threatened to push millions of people into food insecurity Ukraine has been able to send some of its grain and goods by road and rail, and a new naval route is opening up through the Bystre estuary in the Danube Delta. But only 2.5 million tonnes of goods were exported last month, much less than the eight million-tonnes it hoped to export,Ukraine's infrastructure ministry said.,external Russia's Black Sea fleet is said to be stopping any shipments getting in or out, and the BBC has documentedmounting evidence that Moscow's forces have stolen and exported Ukrainian grain.Other routes have been heavily mined. Ukraine optimistic on deal to reopen Black Sea But speaking from Kyiv during his nightly address on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to strike an optimistic tone. ""The Ukrainian delegation has reported to me that there is progress. In the coming days, we will agree on the details with the UN secretary-general,"" he said. Before progress was announced, diplomats said negotiations included plans for Ukrainian vessels to guide grain ships in and out of mined port waters. It was also suggested that Russia would be urged to respect a truce while shipments move and that Turkey - supported by the UN - would offer to inspect ships to allay Russian fears of weapons smuggling. It is important not to get carried away. This tentative deal on grain is undoubtedly good news, especially for the millions around the world who depend on Ukrainian exports for their daily bread. But an agreement on opening the Black Sea and some kind of wider peace deal are very different things. Undoubtedly, both sides will have had to make compromises in order to reach agreement in Turkey, but neither side will have had to make any fundamental concessions. There is no humiliating climbdown, no swallowing of pride in order to make this deal work. In short, there was a solution that was broadly acceptable to all parties. The same cannot be said for any theoretical peace deal. The aims of both sides are so fundamentally opposed, so mutually exclusive, that there is no way a compromise position could realistically be found and so the fighting will almost certainly continue. Most likely, peace talks will only come when one side realises it has lost on the battlefield, or at least can no longer stay the course. At that point, it may be less a negotiated settlement, rather more a conditional surrender. Russia and Ukraine produce 30% of the world's wheat supply. Before the war, Ukraine was seen as the world's bread basket, exporting 4.5 million tonnes of agricultural produce a month through its portsaccording to the International Chamber of Commerce.,external And while Ukraine has managed to get some exports through other channels, they have only partly compensated for the closure of the Black Sea, with export volumes down to about 30% of their pre-war totals. In May, Mr Guterres warned that the Russian blockade threatened ""to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine"". ""There is enough food in our world now if we act together. But unless we solve this problem today, we face the spectre of global food shortage in the coming months,"" he added. And in June, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of seeking to hold the world to ""ransom"" with the blockade. ""It is absolutely unconscionable,"" he said. ""That supply could help people around the world, it could help some of the poorest countries in the world."" PUTIN:What is Putin's plan now key region has fallen? WATCH:The Afghan refugee commanding Ukrainian troops UKRAINE:Hidden drone war precedes next battle in Ukraine READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Despite the news of progress in grain talks, Russian shelling of several major Ukrainian cities has renewed overnight.

Last month, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Mr Putin that his forces had completed the first stage of that plan by capturing Luhansk province. Meanwhile, near the southern city of Kherson. Russian state media reported that Ukrainian forces have renewed their offensive in the region by firing several missiles at the city of Nova Khakova.

"Millions start getting Â£326 cost-of-living paymentThe first Â£326 payment will be paid by the end of July, the government has said.","Cost-of-living payments are coming in various ways in the coming months Direct payments to help with the soaring cost of living are starting to be paid by the government into eight million people's accounts. Low-income households on means-tested benefits will receive the money automatically in their bank, building society or credit union account. The first Â£326 payment will be paid by the end of July, marked as ""DWP Cost of Living"", the government has said. A second instalment of Â£324 will be transferred in the autumn. Together, they are the largest in a package of payments from the government designed to help with rising prices, and specifically soaring energy bills. Even so, recipients can spend or save the money as they see fit. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Five charts that explain the cost of living crisis A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We are on track to process the first instalment by the end of July. ""All eligible households will automatically receive the first instalment, and no one needs to worry they will miss out. ""There will be a few unique cases - such as those who were not initially entitled but have gained entitlement upon appeal - who will be paid after July, as soon as possible."" Financial commentators say these payments will ease, but not cure, the financial strain families face this winter. ""It is a vital step in the right direction for those on lower incomes, but it is a small step back from the precipice after millions of people have edged ever-closer over the past few months,"" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It is a positive step for those on the lowest earnings, who have been hit three times harder than higher earners by rising prices. However, it is not enough to put people back where they were before price hikes."" The energy bill of every household will be discounted by Â£400 from October, and there will be extra payments to pensioners and people with disabilities. However, the prospect of a typical household's winter energy bill increasing by more than previously anticipated has also raised questions over whether more financial support will be needed soon. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The typical bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year, which follows a Â£700 a year rise in April. Those using prepayment meters have to pay slightly higher bills, and Citizens Advice has warned that the number of people seeking help because they cannot afford to top them up has reached a new record. When a prepayment customer does not top up their meter it is known as self-disconnection The charity said that, in June, it dealt with over 1,319 cases on its helplines of people on prepayment meters going without power, known as self-disconnection. There were no signs of the normal drop-off in cases during the summer months. The number of callers who were disconnecting from their energy supply and seeking help was already higher this year than for the whole of 2020 and 2021 combined, the charity said. Data seen by the BBC shows that Citizens Advice referred almost 700 people a day to food banks in June, almost 300 a day more than the same period last year.

Cifas, the fraud prevention organisation, has also warned that the rising cost of living and energy bills were providing criminals with new opportunities to steal victim's personal and financial information.

Millions start getting Â£326 cost-of-living payment,"Cost-of-living payments are coming in various ways in the coming months Direct payments to help with the soaring cost of living are starting to be paid by the government into eight million people's accounts. Low-income households on means-tested benefits will receive the money automatically in their bank, building society or credit union account. The first Â£326 payment will be paid by the end of July, marked as ""DWP Cost of Living"", the government has said. A second instalment of Â£324 will be transferred in the autumn. Together, they are the largest in a package of payments from the government designed to help with rising prices, and specifically soaring energy bills. Even so, recipients can spend or save the money as they see fit. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Five charts that explain the cost of living crisis A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We are on track to process the first instalment by the end of July. ""All eligible households will automatically receive the first instalment, and no one needs to worry they will miss out. ""There will be a few unique cases - such as those who were not initially entitled but have gained entitlement upon appeal - who will be paid after July, as soon as possible."" Financial commentators say these payments will ease, but not cure, the financial strain families face this winter. ""It is a vital step in the right direction for those on lower incomes, but it is a small step back from the precipice after millions of people have edged ever-closer over the past few months,"" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It is a positive step for those on the lowest earnings, who have been hit three times harder than higher earners by rising prices. However, it is not enough to put people back where they were before price hikes."" The energy bill of every household will be discounted by Â£400 from October, and there will be extra payments to pensioners and people with disabilities. However, the prospect of a typical household's winter energy bill increasing by more than previously anticipated has also raised questions over whether more financial support will be needed soon. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The typical bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year, which follows a Â£700 a year rise in April.

Netflix and Microsoft team up for cheaper service,"Netflix has said season four of Stranger Things has been watched for more than a billion hours Netflix has teamed up with Microsoft to offer a cheaper subscription plan to customers that will show adverts. The streaming giant says the service will be an ""addition"" to its existing plans, which do not include adverts. The company has not yet revealed how much it plans to charge subscribers for the new service. Netflix announced the move after it reported its first subscriber loss in more than a decade and cut hundreds of jobs earlier this year. Have we had enough of Netflix? Stranger Things to get spin-off play and series It lost 200,000 subscribers between January and March, compared to the 2.5 million analysts had been expecting the firm to add in the period. Netflix also now expects to lose a further two million subscribers between April and June. The company said it had selected Microsoft as its global advertising technology and sales partner to introduce a ""lower priced ad-supported subscription plan"". ""It's very early days and we have much to work through,"" Netflix's chief operating officer Greg Peters saidin a statement,external. ""But our long-term goal is clear. More choice for consumers and a premium, better-than-linear TV brand experience for advertisers."" Netflix never wanted ads. Its entire business model was built around monthly subscriptions. Yet Netflix executives have had to rip up their own rules. It comes after terrible figures showed that the company was losing subscribers. And the cost of living crisis has meant that households, tightening their belts, have looked at their Netflix subscription as a potential saving. Investors have been spooked. Netflix also has huge competition from the likes of Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Apple TV and Disney+. There are too many options and not enough paying subscribers to go around. To adapt, Netflix is creating a cheaper service - with adverts - that it says will be rolled out later this year. Spotify has a similar model, where music is free if you're happy to sit through commercials. The hope is that Netflix, by embracing ads, will attract new audiences. But the move also shows adverts, that were seen by high-end streaming companies as so passÃ© just a few years ago, are very much still alive and kicking. Netflix is trying to renegotiate the deals it has with major entertainment firms so that it can show adverts as part of its service, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. The firm has reportedly held discussions with Warner Bros., Universal and Sony Pictures Television. Warner Bros declined to comment. Universal and Sony did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. In April, Netflix saw $50bn wiped off its market value after the company disclosed the surprise fall in subscribers - the first drop since October 2011. The company, which had gained millions of subscribers during Covid lockdowns, said it had lost 700,000 subscribers from closing its service in Russia. It also blamed competition from rivals as well as people sharing their Netflix password with others. Last month, the firmannounced 300 job cutsas it grappled with the drop in customer numbers. Also last month, Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said it was in talks with several companies to find ways to appeal to price-sensitive audiences. ""We're not adding ads to Netflix as you know it today. We're adding an ad tier for folks who say 'Hey, I want a lower price and I'll watch ads',"" Mr Sarandos told an audience at a conference in Cannes.

Sturgeon sets out 'democratic case' for independence,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said she was open to negotiation with Boris Johnson's successor. Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to meet the next prime minister for talks over her plan to hold an independence referendum next year. The first minister said she would potentially be willing to compromise on some of the details of the plan. But she said whoever replaces Boris Johnson would have no democratic endorsement from Scotland. Mr Johnson has repeatedly said that now is not the time for another vote on independence. And he has argued that the result of the last referendum in 2014 - when voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45% - should be respected. None of the candidates in the race to succeed him have shown any signs that they are likely to take a different approach. Speaking as she launched thelatest in a series of papers,externalmaking the case for independence, Ms Sturgeon predicted that the UK government would ""shift even further to the right"" regardless of who the next prime minister is when the result is announced on 5 September. She claimed that this could lead to a ""race to the bottom"" on issues such as tax, cuts to public services, support for families and Brexit. Where do Tory candidates stand on indyref2? Is there a mandate for an independence referendum? BBC iPlayer - Independence: Why Scotland Could Vote Again Ms Sturgeon added: ""Not once in my entire lifetime have the Tories won a majority, or even a plurality of seats in Scotland. Yet for around two thirds of my lifetime Scotland has had Tory prime ministers and policies. That is not democracy."" She argued that independence was the only way to end the ""starker than ever"" democratic deficit in Scotland. Mr Johnsonrejected her callfor another referendum to be held on 19 October 2023 shortly before being forced to announce he would be standing down as prime minister. The first minister said her preferred option was still for the two governments to come together to agree a process, as happened before the 2014 referendum, and said she would potentially be willing to compromise on some of the details. She said: ""If the new prime minister is open to that, I will be open to sitting down, and in a spirit of compromise, seeking to come to an agreement."" But she added: ""I'm not going to allow Scottish democracy to be the prisoner of a UK prime minister."" Supreme Court judges have been asked to rule on whether Holyrood has the power to hold an independence referendum Ms Sturgeon had earlier said that ""a prime minister with no democratic endorsement from Scotland is about to be replaced by yet another prime minister that Scotland hasn't voted for - and wouldn't vote for even if we were given the chance. ""All Scotland ever hears from UK politicians these days is democracy denial. They trade opinions on how many years it should be before Westminster might 'allow' us to make a democratic choice about our own future. ""Parties and policies that we reject are to be forced upon us - but the democratic right to choose an alternative is to be denied to us"". And she accused Labour of ""teaming up with the Tories to frustrate the will of the Scottish people"". The first paper in the series waspublished last month. It was described as a ""scene setter"", with the latest document making the ""democratic case"" for independence. Subsequent papers will look at areas including currency, tax and spend, defence, social security and pensions, EU membership and trade. There is pragmatism behind the politics from Nicola Sturgeon here. She is clear that she is no fan of any of the Tory leadership candidates, and that she doesn't think Scots would endorse any of them as prime minister. But equally, she would love to be able to thrash out a deal with whoever ends up in Downing Street, for an agreed referendum in the style of 2014. She does not hold all the cards on the process side of independence, and her backup plans of going to court or seeking to use a general election as a ""de facto"" plebiscite are fraught with difficulty. If the opportunity arose, she would grab the chance to enter talks and negotiate a way forward - even if it meant compromising on details. Anything would be better than the brick wall Boris Johnson has thrown up. But equally, none of the candidates are likely to want to plunge into a campaign at the very beginning of their time in office, alongside all of the other pressures they face. So even if she is still expecting another flat ""no"", Ms Sturgeon will hold out hope for a deal - and knows that looking reasonable in the face of intractable opposition will only help her cause. Ms Sturgeon has asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether Holyrood has the powers to hold a referendum if the UK government continues to refuse to give the formal consent that was put in place ahead of the last referendum in 2014. The Scottish government's top law officer, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain, has already said she""does not have the necessary degree of confidence""that it does. And the UK government hasurged judges to throw out the case, arguing that there is not yet any legislation for them to rule on and that it is clear that issues relating to the constitution are reserved to Westminster. If the Scottish government wins the case, Ms Sturgeon intends to quickly introduce and pass a referendum bill at Holyrood that would allow a vote to happen in October of next year. But if the Supreme Court ruling goes against her, she has said she would use the next election as a ""de facto referendum"" and attempt to use the result to trigger independence negotiations. Both the Conservatives and Labour have dismissed this plan - arguing that people would be voting on many different issues in an election, and not just on independence. Will there be another Scottish independence referendum? And they have said that Ms Sturgeon should be focusing on issues such as the cost of living crisis, health and education rather than another referendum. Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Donald Cameron said the first minister ""knows the vast majority of people in Scotland don't want another divisive independence referendum next year"". He added: ""They want her government focused on tackling the global cost-of-living crisis, helping our NHS to get through the ever-increasing backlogs in treatment and supporting our post-pandemic recovery. ""Yet, instead of getting on with the job at hand, she is using her official residence to spout SNP propaganda, which will only paralyse Scotland with years of bitter division and distraction. ""The nationalists are typically only interested in standing up for the democratic rights of those who agree with them."" Scottish Labour MSP Sarah Boyack said the first minister's ""increasingly desperate attacks"" on Labour were a ""tell-tale sign that her worst fear is a Labour government booting out the Tories out of office and building a better UK for everyone"". Ms Boyack said: ""When people across Scotland are crying out for help with the cost of living crisis, precious government time and energy is being poured into the SNP's endless attempts to whip up division. ""The last paper was nothing but fantasy economics and baseless promises of jam tomorrow, without a shred of clarity on the unanswered questions plaguing the SNP's reckless plans or any attempt to use the powers they have now."" According to polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice, recent polls have - on average - put support for independence at 48%, with 52% against, once ""don't know"" votes are excluded.

Students says landlords tried to evict them to cash in on Open,"St Andrews will see its population swell for the period of The Open Students in St Andrews say landlords have tried to push them out of their rooms to make ""a whole lot of money"" out of visitors to The Open. The historic golf championship could see about 300,000 people visit the town which normally has a population of 19,000. As a result, accommodation in the area is currently fetching up to Â£1,000 a night. Legal experts said long-term renters could not be forced out. The Scottish government said tenants should seek advice and stand their ground. Wilson Jones confronted his letting agency over a clause in his tenancy agreement The 150th Open is being staged in St Andrews from July 14 to 17, with tourist numbers expected to boom before, during and after the event. Wilson Jones is a student who confronted his letting agency over a clause in his tenancy agreement. He told BBC Scotland's The Nine that his landlord had tried to evict him during The Open period. ""The contract that my flatmate and I signed said we were to vacate this place from the 9th to the 19th July,"" Wilson said. ""Over the course of the last seven months we were reaching out to our letting agency about how exactly that was supposed to work. The only response we really got was that we should just leave our things in the house and strip the bed. ""My landlord didn't care where I went, and they were going to make a whole lot of money out of it, presumably. It was ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous."" Wilson's landlord told us they planned to stay in the property themselves, and that they followed the guidance of their property agents. But Barry Will, from the tenants' union Living Rent, claims that similar things have been happening across St Andrews, and that clauses in the leases don't follow the correct practice of how a tenant should be evicted. ""We're seeing landlords charge extortionate rent increases over the period of The Open,"" Mr Will said. ""We're seeing landlords attempting to evict tenants across town. Really, what we're seeing is tenants across St Andrews being let down because of a golf tournament coming to town. ""The Open means a lot to St Andrews, but it shouldn't come at the cost of fracturing our community, and that's what we're trying to fight against."" Student Mia said her rent was due to increase by Â£4,500 during the month of The Open Student Mia, who doesn't want to use her real name for fear of repercussions when trying to find a flat next year, said her rent was due to increase by Â£4,500 during the month of The Open. ""We signed the lease last summer after quite a struggle trying to find properties. It was the only one we were able to get, so we knew, either we take this, or we don't have a house. ""At the time we saw in the lease where it said that if we retained it for the month of July, the rent would go up from Â£2,500 overall to Â£7,000 overall. ""We thought, we can't stay there for July, we can't afford to pay that much money. We just feel a bit powerless as tenants, because the landlords have the resources, the expertise, the lawyers, and we wouldn't know what to do."" The Scottish government brought in new laws five years ago to give more security to tenants. Legal expert Brian Gilmour, from Indigo Square Property, said that any clause requiring tenants to move out for a week, or which increases the rent of a property by unreasonable amounts, isn't enforceable under the new rules. ""If the landlord went to enforce that clause of asking the tenant to move out, and the tenant said, 'I'm not moving out', the tenant would be in the right,"" Mr Gilmour said. ""At the end of the day, this is not a holiday let where you sign a long-term lease, this is somebody's home. ""What you've got is someone dictating, you need to get out of your home for somebody else to make money out of your home."" Barry Will, from the tenants' union Living Rent, claims that similar things have been happening across St Andrews The Scottish government said there were clear laws and contractual terms that landlords must follow in order to rent properties in Scotland, and that includes in circumstances in which leases are terminated. Living Rent advises tenants to seek independent advice, for example via the Citizens Advice Bureau , Shelter Scotland, or student advice services. Barry Will said: ""What we really need now is proper action with the private house market, which almost a million people depend on, to ensure people can continue to live in their homes with dignity and with security."" Mia's letting agency denies that clauses within the leases they provide are unlawful, and that they act on behalf of their landlords and take their instructions. But Mia says it seems absurd that it would be so expensive. ""They know we're obviously not going to pay that, so they just want to kick us out. It just seems greedy.""

Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa flies to Singapore,"Protesters in Colombo celebrated at news of the resignation Sri Lanka's parliament has accepted ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation, ending rule by a family that wielded power for nearly 20 years. Mr Rajapaksa quit after fleeing to Singapore amid mass protests over his mismanagement of the economy. Sri Lanka is in the grip of economic chaos as it faces an acute shortage of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Mr Rajapaksa's resignation paves the way for the country to begin the process of electing a new president. Sri Lanka's speaker of parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said on Friday that he accepted Mr Rajapaksa's resignation, which he received late on Thursday. He has called for parliament to convene on Saturday to start the process of electing a new leader. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has been sworn in as acting president. Parliament has up to a month to elect a new leader, who could be Mr Wickremesinghe. Mr Rajapaksa fled to Singapore on Thursday from the Maldives, as huge protests roiled Sri Lanka. He is believed to have wanted to leave Sri Lanka before stepping down in order to avoid the possibility of arrest under a new administration. The embattled leader arrived in Singapore earlier on Thursday after first flying to the Maldives on Tuesday night. Reports say he is accompanied by his wife and two bodyguards. Singapore's foreign ministry said Mr Rajapaksa had not asked for asylum or been granted asylum. ""Singapore generally does not grant requests for asylum,"" it added. In the capital Colombo on Thursday, delighted demonstrators greeted news of the president's departure with dancing. ""We are beyond happy, but also beyond relieved so we can take a break and go back to our lives,"" Viraga Perera told the BBC. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa defied calls for his resignation for months but has now fled But the crowds appeared smaller than before after Mr Wickremesinghe imposed a fresh round of curfews on Thursday to quell protests. The streets of Colombo were calmer as anti-government demonstrators began leaving some of the official buildings they had occupied. ""We are peacefully withdrawing from the presidential palace, the presidential secretariat and the prime minister's office with immediate effect, but will continue our struggle,"" said a spokeswoman for the protesters. One person died and 84 others were injured during Wednesday's protests, which took place at key landmarks around the capital, Colombo, including the prime minister's office. Protesters broke into the presidential palace on Saturday and set fire to the prime minister's private home. Police fired tear gas at protesters attempting to break down the gates of the prime minister's office in Colombo, before finally forcing their way in. They later headed for parliament but did not get in. Wednesday saw some of the biggest demonstrations since the protests first began in April. by Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo The resignation letter Sri Lankans have been waiting for since people power toppled Gotabaya Rajapaksa has finally arrived. The letter does several things. Firstly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's position as acting president is legitimised. Under Sri Lanka's constitution the prime minister becomes caretaker leader in the event of the president resigning. Secondly, it clears obstacles blocking the holding of an election in parliament for a new president. MPs had been due to meet on 15 July and start this process, with a vote promised a week later. That was delayed by the lack of a resignation letter but now it has arrived the Speaker will be able to reconvene parliament. The two main candidates so far are likely to be Mr Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. But given the governing party has a majority, its MPs are likely to back Mr Wickremesinghe - who has close links with the Rajapaksas. Whether Sri Lanka's public would accept this is another matter. The prime minister's resignation, along with that of Mr Rajapaksa, has been a key demand of protesters. Thirdly, the resignation means Gotabaya Rajapaksa no longer has legal immunity as a head of state and his position is now more precarious as he tries to find a safe country to shelter in. This video can not be played Watch: Police fire tear gas at Sri Lanka protesters as they storm PM's office By Thursday, protesters had handed back the president's official residence to the authorities when the BBC visited. There were no protesters at parliament on Thursday afternoon, a BBC correspondent confirmed. ""We captured this building to show people power. We give it back the way we captured it and leave. We will come back in the next minute if needed,"" Danish Ali, a protester at the prime minister's office, told BBC Tamil. Central banker warns Sri Lanka faces shutdown Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? How Sri Lanka's war heroes became villains Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? Additional reporting by Zubaidah Abdul Jalil Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

Sri Lankan president Rajapaksa flies to Singapore,"Protesters in Colombo celebrated at news of the resignation Sri Lanka's parliament has accepted ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation, ending rule by a family that wielded power for nearly 20 years. Mr Rajapaksa quit after fleeing to Singapore amid mass protests over his mismanagement of the economy. Sri Lanka is in the grip of economic chaos as it faces an acute shortage of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Mr Rajapaksa's resignation paves the way for the country to begin the process of electing a new president. Sri Lanka's speaker of parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said on Friday that he accepted Mr Rajapaksa's resignation, which he received late on Thursday. He has called for parliament to convene on Saturday to start the process of electing a new leader. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has been sworn in as acting president. Parliament has up to a month to elect a new leader, who could be Mr Wickremesinghe. Mr Rajapaksa fled to Singapore on Thursday from the Maldives, as huge protests roiled Sri Lanka. He is believed to have wanted to leave Sri Lanka before stepping down in order to avoid the possibility of arrest under a new administration. The embattled leader arrived in Singapore earlier on Thursday after first flying to the Maldives on Tuesday night. Reports say he is accompanied by his wife and two bodyguards. Singapore's foreign ministry said Mr Rajapaksa had not asked for asylum or been granted asylum. ""Singapore generally does not grant requests for asylum,"" it added. In the capital Colombo on Thursday, delighted demonstrators greeted news of the president's departure with dancing. ""We are beyond happy, but also beyond relieved so we can take a break and go back to our lives,"" Viraga Perera told the BBC. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa defied calls for his resignation for months but has now fled But the crowds appeared smaller than before after Mr Wickremesinghe imposed a fresh round of curfews on Thursday to quell protests. The streets of Colombo were calmer as anti-government demonstrators began leaving some of the official buildings they had occupied. ""We are peacefully withdrawing from the presidential palace, the presidential secretariat and the prime minister's office with immediate effect, but will continue our struggle,"" said a spokeswoman for the protesters. One person died and 84 others were injured during Wednesday's protests, which took place at key landmarks around the capital, Colombo, including the prime minister's office. Protesters broke into the presidential palace on Saturday and set fire to the prime minister's private home. Police fired tear gas at protesters attempting to break down the gates of the prime minister's office in Colombo, before finally forcing their way in. They later headed for parliament but did not get in. Wednesday saw some of the biggest demonstrations since the protests first began in April. by Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo The resignation letter Sri Lankans have been waiting for since people power toppled Gotabaya Rajapaksa has finally arrived. The letter does several things. Firstly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's position as acting president is legitimised. Under Sri Lanka's constitution the prime minister becomes caretaker leader in the event of the president resigning. Secondly, it clears obstacles blocking the holding of an election in parliament for a new president. MPs had been due to meet on 15 July and start this process, with a vote promised a week later. That was delayed by the lack of a resignation letter but now it has arrived the Speaker will be able to reconvene parliament. The two main candidates so far are likely to be Mr Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. But given the governing party has a majority, its MPs are likely to back Mr Wickremesinghe - who has close links with the Rajapaksas. Whether Sri Lanka's public would accept this is another matter. The prime minister's resignation, along with that of Mr Rajapaksa, has been a key demand of protesters. Thirdly, the resignation means Gotabaya Rajapaksa no longer has legal immunity as a head of state and his position is now more precarious as he tries to find a safe country to shelter in. This video can not be played Watch: Police fire tear gas at Sri Lanka protesters as they storm PM's office By Thursday, protesters had handed back the president's official residence to the authorities when the BBC visited. There were no protesters at parliament on Thursday afternoon, a BBC correspondent confirmed. ""We captured this building to show people power. We give it back the way we captured it and leave. We will come back in the next minute if needed,"" Danish Ali, a protester at the prime minister's office, told BBC Tamil. Central banker warns Sri Lanka faces shutdown Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? How Sri Lanka's war heroes became villains Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? Additional reporting by Zubaidah Abdul Jalil Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

FM to set out 'democratic case' for independence,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said she was open to negotiation with Boris Johnson's successor. Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to meet the next prime minister for talks over her plan to hold an independence referendum next year. The first minister said she would potentially be willing to compromise on some of the details of the plan. But she said whoever replaces Boris Johnson would have no democratic endorsement from Scotland. Mr Johnson has repeatedly said that now is not the time for another vote on independence. And he has argued that the result of the last referendum in 2014 - when voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45% - should be respected. None of the candidates in the race to succeed him have shown any signs that they are likely to take a different approach. Speaking as she launched thelatest in a series of papers,externalmaking the case for independence, Ms Sturgeon predicted that the UK government would ""shift even further to the right"" regardless of who the next prime minister is when the result is announced on 5 September. She claimed that this could lead to a ""race to the bottom"" on issues such as tax, cuts to public services, support for families and Brexit. Where do Tory candidates stand on indyref2? Is there a mandate for an independence referendum? BBC iPlayer - Independence: Why Scotland Could Vote Again Ms Sturgeon added: ""Not once in my entire lifetime have the Tories won a majority, or even a plurality of seats in Scotland. Yet for around two thirds of my lifetime Scotland has had Tory prime ministers and policies. That is not democracy."" She argued that independence was the only way to end the ""starker than ever"" democratic deficit in Scotland. Mr Johnsonrejected her callfor another referendum to be held on 19 October 2023 shortly before being forced to announce he would be standing down as prime minister. The first minister said her preferred option was still for the two governments to come together to agree a process, as happened before the 2014 referendum, and said she would potentially be willing to compromise on some of the details. She said: ""If the new prime minister is open to that, I will be open to sitting down, and in a spirit of compromise, seeking to come to an agreement."" But she added: ""I'm not going to allow Scottish democracy to be the prisoner of a UK prime minister."" Supreme Court judges have been asked to rule on whether Holyrood has the power to hold an independence referendum Ms Sturgeon had earlier said that ""a prime minister with no democratic endorsement from Scotland is about to be replaced by yet another prime minister that Scotland hasn't voted for - and wouldn't vote for even if we were given the chance. ""All Scotland ever hears from UK politicians these days is democracy denial. They trade opinions on how many years it should be before Westminster might 'allow' us to make a democratic choice about our own future. ""Parties and policies that we reject are to be forced upon us - but the democratic right to choose an alternative is to be denied to us"". And she accused Labour of ""teaming up with the Tories to frustrate the will of the Scottish people"". The first paper in the series waspublished last month. It was described as a ""scene setter"", with the latest document making the ""democratic case"" for independence. Subsequent papers will look at areas including currency, tax and spend, defence, social security and pensions, EU membership and trade. There is pragmatism behind the politics from Nicola Sturgeon here. She is clear that she is no fan of any of the Tory leadership candidates, and that she doesn't think Scots would endorse any of them as prime minister. But equally, she would love to be able to thrash out a deal with whoever ends up in Downing Street, for an agreed referendum in the style of 2014. She does not hold all the cards on the process side of independence, and her backup plans of going to court or seeking to use a general election as a ""de facto"" plebiscite are fraught with difficulty. If the opportunity arose, she would grab the chance to enter talks and negotiate a way forward - even if it meant compromising on details. Anything would be better than the brick wall Boris Johnson has thrown up. But equally, none of the candidates are likely to want to plunge into a campaign at the very beginning of their time in office, alongside all of the other pressures they face. So even if she is still expecting another flat ""no"", Ms Sturgeon will hold out hope for a deal - and knows that looking reasonable in the face of intractable opposition will only help her cause. Ms Sturgeon has asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether Holyrood has the powers to hold a referendum if the UK government continues to refuse to give the formal consent that was put in place ahead of the last referendum in 2014. The Scottish government's top law officer, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain, has already said she""does not have the necessary degree of confidence""that it does. And the UK government hasurged judges to throw out the case, arguing that there is not yet any legislation for them to rule on and that it is clear that issues relating to the constitution are reserved to Westminster. If the Scottish government wins the case, Ms Sturgeon intends to quickly introduce and pass a referendum bill at Holyrood that would allow a vote to happen in October of next year. But if the Supreme Court ruling goes against her, she has said she would use the next election as a ""de facto referendum"" and attempt to use the result to trigger independence negotiations. Both the Conservatives and Labour have dismissed this plan - arguing that people would be voting on many different issues in an election, and not just on independence. Will there be another Scottish independence referendum? And they have said that Ms Sturgeon should be focusing on issues such as the cost of living crisis, health and education rather than another referendum. Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Donald Cameron said the first minister ""knows the vast majority of people in Scotland don't want another divisive independence referendum next year"". He added: ""They want her government focused on tackling the global cost-of-living crisis, helping our NHS to get through the ever-increasing backlogs in treatment and supporting our post-pandemic recovery. ""Yet, instead of getting on with the job at hand, she is using her official residence to spout SNP propaganda, which will only paralyse Scotland with years of bitter division and distraction. ""The nationalists are typically only interested in standing up for the democratic rights of those who agree with them."" Scottish Labour MSP Sarah Boyack said the first minister's ""increasingly desperate attacks"" on Labour were a ""tell-tale sign that her worst fear is a Labour government booting out the Tories out of office and building a better UK for everyone"". Ms Boyack said: ""When people across Scotland are crying out for help with the cost of living crisis, precious government time and energy is being poured into the SNP's endless attempts to whip up division. ""The last paper was nothing but fantasy economics and baseless promises of jam tomorrow, without a shred of clarity on the unanswered questions plaguing the SNP's reckless plans or any attempt to use the powers they have now."" According to polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice, recent polls have - on average - put support for independence at 48%, with 52% against, once ""don't know"" votes are excluded.

"Tory minister pushed for key role for donor - ex-MPAn ex-MP was urged to appoint a millionaire party donor to a group she led, court papers suggest.UK Politics","Mr Amersi has donated more than Â£500,000 to the Conservatives over the past four years A former Tory MP claims a government minister pressed her to help advance a party donor seeking a knighthood or peerage, court documents have revealed. Charlotte Leslie told a colleague that Lord Agnew - then a Cabinet Office minister - insisted she appoint millionaire Mohamed Amersi as chairman of an influential group she led. Ms Leslie also claims Mr Amersi told her such a role would help him secure an honour, the court documents allege. Mr Amersi is suing her for defamation. The documents have been disclosed by the courts for the first time as part of the legal action, which is pitting the two Conservative Party figures against each other. One is Mr Amersi, a businessman who has donated more than Â£500,000 to the Conservatives over the past four years. His Russian-born partner donated a further Â£260,000 to the party between 2017 and 2018. The other is Ms Leslie, who was MP for Bristol North West from 2010-17. She is managing director of the Conservative Middle East Council (CMEC), which promotes friendship between Tory politicians and the Middle East region. The court documents show Ms Leslie refused to appoint Mr Amersi to chairman of CMEC in 2020. She wrote to party colleagues and ""national security individuals"" about her concerns that Mr Amersi was trying to set up a rival organisation, the papers show. ""I have been told the party's board rejected two previous attempts because it concluded that Mr Amersi's primary objective is to secure a knighthood or peerage,"" she wrote to the CMEC's honorary president, Sir Nicholas Soames, in December 2020. ""Indeed, Mr Amersi has repeatedly been clear about this motive to me during his long and persistent campaign to impose himself as chairman of CMEC."" Lord Agnew told BBC News he had never met Mr Amersi in person Sir Nicholas - Sir Winston Churchill's grandson, who stood down as one of the Conservative Party's longest-standing MPs at the last election after falling out with the leadership over Brexit - forwarded Ms Leslie's concerns to Ben Elliot, co-chairman of the party. A few weeks later, Ms Leslie sent another note to Sir Nicholas, alleging a Conservative Party HQ staff member had contacted her, in July 2020. She said it was to discuss the party's work with special-interest affiliates such as CMEC - often known as Conservative ""friends of"" groups - and ""Mr Amersi's ambitions"". ""I explained that it would not be appropriate for him to become chairman of CMEC in return for money,"" she wrote. Redacted court papers also reveal how Ms Leslie claims to have been telephoned in September 2020 by an individual who the BBC has identified as Lord Agnew. She says he had been ""irate"" that she had considered ""his friend"" Mr Amersi unsuitable for the role as chairman. ""He insisted that CMEC should appoint him as chairman because he will give more money than anyone else and that he is a 'doer',"" she wrote. Lord Agnew described how Mr Amersi had helped him source personal protective equipment from the United Arab Emirates during the pandemic and ""demanded"" she arrange a meeting, Ms Leslie says. Writing to Sir Nicholas, she said at that meeting, Mr Amersi had told her ""he had given a lot of time and money to the party and now wanted his due recognition"". ""He said he wanted to be chairman of a 'friend of' group and was candid that such chairmen usually got a knighthood or a peerage and that he wanted one,"" she wrote. Charlotte Leslie is managing director of Conservative Middle East Council (CMEC) Mr Amersi accuses Ms Leslie of ""inaccurately recording"" their discussions and publishing a series of documents containing ""highly defamatory"" allegations to influential individuals. Through his lawyers, he told the BBC it was ""categorically false"" that he had acted with the objective of securing an honour or that his proposed organisation had been rejected by the party. Lord Agnew told BBC News he had never met Mr Amersi in person but the businessman had helped provide key materials needed to manufacture facemasks during the pandemic. ""So Ms Leslie was right when I described Mr Amersi as a 'doer',"" he said. ""In my limited dealings with him he definitely had been. ""However, beyond that she is wrong in her assertion that he was a good friend. She is also wrong in suggesting I was irate about anything so far from my area of responsibility. ""I merely suggested that he was in my judgement, given my experience of him, a credible potential candidate as chairman of her organisation. The idea that I demanded she meet him is rubbish. I suggested she meet. I thought she would find it helpful."" Ms Leslie told BBC News: ""The court case relates to confidential memoranda that were sent in good faith to a small number of people who had a legitimate interest in the subject matter, which have become public as a result of this legal action. ""I have no comment other than I am vigorously defending the claim."" In June 2021, Mr Amersi began a claim against Ms Leslie, alleging these ""highly defamatory"" memos breached data-protection law. But just before that trial began, in March, he dropped the case, telling the Financial Times he would ""seek vindication"" through these libel proceedings. These cases can cost many hundreds of thousands of pounds and MPs have argued they are used by the rich and powerful to silence critics. Mr Amersi has retained leading London lawyers Carter Ruck, who specialise in reputation management. In January, Tory MP David Davis told Parliament Ms Leslie ""would probably have to sell her home and lose all her savings"" if she had to pay costs. The judge in the current case made an order last month that both sides should disclose their costs. Mr Amersi's lawyers objected to the order. But Mr Justice Nicklin said the court would want to look carefully at the history of this litigation, ""to see whether it is being conducted efficiently, for a legitimate purpose and at proportionate cost"".

Deal in sight to end Ukrainian grain standoffRussia's blockade has seen exports collapse and raised fears of food shortages in developing nations.Europe,"Ukraine fears a big harvest shortfall if its stockpiles cannot be shipped abroad Talks aimed at resuming Ukrainian grain exports blocked by Russia in the Black Sea have produced a deal, Turkey said. It raises hopes for an end to the standoff, which left millions at increased risk of starvation. Turkey's defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said both sides had agreed on ways to ensure the safety of shipping routes for grain ships. He said the agreement would be signed next week, when more talks are set to be held in Turkey. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres called Wednesday's progress a ""critical step forward"". He said more work was needed to finalise the deal, which would require ""a lot of goodwill and commitments by all parties"". The intense fighting in Ukraine has threatened to push millions of people into food insecurity Ukraine has been able to send some of its grain and goods by road and rail, and a new naval route is opening up through the Bystre estuary in the Danube Delta. But only 2.5 million tonnes of goods were exported last month, much less than the eight million-tonnes it hoped to export,Ukraine's infrastructure ministry said.,external Russia's Black Sea fleet is said to be stopping any shipments getting in or out, and the BBC has documentedmounting evidence that Moscow's forces have stolen and exported Ukrainian grain.Other routes have been heavily mined. Ukraine optimistic on deal to reopen Black Sea But speaking from Kyiv during his nightly address on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to strike an optimistic tone. ""The Ukrainian delegation has reported to me that there is progress. In the coming days, we will agree on the details with the UN secretary-general,"" he said. Before progress was announced, diplomats said negotiations included plans for Ukrainian vessels to guide grain ships in and out of mined port waters. It was also suggested that Russia would be urged to respect a truce while shipments move and that Turkey - supported by the UN - would offer to inspect ships to allay Russian fears of weapons smuggling. It is important not to get carried away. This tentative deal on grain is undoubtedly good news, especially for the millions around the world who depend on Ukrainian exports for their daily bread. But an agreement on opening the Black Sea and some kind of wider peace deal are very different things. Undoubtedly, both sides will have had to make compromises in order to reach agreement in Turkey, but neither side will have had to make any fundamental concessions. There is no humiliating climbdown, no swallowing of pride in order to make this deal work. In short, there was a solution that was broadly acceptable to all parties. The same cannot be said for any theoretical peace deal. The aims of both sides are so fundamentally opposed, so mutually exclusive, that there is no way a compromise position could realistically be found and so the fighting will almost certainly continue. Most likely, peace talks will only come when one side realises it has lost on the battlefield, or at least can no longer stay the course. At that point, it may be less a negotiated settlement, rather more a conditional surrender. Russia and Ukraine produce 30% of the world's wheat supply. Before the war, Ukraine was seen as the world's bread basket, exporting 4.5 million tonnes of agricultural produce a month through its portsaccording to the International Chamber of Commerce.,external And while Ukraine has managed to get some exports through other channels, they have only partly compensated for the closure of the Black Sea, with export volumes down to about 30% of their pre-war totals. In May, Mr Guterres warned that the Russian blockade threatened ""to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine"".

One dead and 84 injured in Sri Lanka protests,"Protesters in Colombo celebrated at news of the resignation Sri Lanka's parliament has accepted ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation, ending rule by a family that wielded power for nearly 20 years. Mr Rajapaksa quit after fleeing to Singapore amid mass protests over his mismanagement of the economy. Sri Lanka is in the grip of economic chaos as it faces an acute shortage of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Mr Rajapaksa's resignation paves the way for the country to begin the process of electing a new president. Sri Lanka's speaker of parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said on Friday that he accepted Mr Rajapaksa's resignation, which he received late on Thursday. He has called for parliament to convene on Saturday to start the process of electing a new leader. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has been sworn in as acting president. Parliament has up to a month to elect a new leader, who could be Mr Wickremesinghe. Mr Rajapaksa fled to Singapore on Thursday from the Maldives, as huge protests roiled Sri Lanka. He is believed to have wanted to leave Sri Lanka before stepping down in order to avoid the possibility of arrest under a new administration. The embattled leader arrived in Singapore earlier on Thursday after first flying to the Maldives on Tuesday night. Reports say he is accompanied by his wife and two bodyguards. Singapore's foreign ministry said Mr Rajapaksa had not asked for asylum or been granted asylum. ""Singapore generally does not grant requests for asylum,"" it added. In the capital Colombo on Thursday, delighted demonstrators greeted news of the president's departure with dancing. ""We are beyond happy, but also beyond relieved so we can take a break and go back to our lives,"" Viraga Perera told the BBC. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa defied calls for his resignation for months but has now fled But the crowds appeared smaller than before after Mr Wickremesinghe imposed a fresh round of curfews on Thursday to quell protests. The streets of Colombo were calmer as anti-government demonstrators began leaving some of the official buildings they had occupied. ""We are peacefully withdrawing from the presidential palace, the presidential secretariat and the prime minister's office with immediate effect, but will continue our struggle,"" said a spokeswoman for the protesters. One person died and 84 others were injured during Wednesday's protests, which took place at key landmarks around the capital, Colombo, including the prime minister's office. Protesters broke into the presidential palace on Saturday and set fire to the prime minister's private home. Police fired tear gas at protesters attempting to break down the gates of the prime minister's office in Colombo, before finally forcing their way in. They later headed for parliament but did not get in. Wednesday saw some of the biggest demonstrations since the protests first began in April. by Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo The resignation letter Sri Lankans have been waiting for since people power toppled Gotabaya Rajapaksa has finally arrived. The letter does several things. Firstly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's position as acting president is legitimised. Under Sri Lanka's constitution the prime minister becomes caretaker leader in the event of the president resigning. Secondly, it clears obstacles blocking the holding of an election in parliament for a new president. MPs had been due to meet on 15 July and start this process, with a vote promised a week later. That was delayed by the lack of a resignation letter but now it has arrived the Speaker will be able to reconvene parliament. The two main candidates so far are likely to be Mr Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. But given the governing party has a majority, its MPs are likely to back Mr Wickremesinghe - who has close links with the Rajapaksas. Whether Sri Lanka's public would accept this is another matter. The prime minister's resignation, along with that of Mr Rajapaksa, has been a key demand of protesters. Thirdly, the resignation means Gotabaya Rajapaksa no longer has legal immunity as a head of state and his position is now more precarious as he tries to find a safe country to shelter in. This video can not be played Watch: Police fire tear gas at Sri Lanka protesters as they storm PM's office By Thursday, protesters had handed back the president's official residence to the authorities when the BBC visited. There were no protesters at parliament on Thursday afternoon, a BBC correspondent confirmed. ""We captured this building to show people power. We give it back the way we captured it and leave. We will come back in the next minute if needed,"" Danish Ali, a protester at the prime minister's office, told BBC Tamil.

Additional reporting by Zubaidah Abdul Jalil Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

"Disabled woman fined Â£1,000 for parking in disabled spot","This video can not be played Cerys Gemma cannot get out of her car when she uses the space outside her home A disabled woman faces fines of more than Â£1,000 for using a disabled car parking space outside her flat. Cerys Gemma, who lives in Cardiff Bay, said the space allocated to her flat is inaccessible for her. Instead, she has been using one of the parking spaces reserved for visitors with disabilities. Her property firm said it understood her allocated space was being used by a friend while she was attempting to park another car in a space for visitors. New Generation Parking Management, which manages the bays on behalf of Prospect Place Management, said the spaces have to be kept free for disabled visitors, not residents. The property management firm Ringley Group manages the building and homes at Prospect Place, but not the parking bays. Ringley Group said visitor spaces are available on a ""first-come-first-served"" basis and free to use - but vehicles must be booked in. Wheelchair user describes daily life as a battle Blind drag queen finds performing empowering The woman whose life is spent staring at a ceiling It also said a friend of Ms Gemma has been using the space that comes with her apartment, and she has been ""attempting on a continuous basis"" to use an additional visitor's space. Ringley Group added that with a short supply of spaces, it has been working with the local council to try and find a solution, which could be a ""space swap"", where Ms Gemma trades the one allocated to the apartment for another. Ms Gemma, 34, said she cannot use the space allocated to her waterside flat in Prospect Place. She explained that there is a pillar on one side, and another car parking space close on the other side. Ms Gemma says she cannot use the space allocated to her flat as there is a pillar on one side, and another car parking space close on the other side Ms Gemma said she had been in contact with the property management and parking companies, trying to explain why she needed to use a wheelchair accessible space. ""This has plagued me for two years and I just can't go on like this. ""I'm at breaking point and I've had conversations with people, and I've said this is the end, because I can't do this any more - something has to change. ""I'm not willing to be pushed out of my home because I'm in a wheelchair,"" she said. Ms Gemma has now been ordered to pay by the County Court. Cerys Gemma has been using a wheelchair since sustaining serious spinal injuries following a car accident when she was 17. She said the situation with the fines was now ""desperate"" and she is seeing a counsellor. ""It's hard enough anyway, and I try and be as graceful and patient with people who don't have accessible buildings, and I understand that it's hard, but I'm not being pushed out of my home because of a parking space when they've got eight accessible bays,"" she added. New Generation Parking Management said the eight spaces have to be kept free for disabled visitors, not residents. Disability rights lawyer Chris Fry, from legal firm Scott Montcrieff & Associates, said there is an obligation to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act. ""The reality is that if the space allocated to her is inaccessible to her because of her disability, then they're under obligation to make a reasonable adjustment, to maybe move that space or change it to a closer spot to the front door. ""If they don't, they're in breach of the Equality Act."" Ms Gemma said she worries every day that there will be another parking fine Mr Fry said a breach of the act could result in a company having to pay compensation for ""impact of the injury to feelings that the tenant has faced"", and that could mean fines of more than Â£1,000. New Generation Parking Management said: ""We want to make clear, if we allow one resident to utilise a disabled visitor space as their own, we would need to allow all requests from residents, which we have received over the years. ""This would no doubt reduce the availability of disabled spaces for disabled visitors."" Mr Fry thinks the firm may have misunderstood the Equality Act. ""That sounds like a typical misinterpretation of what equality means, it doesn't mean applying the same policy to everybody - equality means providing the same opportunity for outcomes. ""There is no disadvantage to them changing their policy, and prioritising, in fact legally, prioritising disabled people above other people is legal. ""It is within their gift to cancel those fines, that should be the first step they should take in terms of trying to rebuild the relationship,"" he said. New Generation Parking Management said it was simply enforcing the rules to which Prospect Place agreed when it was instructed to manage the site. Ms Gemma said she had been battling with the property and parking firms for two years and was at ""breaking point"" It said: ""We cannot make changes to these rules unless agreed by the board of directors, therefore in light of the continued distress that this is causing Ms Gemma we will take steps to ensure this is discussed at the next board meeting"". Ms Gemma said she simply wants to be able to live happily in her flat with the knowledge that she is able to park in an accessible space without the worry of more fines. ""Literally every day when I come down to my car I think 'here we go, is there going to be another ticket?', and it's awful"". A Ringley Group spokesman said New Generation Parking Limited was appointed by its client Prospect Place Management and has taken Ms Gemma to county court for parking fines, not Ringley. ""The lady in question has one car parking space that comes with a relative's apartment, but we understand from NGP that use of the parking space that comes with the apartment is currently being used by a friend,"" it said in a statement. ""This means that she has been attempting on a continuous basis to park an additional car on-site in a visitor space, despite already having been allocated one resident's car parking space. ""Residents' car parking spaces form part of the leasehold agreement and are not allocated by Ringley."" The company has met with council officials to try and solve the issue, and the statement added: ""One solution is for her to return her space back to the freeholder and then to sit down with the site team and identify spaces that might be suitable for her and for us to arrange a space swap with another owner. ""There is a short supply of visitor spaces, which are for use for all, which is why we cannot provide her permanent use of a disabled visitor parking space.""

Green Man festival plan for government-owned farm,"Green Man returned to Glan Usk last summer Green Man festival had to rely on Welsh ministers to buy a farm on its behalf because the owners had ""insufficient funds"", government officials say. With events hit by Covid, a civil servant said it was ""unbelievably challenging to raise funds on the private market"". Ministers spent Â£4.25m on buying Gilestone Farm in Powys to help develop the wider Green Man business. Questions have been asked why it was bought without a full business plan. An outline business plan was submitted to the government in October 2021 and a full business plan presented at the end of June. Green Man festival is one of five large outdoor independent festivals in the UK. Held for 20 years at the Glan Usk estate in Powys, the festival attracts over 25,000 visitors annually and is estimated to generate over Â£10m a year to the region's economy. The festival is not expected to move from Glan Usk to the new site. Green Man bosses to run Welsh government farm Watchdog asked to probe Â£4m festival farm purchase Tears and joy as Green Man returns against odds Duringa Senedd committee hearing,external, Plaid Cymru MS Rhys ab Owen asked Welsh government officials: ""Is it usual practice to spend over Â£4m before having a detailed business plan?"" Andrew Slade, director general of the government's economy department, said an ""outline case"" was necessary but that it was ""perfectly possible, feasible, legal, properâ¦for government to engage in property purchases where we think that is going to deliver on Welsh government's policy delivery objectives."" ""It's not the first time we've done something of this sort,"" Mr Slade added. Mr ab Owen earlier accused Mr Slade of using ""a lot of buzzwords"" but not providing clarity as to the ""purpose of buying Gilestone Farm."" Mr Slade said it was about ""the wider business and development of the wider Green Man business"", adding it would include sustainable development work, farming activities and a ""range of other things that would allow them to keep the operation in Wales."" This video can not be played Festival crowds return with 25,000 at Green Man in 2021 Labour MS Mike Hedges asked why Green Man did not buy the farm itself: ""That would've cut out the middle man."" Mr Slade replied that the festival had ""insufficient funds to do that themselves"" with either ""not enough money to go ahead or the possibility of borrowing to go ahead to get the property needed to develop the business"". ""If our due diligence discovers that, unexpectedly, Green Man has the ability to fund all of this and do it off their own bat then there's no need for Welsh government to be involved. ""But that's not the basis on which we've had discussions over many years,"" he added. Fellow civil servant Jason Thomas, director of the government's culture department, said: ""At the time, February, when we were looking at all of this, for somebody running an incredibly large event, [it was] unbelievably challenging to raise funds on the private market. ""The event sector - absolutely decimated by Covid - even raising things like commercial insurance to protect you for an event was unbelievably difficult."" He said the Welsh government felt ""there was overwhelming merit in doing everything we could to retain them in Wales"". Swansea East MS Mike Hedges asked how much money Glastonbury and Notting Hill Carnival got from the Westminster government. Officials said they would have to find out. Mr Hedges told them it was ""not unadjacent to zero"". Tory MS Natasha Asghar asked why Gilestone Farm had been valued at Â£3.25m in February 2020 and Â£4.325m earlier this year. Mr Slade replied that land value had ""spiked very significantly - across the area as a whole it went up by a fifth in the succeeding 18 months or so"". He said added that ""further developments on the site to develop the business"" which made it more valuable. The Welsh government says it undergoing ""full due diligence and assessment"" on the Green Man business plan, submitted by business owner Fiona Stewart on 29 June 2022. If the plan is rejected, the Welsh government aims to sell or rent Gilestone Farm. Mr Slade told the committee he was ""confident"" it would retrieve ""most if not all of the value back on the purchase and maybe more"" if the project fell through. Ms Asghar also said a letter had been shared with the committee from a man who said he had ""ownership rights on sports...on the land and the property itself"". Mr Slade said they were aware of it when the purchase was made and they are in discussions with him. ""Rights of this sort apply on many properties, especially in rural areas and over large areas of land"". He said it might be the case if the brand was used for sporting events in the future more money could be spent on sporting events, but Mr Slade said it was ""subject to negotiation"". Inwritten evidence published ahead of the committee meeting,external, the Welsh government said it has been in discussion since 2019 about the ""need for Green Man to identify and establish a permanent base in Wales"". Green Man had received ""numerous approaches by various corporations to buy the brand in which case it could end up in moving from Wales"", according to the government. Supporting Green Man to this site ""would secure its future in Wales"", the document said. Green Man is said to have submitted an ""outline business plan"" in October 2021 and notified the Welsh government of the potential upcoming sale of Gilestone Farm in February 2022. The government said it paid Â£100,000 less than the farm's market value, assessed by the property company Knight Frank - a figure confirmed to BBC Wales. The property has been leased back to the previous owner until the end of October 2022 ""at a peppercorn rent in order to maintain and manage the property, harvest existing crops and honour existing [event] bookings."" ""The aim of the plan,"" the government said, ""is to provide the rationale and basis upon which the expanded activities and related business activities (food and drink and tourism) and retained agricultural uses will be financed, operated and expanded in due course. ""Green Man have provided assurances that the land would continue to be farmed and information on these plans has been included in the full business plan,"" it said. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said before the hearing: ""Many people trying to get into the agriculture business will look on with dismay as Welsh government buy up a productive farm which most farmers could only dream of."" Plaid Cymru's agriculture spokesman Mabon ap Gwynfor said: ""It seems that a business plan is being created retrospectively to fit the purchase of the land. This is completely at odds with what others have to do when applying for government assistance."" Fiona Stewart was asked to comment ahead of Wednesday's hearing.

First cost-of-living payments start to arrive,"Cost-of-living payments are coming in various ways in the coming months Direct payments to help with the soaring cost of living are starting to be paid by the government into eight million people's accounts. Low-income households on means-tested benefits will receive the money automatically in their bank, building society or credit union account. The first Â£326 payment will be paid by the end of July, marked as ""DWP Cost of Living"", the government has said. A second instalment of Â£324 will be transferred in the autumn. Together, they are the largest in a package of payments from the government designed to help with rising prices, and specifically soaring energy bills. Even so, recipients can spend or save the money as they see fit. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Five charts that explain the cost of living crisis A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We are on track to process the first instalment by the end of July. ""All eligible households will automatically receive the first instalment, and no one needs to worry they will miss out. ""There will be a few unique cases - such as those who were not initially entitled but have gained entitlement upon appeal - who will be paid after July, as soon as possible."" Financial commentators say these payments will ease, but not cure, the financial strain families face this winter. ""It is a vital step in the right direction for those on lower incomes, but it is a small step back from the precipice after millions of people have edged ever-closer over the past few months,"" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It is a positive step for those on the lowest earnings, who have been hit three times harder than higher earners by rising prices. However, it is not enough to put people back where they were before price hikes."" The energy bill of every household will be discounted by Â£400 from October, and there will be extra payments to pensioners and people with disabilities. However, the prospect of a typical household's winter energy bill increasing by more than previously anticipated has also raised questions over whether more financial support will be needed soon. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The typical bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year, which follows a Â£700 a year rise in April. Those using prepayment meters have to pay slightly higher bills, and Citizens Advice has warned that the number of people seeking help because they cannot afford to top them up has reached a new record. When a prepayment customer does not top up their meter it is known as self-disconnection The charity said that, in June, it dealt with over 1,319 cases on its helplines of people on prepayment meters going without power, known as self-disconnection. There were no signs of the normal drop-off in cases during the summer months. The number of callers who were disconnecting from their energy supply and seeking help was already higher this year than for the whole of 2020 and 2021 combined, the charity said. Data seen by the BBC shows that Citizens Advice referred almost 700 people a day to food banks in June, almost 300 a day more than the same period last year. Between January and June this year, the charity has helped almost 120,000 people with ""crisis support"" - 52% higher than the same period last year, and 182% higher than in 2019. Cifas, the fraud prevention organisation, has also warned that the rising cost of living and energy bills were providing criminals with new opportunities to steal victim's personal and financial information. It said it was seeing a rise in phishing emails claiming to be from utility companies offering savings on energy bills, as well as offering fuel vouchers, fake jobs and money-making opportunities. These emails were becoming increasingly sophisticated, as were the websites which were used to collect people's personal information. Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""Everyone is at risk of being targeted by fraudsters, but the current economic crisis is making consumers even more vulnerable.""
