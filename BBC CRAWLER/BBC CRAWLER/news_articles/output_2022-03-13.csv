NI homes offered Â£350 to host Ukrainian refugees,"Ukrainian refugees wait for a train at the railway station in Lviv, western Ukraine Households in Northern Ireland will be offered Â£350 a month to open their homes to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. EarlierHousing Secretary Michael Gove said that tens of thousands of people could come to the UK under the scheme. The Northern Ireland Executive Office said has encouraged expressions of interest in providing accommodation from both individuals and groups. A website to express an interest in being a sponsor is launching on Monday. Westminster confirmed that, like in other parts of the UK, people in Northern Ireland who allow Ukrainian refugees to stay in their homes rent-free will be entitled to government payments. Details of the Homes for Ukraine scheme were announced on Sunday and the project will be overseen by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. BBC News NI asked the department how additional funding would be allocated to support refugees coming to Northern Ireland, including any extra school places and healthcare provision they may need. It said the department will work with devolved administrations to decide the best funding route for them, and discussions were ongoing. However, ministers working in Stormont's devolved government - the Northern Ireland Executive - are currently having problems with the allocation of their existing funds. Paul Givan, from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP),resigned in protest over post-Brexit trade rules in early February, which meant the deputy first minister automatically lost her job. Without both leaders in post, Northern Ireland Executive ministers cannot meet as a team to take any major new decisions. That means thatthey have not been able to sign off on a three-year budget, and Finance Minister Conor Murphy also saida pot of Â£300m from the Treasury cannot be spent without executive approval. How does the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainians work? Heartless or doing its best to help refugees? UK in crisis mode Ireland takes in 5,500 Ukrainian refugees In England, local authorities will also receive Â£10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said. It is not yet known how this money will be allocated in Northern Ireland. On Sunday night, a spokesperson for the Executive Office said that ""while not all the details have yet been announced by Westminster, we are working at pace, making preparations so we stand ready to provide sanctuary to Ukrainian refugees"". ""Mindful of the pressure on social housing stock, officials are also engaging with councils and the voluntary and community sector to find creative ways of bringing suitable accommodation into use and identifying all available capacity,"" added the spokesperson. ""We are in close contact with the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing and with colleagues in other jurisdictions. ""We will participate fully in this humanitarian effort. Partnership across sectors and wider society will be key to ensuring we can support as many Ukrainian people seeking sanctuary here as possible."" Matthew O'Toole previously worked in Downing Street and the Treasury as a civil servant On Sunday morning, the SDLP's economy spokesperson called on Northern Ireland's devolved government to ""do more"" to support Ukrainian refugees who are fleeing the war. Matthew O'Toole made the call afterleaders in Scotland and Wales proposed both their governments become ""super sponsors""to take in more refugees. He said it was ""not good enough"" for Stormont to take no action because of the current absence of its leaders. Mr O'Toole was asked if there was more Stormont could do to support Ukrainian refugees in the absence of a first and deputy first minister. ""Yes, there definitely is,"" he told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme. ""From my perspective, I've already called on on the Executive Office to do more more to prepare to receive Ukrainian refugees. ""This is the biggest humanitarian crisis on our continent in probably most of our lifetimes, probably since the Second World War."" The Home Office in Westminster has faced criticism in recent days over the numbers of Ukrainian refugees it has allowed into the UK so far and the amount of bureaucracy involved its visa system. In contrast, EU member states, including the Republic of Ireland, lifted visa restrictions on Ukrainians arriving in the country shortly after Russia invaded. To date, about 5,500 Ukrainian refugees have now arrived in the Republic of Ireland, the country'staoiseach (prime minister) confirmed to the BBC's Sunday Morning programme.

Hurt began acting on stage in the 1970s before making his big-screen breakthrough as an obsessed scientist in Altered States, which earned him a best newcomer nomination at the Golden Globes in 1981. That year, he also starred as a womanising lawyer in erotic thriller Body Heat, before being cast in The Big Chill and Gorky Park. Winning an Oscar for playing a gay man who shares a cell with a political prisoner in Kiss of the Spider Woman was ""very isolating"",he later told the Los Angeles Times,external. ""The instant they gave it to me, I thought, God, what do I do now? How am I going to walk into a room and have any other actor trust me?"" That did not stop him getting two more consecutive nominations, though, before roles in The Accidental Tourist, Lost in Space, Contagion and AI. Then came a fourth Oscar nomination for David Cronenberg's A History of Violence in 2006. He also received Emmy nominations for playing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2011's Too Big to Fail, and for legal TV drama Damages. He returned to the theatre in productions including Henry V, A Midsummer Night Dream and Hurlyburly, the latter of which saw him recognised with a nomination at Broadway's Tony Awards. Hurt had been diagnosed with prostate cancer He was regarded as a compelling but complex and often confrontational presence, however. Fame was ""a challenge"" and ""not a happy condition for me"", he admitted. ""It's a privilege and a responsibility, and I'm not sure I carried the responsibility well at times, which is embarrassing,""he told The Telegraph in 2013,external. ""And I've had to look and be disappointed in myself occasionally for how I behaved in some circumstances."" He drank heavily for a spell and in a high-profile palimony trial in 1989, former partner Sandra Jennings described his drunken rages. Another former girlfriend, Children of a Lesser God co-star Marlee Matlin, later accused him of physical and emotional abuse. He apologised ""for any pain I caused"". The actor revealed in 2018 that he had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer.

M&S and Asos back jobs call for Ukraine refugees,"Major UK businesses are lining up to offer jobs to Ukrainian refugees when theystart to arrive in the UK. A group of more than 45 large businesses is pressing the government to make it easier for those driven out by Russia's invasion to come to the UK. Marks & Spencer, Asos, Lush and recruitment giant Robert Walters are some of the firms involved. The government has been criticised over the speed and scale of its response to the Ukraine refugee crisis. The initiative is being led by British entrepreneur Emma Sinclair, the chief executive of Enterprise Alumni. She said it had quickly gained ground in a short space of time. The project is in its early stages, and many of the details about how it will work in practice are unclear. Ms Sinclair, who is co-ordinating the initiative at the moment despite a recent head injury, told the BBC that many of her ancestors were from Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. The aim of the project is to help ""tens of thousands"" of refugees not only get jobs in the UK, but to help them find accommodation, and gain language skills. Many UK businesses have beenfacing labour shortagesdue to a combination of factors including Covid and Brexit, and it is in their interests to fill outstanding vacancies. However, Ms Sinclair said the consortium was ""purely altruistic"" and not acting to promote any particular corporate agenda. The companies involved, especially the recruitment firms, have got ""thousands of jobs to fill every day of the week"" - this is not a new situation for them, she said. ""People are inherently generally good, and people want to help,"" she added. The initiative,which was first reported in the Sunday Times,external, wants to provide tens of thousands of jobs. Ms Sinclair is due to have a meeting with the newly appointed Minister for Refugees Richard Harrington on Monday, and she has also been in contact with Number 10 Downing Street. ""We [businesses] want people, we need people, and we want to help,"" she said. ""We want to see movement on rising numbers of refugees."" She said the current focus of this initiative is to help refugees from Ukraine rebuild their lives, but in an ideal world the scheme would be extended to all refugees. The government has been criticised, including by its own MPs, for not moving quickly enough to help refugees from Ukraine. Ms Sinclair said that the UK ""can do better"" and ""go faster"" than it is currently on Ukraine refugees. ""We want to see the red tape burnt,"" she said. Emma Sinclair, chief executive of Enterprise Alumni, is currently coordinating the consortium A government spokesperson said: ""We are standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians which is why we've made it easier for those with valid Ukrainian passports to come here. This is alongside changes to visas to ensure Ukrainians in the UK can stay here. ""We have expanded our visa application capacity to 13,000 a week, deployed additional staff across the EU, with a 24/7 helpline in place to ensure those who need appointments can get them to come here. ""This allows us to balance security risks while welcoming those in need,"" they added. Marks & Spencer, which is part of the consortium, said it was ""absolutely committed to supporting Ukrainian refugees"" both through humanitarian schemes and through jobs. ""We are in discussion with the Home Office about the detail of this,"" it said. Online fashion retailer Asos, which is also involved in the initiative, said: ""We are currently recruiting for many tech engineering roles in the UK and we know Ukraine has a strong skill set in this area. ""We are also working with our partners to explore opportunities at our distribution centres in the UK and elsewhere in Europe."" Asos expects the number of positions to be in double digits in the UK, adding the business already has a Ukrainian workforce in Poland so opportunities for newly arrived refugees will exist there. High street cosmetics business Lush said it was ""happy to consider refugees for any role, even those we would usually advertise for internal candidates only"". It said its recruiters are meeting with the Refugee Council charity next week to ""share what potential opportunities there are across the business"". Lush added that it was recruiting web developers and other tech roles, designers, spa therapists and warehouse and retail assistants - and from May and June, temporary staff for the Christmas period. Toby Fowlston, chief executive of recruitment giant Robert Walters, said the firm had ""committed to hiring displaced Ukrainians into our own business and as a recruitment company we will also represent them as potential employees to our clients"". ""We will need government support to help expedite working visas to ensure we can act quickly."","" he added. Another large UK recruitment firm Impellam Group is part of the consortium, as is software company Unit4 and Portman Dental Group.

However, she warned that for a six-month placement, both the refugees and the people offering space in their houses need to be screened, otherwise it ""might be a little dangerous"". Ms Nathan added that the processes for dealing with Ukrainian refugees also needed to be fair to refugees of other nationalities. ""What happens to Afghans?"" she said. ""They are still in hotels."" Organisations that are not linked to the initiative have also contacted the Home Office to say they are willing to offer refugees jobs, include Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and the Co-op. More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion, and European Union countries have let them come in without a visa for three years. In the UK, at the moment only Ukrainian refugees with family connections in the UK can apply for a visa under the Ukraine Family Scheme. Other visas are available but application centres in Ukraine are closed. However, under a new scheme called Homes for Ukraine, people will be able to nominate a named individual or a family to stay with them rent-free, or in another property, for at least six months. Sponsors will not be required to know the refugees in advance and there will be no limit on the number of people who can come to the UK through this route. Refugees will be given three years leave to remain, with the right to work and access public services.

Ukraine accuses Russia of abducting second mayor,"Ukraine's foreign minister said Yevhen Matveyev was abducted by ""Russian war criminals"" Ukraine's government has accused the Russian military of abducting another mayor in an area that it has captured. Yevhen Matveyev was seized in the southern town of Dniprorudne,Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted,external, accusing Russia of ""terror"" tactics. Earlier, Russia installed a new mayor in Melitopol, after allegedly abducting the city's previous incumbent. Ukraine's president also accused Russia of trying to create ""pseudo-republics"" to break his country apart. In her first public appearance, Melitopol's newly installed mayor Galina Danilchenko urged residents not to take part in ""extremist actions"" and declared her main task was construction of ""basic mechanisms under the new reality"". Hundreds of people took part in a protest outside the city hall on Saturday to demand the release of previous incumbent Ivan Fedorov, who had refused to co-operate with Russian troops since they took the city on the third day of the invasion.

Mr Fedorov was last seen on Friday evening being dragged away from the city's crisis centre by several armed men with a bag over his head. Ukrainian officials shared a video of the incident,externaland said the armed men were Russian soldiers. ""We are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,""Mr Fedorov had told the BBC earlier in the week. ""They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us, and we do not want their help."" Russian authorities have not commented on his disappearance, but the prosecutor's office of the Russian-backed breakaway eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk hasreportedly accused him of ""terrorist activities"",external. CCTV image from the video allegedly showing the mayor being marched away Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded Mr Fedorov's immediate release and asked the leaders of Israel, Germany and France to put pressure on Russia to free him. In his latest video address on Saturday night, Mr Zelensky said Russia was to create ""pseudo-republics"" in Ukraine. He praised those refusing to collaborate in the Russian-controlled Kherson region. The council there had earlier adopted a resolution reaffirming that it ""has been, is and will be an inalienable part of the united state of Ukraine"" in response to what it said was a Russian plan to stage a referendum on the creation of a ""people's republic"". Mr Zelensky also warned ""certain figures"" of dire personal consequences of any collaboration - an apparent reference to Ms Danilchenko.

Chelsea snatch late win over Newcastle,"Kai Havertz has scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time, and in all competitions he has had a hand in six goals in his last five games (five goals, one assist) Chelsea snatched a dramatic winner against Newcastle in the first game at Stamford Bridge since Blues' Russian owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government. The game looked to be heading towards a goalless draw before Kai Havertz expertly controlled a ball forward and fired into the net in the 88th minute. It was a tough goal to concede for Newcastle who had wanted Havertz to be sent off in the first half for catching Dan Burn in the face with an elbow when jumping, but the German only received a booking. Before the goal, both sides had struggled to create clear-cut chances, with Chelsea taking 75 minutes to produce an effort on target. Newcastle's Miguel Almiron had earlier forced a fine save from home goalkeeper Edouard Mendy with a well-struck 25-yard volley and Burn headed just wide. Just as had happened in Chelsea's 3-1 away win over Norwich on Thursday, a small section of fans chanted Abramovich's name, for a brief period in the second half. Abramovich has been sanctioned as a part of the government's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, meaning his assets, including Chelsea Football Club, have been frozen. Prospective owner Candy wants fan on club board if Chelsea takeover successful Chelsea v Newcastle as it happened, plus reaction and analysis This video can not be played Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle: Thomas Tuchel praises Kai Havertz's 'rare quality' Chelsea stay third, but are now only seven points behind second-placed Liverpool and 10 adrift of leaders Manchester City. Meanwhile, Newcastle, beaten for the first time in nine Premier League matches, are 14th, 10 points clear of the relegation zone. The relief and delight shown from Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, both at the goal and again at the final whistle, showed what this meant to him by screaming at the fans and punching the air. And it was easy to see why he was so emotional with the club's very existence potentially under threat. Abramovich has been the Chelsea owner for nearly 19 years, a period in which they have won 21 trophies, including the Premier League on five occasions and the Champions League twice. But the current sanctions against him have stopped him selling Chelsea, and mean the club are unable to buy or sell players, cannot sell any more tickets for games, have had their credit cards suspended and have had to close the club shop. The government said it would issue a special licence that allowed fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches, although the club's wage bill stands at Â£28m a month. It seemed fitting that Newcastle, another side with hugely controversial owners following their takeover in October by the Saudi Arabian-backed Public Investment Fund (PIF), were Chelsea's opponents on a day when events off the field were talked about as much as those on it. Newcastle's takeover and the potential huge investment into the club was celebrated by their fans a few months ago, although Amnesty International said ""it represented a clear attempt by the Saudi authorities to sportswash their appalling human rights record with the glamour of top-flight football"". This video can not be played Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle: Eddie Howe 'disappointed' to lose unbeaten run Despite the late defeat, this was another sign of the progress Newcastle are making on the pitch. There was plenty for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe to be positive about given his side were only a few minutes away from securing a point away at the current European and world champions. Arriving at a club without a league win and with only six points from 12 matches, he began with five defeats in his first eight games in all competitions, including a humiliating home loss to third-tier Cambridge United in the FA Cup third round. But, after spending Â£80m in the January transfer window, the Magpies had been on a run of eight games unbeaten, including six victories, before this narrow loss. The visitors had defended superbly up until Jorginho's excellent ball over the defence found Havertz, who showed his class to control it and then score the winner to delight the packed crowd at Stamford Bridge. Howe said he thought Havertz could have been sent off but was also disappointed his side did not get a second-half penalty when Trevoh Chalobah had a hold of Jacob Murphy's shirt. Newcastle wanted Chelsea's Kai Havertz to be sent off for elbowing Dan Burn, but Havertz only received a yellow card after a check by the video assistant referee Our coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here'severything you need to knowto make sure you never miss a moment Premier League official site Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Potter 'excitement' short lived - but West Ham find 'positives' Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Glasgow beat Racing to seal Champions Cup knockout spot Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

Jobs warning over push to shut rail ticket kiosks,"Fewer people are commuting to work even after work-from-home guidance was lifted Jobs on the railways ""will need to change to become more passenger-centric"", according to the group that represents train operators. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) was responding to reports that hundreds of rail ticket offices could potentially close as part of a plan to modernise the railways. RDG said it is talking to unions about how to address job changes. One union said it will ballot staff if compulsory redundancies are used. A spokesperson for the RDG, which represents the rail industry, said: ""The pandemic has been an unprecedented financial shock to the railway. ""While no decisions have been taken over ticket offices, with the acceleration of changing travel patterns and more passengers migrating to digital technology, many jobs will need to change to become more passenger-centric. ""Train companies are working with unions on how to address those changes, while making sure the industry takes no more than its fair share from the taxpayer,"" they added. The bosses of rail operators are in talks with the government about the closures, which may result in redundancies if staff cannot be moved into other roles, theSunday Times reported,external. During the pandemic, train passenger numbers collapsed and so did revenues. Living costs rising at their fastest rate for 30 years Air fares rise are unavoidable, warns airline boss Mayors call on government to reassess rail plans Passengers numbers are still recovering, with big changes such as hybrid working affecting commuter levels and season ticket sales. To ensure the railways kept running during the pandemic, the government stepped in to finance the industry. Recently, rail minister Wendy Morton told the BBC that taxpayers had supported the railways with more than Â£14bn of funding, and that taxpayers had to get a good return on what they had invested. As part of plans to modernise the railways, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps committed to modernising ticketing with more digitisation, as part of theWilliams-Shapps plan for rail. Train tickets purchased online can be collected at self-service kiosks in train stations Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, said: ""Grant Shapps needs to realise that this daft plan is likely to result in the threat of compulsory redundancies, and if that happens we will be issuing ballots for industrial action. ""Closing ticket offices will not only be opposed by the unions but the public at large. ""Shapps must stand up to the faceless accountants in the Treasury because a properly run and fully functioning railway is vital in building an economic recovery from Covid. ""The government should share their plans in detail with us and commuters now if they are so sure that closing ticket offices and taking Â£2bn a year out of our railways is the best way forward. ""I'd strongly urge them to reconsider,"" Mr Cortes added. Railway ticket offices are run by train operating companies in different stations, and not by Network Rail.

Poland feels the strain of Ukraine's refugees,"A group of children including toddlers and teenagers take part in a karate class for new arrivals in eastern Poland The kicks are high and the punches straight, but the Ukrainian children here are delivering them in an environment of peace: a karate class for new arrivals in eastern Poland. The 14 students are given the basic moves by a Polish teacher, who ensures there's plenty of laughter. For this hour at least, the trauma they've gone through in the past fortnight is replaced by enjoyment. Some of them have family back at home fighting for real. Fourteen-year-old Dariy Gulyk hasn't heard from his father for three days and is worried. The emotions make it hard to feel settled here. ""In Poland, it's very cool"", he says, ""but we want to go home - because home is home."" His cousin, Sasha Minaiev, 17, appreciates the temporary distraction. ""When we're in the karate class, we forget about the war in that moment"", he says, ""but when it ends, we remember again, and we understand we must do all we can to help our people in Ukraine."" The old centre of Zamosc is a Unesco World Heritage site The class takes place in the small eastern Polish town of Zamosc, population 60,000. Its beautiful old centre, a Unesco World Heritage site, is dotted with Renaissance churches and coloured facades: a far cry from the horror unfolding across the border. It, like many others across Poland, has been transformed in the past two weeks into a refugee hub. On some days, up to 35,000 people have arrived - most going on further west but some staying. Around a thousand beds have been provided at the reception centre, schools, private homes and even the sports club where the karate class takes place. The mayor, Andrzej Wnuk, says it's a huge strain on Zamosc, warning that the welcome has its limits. ""Polish people seem infinitely ready to give, but it will end one day"", he says. ""We thought there would be a first wave of refugees and then we would get significant support from the government and the EU but it turns out we were left alone. We need financial help or the quality of our hospitality will drop drastically."" The impulse in Zamosc to offer refuge is partly due to its history as a place that has known the cost of oppression. Almost half of its pre-war population, some 12,000 people, were Jews. During occupation first by the Soviets and then the Nazis, most were sent to the ghetto here and then to concentration camps. A monument to the tragedy, made from the headstones in the town's old Jewish cemetery, stands on the outskirts. The locals here are proud of their heritage of hospitality, extended to the new arrivals. The restaurant at the Renesans hotel is now only cooking for refugees. In the kitchen, pots of Ukrainian beetroot soup and fruit compote bubble away, as staff box up portions of pork ribs and pasta. The owner, Damian Poterucha, says as a father, it was a natural decision to change his business once he saw the children fleeing the war. ""I can't believe Polish people are responding like this"", he says, ""it's nice to see."" But he says he's running short of money and can only continue offering the handouts for another two weeks. ""After that, I will think about what I can do next"", he adds. Damian Poterucha now uses his hotel kitchen to prepare food for refugees The food is delivered to the main shelter, where some 300 volunteers help out. All the while, buses arrive with new arrivals - and others leave, taking those on board to larger cities in the west, where many of the refugees have friends or family. ""We need help from the world"", says Barbara Godziszewska, a town hall employee now helping to serve hot food. ""Everybody looks at us and gives us a 'bravo', but it's too small - someone needs to tell us what we can do with the refugees. If the numbers continue like this, I'm afraid maybe they'll go on the street to sleep because every hotel is full."" In the space of a fortnight, Poland has gone from rejecting migrants from the Middle East to opening its arms to those from Ukraine. There is discomfort among some Poles with what appears to be a volte-face by their government, from pushing away the mainly Muslim men of Syria to welcoming the predominantly white, Christian women and children of Ukraine. But Poland's migration policy will be pored over by historians in future years. For now, the focus is on the present influx. And as the fighting worsens in Ukraine - and begins to spread to the west - towns like Zamosc are wondering how long they can cope.

Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad,"This video can not be played Watch: Yevgeny says it is his responsibility as a Russian to help Ukrainians Outside Georgia's parliament, Yevgeny Lyamin heaves boxes of clothes and food parcels on to a waiting truck bound for Ukraine. He is one of more than 25,000 Russians to have arrived in Georgia since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russians have been struggling to find affordable accommodation in all the major cities. Many can be seen wandering around the capital, Tbilisi, with their suitcases and often even their pets. A blue-and-yellow ribbon is attached to the lapel of Yevgeny's trench-coat - the colours of the Ukrainian flag. It was these ribbons that got him arrested at an anti-war protest in Russia, a day after it launched its war on Ukraine. ""I understood the best way to act against Putin's regime would be my emigration from Russia,"" says the 23-year old politics graduate. ""It's my responsibility to do anything I can to help the Ukrainians."" The exodus does not stop at Georgia. The EU, US, UK and Canada have closed their airspace to Russian flights, so they are heading for countries where flights are still permitted and where visas are not required, such as Turkey, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Many have fled to Armenia. According to one estimate by a Russian economist, as many as 200,000 Russians have left their country since the start of the war. Allow Twitter content?

Belarusians are on the move too, fleeing repression and the Western sanctions imposed on authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko's government for collaborating with Russia's Vladimir Putin. That has prompted prices to surge on last-minute flights and rental accommodation in the main host cities, such as Istanbul and Armenia's capital, Yerevan. ""A one-way flight to Istanbul cost me and my husband more than our combined monthly income,"" said Anya, who did not want to give her surname. For her the moment of decision came with a new ""state betrayal"" law that has come into force in Russia. Anyone expressing support for Ukraine could face jail sentences of up to 20 years and Anya believed she could be a target. ""Fear of closed borders, political repression and forced military service is in our DNA. I remember my grandmother telling me stories about the state of fear they lived in during Stalin's time, and now we are experiencing it,"" she said. An estimated 25,000 Russians have left for Georgia Many of the new emigres are tech industry professionals who can work remotely. A video games developer I met at a cafe in Tbilisi told me that he and most people he knew disagreed with Russian policy and they knew now that any protest would be violently suppressed. ""The only way we can protest is to leave the country, take our skills and money with us. Almost everyone in our circle has made a similar decision,"" said Igor (not his real name). He plans to leave the Georgian capital, because he does not feel welcome here. There have been numerous reports of Airbnb hosts refusing to let their properties to Russian and Belarusian citizens. ""I do not accept Russian and Belarus people"" one host told a Belarusian couple, who shared their exchange with the BBC. ""You do not have time for vacations - revolt against your corrupt governments."" ""They think we are running away from Russia because Apple Pay no longer works there,"" Igor complained. ""We are not running for comfort, we've lost everything there, we are basically refugees. Putin's geopolitics has destroyed our lives."" At Tbilisi's public service hall, new arrivals are registering businesses or applying for residency. Kristina and Nikita, who are both IT specialists from the Belarusian capital Minsk, have registered as sole entrepreneurs. That will allow them to open Georgian bank accounts. ""We don't support our governments, which is obvious because we ran away. We want to be safe here,"" said Kristina. ""But we are being bullied just because of our nationality, I need to hide my country of origin, I don't feel comfortable when people ask me where I am from."" Since the start of the war Tbilisi has seen some of the largest rallies in support of Ukraine. A recent survey found that 87% of Georgians view the war in Ukraine as their own war with Russia. But many Georgians are uneasy about this dramatic influx of Russians, as it is less than 14 years since Russia's leader invaded Georgia. Some 30,000 Georgians listened to Ukraine's President Zelensky during a mass protest Some fear President Putin might claim Russian citizens abroad need protection, because that was his excuse to justify sending troops into the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia in 2008. To date, 20% of Georgian territory remains under Russian occupation. However, tech entrepreneur Lev Kalashnikov thinks Georgia will benefit from what he asserts is the biggest brain drain in Russia's modern history. He opened a group for expats on the Telegram messaging app while standing in a queue. ""There were 50 people in front of me and 50 people behind me. They became my first subscribers and now we have nearly 4,000 members."" Members discuss where to find accommodation, how to open bank accounts, and whether or not it is safe to speak Russian in public. Yevgeny Lyamin is already learning Georgian, practising Georgia's unique alphabet in an exercise book. ""I am against Putin, I am against war. I still can't withdraw money from my Russian bank account, but that's nothing like the problems that Ukrainians face.""

Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugee,"John Rutherford and his wife have previously hosted refugees from Ethiopia and Iran People in the UK are being asked to offer a spare room to Ukrainian refugees. But what is it like sharing your home with someone who has fled war or persecution? For the third time in a year, John Rutherford and his wife Sue are considering opening up their south London house to a refugee. ""We have a big house, my kids have left home,"" says John. ""It's not a great hardship for us to make some space for a refugee."" In 2021, they hosted one person from Ethiopia and one from Iran, each for a couple of weeks while they awaited longer-term accommodation during the asylum application process. And now, he is ready to open his five-bedroom house again. He says: ""It was the sheer numbers involved that made me want to help. The fact that this is only down the road... means there is even more obligation for us to be hospitable. ""There could be four or five million people looking for places to stay, so the UK has to do its bit and the British people have to do their bit."" He says the system for Ukrainian refugees will involve a bigger commitment than his Ethiopian and Iranian guests - the government are asking for people to offer a place to stay for at least six months. But John says hosting refugees can be very rewarding. ""I really enjoy meeting people and talking to people from different cultures,"" he says. ""I just found the experience absolutely fascinating, talking about their country, their experiences, their culture."" He says his refugee guests wanted to be useful. The Ethiopian made a meal for his hosts to introduce them to his country's cuisine, while the Iranian repeatedly offered to use his professional skills to repair things around the house. But he advises anyone considering being a host to be ""patient and understanding"" - and to learn as much about their guest as they can, in order to offer them the right kind of environment. ""A lot of refugees will be severely stressed, maybe they even have PTSD,"" John says. ""Chances are, refugees have had terrible experiences, and you have to know when to give them some space and some peace and quiet, or when they might want companionship."" Efrem, from Ethiopia, shared his country's cuisine with John and Sue when he stayed with them He suggests finding out about their interests; whether they want to attend a church or other religious services; whether they have hobbies; or whether they prefer peace and relaxation or keeping busy. But with the Homes for Ukraine scheme requiring people in the UK to identify a named refugee they can host, John questions how many people who might want to help - but don't have a personal connection with a Ukrainian - could be matched with someone. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby SANCTIONS:Impact on everyday lives in Russia EXIT:Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad RECRUITS:Ukraine's teenage soldiers IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict On previous occasions John hosted refugees, it was arranged by the charity Refugees At Home, which visited him to check on the accommodation being offered and asked about any house rules. He then received information about the refugee they hoped to place with him - with details such as their age, country of origin, and whether they spoke English. John says he is concerned about the lack of a similar system for Ukrainians, with the government suggesting people in the UK could make contact with refugees via social media. ""I am concerned about what support mechanism there will be,"" he says. Since the Ukraine scheme was announced, John has contacted Refugees at Home, and urges anyone considering opening their doors to see it as an opportunity. ""It might be challenging,"" he says, ""but it can also be very enriching.""

How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia,"The US, UK and EU have put in place unprecedented financial penalties on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, and hundreds of international companies have pulled out of the country. The impact of these measures is just starting to be felt, with the cost of basic products rising, a looming risk of job losses, and for some, an increasing sense of isolation. Here are some of the ways daily life has been changing. All names have been changed, and currency conversions were correct at time of publication. Consumer prices jumped 2.2% in the first week of the invasion, with food among the biggest rises  â¢ Some shops are restricting the sale of staples, after reports of hoarding â¢  Sales of medicines are not subject to sanctions, but with major shipping companies suspending services, supplies could be hit The rouble has plummeted since Russia invaded Ukraine, leading many retailers to raise their prices. Daria, who lives in central Moscow, says she's not yet seen empty shelves. ""Food won't disappear but will get more expensive,"" she says. ""How much more expensive, I can't imagine - and am scared to even think about."" Jan, is an EU citizen who lives and works in Moscow. ""On 20 February I ordered groceries for 5,500 roubles [about $57; Â£44] and now the same basket costs 8,000,"" he says. The price of milk has almost doubled in the past two weeks, he adds. Sugar and cereal prices were already about 20% higher this February than a year ago. Russian state news agency Tass said some retailers had agreed to limit price rises on some staples to 5%. Others are restricting the amount of basics like flour, sugar and oil that customers can buy. Daria has been stocking up. ""We bought 4kg of coffee, 4 litres of sunflower oil, 4 litres of olive oil and four bottles of whisky."" She has also ordered a three-month supply of medication for her high blood pressure - she says some drugs are already harder to get hold of. The price of some consumer goods has drastically increased â¢  The cost of smartphones and televisions has increased by more than 10% and an average vacation to Turkey has increased by 29% â¢  Major brands like Apple, Ikea and Nike no longer sell their products in Russia Daria had been considering buying new laptops for her family, and rushed ahead with the purchase as she saw prices steadily increase. ""At the beginning of February they cost about 70,000 roubles [$730; Â£560] but by the end of the month they had gone up to 100,000 roubles, which is what we paid. They then went up to 140,000 before they all sold out in Moscow."" They didn't buy iPhone chargers, though many others did - Apple said on 2 March that it would halt all direct product sales in Russia. ""We probably should have,"" Daria says. ""There's a joke now that we all have the last iPhone."" New cars have also gone up in price. ""We bought filters and oil for the car for when it needs a service,"" Daria says. ""We managed to buy them at the old prices before they almost doubled before our eyes."" Pavel, a university lecturer with a wife and two children, was looking to buy appliances for their flat in Moscow. On the day the war started, he saw some prices rise by nearly 30%. He managed to buy a fridge, cooker, washing machine and a kettle, and ordered a bed and a cupboard from Ikea just a day before it closed. He doesn't think prices in Ikea changed. ""They simply didn't have time to raise prices,"" Pavel jokes sadly. The symbolism of McDonald's closing its 847 restaurants has not been lost on Russians - it was among the first Western firms to open in the Soviet Union 30 years ago. Within hours of the announcement, thousands of adverts appeared from Russians reselling food from its restaurants, at up to 10 times the usual price. ""Nuggets and pies bought just before the restaurant chain closed down. Your last chance to taste foreign bliss,"" said one message. But Vladimir, who lives in Saratov in south western Russia, says he has yet to feel the impact of Western sanctions. ""Vatniki [Kremlin supporters] won't be affected by the fall in the rouble, because they don't buy expensive foreign goods."" Russian banks removed from Swift international payment system â¢ Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Apple and Google Pay limit their services in Russia â¢ Russian central bank says economy could shrink by up to 8% ""The situation has had a big impact on our business,"" says Natasha, who works in the fitness industry. ""Our customer numbers are down. People are asking us to refund their club membership. And our costs for rent, equipment and cleaning are all rising. Outgoings have gone up by 30% on average since sanctions were introduced."" She anticipates that many businesses like hers will close. Those that don't will struggle to find Russian manufacturers to replace imported equipment. Ekaterina runs a number of language schools and says the sanctions have already caused her problems. ""We have teachers in other countries we can't pay because all the transfer networks are frozen. We also have students in the US, Germany and Latvia who can't pay their fees into our accounts. We've found ways around it but at the moment every working day begins with fire-fighting a new crisis."" Ekaterina is worried how they will manage their international group lessons if Zoom is blocked, and says she has had problems because her online platforms were maintained by a company in Ukraine. ""Everything stopped immediately although we worked with them for ages. We were very happy with them and their work was top class. We are very upset for them, for ourselves, that we're all in this situation,"" she says. Natasha is finding it hard to come to terms with the changes. ""This is a completely new kind of crisis which makes us all feel lost and bewildered. Not just in business but in our own lives. The loss of income, having to give up a whole way of life, reduced connections, including on social media, and not being able to travel to see family and friends who live abroad. There are a lot of things we have already lost and haven't yet fully understood."" Daria says hearing about job losses as big international companies pull out of Russia worries her. ""So far there aren't any cuts in the government-funded projects I work on,"" she says, ""but I'm very scared of losing my job."" New law threatens to jail anyone deemed to have spread ""fake"" news on the invasion â¢ Independent and international media subject of severe restrictions â¢ More than13,000 people arrested,externalin anti-war protests Daria holds President Putin responsible for the sanctions, but most Russians get their news from state-run media, which carries the Kremlin's anti-Ukraine propaganda. Many people support him and may end up blaming the West for sanctions. Others don't approve of the war, but stay silent - it's risky for Russians to criticise their leader. Western governments hope the sanctions being piled on Russians will hurt enough to bring change at the top, but that could take time. This video can not be played WATCH: Staff from TV Rain walk off set after final broadcast The view that only better-off Russians will feel the pain of sanctions is debatable. No-one is sure quite what's going to happen next, but the economic fallout is expected to be severe and long lasting.  Russia's central bank said there had been a ""drastic"" economic change since the invasion. On the surface you might not guess what's going on in Moscow, says Daria. The city's cafes and restaurants are full, the metro is working, the traffic jams in the centre haven't gone anywhere. ""That's if you don't see the protests, the searches and the departures of creative people who make a big noise about leaving. A lot of other people are probably quietly leaving too. This gives me the feeling that we're running out of air,"" she says. Today's events bring back memories of the 1990s, when Russia's economy collapsed after the Soviet Union fell apart. ""It's been interesting talking to people in their 30s about those times and the ration cards we had for food. We had coupons and tokens to buy sugar, butter and vodka,"" says Daria. ""I remember the huge queues to buy sausage... There were often loud arguments, against selling things to the out-of-town shoppers. It was shameful. I hope it doesn't come to that again. ""I'm afraid that there will be more burglaries and robberies because of a sudden increase in poverty and job losses,"" she says. Jan says he hasn't noticed life changing in a big way and he doesn't plan to leave. ""My family and my work are here. It's very hard to start life all over again in a new place.""

Oscar-winning actor William Hurt diesHis roles ranged from acclaimed 1980s dramas to playing General Thaddeus Ross in five Marvel films.Entertainment & Arts,"William Hurt at the premiere of Marvel's Captain America: Civil War in 2016 William Hurt, the Oscar-winning US actor whose roles ranged from acclaimed 1980s dramas to Marvel films, has died at the age of 71, US media say. Hurt won the best actor Oscar in 1986 for playing a prisoner in a Brazilian jail in Kiss of the Spider Woman. He was nominated two more times in the next two years, for Children of a Lesser God and Broadcast News. In recent years, he has been known as General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross in five Marvel blockbusters. Hurt made his Hollywood breakthrough at the start of the 1980s in films including Body Heat alongside Kathleen Turner Hollywood websiteDeadline quoted a statement,externalfrom Hurt's son Will as saying: ""It is with great sadness that the Hurt family mourns the passing of William Hurt, beloved father and Oscar winning actor, on March 13, 2022, one week before his 72nd birthday. ""He died peacefully, among family, of natural causes. The family requests privacy at this time."" Variety said,externalthe news was confirmed by Hurt's friend Gerry Byrne.

Hurt began acting on stage in the 1970s before making his big-screen breakthrough as an obsessed scientist in Altered States, which earned him a best newcomer nomination at the Golden Globes in 1981. That year, he also starred as a womanising lawyer in erotic thriller Body Heat, before being cast in The Big Chill and Gorky Park. Winning an Oscar for playing a gay man who shares a cell with a political prisoner in Kiss of the Spider Woman was ""very isolating"",he later told the Los Angeles Times,external. ""The instant they gave it to me, I thought, God, what do I do now? How am I going to walk into a room and have any other actor trust me?"" That did not stop him getting two more consecutive nominations, though, before roles in The Accidental Tourist, Lost in Space, Contagion and AI. Then came a fourth Oscar nomination for David Cronenberg's A History of Violence in 2006. He also received Emmy nominations for playing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2011's Too Big to Fail, and for legal TV drama Damages. He returned to the theatre in productions including Henry V, A Midsummer Night Dream and Hurlyburly, the latter of which saw him recognised with a nomination at Broadway's Tony Awards. Hurt had been diagnosed with prostate cancer He was regarded as a compelling but complex and often confrontational presence, however. Fame was ""a challenge"" and ""not a happy condition for me"", he admitted. ""It's a privilege and a responsibility, and I'm not sure I carried the responsibility well at times, which is embarrassing,""he told The Telegraph in 2013,external. ""And I've had to look and be disappointed in myself occasionally for how I behaved in some circumstances."" He drank heavily for a spell and in a high-profile palimony trial in 1989, former partner Sandra Jennings described his drunken rages. Another former girlfriend, Children of a Lesser God co-star Marlee Matlin, later accused him of physical and emotional abuse. He apologised ""for any pain I caused"". The actor revealed in 2018 that he had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer.

M&S and Asos in push to give Ukraine refugees jobs,"Major UK businesses are lining up to offer jobs to Ukrainian refugees when theystart to arrive in the UK. A group of more than 45 large businesses is pressing the government to make it easier for those driven out by Russia's invasion to come to the UK. Marks & Spencer, Asos, Lush and recruitment giant Robert Walters are some of the firms involved. The government has been criticised over the speed and scale of its response to the Ukraine refugee crisis. The initiative is being led by British entrepreneur Emma Sinclair, the chief executive of Enterprise Alumni. She said it had quickly gained ground in a short space of time. The project is in its early stages, and many of the details about how it will work in practice are unclear. Ms Sinclair, who is co-ordinating the initiative at the moment despite a recent head injury, told the BBC that many of her ancestors were from Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. The aim of the project is to help ""tens of thousands"" of refugees not only get jobs in the UK, but to help them find accommodation, and gain language skills. Many UK businesses have beenfacing labour shortagesdue to a combination of factors including Covid and Brexit, and it is in their interests to fill outstanding vacancies. However, Ms Sinclair said the consortium was ""purely altruistic"" and not acting to promote any particular corporate agenda. The companies involved, especially the recruitment firms, have got ""thousands of jobs to fill every day of the week"" - this is not a new situation for them, she said. ""People are inherently generally good, and people want to help,"" she added. The initiative,which was first reported in the Sunday Times,external, wants to provide tens of thousands of jobs. Ms Sinclair is due to have a meeting with the newly appointed Minister for Refugees Richard Harrington on Monday, and she has also been in contact with Number 10 Downing Street. ""We [businesses] want people, we need people, and we want to help,"" she said. ""We want to see movement on rising numbers of refugees."" She said the current focus of this initiative is to help refugees from Ukraine rebuild their lives, but in an ideal world the scheme would be extended to all refugees. The government has been criticised, including by its own MPs, for not moving quickly enough to help refugees from Ukraine. Ms Sinclair said that the UK ""can do better"" and ""go faster"" than it is currently on Ukraine refugees. ""We want to see the red tape burnt,"" she said. Emma Sinclair, chief executive of Enterprise Alumni, is currently coordinating the consortium A government spokesperson said: ""We are standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians which is why we've made it easier for those with valid Ukrainian passports to come here. This is alongside changes to visas to ensure Ukrainians in the UK can stay here. ""We have expanded our visa application capacity to 13,000 a week, deployed additional staff across the EU, with a 24/7 helpline in place to ensure those who need appointments can get them to come here. ""This allows us to balance security risks while welcoming those in need,"" they added. Marks & Spencer, which is part of the consortium, said it was ""absolutely committed to supporting Ukrainian refugees"" both through humanitarian schemes and through jobs. ""We are in discussion with the Home Office about the detail of this,"" it said. Online fashion retailer Asos, which is also involved in the initiative, said: ""We are currently recruiting for many tech engineering roles in the UK and we know Ukraine has a strong skill set in this area. ""We are also working with our partners to explore opportunities at our distribution centres in the UK and elsewhere in Europe."" Asos expects the number of positions to be in double digits in the UK, adding the business already has a Ukrainian workforce in Poland so opportunities for newly arrived refugees will exist there. High street cosmetics business Lush said it was ""happy to consider refugees for any role, even those we would usually advertise for internal candidates only"". It said its recruiters are meeting with the Refugee Council charity next week to ""share what potential opportunities there are across the business"". Lush added that it was recruiting web developers and other tech roles, designers, spa therapists and warehouse and retail assistants - and from May and June, temporary staff for the Christmas period. Toby Fowlston, chief executive of recruitment giant Robert Walters, said the firm had ""committed to hiring displaced Ukrainians into our own business and as a recruitment company we will also represent them as potential employees to our clients"". ""We will need government support to help expedite working visas to ensure we can act quickly."","" he added. Another large UK recruitment firm Impellam Group is part of the consortium, as is software company Unit4 and Portman Dental Group.

However, she warned that for a six-month placement, both the refugees and the people offering space in their houses need to be screened, otherwise it ""might be a little dangerous"". Ms Nathan added that the processes for dealing with Ukrainian refugees also needed to be fair to refugees of other nationalities. ""What happens to Afghans?"" she said. ""They are still in hotels."" Organisations that are not linked to the initiative have also contacted the Home Office to say they are willing to offer refugees jobs, include Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and the Co-op. More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion, and European Union countries have let them come in without a visa for three years. In the UK, at the moment only Ukrainian refugees with family connections in the UK can apply for a visa under the Ukraine Family Scheme. Other visas are available but application centres in Ukraine are closed. However, under a new scheme called Homes for Ukraine, people will be able to nominate a named individual or a family to stay with them rent-free, or in another property, for at least six months. Sponsors will not be required to know the refugees in advance and there will be no limit on the number of people who can come to the UK through this route. Refugees will be given three years leave to remain, with the right to work and access public services.

'Sky turned red' as missiles hit Lviv military base,"Witnesses to a deadly Russian attack on a Ukrainian military base have told how ""the sky turned red"" as missiles struck the site near the Polish border. At least 35 people died in the strike on the Yavoriv training base, near a major crossing point into Poland used by refugees from the conflict. Russia fired around 30 cruise missiles at the base, outside the city of Lviv, early Sunday, the local governor said. Hours after the attack, ambulances were still rushing to the scene. Roads leading to the facility were blocked with checkpoints and authorities were conducting search-and-rescue operations. Russian jets fired around 30 cruise missiles at the site, also known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, authorities in Lviv said. Most, though, were intercepted by the air defence system. Video of the aftermath of the attack posted online and verified by the BBC showed a huge crater at the site and thick smoke billowing from a massive fire at a small building nearby. Dukhnych Vitalii, a 19-year-old student who lives in a nearby apartment complex, said ""the night sky turned red"" as the attack happened. ""We can't hear the air raid sirens in this area. We woke up when we heard the sound of the first explosion. We went to the bunker,"" he said. ""It looked scary."" His 25-year-old cousin was training at the facility, Mr Vitalii said, and his family were still trying to contact him. Another resident, Nadin Berezovska, said she could see the fire from her parents' flat, where she had been living after fleeing the country's capital, Kyiv. ""It was very scary. We're in shock,"" Ms Berezovska, a 39-year-old photographer, said. ""Now we realise that it doesn't matter where you live,"" she said. ""We aren't safe. How can Poland be safe?"" The base has previously been used for military training of Ukrainian troops, often with instructors from the US and other Nato countries. It was not immediately clear whether foreign instructors were at the centre when it was hit. The attack is significant because the base, one of Ukraine's largest military facilities, is located just 25km (15 miles) from Poland, a Nato member. The border with Poland is a vital route for refugees, but also for weapons being sent by countries in the military alliance - which have included anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. It is also the first major attack in western Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of the country, on 24 February. The region has become a hub for millions of people escaping the war in other areas, and around 2.6 million have left Ukraine so far. ""We're very scared,"" Yurii Vitiv, a 50-year-old driver, said. ""Until this morning we had hoped that the war would stop on eastern Ukraine."" Hours earlier, Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, said Moscow had warned the US that ""pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn't just a dangerous move, it's an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets"". LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby SANCTIONS:Impact on everyday lives in Russia EXIT:Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad RECRUITS:Ukraine's teenage soldiers IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Despite sending weapons, Nato has, so far, ruled out a request by Ukraine's government to establish a no-fly zone over the country, saying this would trigger a wider conflict with Russia. But Andriy Sadovyy, the mayor of Lviv, said such a measure was necessary to prevent Russia from carrying our aerial strikes. ""Europeans, understand this situation: it's easy to talk and drink coffee and say they're deeply concerned... but every hour the skies are not closed, the Russians are killing civilians and children,"" he told the BBC in an interview. ""We need closed sky. We need decision today. We need bullet-proof vests today, not tomorrow. Tomorrow Russian missiles [will] end up in the European Union."" Ms Berezovska, the photographer, agreed. ""In Ukraine, there's no place to hide,"" she said. ""We ask Nato to close the sky."" Additional reporting by Orysia Khimiak Are you or your family in Lviv?

Stormont must 'do more' to help Ukrainian refugees,"Ukrainian refugees wait for a train at the railway station in Lviv, western Ukraine Households in Northern Ireland will be offered Â£350 a month to open their homes to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. EarlierHousing Secretary Michael Gove said that tens of thousands of people could come to the UK under the scheme. The Northern Ireland Executive Office said has encouraged expressions of interest in providing accommodation from both individuals and groups. A website to express an interest in being a sponsor is launching on Monday. Westminster confirmed that, like in other parts of the UK, people in Northern Ireland who allow Ukrainian refugees to stay in their homes rent-free will be entitled to government payments. Details of the Homes for Ukraine scheme were announced on Sunday and the project will be overseen by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. BBC News NI asked the department how additional funding would be allocated to support refugees coming to Northern Ireland, including any extra school places and healthcare provision they may need. It said the department will work with devolved administrations to decide the best funding route for them, and discussions were ongoing. However, ministers working in Stormont's devolved government - the Northern Ireland Executive - are currently having problems with the allocation of their existing funds. Paul Givan, from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP),resigned in protest over post-Brexit trade rules in early February, which meant the deputy first minister automatically lost her job. Without both leaders in post, Northern Ireland Executive ministers cannot meet as a team to take any major new decisions. That means thatthey have not been able to sign off on a three-year budget, and Finance Minister Conor Murphy also saida pot of Â£300m from the Treasury cannot be spent without executive approval. How does the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainians work? Heartless or doing its best to help refugees? UK in crisis mode Ireland takes in 5,500 Ukrainian refugees In England, local authorities will also receive Â£10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said. It is not yet known how this money will be allocated in Northern Ireland. On Sunday night, a spokesperson for the Executive Office said that ""while not all the details have yet been announced by Westminster, we are working at pace, making preparations so we stand ready to provide sanctuary to Ukrainian refugees"". ""Mindful of the pressure on social housing stock, officials are also engaging with councils and the voluntary and community sector to find creative ways of bringing suitable accommodation into use and identifying all available capacity,"" added the spokesperson. ""We are in close contact with the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing and with colleagues in other jurisdictions. ""We will participate fully in this humanitarian effort. Partnership across sectors and wider society will be key to ensuring we can support as many Ukrainian people seeking sanctuary here as possible."" Matthew O'Toole previously worked in Downing Street and the Treasury as a civil servant On Sunday morning, the SDLP's economy spokesperson called on Northern Ireland's devolved government to ""do more"" to support Ukrainian refugees who are fleeing the war. Matthew O'Toole made the call afterleaders in Scotland and Wales proposed both their governments become ""super sponsors""to take in more refugees. He said it was ""not good enough"" for Stormont to take no action because of the current absence of its leaders. Mr O'Toole was asked if there was more Stormont could do to support Ukrainian refugees in the absence of a first and deputy first minister. ""Yes, there definitely is,"" he told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme. ""From my perspective, I've already called on on the Executive Office to do more more to prepare to receive Ukrainian refugees. ""This is the biggest humanitarian crisis on our continent in probably most of our lifetimes, probably since the Second World War."" The Home Office in Westminster has faced criticism in recent days over the numbers of Ukrainian refugees it has allowed into the UK so far and the amount of bureaucracy involved its visa system. In contrast, EU member states, including the Republic of Ireland, lifted visa restrictions on Ukrainians arriving in the country shortly after Russia invaded. To date, about 5,500 Ukrainian refugees have now arrived in the Republic of Ireland, the country'staoiseach (prime minister) confirmed to the BBC's Sunday Morning programme.

Scotland and Wales bid to be refugee super sponsors,"The first ministers of Scotland and Wales want to get Ukrainians settled and cared for faster Scotland's first minister and her Welsh counterpart have proposed that both governments become ""super sponsors"" to Ukranian refugees fleeing the war. Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford have written to the UK government to confirm their commitment in contributing to its community sponsorship scheme. But Scotland and Wales have offered to step further to support refugees by acting as super sponsors. It is hoped this would allow Ukrainians to come to the two countries faster. The idea would be to get them into temporary accommodation immediately and then work with local partners to provide longer-term places to stay, including with host individuals, and give them access to safeguarding and services. Households in the UK will be offered Â£350 a monthto open their homes to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. The UK government's Homes for Ukraine scheme calls on people to offer a spare room or an empty property to a refugee for a period of at least six months. In a joint letter to Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford have emphasised that the government must provide more clarity on how the scheme will work. The letter makes clear that no cap will be set by Scotland and Wales on the numbers of refugees they will welcome. Scotland has made an immediate commitment to support 3,000 refugees in the initial wave, in line with the numbers that were resettled under the Syrian scheme. Wales would take 1,000. The Scottish government said it would welcome ""at least"" a proportionate share of the total number who come to the UK. The letter also says it is essential that all arrivals have access to public funds, including welfare benefits, and are exempted from the Habitual Residence Test for accessing these. The first ministers also call for urgent clarity on funding arrangements to support local government and they have suggested a ""per head"" funding arrangement similar to the Syrian and Afghanistan schemes to support resettlement and integration costs. Finally, the letter calls for all visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals to be waived. Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I want Scotland to play our full part in welcoming Ukrainians seeking sanctuary from war. The UK response so far has been beset with bureaucracy and red tape, when what is needed is humanity and urgent refuge for as many as possible. ""We are still awaiting full details of the proposed community sponsorship scheme. If the UK government is still unwilling to waive visa requirements, it is essential that this scheme works efficiently and effectively and allows people to come to the UK as quickly as possible. ""However, I am very worried that if people have to be matched with an individual sponsor before even being allowed entry to the UK, it will prove slow and cumbersome."" People called for more help for Ukrainian refugees at a rally in Glasgow on Saturday She said that super sponsorship would allow large numbers to come to the respective nations quickly and that she would be able to welcome Ukrainians to Scotland as soon as possible. However, refugee support groups fear the main problem is not with hosting Ukrainians, but in visa restrictions stopping them from entering the country in the first place. Robina Qureshi, director of refugee homelessness charity Positive Action in Housing, said there were skilled and experienced hosting networks up and down the country with thousands of hosts. ""Britain is not planning on taking its fair share of refugees, even though there is public support for taking in Ukrainian refugees,"" she said. ""The families who host refugees don't do it for money, they are helping because they see a government that is heartless and won't lift visa restrictions. ""The number of houses is not the problem and this is a gimmick - just another distraction from the fact that the UK is still the only country in Europe that hasn't lifted visa restrictions and there are still no safe routes here for Ukrainian war refugees."" A spokesman for the Department for Levelling Up said: ""We are always grateful to the devolved govts for their offers of support. ""We will continue to work with the devolved governments in the organisation of this scheme and see how best it can continue to be delivered.""

"Ukraine accuses Russia of abducting second mayorThe news comes as Ukraine says Russia is trying to create ""pseudo-republics"" to break up the country.Europe","Ukraine's foreign minister said Yevhen Matveyev was abducted by ""Russian war criminals"" Ukraine's government has accused the Russian military of abducting another mayor in an area that it has captured. Yevhen Matveyev was seized in the southern town of Dniprorudne,Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted,external, accusing Russia of ""terror"" tactics. Earlier, Russia installed a new mayor in Melitopol, after allegedly abducting the city's previous incumbent. Ukraine's president also accused Russia of trying to create ""pseudo-republics"" to break his country apart. In her first public appearance, Melitopol's newly installed mayor Galina Danilchenko urged residents not to take part in ""extremist actions"" and declared her main task was construction of ""basic mechanisms under the new reality"". Hundreds of people took part in a protest outside the city hall on Saturday to demand the release of previous incumbent Ivan Fedorov, who had refused to co-operate with Russian troops since they took the city on the third day of the invasion.

""We are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,""Mr Fedorov had told the BBC earlier in the week. ""They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us, and we do not want their help."" Russian authorities have not commented on his disappearance, but the prosecutor's office of the Russian-backed breakaway eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk hasreportedly accused him of ""terrorist activities"",external. CCTV image from the video allegedly showing the mayor being marched away Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded Mr Fedorov's immediate release and asked the leaders of Israel, Germany and France to put pressure on Russia to free him. In his latest video address on Saturday night, Mr Zelensky said Russia was to create ""pseudo-republics"" in Ukraine. He praised those refusing to collaborate in the Russian-controlled Kherson region. The council there had earlier adopted a resolution reaffirming that it ""has been, is and will be an inalienable part of the united state of Ukraine"" in response to what it said was a Russian plan to stage a referendum on the creation of a ""people's republic"". Mr Zelensky also warned ""certain figures"" of dire personal consequences of any collaboration - an apparent reference to Ms Danilchenko.

"Ireland takes in 5,500 Ukrainian refugees","MicheÃ¡l Martin says a humanitarian response ""trumps everything"" Five-and-a-half-thousand Ukrainian refugees have now arrived in the Republic of Ireland, the country's taoiseach (prime minister) has said. Ireland lifted restrictions on Ukrainians arriving in the country shortly after Russia invaded. This allows them to enter Ireland without checks or visas beforehand, as well as access benefits and healthcare, and the right to work. MicheÃ¡l Martin said a humanitarian response ""trumps anything"". More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded, in what the UN has called the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War Two. The Irish government has previously said it could take up to 100,000 refugees. LIVE: Latest updates from on the ground Asked about the figure by Sophie Raworth on BBC's Sunday Morning, Mr Martin said Ireland had ""never experienced anything on this scale before, but we believe we need to do it"". He added: ""Our primary impulse is to assist those fleeing war. ""The Irish people are very seized by a series of atrocities that are going on, what we're witnessing on our screens every evening is really shocking people and there is huge human empathy there to help the women and the children. There is no sign of any end to the war in Ukraine, now in its 18th day ""There is always a balancing of issues, we keep channels open with our UK counterparts. The Home Secretary and our Minister for Justice Helen McEntee have been in regular contact."" Mr Martin is in London on a two-day trip, where he has discussedthe Northern Ireland protocol with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as well as the international response to Ukraine. When asked about security concerns Mr Martin said: ""The humanitarian response trumps anything as far as we're concerned. ""But our security people will keep on monitoring the situation in terms of what's on. ""We can all see the humanitarian crisis, we do know that that can be exploited by certain bad actors, but our security personnel will keep an eye on that in a more general way. ""The prime minister's only discussion with me was on the basis of praising the Irish humanitarian response and no more than that. We didn't get into the security issues as such."" Ireland's military is neutral, and it is not a Nato member. Because of this Ireland sends only ""non-lethal"" aid to Ukraine, like medical supplies, body armour and helmets - not weapons. Asked about Ireland's military neutrality and Ukraine's international plea for arms, Mr Martin said his country would have to look at its position in the future but added: ""One cannot, in the middle of a crisis, change a long-held policy overnight."" Events in Ukraine including the flight of refugees have caused some to question Ireland's military neutrality He said Ireland was not morally or politically neutral. ""We're not a military power, what Ireland does best is on the humanitarian side and on the peace keeping side."" On Sunday, the government announced a scheme to offer UK householdsÂ£350 a month to host refugees. Unlike the EU,the UK has not waived its visa rules. On 9 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said about 1,000 Ukrainian refugees had received UK visas. But some MPs have called for restrictions to be scrapped. How does the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainians work? The programme asked the taoiseach whether the talkson the Northern Ireland Protocol-  the post-Brexit trade arrangements which led to the recent collapse of Stormont's devolved government - would be ""kicked into the long grass"" because of the crisis in Ukraine ""I think we should concentrate, obviously, on our response to Ukraine,"" Mr Martin replied, but he also said he believed it would also be possible to make progress on the protocol talks. He suggested the war in Ukraine had showed the strength of international cooperation on ""big issues"", which gave him hope for agreement on the protocol. ""What's interesting - and I welcome this warmly - is the very strong partnership between the UK, the EU, the US on fundamental issues of substance - which is democracy; human rights; the freedom of the individual - and that is something that I think really trumps the issues. ""It really says to us all that we should be able to resolve issues to do with the Northern Ireland Protocol."" Mr Martin said access to the EU Single Market was important to Northern Ireland for inward investment but he added both sides were trying to find solutions. However, he said he did not believe there would be a break-through before the Stormont election on 5 May. He said some progress had already been made, and the EU had ""put forward a lot of sensible compromises and their mindset is to really resolve this, and I believe the foreign secretary (Liz Truss) is in the same mode of thought.""

Luton fall a place to seventh but are level on points with sixth-placed Sheffield United after 36 games. Luton Town 1-2 QPR The full-time whistle goes and QPR complete the comeback for a huge win in the race for the play-offs, having won just one game in their last seven before today. Luton looked in full control as they led throughCameron Jerome's first-half strike. QPR were handed a lifeline whenAndre Graywas brought down in the box and he was the coolest man in the stadium when he stepped up to equalise from the penalty spot. Luton pushed for the winner but it was the away side who grabbed all three points asRob Dickie's late finish from a corner, which looked to have gone in off his shoulder, completed a dramatic turnaround. Luton Town 1-1 QPR There's a late yellow card for Lee Wallace for winding down the clock. Luton Town 1-1 QPR QPR are seeing this out well now, controlling the ball and slowing the game down as they head towards a massive three points. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Now then! What can Luton do to get back in this game? Robert Snodgrass finds space on the edge of the box and looks to bend the ball into the corner but it's hit down the middle and doesn't trouble David Marshall. Now it's QPR in fourth in the table as it stands with Luton in seventh. Five minutes added on! Rob Dickie (82 mins) QPR are ahead and it's the big centre-backRob Dickie! The away side win a corner after Luton captain Kal Naismith slices behind. There are so many bodies in the area as the ball is whipped in and it hits Dickie on the shoulder, with James Shea unable to keep the ball out. There's a question of offside again with Rangers players potentially blocking the goalkeeper's view. But the goal stands and the turnaround is complete. Can Luton respond? Luton Town 1-1 QPR Robert Snodgrass is on for Luton, replacing Jordan Clark. QPR are floating some nice balls into the home side's box but haven't been able to get on the end of any as yet. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Close! Amari'i Bell lashes a shot from wide on the left and it hits the side netting. David Marshall might well have had it covered but it had the potential to be an absolute screamer! QPR have made their final change with Chris Willock coming on for penalty-scorer Andre Gray as we head for the final 10 minutes. Luton Town 1-1 QPR There are muted appeals for a Luton penalty but replays show it's a coming together of their own players! Luke Amos replaces Jeff Hendrick for the visitors. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Andre Gray gets in behind the Luton backline but is flagged offside. It looks like spaces could be opening up for QPR as the away side push for the winner. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Elijah Adebayo wins a corner for the home side, with what looked like another handball. David Marshall does well to get the ball away and Adebayo is penalised for a foul as the ball comes back in. QPR then go up the other end and Moses Odubajo whips in a dangerous ball which is turned away for a corner - again it comes to nothing. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Cameron Jerome does well down the right hand side to force David Marshall into action in the QPR goal. The home side then force a corner but it's headed out for a goal kick. Luton still look the more likely team to score, with the equaliser very much coming against the run of play. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Luton have immediately upped the intensity as they aim to take the lead again. QPR are making moves as well, with Charlie Austin coming on for the booked Ilias Chair. Andre Gray pen (55 mins) QPR are level! Andre Graygoes down under a challenge from Kal Naismith on the goal line and the referee points to the spot. Gray steps up to lash the ball into the top right corner against his former club with James Shea rooted to the floor in the Luton goal. It's Gray's first penalty since 2017, that makes you wonder why he doesn't take more. Game on! Luton Town 1-0 QPR The visitors have a big chance here... Luton Town 1-0 QPR Allan Campbell wins a free kick for Luton in a good position after he's brought down by Jeff Hendrick. James Bree steps up but it's straight into the wall, not his finest. Luton Town 1-0 QPR The home side make a lightning start to the second half as they work the ball out to Elijah Adebayo on the left-hand side. There's a hint of offside against him but he plays it back to Allan Campbell on the edge of the area, whose side-foot shot is saved well by David Marshall. That should do his confidence a world of good after conceding the opening goal. Luton Town 1-0 QPR Ilias Chair gets the second half under way. Â© 2025 BBC.

"In pictures: War, suffering and defiance in Ukraine","It's already week three of the Russian invasion - and the scenes below are becoming all too familiar across Ukraine. Cities across the country often wake up to the haunting call of air raid sirens and skies filled with traces of rockets, missiles and artillery strikes, like this one from Baryshivka, east of the capital, Kyiv. Russia may have been slow to advance inside Ukrainian territory, but the shelling has been intense. The Russians say they are hitting military targets - the scene below is from a storage facility in Kalynivka, in the centre of the country. Ukrainians, however, say the occupying force has been aiming for civilian targets indiscriminately. One of the worst-hit cities has been Kharkiv in the east. The BBC'sQuentin Sommerville says entering the centre of the city is almost like entering another world. Few neighbourhoods have escaped some kind of damage. The relentless Russian shelling has meant that most of the 1.5 million population has fled. Early in the mornings, queues can still be seen at pharmacies, banks, supermarkets and petrol stations, as those who stayed behind stock up on supplies, our correspondent says. A huge logistical and humanitarian effort is going on behind the scenes to keep Kharkiv running - these volunteers below are preparing food for the defenders, and others who may need it. And the toll is mounting by the day. Even though official figures are patchy, thousands are believed to have lost their lives or sustained serious injuries, many losing limbs in the shelling. The situation is said to be dire in the port city of Mariupol, which has been surrounded by Russian troops for nearly two weeks. Authorities say nearly 1,600 have died as a result of Russian shelling alone - and they are unable to collect the bodies amid unrelenting Russian firepower to force it to surrender. Not far from Mariupol, another battle is being waged to conquer the city of Mykolaiv. Cluster bombs have been used, but the locals are resisting. However, Mykolaiv's governor Vitaly Kim is loath to celebrate prematurely,telling the BBC's Andrew Harding, ""We are winning this fight, but not this war."" Dnipro was hit for the first time on Friday - a day when Russia expanded its strikes from east, where the city lies, to the west. The capital city is bracing for the worst. Ukrainian forces have been holding the Russians back for days on the outskirts. And in Kyiv city itself, volunteers have been preparing - digging trenches and building barricades.The city is turning into a fortress, says our correspondent there Jeremy Bowen. Others are trying to contribute to the effort. Field kitchens have sprung up in various neighbourhoods. However, for many Ukrainians - women and children only, as men have to stay behind to fight - the scramble to flee has become the norm. More than 2.5 million people have now left the country. The shock is all too real. Here in Moldova, Smadar the Clown tries to lighten the mood with this mock interview with a young Ukrainian girl at a refugee centre in the country's capital, Chisinau. Moldova clown Culture is randomly a victim of the war, too, as seen in too many conflicts this century alone. The picturesque western city of Lviv has been left untouched, so far. But it is preparing - the checkpoints on main roads and the soldiers on the streets can be seen by all - butsome preparations are taking place behind closed doors, says the BBC's Joel Gunter. In Lviv's galleries, museums and churches, a huge operation is under way to safeguard the city's cultural heritage, he says.

Scotland and Wales 'super sponsor' bid,"The first ministers of Scotland and Wales want to get Ukrainians settled and cared for faster Scotland's first minister and her Welsh counterpart have proposed that both governments become ""super sponsors"" to Ukranian refugees fleeing the war. Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford have written to the UK government to confirm their commitment in contributing to its community sponsorship scheme. But Scotland and Wales have offered to step further to support refugees by acting as super sponsors. It is hoped this would allow Ukrainians to come to the two countries faster. The idea would be to get them into temporary accommodation immediately and then work with local partners to provide longer-term places to stay, including with host individuals, and give them access to safeguarding and services. Households in the UK will be offered Â£350 a monthto open their homes to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. The UK government's Homes for Ukraine scheme calls on people to offer a spare room or an empty property to a refugee for a period of at least six months. In a joint letter to Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford have emphasised that the government must provide more clarity on how the scheme will work. The letter makes clear that no cap will be set by Scotland and Wales on the numbers of refugees they will welcome. Scotland has made an immediate commitment to support 3,000 refugees in the initial wave, in line with the numbers that were resettled under the Syrian scheme. Wales would take 1,000. The Scottish government said it would welcome ""at least"" a proportionate share of the total number who come to the UK. The letter also says it is essential that all arrivals have access to public funds, including welfare benefits, and are exempted from the Habitual Residence Test for accessing these. The first ministers also call for urgent clarity on funding arrangements to support local government and they have suggested a ""per head"" funding arrangement similar to the Syrian and Afghanistan schemes to support resettlement and integration costs. Finally, the letter calls for all visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals to be waived. Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I want Scotland to play our full part in welcoming Ukrainians seeking sanctuary from war. The UK response so far has been beset with bureaucracy and red tape, when what is needed is humanity and urgent refuge for as many as possible. ""We are still awaiting full details of the proposed community sponsorship scheme. If the UK government is still unwilling to waive visa requirements, it is essential that this scheme works efficiently and effectively and allows people to come to the UK as quickly as possible. ""However, I am very worried that if people have to be matched with an individual sponsor before even being allowed entry to the UK, it will prove slow and cumbersome."" People called for more help for Ukrainian refugees at a rally in Glasgow on Saturday She said that super sponsorship would allow large numbers to come to the respective nations quickly and that she would be able to welcome Ukrainians to Scotland as soon as possible. However, refugee support groups fear the main problem is not with hosting Ukrainians, but in visa restrictions stopping them from entering the country in the first place. Robina Qureshi, director of refugee homelessness charity Positive Action in Housing, said there were skilled and experienced hosting networks up and down the country with thousands of hosts. ""Britain is not planning on taking its fair share of refugees, even though there is public support for taking in Ukrainian refugees,"" she said. ""The families who host refugees don't do it for money, they are helping because they see a government that is heartless and won't lift visa restrictions. ""The number of houses is not the problem and this is a gimmick - just another distraction from the fact that the UK is still the only country in Europe that hasn't lifted visa restrictions and there are still no safe routes here for Ukrainian war refugees."" A spokesman for the Department for Levelling Up said: ""We are always grateful to the devolved govts for their offers of support. ""We will continue to work with the devolved governments in the organisation of this scheme and see how best it can continue to be delivered.""

'Sky turned red' as missiles hit Lviv military baseA witness to a deadly Russian attack on a Ukrainian military base describes the moment missiles struck the site.Europe,"Witnesses to a deadly Russian attack on a Ukrainian military base have told how ""the sky turned red"" as missiles struck the site near the Polish border. At least 35 people died in the strike on the Yavoriv training base, near a major crossing point into Poland used by refugees from the conflict. Russia fired around 30 cruise missiles at the base, outside the city of Lviv, early Sunday, the local governor said. Hours after the attack, ambulances were still rushing to the scene. Roads leading to the facility were blocked with checkpoints and authorities were conducting search-and-rescue operations. Russian jets fired around 30 cruise missiles at the site, also known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, authorities in Lviv said. Most, though, were intercepted by the air defence system. Video of the aftermath of the attack posted online and verified by the BBC showed a huge crater at the site and thick smoke billowing from a massive fire at a small building nearby. Dukhnych Vitalii, a 19-year-old student who lives in a nearby apartment complex, said ""the night sky turned red"" as the attack happened. ""We can't hear the air raid sirens in this area. We woke up when we heard the sound of the first explosion. We went to the bunker,"" he said. ""It looked scary."" His 25-year-old cousin was training at the facility, Mr Vitalii said, and his family were still trying to contact him. Another resident, Nadin Berezovska, said she could see the fire from her parents' flat, where she had been living after fleeing the country's capital, Kyiv. ""It was very scary. We're in shock,"" Ms Berezovska, a 39-year-old photographer, said. ""Now we realise that it doesn't matter where you live,"" she said. ""We aren't safe. How can Poland be safe?"" The base has previously been used for military training of Ukrainian troops, often with instructors from the US and other Nato countries. It was not immediately clear whether foreign instructors were at the centre when it was hit. The attack is significant because the base, one of Ukraine's largest military facilities, is located just 25km (15 miles) from Poland, a Nato member. The border with Poland is a vital route for refugees, but also for weapons being sent by countries in the military alliance - which have included anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. It is also the first major attack in western Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of the country, on 24 February. The region has become a hub for millions of people escaping the war in other areas, and around 2.6 million have left Ukraine so far. ""We're very scared,"" Yurii Vitiv, a 50-year-old driver, said. ""Until this morning we had hoped that the war would stop on eastern Ukraine."" Hours earlier, Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, said Moscow had warned the US that ""pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn't just a dangerous move, it's an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets"". LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby SANCTIONS:Impact on everyday lives in Russia EXIT:Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad RECRUITS:Ukraine's teenage soldiers IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Despite sending weapons, Nato has, so far, ruled out a request by Ukraine's government to establish a no-fly zone over the country, saying this would trigger a wider conflict with Russia. But Andriy Sadovyy, the mayor of Lviv, said such a measure was necessary to prevent Russia from carrying our aerial strikes. ""Europeans, understand this situation: it's easy to talk and drink coffee and say they're deeply concerned... but every hour the skies are not closed, the Russians are killing civilians and children,"" he told the BBC in an interview. ""We need closed sky. We need decision today. We need bullet-proof vests today, not tomorrow. Tomorrow Russian missiles [will] end up in the European Union."" Ms Berezovska, the photographer, agreed. ""In Ukraine, there's no place to hide,"" she said. ""We ask Nato to close the sky."" Additional reporting by Orysia Khimiak Are you or your family in Lviv?

Luton fall a place to seventh but are level on points with sixth-placed Sheffield United after 36 games. Luton Town 1-2 QPR The full-time whistle goes and QPR complete the comeback for a huge win in the race for the play-offs, having won just one game in their last seven before today. Luton looked in full control as they led throughCameron Jerome's first-half strike. QPR were handed a lifeline whenAndre Graywas brought down in the box and he was the coolest man in the stadium when he stepped up to equalise from the penalty spot. Luton pushed for the winner but it was the away side who grabbed all three points asRob Dickie's late finish from a corner, which looked to have gone in off his shoulder, completed a dramatic turnaround. Luton Town 1-1 QPR There's a late yellow card for Lee Wallace for winding down the clock. Luton Town 1-1 QPR QPR are seeing this out well now, controlling the ball and slowing the game down as they head towards a massive three points. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Now then! What can Luton do to get back in this game? Robert Snodgrass finds space on the edge of the box and looks to bend the ball into the corner but it's hit down the middle and doesn't trouble David Marshall. Now it's QPR in fourth in the table as it stands with Luton in seventh. Five minutes added on! Rob Dickie (82 mins) QPR are ahead and it's the big centre-backRob Dickie! The away side win a corner after Luton captain Kal Naismith slices behind. There are so many bodies in the area as the ball is whipped in and it hits Dickie on the shoulder, with James Shea unable to keep the ball out. There's a question of offside again with Rangers players potentially blocking the goalkeeper's view. But the goal stands and the turnaround is complete. Can Luton respond? Luton Town 1-1 QPR Robert Snodgrass is on for Luton, replacing Jordan Clark. QPR are floating some nice balls into the home side's box but haven't been able to get on the end of any as yet. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Close! Amari'i Bell lashes a shot from wide on the left and it hits the side netting. David Marshall might well have had it covered but it had the potential to be an absolute screamer! QPR have made their final change with Chris Willock coming on for penalty-scorer Andre Gray as we head for the final 10 minutes. Luton Town 1-1 QPR There are muted appeals for a Luton penalty but replays show it's a coming together of their own players! Luke Amos replaces Jeff Hendrick for the visitors. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Andre Gray gets in behind the Luton backline but is flagged offside. It looks like spaces could be opening up for QPR as the away side push for the winner. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Elijah Adebayo wins a corner for the home side, with what looked like another handball. David Marshall does well to get the ball away and Adebayo is penalised for a foul as the ball comes back in. QPR then go up the other end and Moses Odubajo whips in a dangerous ball which is turned away for a corner - again it comes to nothing. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Cameron Jerome does well down the right hand side to force David Marshall into action in the QPR goal. The home side then force a corner but it's headed out for a goal kick. Luton still look the more likely team to score, with the equaliser very much coming against the run of play. Luton Town 1-1 QPR Luton have immediately upped the intensity as they aim to take the lead again. QPR are making moves as well, with Charlie Austin coming on for the booked Ilias Chair. Andre Gray pen (55 mins) QPR are level! Andre Graygoes down under a challenge from Kal Naismith on the goal line and the referee points to the spot. Gray steps up to lash the ball into the top right corner against his former club with James Shea rooted to the floor in the Luton goal. It's Gray's first penalty since 2017, that makes you wonder why he doesn't take more. Game on! Luton Town 1-0 QPR The visitors have a big chance here... Luton Town 1-0 QPR Allan Campbell wins a free kick for Luton in a good position after he's brought down by Jeff Hendrick. James Bree steps up but it's straight into the wall, not his finest. Luton Town 1-0 QPR The home side make a lightning start to the second half as they work the ball out to Elijah Adebayo on the left-hand side. There's a hint of offside against him but he plays it back to Allan Campbell on the edge of the area, whose side-foot shot is saved well by David Marshall. That should do his confidence a world of good after conceding the opening goal. Luton Town 1-0 QPR Ilias Chair gets the second half under way. Â© 2025 BBC.

Wood knocks out Conlan to retain title,"Wood was outclassed over the first half of the fight Leigh Wood produced a brutal last-round knockout of Michael Conlan to retain his WBA 'Regular' featherweight title amid worrying scenes in Nottingham. The powerful punch sent Conlan through the ropes and on to the floor and he was later carried from the arena on a stretcher and taken to hospital. Conlan posted a video on Instagram on Sunday morning saying ""I'm all good"". England's Wood had himself been knocked down in the first round and was losing before the late knockout. Wood v Conlan round-by-round coverage Wood, who stopped his celebrations as his opponent received immediate medical treatment, told broadcaster Dazn immediately after the fight: ""I just hope Michael is all right; I can't celebrate until I know he is. ""He is so tough and it was a bad knockout so I just want to see he is all right."" And Belfast fighter Conlan gave an update on his condition from hospital hours later, saying his CT scans were clear. ""Congrats to Leigh Wood, congrats to his team, that was the best shot of the night he got me with at the end,"" he said. ""But it is what it is, I'll be back."" On Twitter, he followed up with: ""Definitely want a rematch."" This video can not be played Michael Conlan: Belfast fighter 'all good' after knockout defeat Conlan's words on Sunday morning will come as a huge relief for all concerned. Wood was in tears at the post-fight news conference and admitted: ""I'm in an emotional state and there have been some tears. ""I heard he is up and talking but I would like to see him."" Promoter Eddie Hearn called Wood's win ""one of the greatest comebacks"" but added ""we're all praying for Michael"". ""It looked a masterclass from Michael and coming into the 12th I could not see a way Leigh could turn the fight around,"" Hearn said. ""Michael was two ahead going into the last round - Leigh had to knock him out in the 12th and he did. ""I would love to celebrate but all our thoughts are with Michael."" Wood seemed to be heading for a quick defeat as Conlan made a superb start Wood, 33, won the 'regular' version of the WBA title with a points win over China's Xu Can in July at Matchroom's Fight Camp, staged in Hearn's garden in Brentwood, Essex, because of Covid-19 restrictions. Wood was set to fight at his hometown venue on the undercard of Carl Froch's IBF super-middleweight world title fight against Lucian Bute 10 years ago, but his bout did not go ahead. However, Wood, who was in the crowd that day cheering on his fellow Nottingham boxer as he beat Bute with a fifth-round knockout, called the opportunity to fight in front of a crowd of just under 10,000 people at the same venue, the Motorpoint Arena, ""a fairy tale"". His hopes nearly ended inside the opening three minutes when he was caught late in the first round by a brilliantly timed and brutally powerful overhand left. Previously unbeaten, Conlan was fighting for a world title in his 17th professional fight after a glittering amateur career that earned him an Olympic bronze medal and gold medals in both the World and European Amateur Championships and was close to winning the fight in the second. But Wood showed great character and desire, despite suffering a cut over his eye in the fourth round, as both men repeatedly traded blows in a hugely entertaining clash, which was described as the ""best fight I've ever seen"" by two-weight former world champion Carl Frampton. Wood gradually started to work his way back into the fight, aided by some great shots to Conlan's body, before the away fighter was judged to have been knocked down in the 11th, despite arguments from his corner, who told referee Steve Gray their fighter had slipped. But, after one minute 25 seconds of the final round, the fight ended in dramatic circumstances. Wood caught Conlan with a glancing blow to the head. Conlan dropped his arms, looking exhausted, and Wood landed the knockout blow. The WBA 'super' featherweight belt is vacant, Mexican Emanuel Navarrette, is the WBO champion, and Mark Magsayo of the Philippines holds the WBC crown after ending the long reign of American Gary Russell Jr with a majority points decision win in January. But Wood will be very keen to watch the fight for the IBF title as Spanish title holder Kiko Martinez takes on England's Josh Warrington in Warrington's home city of Leeds on 26 March. If Warrington beats Martinez for the second time in his career, that could set up an all-English world title fight at a stadium, with Leeds United's Elland Road and Nottingham Forest's City Ground potential venues. Hearn said: ""If Leigh Wood fights in Nottingham again it will be at the City Ground - that has been his dream for a long time."" Terri Harper stepped up to lightweight on her return to the ring Caoimhin Agyarkoextended his professional record to 11 wins from 11 contests. He was never in trouble against Mexican Juan Carlos Rubio, who showed great courage to reach the final bell. Two judges gave Agyarko every round (100-90), and the third judge called it 98-92, as the Belfast fighter kept hold of his WBA international middleweight title. Former women's super-featherweight world championTerri Harpergot back to winning ways after stepping up to lightweight with a big points win over Argentina's Yamila Belen Abellaneda. Harper, 25, said she was ""embarrassed"" by her loss to Alycia Baumgardner in November, which saw her relinquish the title she had held since July 2019. Harper started well against Belen Abellaneda but sustained a bad-looking cut over her left eye in the third round. Belen Abellaneda kept coming forward but took a lot of punishment with Harper having success with lefts to the head and body and some powerful uppercuts on her way to a deserved win. Irish lightweightGary Cullymaintained his unbeaten record with his 14th professional win as he knocked out Miguel Vasquez in five rounds after earlier putting him down in the third.

UK and Irish prime ministers discuss NI ProtocolMicheÃ¡l Martin and Boris Johnson met prior to attending the Ireland-England rugby match on Saturday.Northern Ireland,"MicheÃ¡l Martin and Boris Johnson sat together at the Ireland-England Six Nations match The international co-operation shown in response to Ukraine suggests it should be possible to resolve a matter like the Northern Ireland Protocol, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has said. MicheÃ¡l Martin was speaking a day after meeting UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London, during which they discussed both the Ukraine war and the protocol. They met before attendingthe England-Ireland rugby match on Saturday. Mr Martin has a series of engagements in London ahead of St Patrick's Day. Speaking a day after his meeting with Mr Johnson, the taoiseach told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme that some progress has already been made in the post-Brexit trade dispute between the EU and the UK. However, he said he did not believe there would be a breakthrough before the Northern Ireland Assembly election on 5 May. Asked if the protocol talks had now been ""kicked into the long grass"" because of the crisis in Ukraine, Mr Martin said: ""I think we should concentrate, obviously, on our response to Ukraine."" However, he added he also believed the crisis showed it should also be possible to make further progress on problems like the post-Brexit trade dispute. ""What's interesting - and I welcome this warmly - is the very strong partnership between between the UK, the EU, the US on fundamental issues of substance - which is democracy; human rights; the freedom of the individual - and that is something that I think really trumps the issues. ""It really says to us all that we should be able to resolve issues to do with the Northern Ireland Protocol."" During Saturday's meeting, Mr Martin and Mr Johnson also discussed ways of working together to ensure the return of the Northern Ireland Executive following May's assembly election. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said it would be difficult for his party to form a governmentif issues around the protocol are not addressed. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The mechanism to ensure free trade across the Irish border post-Brexit has been criticised by some unionists for its knock-on impact to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In February, the DUP'sPaul Givan resigned as first ministeras part of the party's protest against the protocol, causing the collapse of the executive. Taoiseach Micheal Martin wore a scarf with the colours of the Ukrainian flag as he led Sunday's St Patrick's Day parade in London The taoiseach welcomed the ongoing engagement between the UK and the European Union on the protocol issue. Mr Martin said access to the EU single market was important to Northern Ireland for inward investment but he added both sides were trying to find solutions. He argued that the EU had ""put forward a lot of sensible compromises and their mindset is to really resolve this, and I believe the foreign secretary (Liz Truss) is in the same mode of thought"".

Russia faces brain drain,"This video can not be played Watch: Yevgeny says it is his responsibility as a Russian to help Ukrainians Outside Georgia's parliament, Yevgeny Lyamin heaves boxes of clothes and food parcels on to a waiting truck bound for Ukraine. He is one of more than 25,000 Russians to have arrived in Georgia since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russians have been struggling to find affordable accommodation in all the major cities. Many can be seen wandering around the capital, Tbilisi, with their suitcases and often even their pets. A blue-and-yellow ribbon is attached to the lapel of Yevgeny's trench-coat - the colours of the Ukrainian flag. It was these ribbons that got him arrested at an anti-war protest in Russia, a day after it launched its war on Ukraine. ""I understood the best way to act against Putin's regime would be my emigration from Russia,"" says the 23-year old politics graduate. ""It's my responsibility to do anything I can to help the Ukrainians."" The exodus does not stop at Georgia. The EU, US, UK and Canada have closed their airspace to Russian flights, so they are heading for countries where flights are still permitted and where visas are not required, such as Turkey, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Many have fled to Armenia. According to one estimate by a Russian economist, as many as 200,000 Russians have left their country since the start of the war. Allow Twitter content?

Belarusians are on the move too, fleeing repression and the Western sanctions imposed on authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko's government for collaborating with Russia's Vladimir Putin. That has prompted prices to surge on last-minute flights and rental accommodation in the main host cities, such as Istanbul and Armenia's capital, Yerevan. ""A one-way flight to Istanbul cost me and my husband more than our combined monthly income,"" said Anya, who did not want to give her surname. For her the moment of decision came with a new ""state betrayal"" law that has come into force in Russia. Anyone expressing support for Ukraine could face jail sentences of up to 20 years and Anya believed she could be a target. ""Fear of closed borders, political repression and forced military service is in our DNA. I remember my grandmother telling me stories about the state of fear they lived in during Stalin's time, and now we are experiencing it,"" she said. An estimated 25,000 Russians have left for Georgia Many of the new emigres are tech industry professionals who can work remotely. A video games developer I met at a cafe in Tbilisi told me that he and most people he knew disagreed with Russian policy and they knew now that any protest would be violently suppressed. ""The only way we can protest is to leave the country, take our skills and money with us. Almost everyone in our circle has made a similar decision,"" said Igor (not his real name). He plans to leave the Georgian capital, because he does not feel welcome here. There have been numerous reports of Airbnb hosts refusing to let their properties to Russian and Belarusian citizens. ""I do not accept Russian and Belarus people"" one host told a Belarusian couple, who shared their exchange with the BBC. ""You do not have time for vacations - revolt against your corrupt governments."" ""They think we are running away from Russia because Apple Pay no longer works there,"" Igor complained. ""We are not running for comfort, we've lost everything there, we are basically refugees. Putin's geopolitics has destroyed our lives."" At Tbilisi's public service hall, new arrivals are registering businesses or applying for residency. Kristina and Nikita, who are both IT specialists from the Belarusian capital Minsk, have registered as sole entrepreneurs. That will allow them to open Georgian bank accounts. ""We don't support our governments, which is obvious because we ran away. We want to be safe here,"" said Kristina. ""But we are being bullied just because of our nationality, I need to hide my country of origin, I don't feel comfortable when people ask me where I am from."" Since the start of the war Tbilisi has seen some of the largest rallies in support of Ukraine. A recent survey found that 87% of Georgians view the war in Ukraine as their own war with Russia. But many Georgians are uneasy about this dramatic influx of Russians, as it is less than 14 years since Russia's leader invaded Georgia. Some 30,000 Georgians listened to Ukraine's President Zelensky during a mass protest Some fear President Putin might claim Russian citizens abroad need protection, because that was his excuse to justify sending troops into the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia in 2008. To date, 20% of Georgian territory remains under Russian occupation. However, tech entrepreneur Lev Kalashnikov thinks Georgia will benefit from what he asserts is the biggest brain drain in Russia's modern history. He opened a group for expats on the Telegram messaging app while standing in a queue. ""There were 50 people in front of me and 50 people behind me. They became my first subscribers and now we have nearly 4,000 members."" Members discuss where to find accommodation, how to open bank accounts, and whether or not it is safe to speak Russian in public. Yevgeny Lyamin is already learning Georgian, practising Georgia's unique alphabet in an exercise book. ""I am against Putin, I am against war. I still can't withdraw money from my Russian bank account, but that's nothing like the problems that Ukrainians face.""
