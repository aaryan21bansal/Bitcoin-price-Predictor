Anger and solidarity at mosque attack event,"This video can not be played London imam Mohammed Mahmoud calls for a crackdown on far-right extremism There was a message of solidarity as faith and community leaders, joined by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, held a gathering at the East London Mosque dedicated tovictims of the New Zealand mosque shootings. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up at the event in Whitechapel, as one speaker after another called for people to come together, across countries and religions. The Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, Harun Rashid Khan, expressed ""solidarity and companionship with all the people who are suffering from the heinous act of violence against minority communities"". The Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, said an ""attack on faith anywhere"" was an ""attack on faith everywhere"". But there was also an obvious sense of anger from the Muslim community - not just at the attackers but also the media, politicians, and other public figures for ""demonising"" Muslims. Mohammed Mahmoud, an imam who was praised for his response to an attack outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, London, in 2017, said the security and peace of Muslims was under threat. He said people in power were partly responsible for ""perpetuating the narrative of otherness of a group who are perceived as infiltrators, and the dehumanisation and the vilification of Muslims who, by and large, are peaceful, law-abiding, loving citizens"". New Zealand mosque shootings kill 49 Outpouring of support from UK after NZ attack Lawrence Lewis said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"" Others were critical of the media for giving a platform to people they say are openly Islamophobic, as well as the coverage of terror attacks. Jusna Begum, 43, who believes Islamophobia is getting worse, said: ""I've stopped reading them, how attacks are covered... ""A simple headline will always go back to the religion, for example this Australian guy, we won't say white, or Christian, we say mad men."" Lawrence Lewis, 28, said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"". ""I feel like a lot of the time the Western narrative of the media is to demonise Islam, because they think that the laws and principles of Islam go against their ideology, and it doesn't,"" he said. Sheila McGregor, of the Tower Hamlets Stand Up To Racism group, said the ""demonisation"" of Muslims was a ""global phenomenon"" and had been carried out by politicians for ""decades"". ""This kind of act happens when people feel it is legitimate and it's legitimised from the top,"" she said. The role of language in fomenting anti-Islam sentiment was touched on by several of the speakers, including the London mayor. Mr Khan did not reference the media or any politicians directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and at their role in people becoming radicalised. ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use, and the messages we amplify,"" the mayor said. ""There are some people in our city, in our country, who fan the flames of hatred."" ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together,"" said Yelda Mahmood Others spoke of their shock at the New Zealand attack and their fear that something similar might happen in other mosques. Yelda Mahmood, 28, who had travelled from the US to London, said: ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together. ""It doesn't matter what race you are or what religion you practice. ""How can someone go to someone's house of worship and do something like that? ""It happens on the streets and in our neighbourhoods and now in our place of worships."" Sadiq Khan and faith and community leaders gathered for the event at the East London Mosque In the wake of the attack,police have increased patrols at British mosques to provide reassurance. But Mohammed Mahmoud said there also needed to be more done to prevent people from spreading their Islamophobic views. He added: ""We demand that these platform providers, these people who provide columns and airtime for such individuals are called out and exposed and scandalised for their crimes against not only a group of Muslims who are peace loving, but also the crimes of disturbing the peace."" Mr Khan said he hoped the increased presence of police at mosques would reassure worshippers. ""As far as we are concerned our diversity is a strength not weakness,"" he said. ""We don't simply tolerate it, we embrace it and respect it.""

What are New Zealand's gun laws?,"New Zealand has said it will reform its gun laws after 50 people were killed in a mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch. In 2016 New Zealand Police estimated that there were 1.2 million legal firearms owned by civilians - that equates to around one for every four people. So, what does the law say now? The minimum legal age to own a gun in New Zealand is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons. Anyone over those ages who is considered by police to be ""fit and proper"" can possess a firearm. All gun-owners must have a licence, but most individual weapons don't have to be registered. New Zealand is one of the few countries where this is the case. In order to own a gun legally, applicants for a firearm licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records. Factors like mental health, addiction and domestic violence should be considered. Witnesses 'prayed for end to bullets' Christchurch shootings: Social media's role Once a licence has been issued, gun-owners can buy as many weapons as they want. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect had a gun licence, obtained in November 2017, and owned five guns. While most guns don't have to be registered, a special application does have to be made to police to own military-style semi-automatic weapons, pistols, or other restricted firearms. Because of this, police say they can't be sure how many legally owned firearms there are in the country as there is ""no record of the majority of firearms"". As of June 2018, there were 246,952 active firearms licences including dealers and individual owners. The year before, of the 43,509 who people applied for firearms licences, 43,321 were granted them. Until the mosque attacks, New Zealand's worst mass shooting was in 1990 in the small seaside town of Aramoana on the South Island, in which 13 people were killed. That shooting prompted an amendment to the the Arms Act (1983), the main law governing gun use and ownership, restricting the ownership of military-style semi-automatic weapons. But parliament stopped short of a total ban. The law was further amended in 2012 to clarify which weapons are restricted. In a response to an official request for information last year, New Zealand Police published figures showing that 859 restricted-category firearms were seized by police between 2008 and 2017. During the same period, 12,688 firearms of all types were seized. Police figures show that in the decade to 2017-18, there were 28 homicides involving a firearm where the offender had a current firearms licence, and 126 homicides where the offender had never held a firearms licence.

Brexit talks continue over DUP concerns,"The DUP has welcomed the government's ""renewed focus"" on addressing its objections to the Brexit deal ahead of next week's third Commons vote. The party has twice voted against the deal over concerns it would see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK. After talks with ministers in London, its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said it was still seeking extra guarantees. His party ""wanted to get a deal but it had to be the right deal"", he said. Mr Dodds spent Friday afternoon in meetings with key cabinet figures - including Chancellor Philip Hammond and Environment Secretary Michael Gove - as the government seeks to persuade MPs to support its deal when it returns to the Commons. MPs vote to seek delay to Brexit Will EU leaders agree to extending Brexit? McVey hints she will back PM's Brexit deal The third ""meaningful vote"" on Mrs May's deal is expected by 20 March and, if agreed, the prime minister has promised to seek a short extension to the Brexit departure date of 29 March, after MPs voted in favour of a delay. If it fails to gain support, having already been defeated in the Commons by large margins twice, Mrs May has warned a longer extension may be needed and the UK may have to take part in European elections. The 10 votes provided by the DUP, which has a parliamentary pact with the Conservatives, are thought to be key to the prime minister securing her deal. Some Tory Brexiteers who have also criticised the backstop - a fallback arrangement designed to avoid the return of physical checks on the Irish border - and voted against the deal are now pledging their support to avoid a long extension. This video can not be played McVey: ""People will have to vote for deal if they want Brexit"" James Gray said he will vote for the ""obnoxious"" deal ""after a great deal of soul-searching"", and described those who said they would oppose any deal as ""total extremists"". And former cabinet minister Esther McVey - who resigned her role over Mrs May's Brexit deal - also suggested she might vote in favour of it. Some MPs have suggested looking into whether the backstop could be solvedby using Article 62 of the Vienna Convention- which would allow the UK to withdraw from any treaty if there had been ""a fundamental change of circumstances... which was not foreseen by the parties"". In a letter to the Times, cross-bench peer and QC Lord Pannick said the UK would be ""entitled to terminate the withdrawal agreement"" under this clause - although he questioned whether it would be ""wise politically"". Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said the government's Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, had considered the matter and would comment further if he thought it was necessary. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Speaking after the meetings in the Cabinet Office, Mr Dodds told reporters there had been ""constructive dialogue"". He added: ""Our focusâ¦ has been on how can we ensure Northern Ireland leaves the European Union with the rest of United Kingdom as one country. ""We have had good discussions today [and] those discussions will continue over period of time."" Mr Dodds said his party were ""disappointed"" with the last minute additions to the deal around the backstop thatMrs May brought back from Strasbourg on Monday night, which she had hoped would persuade MPs to back her plan. But her Attorney General Mr Cox told Parliament the risk of getting locked into the backstop indefinitely had not changed, and it was later rejected by 149 votes. This video can not be played Stephen Barclay: ""I'm proud we stopped attempt to frustrate Brexit"" Mr Dodds said DUP members were ""disappointed"" with his assessment and agreed that Mrs May had not made ""sufficient progress"" around the issue. But, he added: ""We have always said that we want to get a deal, but it has to be the right deal. ""Some of our concerns are not new. What is new now is a renewed focus in government in ensuring those issues are addressed."" In a week of drama in Westminster,MPs rejected Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for a second timeand then voted againstthe idea of the UK leaving the EU without a dealunder any circumstances. The Commons thenvoted to seek an extension to Article 50- the legal mechanism by which the UK is due to leave the EU. However, as things stand, the law has not been changed, as Wednesday and Thursday's votes were not legally binding. That means the UK is still set to leave on 29 March - with or without a deal. If the government decided it did want to delay, it would have to be agreed by all other 27 EU members. Talks about possible conditions could take place before EU leaders meet at a summit on 21 March.

Brothers killed in hit-and-run crash,"Sanjay, 10, and Pawanveer Singh, 23 months, died at the scene of the crash Two young brothers have died in a hit-and-run car crash in Wolverhampton. Sanjay Singh, aged 10, and Pawanveer Singh, 23 months, were in a BMW being driven by their mother when it was in collision with an Audi S3. Police have urged the driver of the Audi, who left the scene on Thursday evening, to come forward. The 31-year-old driver of a third car, a Bentley, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. A taxi driver said two cars had passed him at a ""very fast"" speed about a mile away from the scene of the crash on Birmingham New Road. Police are yet to trace the driver of the Audi, which police said hit the family's BMW Ambulance crews arrived at the Lawnswood Avenue junction to find members of the public tending to the injured. Paramedics tried to save the brothers - from Dudley, police said - but they were pronounced dead at the scene. The mother, whose injuries were not life-threatening, was taken to hospital but has since been released. A family statement issued by West Midlands Police said: ""Our family are grieving over the tragic deaths of our two beautiful children, as well as dealing with the shock of the horrific crash."" Det Sgt Paul Hughes said the boys' mother was physically well but added: ""I don't think any of us can comprehend what she and her family must be going through."" A mother and her two sons were in their BMW when it was struck by the Audi, police said Describing how two cars had sped past him, taxi driver Tanveer Hussain said: ""I was further up the road, by McDonald's, and two cars overtook me. If I am doing 35 to 40, they were doing much more."" He said he then pulled over when he came upon the crash site. ""I got out of my car and other lads tended to the children. What I saw was terrible,"" Mr Hussain said. ""It was too much. The mother was just in shock."" Police have confirmed the speed of the vehicles involved was being investigated. A witness described hearing an ""almighty bang"" Another witness, who lives nearby but did not want to be named, said:  ""I didn't see it but I heard it - two cars must have been racing. Latest news from the West Midlands ""My son ran to the window and said 'they are racing dad' and then we heard an almighty bang. ""My Mrs ran down to see if she could help and all the police and ambulance workers were there. You could see the police officers stopping the traffic were really, really distressed."" Police said the family was being supported by specialist officers Det Sgt Hughes appealed directly to the driver of the Audi to make contact with the police. ""Do the right thing, contact us and give us your version of events. ""You may not be fully aware of the full tragic circumstances but you now need to speak to us,"" he said. Police have also urged people who saw a white Bentley Continental convertible and a blue Audi S3 travelling along Birmingham New Road around the time to get in touch. The crash happened on a road covered by an injunction forbidding people from so-called car cruising. Prohibited activities include speeding, driving in convoy, racing and performing stunts between the hours of 15:00 and 07:00. The road was reopened at 03:40.

Topshop retail group explores restructuring,"Sir Philip Green is working on a restructuring of his Arcadia Group retail empire that includes Topshop and Miss Selfridge. The billionaire's company said in a statement that it was suffering ""an exceptionally challenging retail market"" in the UK. Arcadia was therefore ""exploring options"" to bolster the business. Job cuts and store closures are likely, but they would not be ""significant"", Arcadia insisted. There were reports on Friday that Sir Philip was considering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that would enable him to seek rent cuts and close unwanted stores. Arcadia said that it was issuing its statement in response to that media speculation, but made no mention about a CVA nor potential sales. ""Within an exceptionally challenging retail market and given the continued pressures that are specific to the UK high street we are exploring several options to enable the business to operate in a more efficient manner,"" Arcadia said. ""None of the options being explored involve a significant number of redundancies or store closures. The business continues to operate as usual including all payments being made to suppliers as normal,"" it added. CVAs can be used to cut shop rent bills, and other costs, but they are controversial and when House of Fraser used the arrangement it sparked a huge legal battle with landlords. News that one of the UK's biggest fashion retail groups is struggling comes after a string of High Street names hit financial trouble. Debenhams, New Look, Mothercare, House of Fraser, HMV and LK Bennett are among a roll-call of retailers hit by weak consumer confidence, higher costs, and the growth of online rivals. Philip Green 'paid harassment accuser Â£1m' Karren Brady quits Philip Green's empire Philip Green's Topshop facing boycott Many retail experts believe Topshop, Sir Philip's prize asset, has fallen out of favour with today's young consumers. Arcadia also owns Evans and Wallis. Last year Sir Philip was embroiled in claims - strongly denied - of bullying and inappropriate behaviour. He was also criticised over the demise of department store chain BHS, which, after he sold it for just Â£1, collapsed a year later. The reports earlier that Arcadia was working on turnaround plans suggested that formal talks with shop landlords were expected to begin in the next few weeks. It emerged in January that the business had hired advisers at Deloitte to explore a restructuring, prompted by a decline in sales and profits. The news comes just weeks after Baroness Karren Brady resigned from Arcadia's parent company Taveta, following the emergence of harassment allegations against Sir Philip.

Final Hatton Garden raider jailed,"Michael Seed's lawyers denied he was the mystery raider known as ""Basil"" The last suspect in the Hatton Garden heist has been found guilty of conspiracy to burgle. Michael Seed, 58, from Islington, nick-named ""Basil"", played a key role in the Â£14m safe deposit raid in 2015. Seed, an alarm specialist who denied the charges, was also found guilty of conspiring to hide the proceeds. He was jailed for 10 years for the burglary and eight years for the second charge, with the terms to run concurrently. Jurors at Woolwich Crown Court had been deliberating for more than a week and returned a majority verdict earlier of 10-2 on the first charge. The convictions come four years afterthe infamous heist. Seed became known as 'Basil' in the Hatton Garden gang Seed is believed to have let himself in to the building in London's diamond district using a set of keys. He was one of two men who climbed into the vault to loot 73 safe deposit boxes after the gang of ageing criminals drilled through the thick concrete wall during the 2015 Easter bank holiday weekend. Seed, who pays no taxes, claims no benefits and rarely uses a bank account, evaded capture for three years. Police raided his flat, in Islington, north London, located about two miles away from Hatton Garden, on 27 March last year. The electronics expert told a jury at Woolwich Crown Court he was not the man nicknamed ""Basil"" by the rest of the gang. But jurors returned a unanimous guilty verdict for the second charge of conspiracy to handle the proceeds after Â£143,000 worth of gold ingots, gems and jewellery was found in his bedroom. Seed is believed to have been melting down gold and breaking up jewellery on his bedroom workbench. This video can not be played The final member of gang that carried out the Hatton Garden heist has been found guilty He was cleared of conspiracy to burgle the high-end Chatila jewellery store in Bond Street over the late August bank holiday weekend in 2010 with members of the same gang. Prosecutors had alleged he posed as a BT engineer to tamper with the security system before the burglary, then used a 2G mobile phone jammer to block the alarm signal. On that occasion, thieves failed to drill into a safe containing Â£40 million worth of gems but made off with Â£1 million worth of jewellery from the shop's display cabinets. Hatton Garden gang ordered to pay Â£27.5m Who's who of the Hatton Garden gang Raiders may have dodged alarm with cloaks The jury of six men and six women deliberated for 35 hours and 35 minutes before returning their verdicts. Seed previously told the court he could have been on a family holiday in Cornwall or visiting his elderly mother, in Cambridge, at the time of the Hatton Garden burglary and told jurors he had never been known as Basil. Clockwise from top left Brian Reader, John Collins, Daniel Jones and Terry Perkins were described as the ringleaders of the heist His fellow Hatton Garden raiders Brian Reader, 80, John ""Kenny"" Collins, 78, Daniel Jones, 64, and Terry Perkins, whodied in prison last year aged 69, were all jailed in 2016. Collins and Reader are already out of prison but face going back to jail if they fail to pay back more than Â£6.5m of the proceeds police believe could still be under their control. Detectives believe the gang could have been operating undetected for decades before they were caught, but cannot link them to any other crimes. The Met Police released surveillance images of Seed with fellow raider John Collins The son of a university professor, Seed gained A-levels in physics, chemistry, maths and geology at a secondary modern school outside Cambridge. He then worked in an electronics factory making parts for submarine detectors. ""I have always had an interest in electronics"", Seed told jurors. ""It was a passion of mine."" He went on to study physics and electronics at Nottingham University, where he ""enjoyed recreational drugs"" and ""used to take LSD every weekend"" before his one previous run-in with the law. In 1984, aged 24, Seed was handed a three-year prison sentence for supplying controlled drugs of Class A and Class B after selling 10 LSD tablets and some cannabis to a friend. He was released after serving 21 months and moved into the one-bedroom council flat in Islington where he lived up until his arrest.

Anger and solidarity,"This video can not be played London imam Mohammed Mahmoud calls for a crackdown on far-right extremism There was a message of solidarity as faith and community leaders, joined by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, held a gathering at the East London Mosque dedicated tovictims of the New Zealand mosque shootings. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up at the event in Whitechapel, as one speaker after another called for people to come together, across countries and religions. The Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, Harun Rashid Khan, expressed ""solidarity and companionship with all the people who are suffering from the heinous act of violence against minority communities"". The Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, said an ""attack on faith anywhere"" was an ""attack on faith everywhere"". But there was also an obvious sense of anger from the Muslim community - not just at the attackers but also the media, politicians, and other public figures for ""demonising"" Muslims. Mohammed Mahmoud, an imam who was praised for his response to an attack outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, London, in 2017, said the security and peace of Muslims was under threat. He said people in power were partly responsible for ""perpetuating the narrative of otherness of a group who are perceived as infiltrators, and the dehumanisation and the vilification of Muslims who, by and large, are peaceful, law-abiding, loving citizens"". New Zealand mosque shootings kill 49 Outpouring of support from UK after NZ attack Lawrence Lewis said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"" Others were critical of the media for giving a platform to people they say are openly Islamophobic, as well as the coverage of terror attacks. Jusna Begum, 43, who believes Islamophobia is getting worse, said: ""I've stopped reading them, how attacks are covered... ""A simple headline will always go back to the religion, for example this Australian guy, we won't say white, or Christian, we say mad men."" Lawrence Lewis, 28, said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"". ""I feel like a lot of the time the Western narrative of the media is to demonise Islam, because they think that the laws and principles of Islam go against their ideology, and it doesn't,"" he said. Sheila McGregor, of the Tower Hamlets Stand Up To Racism group, said the ""demonisation"" of Muslims was a ""global phenomenon"" and had been carried out by politicians for ""decades"". ""This kind of act happens when people feel it is legitimate and it's legitimised from the top,"" she said. The role of language in fomenting anti-Islam sentiment was touched on by several of the speakers, including the London mayor. Mr Khan did not reference the media or any politicians directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and at their role in people becoming radicalised. ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use, and the messages we amplify,"" the mayor said. ""There are some people in our city, in our country, who fan the flames of hatred."" ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together,"" said Yelda Mahmood Others spoke of their shock at the New Zealand attack and their fear that something similar might happen in other mosques. Yelda Mahmood, 28, who had travelled from the US to London, said: ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together. ""It doesn't matter what race you are or what religion you practice. ""How can someone go to someone's house of worship and do something like that? ""It happens on the streets and in our neighbourhoods and now in our place of worships."" Sadiq Khan and faith and community leaders gathered for the event at the East London Mosque In the wake of the attack,police have increased patrols at British mosques to provide reassurance. But Mohammed Mahmoud said there also needed to be more done to prevent people from spreading their Islamophobic views. He added: ""We demand that these platform providers, these people who provide columns and airtime for such individuals are called out and exposed and scandalised for their crimes against not only a group of Muslims who are peace loving, but also the crimes of disturbing the peace."" Mr Khan said he hoped the increased presence of police at mosques would reassure worshippers. ""As far as we are concerned our diversity is a strength not weakness,"" he said. ""We don't simply tolerate it, we embrace it and respect it.""

New Zealand's gun laws,"New Zealand has said it will reform its gun laws after 50 people were killed in a mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch. In 2016 New Zealand Police estimated that there were 1.2 million legal firearms owned by civilians - that equates to around one for every four people. So, what does the law say now? The minimum legal age to own a gun in New Zealand is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons. Anyone over those ages who is considered by police to be ""fit and proper"" can possess a firearm. All gun-owners must have a licence, but most individual weapons don't have to be registered. New Zealand is one of the few countries where this is the case. In order to own a gun legally, applicants for a firearm licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records. Factors like mental health, addiction and domestic violence should be considered. Witnesses 'prayed for end to bullets' Christchurch shootings: Social media's role Once a licence has been issued, gun-owners can buy as many weapons as they want. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect had a gun licence, obtained in November 2017, and owned five guns. While most guns don't have to be registered, a special application does have to be made to police to own military-style semi-automatic weapons, pistols, or other restricted firearms. Because of this, police say they can't be sure how many legally owned firearms there are in the country as there is ""no record of the majority of firearms"". As of June 2018, there were 246,952 active firearms licences including dealers and individual owners. The year before, of the 43,509 who people applied for firearms licences, 43,321 were granted them. Until the mosque attacks, New Zealand's worst mass shooting was in 1990 in the small seaside town of Aramoana on the South Island, in which 13 people were killed. That shooting prompted an amendment to the the Arms Act (1983), the main law governing gun use and ownership, restricting the ownership of military-style semi-automatic weapons. But parliament stopped short of a total ban. The law was further amended in 2012 to clarify which weapons are restricted. In a response to an official request for information last year, New Zealand Police published figures showing that 859 restricted-category firearms were seized by police between 2008 and 2017. During the same period, 12,688 firearms of all types were seized. Police figures show that in the decade to 2017-18, there were 28 homicides involving a firearm where the offender had a current firearms licence, and 126 homicides where the offender had never held a firearms licence.

US presses Kim Jong-un to keep his word,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo answers questions at the State Department US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he expects North Korea's leader will live up to his commitment not to resume nuclear and missile tests. Mr Pompeo said Kim Jong-un had promised US President Donald Trump in Vietnam that testing would not resume. His comments follow a suggestion by North Korean-Vice Foreign Minister Choe Sun-hui that denuclearisation talks might end and testing could resume. The US says sanctions will remain until Pyongyang destroys all nuclear sites. Mr Pompeo told reporters on Friday that ""on multiple occasions [Mr Kim] spoke directly to the president and made a commitment that he would not resume nuclear testing, nor would he resume missile testing"" during their February summit. ""That's Chairman Kim's word,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""We have every expectation that he will live up to that commitment."" Earlier, Ms Choe said US diplomats had thrown away ""a golden opportunity"" during the summit when North Korea offered to dismantle its main Yongbyon nuclear complex. Talks in Hanoi collapsed when Mr Trump refused to lift any sanctionsuntil North Korea was completely denuclearised. But Mr Pompeo said he is ""hopeful"" that discussions will continue. ""I saw the remarks [Ms Choe] made - she left open the possibility negotiations would continue. It's the administration's desire that we continue to have conversations around this."" North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, seen here during the Hanoi summit Ms Choe said in Pyongyang that Mr Kim would decide whether to stick to the launch and test moratorium, and she expects him to ""clarify his position"" soon. ""We have no intention to yield to the US demands in any form, nor are we willing to engage in negotiations of this kind,"" she told reporters in North Korea, Russia's state Tass news agency reported. She accused the US of taking a ""gangster-like"" stance,according to the Associated Press,external, but added that ""personal relations between the two supreme leaders are still good and the chemistry is mysteriously wonderful"". Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea crisis in 300 words Ms Choe said that North Korea's demand during the recent summit was for five key economic sanctions to be lifted, not all sanctions, as Mr Trump said after talks broke down. ""What is clear is that the US has thrown away a golden opportunity this time,"" she said. ""I'm not sure why the US came out with this different description. We never asked for the removal of sanctions in their entirety."" Mr Trump and Mr Pompeo clearly stated after last month's talks that North Korean officials had asked for full sanctions relief. ""It was all about the sanctions. They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" he said. In Washington this week, the US special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, said that diplomacy was ""still very much alive"", though he did not say if there had been any negotiations since the summit, or outline any plans for further talks. North Korea 'unlikely to abandon nukes' Are the rules which have stopped nuclear war broken? The two leaders first met in Singapore last year, in an unprecedented summit between a US sitting president and a North Korean leader. Their second meeting was in Hanoi in February. At a news conference after the second summit, Mr Trump said no plans had been made for a third summit, but he expressed optimism about a ""good outcome"" in the future. Laure Bicker, BBC Seoul correspondent So does this mean a return to ""fire and fury""? Not quite. North Korea's tactic might be to hope this will initiate a reaction from the US. Pyongyang is aware that Donald Trump has boasted about his ability to get Mr Kim to stop firing missiles and testing nuclear missiles. ""As long as there's no testing,"" said Mr Trump, ""I'm in no rush."" After the two leaders failed to secure a deal in Hanoi, and with economic sanctions still in place, North Korea might be trying to hurry the US president along and get him back to the table with a better deal. It is worth noting Choe Sun-hui still praised the personal relationship between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. So the door to diplomacy is still open. Instead she blamed Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton for hardening the US position. North Korea also has hardliners of its own, who may perceive Kim Jong-un's 120-hour train trip to Hanoi and back as a failure. This announcement lets them know, along with the Trump administration, that Mr Kim is standing firm. Are the rules which have stopped nuclear war broken?

Akeela Ahmed, who belongs to a group of Muslim representatives which advises the government, also called on the British public to ""come together"" in order to ""challenge the extremist narrative promoted by those who seek to create divisions"".

Flags have been lowered to half mast at Downing Street and the Foreign Office, as well as in the British town of Christchurch in Dorset, which is twinned with its New Zealand namesake. Mohammed Kozbar, the vice president of the Muslim Association of Britain, said Muslims in the UK would not be intimidated by terror attacks. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, shared a post on Twitter urging Christians to go along to Friday prayers at local mosques. And the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, told the BBC that ""an attack against faith anywhere is an attack on faith everywhere"". By Alex Therrien from BBC News, at the East London Mosque There was sadness and solidarity, but also anger, at a vigil at the East London Mosque, held in memory of the victims of the New Zealand attack. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up as Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and faith leaders gave short speeches. But among many of the gatherers the BBC spoke to there was also anger and fear. Fear about whether such an attack could happen in the UK. And anger at what they see as the normalisation of Islamophobia in parts of the media and among politicians. ""These are the ones we should be pointing the finger at,"" said one man who refused to give his name. ""They are the ones who caused this."" The London mayor did not name politicians or the media directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and having a role in them becoming radicalised. ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use,"" he urged. The mayor added that diversity in London was a strength, not a weakness. ""We don't simply tolerate it - we embrace and respect it."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was due to attend a vigil at Glasgow Central Mosque on Friday evening, and said the events in New Zealand ""will feel very personal and close to home"" for Muslims. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, laid flowers at the High Commission of New Zealand in London, where members of an anti-terrorism group had gathered. MPs have observed a minute's silence in the House of Commons. British security minister Ben Wallace called the attack ""repugnant"" and said the UK ""stands shoulder to shoulder with New Zealand against terrorism"". He said he and Home Secretary Sajid Javid would speak to counter-terrorism police chiefs and the security services on Friday, ""to discuss what further measures we can take to protect our mosques and our communities from any threats here in the United Kingdom"". Mr Wallace added: ""Our police and security services treat all threats the same and all terrorists the same no matter what communities, religion or background they come from.  A terrorist is a terrorist and we shall deal with them exactly the same."" Bangladesh team 'minutes' from fatal shooting 'This can only be described as a terrorist attack' Mayor of London Mr Khan described the attacks as ""heartbreaking"". He said that, after discussions with Scotland Yard, there would be ""highly visible policing around mosques today, as well as armed response officers, as Londoners go to pray"". Imam Qari Asim talks to PC Plumber as he visits the Makkah Mosque in Leeds Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the national policing lead for counter-terrorism, said there was ""no intelligence linking these appalling events in Christchurch to the UK"". Mr Basu said there would be more ""reassurance patrols"" near places of worship and specific communities in the ""coming days"". He added that specific attention would be paid to mosques. Police Scotland and Greater Manchester Police also said patrols would be increased around mosques, but added there was no intelligence to suggest there was a specific threat. Greater Manchester Police said ""we know all too well the effects of terrorism"". Meanwhile, Met Chief Superintendent Nick Aldworth, who leads the government's counter-terrorism strategy, told BBC 5 Live that police would be assessing what impact the Christchurch attack could have on Britain. ""There's no doubt in my mind that, having seen what I've seen here, this is something that we within counter-terrorism should be responding to in the UK and ensuring our current plans and thinking is correct,"" he said. Sir Mark Rowley, the UK's former head of counter terrorism at the Met Police until last year, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although ""Western societies have always had racist thugs"" who commit crimes, in recent years they have become ""more organised and with more terrorist ambitions"". He said he thought social media had played a role and was ""a very big problem"". Downing Street and Home Secretary Mr Javid also criticised social media, saying Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should have been quicker to remove video footage - recorded by the gunman during the attack - from its platforms.

Hyponatraemia nurses could face action,"Nine-year-old Raychel Ferguson died in hospital in 2001 It was ""wrong"" not to take further action against nurses involved in the care of a Londonderry girl who died of hyponatraemia, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) has said. The death of Raychel Ferguson in 2001was found to be ""avoidable"". In October, the NMC said no further action was required after it reviewed the cases of five nurses who were named in the inquiry's report, Failings had been addressed, it added. However, it has now said it is sorry for that decision. The reversal came after Raychel's family appealed against the decision and provided the regulator with additional evidence. The NMC has said it will now send the referral for a full fitness to practise investigation. Raychel's mother Marie told BBC News NI that the family ""welcomed the news that the NMC have finally come to their senses and are investigating these nurses"". Hyponatraemia inquiry: Timeline of hospital deaths investigation Who were the children? Children's hospital deaths were avoidable ""The NMC has fully apologised and acknowledged the hurt that they have caused to our family by previously coming to the wrong decision."" The NMC emailed the family about its decision this week. It included their reasoning, which it said varies a little between each nurse. In a summary, seen by the BBC, it said that ""in addition to the clinical concerns previously identified, we now consider that Sir John's report raises attitudinal concerns, in relation to four of the five nurses"". It added that an investigation was needed to decided whether the nurses ""failed to be open and candid about what went wrong in Raychel's care"" and that ""consequently those nurses' integrity may be in question"". Marie Ferguson, the mother of Raychel, during the delivery of Mr Justice O'Hara's findings Raychel was nine when she died at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in June 2001, a day after an appendix operation at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry. An inquiry into the deaths of five children concluded in 2018 that four were avoidable. A number of nurses and doctors named in the report referred themselves to the regulators. Documents provided by the Western Health Trust to the NMC said concerns raised by the inquiry, including record training and training in preventing, recognising and managing hyponatraemia in children by the nurses, had all been rectified. However, on reflection, the NMC said it should not have relied on this information from the trust and instead they required sufficient, independent documentary evidence - for example certificates from training providers - establishing that training had been undertaken and the basic nursing failures remedied. Raychel's mother Marie told BBC News NI that, because of the U-turn  she now placed complete faith in them dealing with the matter in the way she felt it should have been dealt with in the first place. In a statement to the BBC, Matthew McClelland, the director of fitness to practise at the NMC, said: ""We have been in contact with Raychel Ferguson's family to let them know we have decided to investigate the conduct of five nurses involved in the care of their daughter. ""I am sorry we did not make the right decision the first time and am in no doubt of how upsetting that was for Raychel's family. ""I hope our decision today will go some way in reassuring them that their concerns about Raychel's care will be fully investigated.""

Patrick - the saint who 'liked a drink',"Bedecked in green, the 2018 St Patrick's Day parade in Belfast was typical of how the day is celebrated St Patrick's Day is celebrated across the world by Irish people, their descendants and anyone else who wants to join in. The day, known in the modern era for huge parades, turning things green and having a drink, has, on occasion, led to excess. However, it seems that a little tipsiness has always been the way to remember the saint. The Book of Armagh, from the 9th Century, said all Irish monasteries and churches were to celebrate Patrick with three days and nights of feasting. St Patrick's Day: Globe goes green William and Kate brave snowy St Patrick's Day parade The great Irish folklorist Kevin Dannaher described the St Patrick's Day of 300 years ago. ""In most parts of Ireland the men repaired to the local tavern after church to the drink the 'pota PÃ¡draig' or 'St Patrick's pot'. Seldom did the drinking stop at one pot."" Though he did write that ""drowning the shamrock... by no means implies that it is necessary to get drunk in doing so"". But where did the association between saint and alcohol come from? StiofÃ¡n Ã Cadhla is a senior lecturer in folklore and ethnology in University College Cork. He said that folklore indicates that St Patrick himself liked to have a drink. St Patrick's Day now sees huge parades celebrating Irish culture but that was not always the case ""One of the narratives associated with him is about 'peaca an tomhais'â¦ the 'sin of mismeasure' when St Patrick enters a public house and orders his pint. ""The publican gives him the drink but he has left the drink shorter than he should, he doesn't give him his full measure. ""Patrick corrects him and tells him: 'You haven't realised that this sin of mismeasure is one of the worst sins that you can commit'."" Diarmuid Ã GiollÃ¡in, professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, USA, said St Patrick's Day has always been marked not only because it was a celebration of the patron saint but also because a dispensation allowed the Lenten fast to be broken - meat to be eaten and alcohol drunk - whilst Christians everywhere else were fasting. Saint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland, he lived in the 5th century AD and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity. While St Patrick really existed, and some of his writings survive, his value does not really come from historical details but from the inspiration of a man who returned to the country where he had been a child slave, in order to bring the message of Christ. He is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. Diarmuid Ã GiollÃ¡in explained that drinking on St Patrick's Day was an important aspect of the religious festival and ""a break in the rigours of lent"". StiofÃ¡n Ã Cadhla points out that St Patrick's Days falls close to the Spring Equinox. Belfast's Holyland is home to many students and has seen trouble on St Patrick's Day in the past ""You can expect exuberance at this time of year,"" he said. ""It is tied up with the time of the year and the return to growth, everyone wanted to have their potatoes planted on St Patrick's Day. ""Drowning the shamrock in St Patrick's pot, that is to say putting your shamrock in a drink, is one of the most traditional ways of celebrating. ""John Carr wrote in the early 19th centuryâ¦ that around this time of the year the country people assemble and get very tipsy, they walk through the streets wearing the shamrock in their hats, whiskey is drank in copious libations, and the merry devotees continue until the greater part of the next day in honour of Sheelagh, St Patrick's wife,"" he said, adding that St Sheelagh is now mostly forgotten today. Dr Ã Cadhla added that when the Catholic Church regrouped in Ireland in the wake of the potato famine it took the opportunity to clamp down on some traditional practices around the saint. ""St Patrick's Day would have been associated with fair days and large gatherings of people in certain locations and at certain wells. ""The church step inâ¦ asserting themselves, and trying to wean the people off some of those ideas. This video can not be played NI celebrates St Patrick's Day in 2018 ""They don't succeed 100%."" Traditional belief systems and the Catholic tendencies have come to an accommodation. combining to become a folkloric belief and behaviour, he explained. There were always concerns that some of the behaviour surrounding the festival ""did not fit in with the strict idea of St Patrick"", Dr Ã Cadhla said: ""There is Saint Patrick of the hagiographers [people who write about the lives of saints] but of course there is Saint Patrick beloved of Irish people, who is like one of themselves. ""Of course, St Patrick understands and loves the Irish people and is one of them in this celebration."" Dr Ã Cadhla said that the great public parades connected with the patron saint are a relatively recent thing, in Ireland at least. ""I think people of a certain age will recall how poorly patronised those parades were and how people really didn't tend to take them that seriously."" Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke Of Cambridge attend the annual Irish Guards St Patrick's Day Parade He suggested that the parades may have a military origin and that British Army bands would have come out and paraded in the 19th Century. The British Army's Royal Irish Regiment celebrates St Patrick's Day to this day, as do the Irish Defence Forces. However, he stressed that the ""formal, militaristic"" nature of today's parades are greatly influenced by Irish America. Prof Ã GiollÃ¡in agreed - he said changes in Irish society and globalisation have led to huge change in how St Patrick's Day is celebrated in Ireland. ""I think the model has been the American St Patrick's Day celebrations, the American razzmatazz."" Chicago River is turned green for the 2018 St Patrick's Day in Chicago, United States He sees the day as having moved away from the concept of a national day, away from church and state patronage, to representing a global dimension of Irishness. ""It has been taken as an opportunity to tourism but also to promote Ireland as a country which is more diverse and more open to the world,"" he said. ""The change reflects changes in Irish society.""

What happened to Claudia?," Claudia Lawrence’s house remains empty, preserved by her family in the hope she might one day return. For years her dresses hung unworn in the wardrobe, some with tags still attached. The remnants of her belongings are now pushed against the walls in haphazard piles. In the decade since she vanished - presumed murdered - a number of significant dates have passed, including her 40th and 45th birthdays. For her friends and family, it has been an unbearable time. Three days into the investigation, Claudia’s friends couldn’t imagine it going on another week, let alone a decade. They felt sure she would turn up. That changed for Suzy Cooper moments after the landlord of the Nag’s Head pub called to say the press were there and wanted to talk to her. She was wholly unprepared for what greeted her. Claudia and Suzy were so close they called each other “sister” “I opened the door and every paper and news channel you could imagine were there. Microphones and cameras were shoved in my face, people asking me this and that. It was horrendous. “It really hit me on the Saturday night when I saw the story on the news. I remember thinking ‘oh Claudia would hate that picture’ - she really disliked her picture being taken. “I thought it was going to be over in a day or two, for sure. How this has gone on for 10 years with no resolution, no clue, no nothing, I can’t fathom. “How can that happen in this day and age?” “I regularly go out for a walk. It might be a nice sunny day and I wonder‘Claudia, are you seeing this?’” Hands clasped in his lap, Peter Lawrence glances at a candle on the fireplace at his home in York, less than two miles from his daughter’s small terraced house in Heworth. The red wax pillar was given to him by the Archbishop of York as a symbol of hope in the bleak years following Claudia’s disappearance. Ali and Claudia were three years apart in age Peter and his ex-wife Joan had two children - Ali, born in 1971, followed three years later by Claudia. They brought them up in Malton, a North Yorkshire market town with strong horse racing connections, 16 miles from York. It was a comfortable upbringing. Claudia played the flute and on Saturdays the sisters would go for riding lessons in nearby Rillington. Horses became a life-long passion for the younger girl and she continued to ride until the time she disappeared. The family’s five-bedroom home had paddocks and the girls had their own ponies. In the winter the family looked after donkeys from Scarborough beach and their garden was used as a sanctuary for the animals to recover from a busy summer on the sand. Claudia’s teenage years were seemingly as content as her childhood - she would wander into the market square with friends and occasionally babysit for Peter’s friend Martin Dales, whose two daughters thought she was “glamorous”. Ali and Claudia went to nearby private schools and while close, were different in character. “Ali was more academically minded while Claudia was brave, adventurous, always wanting to do things,” says Peter. “She would go out for long rides and would help mucking out at the stables. She enjoyed school, although maybe not the work as much. But she was happy and had a lot of friends.” Claudia went on to study catering and by the time she was in her early 20s, she had worked in various kitchens before joining the University of York as a chef. Joan said she was a well-liked employee, the type who would volunteer for shifts at Christmas so colleagues could spend it with their children. “Chefs are not particularly well paid unless you get to be famous,” adds Peter. “But she had no aspirations to do that - she was really happy doing what she was doing.” It was working in York that prompted Claudia to move. She had become nervous about driving there in winter, so she bought a neat terraced house with a green door on the outskirts of the city centre. Heworth Road is dotted with typical suburban landmarks: a post office, a primary school, a Costcutter shop and a church on the corner. The Nag’s Head, a stone’s throw from her gate, was Claudia’s regular and the place where she often socialised with friends. Her home was also a 10-minute car journey to her job at Goodricke College on the university’s Heslington campus. But according to Joan, Claudia had been walking to work in the days leading up to her disappearance on Thursday, 19 March 2009, because her ageing Vauxhall Corsa was in the garage. Indeed, the 35-year-old was seen walking home from work the day before - cameras capturing her as she left work at 14:31 and spotting her at various points along the 45-minute route. Later that night, she spoke to Peter on the phone, then Joan, with whom she made plans to mark Mother’s Day. Claudia purchased the house in Heworth Road in 2007 “We’d both been watching Location, Location, Location on the television,” says Joan. “It was being filmed in Harrogate, and we have a friend there, so we just chatted about that. “She seemed absolutely fine.” “I dream about Claudia - we always talk about why she’s been missing and there’s always a different explanation. “I like the dreams because in some sort of way I’ve seen her but it really shakes me for the rest of the day. It’s almost like I don’t want to go back to reality, I just want to stay in the dream with her.” Suzy Cooper was sitting alone in the Nag’s Head waiting for Claudia to show up on the evening of 19 March when she realised something wasn’t quite right. The pair had arranged to meet for a cider, as they so often did. But when her friend failed to arrive Suzy sent her a text, joking about being “stood up”. When she called and it went straight to voicemail, she chalked it up to Claudia falling asleep and leaving her phone uncharged. “I was off work that week so the next morning, the Friday, I rang her and again it was switched off. That was totally out of character and at that point I knew something was wrong.” Suzy, Claudia and Jen King were part of a tight-knit group that regularly met at the Nag’s Head. The trio formed a close friendship soon after meeting at the pub in 2006 and spent several nights there a week. When they weren’t together, they were constantly texting or chatting on the phone. “We’d listen to each other moan, talk about our days or, if we were having a stressful time at work, then we’d say ‘oh, come on let’s just have a drink’,” says Jen. Claudia, Suzy, and Jen were close friends Suzy and Claudia were so close they rarely called each other by their first names, instead calling each other “sister”. While Jen, who was a barmaid at the pub, lived for a few months with Claudia in Heworth Road. “She was a simple person, in that she was fairly easily pleased,” says Jen. “She liked to buy a new top now and again, go to the pub, see her horse, listen to music. She didn’t desire the grand things in life, she just wanted a nice sunshine holiday and to have a tan.” It was this predictability that tipped Suzy off. When she couldn’t get hold of Claudia again the next day, she immediately rang Peter. “I told him Claudia hadn’t turned up when we arranged to meet and that she hadn’t answered my calls and that I was really worried. He drove straight over.” The pair were nervous as they entered Claudia’s house on 20 March. They feared she had been attacked or fallen down the stairs but the total absence of anything out of the ordinary was even more concerning. Her slippers were neatly by the door, dishes stacked in the sink. The jewellery she typically took off for work and left at home was on the chest of drawers. In the kitchen, next to the bathroom, her toothbrush had been left on the draining board. Her phone and rucksack containing her chef’s whites were missing. Everything suggested she left for work as planned. Peter Lawrence spoke to his daughter the night before she vanished Peter had already called the university and learned his daughter had not turned up for her shift the previous day. He walked outside, sat alone in his car and called 999 to report her missing. Within hours, Heworth was swarming with police. “When I called I expected them to say - given how long she’d been missing - to give it a day or two, but it was the complete opposite,” he says. “There were about 150 to 200 officers combing every inch of the route she would have taken to the university. It just all seemed very surreal.” According to police, the first 72 hours of a missing persons inquiry are the most critical. The intensity of the searches in and around Claudia’s home in those first few days reflected the fact that detectives knew they were working against the clock. But despite the speed at which North Yorkshire Police descended on Heworth Road, Claudia’s mother believes the initial investigation was plagued with mistakes from the outset. “In my mind the police were out of their depth,” says Joan. “It got so big, so quickly, that they didn’t know how to handle it.” York Press newspaper reporter Nicola Small was at work when North Yorkshire Police made its first media appeal two days after Claudia’s disappearance. “I remember being struck by the photo of her - she stood out. A smiling, attractive blonde who didn’t look like she’d had a troubled life. “There was nothing [in the press release] to suggest we wouldn’t soon be getting another saying she’d returned home safe and well.” Joan Lawrence is critical of the police for using this photo of Claudia But by Sunday, a second appeal struck a more worrying tone. A high-ranking officer had been assigned to the case and a press conference arranged for the next day. Chief reporter Mike Laycock suspected Claudia’s disappearance wasn’t a typical missing persons case and decided to put the story on the front page of Monday’s newspaper. He was right to follow his instinct. The next day, Det Ch Insp Lucy Pope told journalists she feared Claudia had been abducted. Sitting alongside her was a visibly shaken Peter, who described the wait for news as a “living nightmare”. “I just remember his face,” says Jen, who saw him later that day at the police station. “[I remember] him saying ‘things like this don’t happen to us’.” In York - a tourist city known for its Viking heritage and Gothic cathedral - the story struck a nerve, says Nicola. “Everybody wanted to know what the latest developments were and everybody had their own theory about what had happened. “These things didn’t happen here. Young women with everything to live for didn’t vanish without trace.” The case was handed to one of North Yorkshire Police’s most senior officers, Det Supt Ray Galloway. It quickly became the biggest investigation the force had dealt with in several years. Posters of Claudia were plastered on lampposts across the city and officers trawled Heworth, combing through undergrowth, checking a nearby stream and speaking to neighbours. Images of a bag and phone similar to Claudia’s missing items were released Her house was searched and largely discounted as a crime scene because there were no signs of struggle or foul play. A suggestion Claudia had left the country to live in Cyprus, where she had holidayed numerous times, was also dismissed because her bank cards and passport were in the house. Claudia left few digital clues as to her whereabouts. She didn’t use social media, own a computer, or use the internet on her Samsung D900. Unlike smartphones today, hers did not track her location. She was, however, a prolific texter. She replied to a message at 20:27 on 18 March but failed to respond to one received at 21:12. Analysis of her phone showed it was deliberately turned off at 12:10 the next day within an eight-mile radius of York. Detectives were certain Claudia had left for work on 19 March and that something had happened to her between Heworth Road and Goodricke College. A number of witnesses came forward, including a cyclist who saw a woman that morning matching Claudia’s description,  talking to a man dubbed by police as “the left-handed smoker”. They were spotted near the electricity substation at Melrosegate bridge at about 05:35. It was potentially significant because if Claudia had left for work as planned, she would have reached the bridge - a 10-minute walk from her house - by that time. A witness reported seeing a man and a woman talking by the bridge But it was not as far as the CCTV camera at the Melrosegate shops which had captured her walking home from work on 18 March, suggesting she never made it that far on foot the next morning. A different witness, however, came forward to report seeing a man and woman arguing on a grass verge next to a parked vehicle on University Way, around the time Claudia was due to start her shift. Both sightings were major lines of inquiry but despite numerous appeals, neither couple was ever traced. Six weeks after Claudia’s disappearance, the investigation was reclassified as a suspected murder case. While there was no body, crime scene or suspect, there was no proof of life either. Joan says she found out about the latest development in her daughter’s case from a TV news report. “I got such a shock, I couldn’t believe it,” she says. Joan Lawrence says she will never give up hope Joan has long been critical of the first police investigation. She says officers initially used a photo of Claudia with the wrong hair colour and that she wasn’t spoken to in the immediate aftermath of her daughter’s disappearance. “Ray Galloway came to see me once, a few days [later]. He never asked me what Claudia was like, what her hobbies were, he didn’t want to get to know her. “I told [police] that she didn’t look like that when she disappeared - her hair was much darker, but they carried on using that [photo] for a number of years.” Joan with Ali, left, and Claudia As the weeks passed, police were seemingly getting no further. Detectives hoped CCTV released in mid May of a man seen near Claudia’s home the morning of her disappearance might provide a crucial clue. At 05:07 he can be seen walking into Heworth Place towards an alley behind her house. Just over a minute later, he reappears and rejoins the main road. Mr Galloway told the York Press at the time that the man’s actions were “strange” and urged him to come forward so he could be excluded from the inquiry. He has never been identified. By June, the case had taken a different direction. Its lead detective told BBC Crimewatch that investigators were now focusing on allegations made about the chef’s love life. “Who was Claudia going out with? Who was she seeing?” Mr Galloway asked viewers. “Who was her boyfriend? Who was showing her maybe some unhealthy interest?” Former Det Supt Ray Galloway led the initial investigation In a second appearance on the show he made more direct claims, describing Claudia’s relationships as “complex and mysterious” - words that immediately became the subject of tabloid headlines. “It set the rumour mill whirring,” says former Met detective chief inspector Clive Driscoll. Mr Driscoll, who is credited with finally securing justice for the family of Stephen Lawrence, has previously examined Claudia’s case as part of a documentary. He believes Mr Galloway’s comments turned public opinion against her and had a detrimental effect on the investigation. Clive Driscoll was the face of a 2018 documentary - Stephen: The Murder that Changed a Nation “The way Ray Galloway went about it was wrong, he should have phrased it differently,” he says. “It painted a picture that Claudia somehow deserved what happened to her. It had a big impact on how people viewed her and subsequently how the public responded to the investigation.” Mr Galloway, who is no longer with the force, was contacted by the BBC about points raised in this article. He declined to comment. The maxim “find out how a person lived and you will find out how they died” is in chapter one of the National College of Policing’s murder investigation manual. It states that it is only in a minority of cases that there is no prior association between the offender and the victim; that understanding the lifestyle and routine of a victim is key to finding out why they died; and that the majority of women are killed by a partner or ex-partner. Claudia was seen on CCTV leaving work at the University of York The focus on Claudia’s love life was both a natural and legitimate line of inquiry. Mr Galloway would have been failing as senior investigating officer had he not pursued it. Former police inspector Martin Holleran, now a senior lecturer for police studies at York St John University, said the detective was faced with a tough decision. “It’s a huge balancing act. You need to put that information out because if you don’t you might not get the right people to come forward. “But once it’s out there you don’t have any control over the slant the press will put on it.” Mr Galloway’s public comments about Claudia’s “secret relationships” were indeed seized upon by journalists. “Claudia’s sex life, her alleged affairs, were represented in the press as being of key relevance to her case and status as a victim,” says Dr Charlotte Barlow, criminology lecturer at Lancaster University. “Some of the main phrases used to refer to her were things like ‘scarlet woman’ or ‘home-wrecker’ and it’s this kind of narrative and language which has underlying, highly gendered assumptions.” Dr Barlow says such wording is only really used to describe female victims and represents them as somehow responsible for their fate. “However, the blame and focus here should always be on the perpetrator, ensuring that they are held to account, and never on the victim.” Dr Karen Shalev-Greene, director for the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons, says there is often an element of “victim hierarchy” in how the press portray missing people. “The most ‘innocent’ victims get an almost angelic coverage while those with more ‘complex’ lives are portrayed differently, without a thought to the victim or the family.” Police suspected that Claudia had several lovers over a number of years - not unusual for a single woman of her age who was actively dating. But when coupled with the suggestion that some of them were married, she was seen as “the other woman”. The picture painted of Claudia in the press was not one her friends recognised. “If this was a man, this kind of behaviour would not have been an issue,” says Suzy. Jen defended Claudia when asked by the press about the chef’s love life “There was a marked change when the salacious stories started,” adds Jen. “They didn’t mention Claudia the great friend, the loving daughter, the chef who went to work even if she was on death’s door. “She might have been seeing someone, she might have been going on dates we necessarily didn’t know about but really, it was a non-thing as far as we were concerned. “She wasn’t exclusive with anyone at the time. She wasn’t married or had kids to look after, she was just living her life - and why not?” The allegations about their daughter’s love life were a surprise to her parents. Joan was furious and dismissed Mr Galloway’s comments. Peter thought them insensitive but conceded he wouldn’t have expected to know every detail of his daughter’s private life. “It was obviously difficult to hear and of course the media just went crazy with it,” he says. “But she was a 35-year-old single woman, it would have been more unusual if she hadn’t [had relationships].” North Yorkshire Police had started to consider jealousy and revenge as motives. A key focus was the Nag’s Head, where Claudia had met several men with whom she’d had relationships. Bed sheets were taken from the pub for examination and regulars were interviewed, to no avail. Meanwhile, at the York Press, armchair detectives were calling the newsroom with their theories and reporters heard repeated rumours concerning the university’s Ron Cooke Hub, which was being built in 2009. They were further fuelled by claims Claudia had been involved with men in the building trade. “With that building project there was a lot of concrete being put down and there was a suggestion she may have been dumped under there,” says Mike Laycock. The investigation on the whole appeared to be hampered by a reluctant public wary of being implicated in what had been portrayed as a lurid scandal. There were also a number of red herrings, including psychics who claimed they knew where Claudia was and a hoaxer who posted as her on Facebook. “The challenge is that you have to get people to come forward with information,” reflects Mr Driscoll. “But that was hindered because of how the case was handled.” With leads dwindling, the force scaled down the investigation in July 2010. The following February, Crimestoppers withdrew its £10,000 reward for information. “It does haunt me,” Mr Galloway said in an interview at the time, describing how he had spent many restless nights thinking about the case. “There is every potential that we have spoken to her killer.” By the time Det Supt Dai Malyn had completed his review of the Claudia Lawrence case for North Yorkshire Police, he had reached a far blunter conclusion. “I still strongly favour the theory that the person - or persons - responsible for Claudia’s disappearance was someone - or several people - who were close to her. “It was either very well-planned or there was a huge element of luck to have got away with it, so far at least. “In my view they have probably been helped by the fact that those closely associated with Claudia have withheld key information.” The detective’s comments in 2016 spoke to the frustration of a case which had left his force with a black mark in its unsolved crimes column for years. His team had spent two years unearthing new leads and theories - the most significant of which was considering the possibility that whatever happened to Claudia did so on 18 March and not the next day. It is a theory supported by Clive Driscoll, who thinks it far more likely she came to harm overnight. “It could have all gone horribly sour the moment Claudia finished that phone call with her mum. From the time she finished that conversation… is, in my mind, where the focus should lie.” The alley search was carried out six years after Claudia vanished Claudia’s house was forensically re-examined using techniques not available to the original team. This turned up new fingerprints and DNA that remain unidentified to this day. Det Supt Malyn stressed the growing importance of the alley behind Claudia’s home and officers searched it on their hands and knees. He suggested if something had happened at the property overnight those responsible would have used the alley. The review team discovered some used bleach and brown hair dye in Claudia’s bathroom and that her hair straighteners were missing The review also unearthed additional CCTV images similar to that released by the original inquiry team of the man seen near Claudia’s home on the morning of 19 March. The new footage was shot by the same camera the previous evening and appeared “to show the same man in the same place”, Det Supt Malyn said. The man walks into Heworth Place and out of shot before reappearing about a minute later, stopping briefly while someone up ahead walks across the road. North Yorkshire Police said he remains a key person to trace. Finally, in 2014 - five years after Claudia disappeared - police made the first arrests. A house in North Shields on Tyneside was searched and a pub in Acomb in York had its cellar dug up. For reasons that remain unknown, Claudia’s phone had been traced to that area in the weeks before she vanished. A 59-year-old man was held on suspicion of murder and a 46-year-old man was held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Both were released later that year without charge. The following year, hopes were again raised when four local men, who drank in the Nag’s Head, were arrested on suspicion of murder. Then in March 2016, the Crown Prosecution Service abandoned proceedings, citing a lack of evidence. North Yorkshire Police said at the time the case had “ultimately been compromised by the reluctance of some, and refusal of others, to co-operate”. The Nag’s Head, now under new management, was a key focus in the case The final blow came in late 2018 when police announced that attempts to identify a suspect from DNA obtained from a cigarette butt in Claudia’s car had drawn a blank. It meant that the £1m inquiry had stalled again. Despite thousands of names and statements being recorded, despite hundreds of interviews and searches, police still lacked that crucial piece of information. Det Supt Malyn’s disappointment was clear. The North Shields house was searched by forensics officers “I am sure that there are some people who know, or who have very strong suspicions about what happened to Claudia. For whatever reason they have either refused to come forward, or have been economical with the truth. “I am left with the inescapable conclusion that this case could still be solved if only people were honest with us. The fact that they are not is agonising for Claudia’s family and they should be ashamed of themselves.” Claudia’s case is now in a “reactive phase”, meaning it will only be reviewed if new information comes to light. Mr Driscoll - who cracked the Stephen Lawrence case after numerous police failures - believes the unsolved crime would benefit from an independent review, perhaps by a different force. “With the utmost respect to North Yorkshire Police, the case could do with a fresh pair of eyes,” he says. “It might mean they have to say, ‘listen, this is a bit embarrassing’, but at least it might provide some answers as to what has happened to this poor girl.” The force’s reluctance to take part in interviews on the 10th anniversary of the case is a wasted opportunity for “one big push” to solve it, says Mr Holleran. “Ten years on and loyalties change. People may struggle to live with the knowledge they possess and cracks may form. “Anniversaries such as this are an ideal opportunity to bring people forward again and get Claudia’s name back in the public’s mind.” Det Supt Dai Malyn led the review into Claudia’s case The BBC asked North Yorkshire Police a series of questions about the points raised in this article on a number of occasions during its production. In response, the force provided a statement from Det Supt Malyn which said his review was led by a “gold group” of experts from around the country that maximised “every opportunity” to establish what happened to Claudia. He said detectives would continue to investigate any new information, adding: “North Yorkshire Police will never give up on Claudia and her family.” The past decade has proved an agonising time for those close to Claudia. Peter has gained comfort by helping others caught up in the aftermath of a loved one’s disappearance and has been appointed OBE for his work. He has successfully campaigned for Claudia’s Law, which allows families to manage a missing relative’s finances and property - including his daughter’s. Claudia’s friendship group has fragmented as they wrestle with the inconceivable idea the killer could be known to them. For Suzy, it has been particularly hard - she has become withdrawn and finds social situations almost impossible. “I have pushed people away. I suppose that way if I don’t get close to anyone they can’t leave me or disappear,” she says. A mother’s instinct keeps Joan going. She refuses to believe her daughter is dead because she has “no cut-off feeling”. “I get up in the morning and see what the weather is like. If it’s snowing, Claudia wouldn’t have liked it - she hated the cold. In the supermarket I see tulips, her favourite flowers. “You have to keep going. If I stay in bed all day looking at four walls, what good will that do? “I will not give up [hope]. One day I will find out what happened to my daughter.” Built with Shorthand"
Duckenfield case 'breathtakingly unfair',"Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans The prosecution of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield was ""breathtakingly unfair"" as he was made to take the blame for others, a jury has heard. Ben Myers QC made the claim in his closing speech at Preston Crown Court in defence of the 74-year-old. He denies gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans, on 15 April 1989. Mr Myers also said ""it must be one of the most heartbreaking cases ever to come before an English court"". He said it was obvious now, but not then, of the dangers of putting large numbers of people in confined spaces in pens. Football was plagued by hooliganism in the 1970s and 1980s and was a ""world away"" from today's game, he said. ""It affected how police planned the event and how they would react as matters unfolded."" He said it was ""humbling"" to be addressing the court ""because of the scale of the case and the scale of the loss"". The barrister told the jury failings at Hillsborough included faulty police radios, poor signage, a reduction in police manpower and stadium structure - none of which was Mr Duckenfield's fault. He said his client was an ""excellent police officer"" who less than three weeks to prepare for the game after being promoted. ""He was faced with something that no-one had foreseen, no-one had planned for and no-one could deal with."" Mr Myers said the jury was being invited to ""give him criminal responsibility for a decade of incompetence on the part of others"". The barrister told the court the case against his client, who chose not to give evidence, was heavily based on hindsight, adding: ""In the real world you get one go."" He said the Hillsborough stadium ""was potentially lethal"" and there had been a ""history of near-misses"". ""It's like giving a captain a ship that's already sinking and judging him on how well he sails it,"" Mr Myers added. ""The system he was working with was riddled with system faults. It's not a fair start."" The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster At one point he turned to the defendant and said: ""Look at him now. Someone has to stand up for him. We do that, and we do it with vigour. He is an ageing man and not in the best of health."" Mr Myers said it would be ""very wrong indeed"" to convict Mr Duckenfield ""as a way of expressing"" sympathy over what happened. Mr Myers also said it was ""utterly wrong and deeply unfair"" that the jury was shown video footage of the disaster by the prosecution. He said: ""It is not right to bridge evidential gaps with emotion and strong feeling."" On Thursday, prosecutor Richard Matthews QC said Mr Duckenfield had ""ultimate responsibility"" and should have made ""lifesaving decisions"". Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster. Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, denies failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety Act. The trial continues.

Students' climate strike spreads globally,"This video can not be played Climate change: Fears about effects of pollution and climate change Thousands of school pupils worldwide have abandoned classrooms for a day of protest against climate change. India, South Korea, Australia and the US are among the countries where teenagers are already on strike. The day of action is expected to embrace about 100 countries. They are inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who protests weekly outside Sweden's parliament. Scientists say tougher measures are needed to cut global warming. The Paris climate agreement of 2017 committed nearly 200 countries to keeping global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and to striving for a maximum of 1.5C.

Tommy Robinson loses harassment case,"Tommy Robinson, in court under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, said he was told to leave a pub by police English Defence League (EDL) founder Tommy Robinson has lost his legal challenge claiming police harassed him. Appearing in court under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, 36, was asked to move on from a Cambridge pub following a football match in August 2016. He said Cambridgeshire Police had targeted him ""because of his beliefs"". Judge Karen Walden-Smith said there was ""no evidence that Mr Lennon was being treated differently because of his beliefs about fundamentalist Islam."" His harassment claim was heard at Peterborough County Court. Sgt Paul Street, who asked Mr Yaxley-Lennon to move on from the pub, told the court he did not know what Tommy Robinson looked like and thought the name referred to an ""'80s football hooligan"". He said he moved Mr Yaxley-Lennon on due to intelligence that he was a football supporter likely to cause trouble, and was with a group of other ""risk"" supporters. Giving her judgement following a four-day hearing, Ms Walden-Smith said: ""Mr Lennon isn't as well-known as he and his supporters may think."" Ms Walden-Smith ruled that all of his claims, including several under the Human Rights Act, had failed. Mr Yaxley-Lennon said he had been with his three children, aged between five and nine at the time, on a family day out to see Luton Town play Cambridge United. He was with his three young children at the time and was not dressed for a fight, his lawyer said Alison Gurden, representing the 36-year-old, said Sgt Street ""didn't take into account factors that he should have done"". ""It wasn't necessary [to move him on] as there was... nothing to indicate Mr Lennon was likely to become involved in disorder,"" she said. ""He's there with his children and he's certainly not dressed for a fight, he's in his flip-flops."" She said Mr Yaxley-Lennon believed he was ""discriminated against on the grounds of being Tommy Robinson and his beliefs"". When the judge read out her decision, there was a shout of ""the law's an ass"" from the public gallery and Mr Yaxley-Lennon said the judgment reflected the ""entire corrupt system"". The judge ordered that Mr Yaxley-Lennon pay Â£20,000 towards the defendant's costs. Mr Yaxley-Lennon said outside court that he would appeal against the judgement.

Trump issues veto over border emergency,"This video can not be played Trump issues first veto of his presidency President Donald Trump has vetoed a measure from Congress revoking his declaration of a national emergency at the US-Mexico border. Lawmakers, including 12 Republicans, had passed the rejection resolution on Thursday in a surprising rebuke of Mr Trump's pledge to build a border wall. Congress will now need a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override him, which is unlikely to happen. This is the first veto of Mr Trump's presidency. ""As president, the protection of the nation is my highest duty,"" Mr Trump said on Friday. Standing behind the president were law enforcement officials, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Vice-President Mike Pence, Attorney General William Barr and ""angel parents"" - the parents of children killed by illegal immigrants. ""Yesterday, Congress passed a dangerous resolution that if signed into law, would put countless Americans in danger. ""Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution and I have the duty to veto it. I'm very proud to veto it. "" Mr Trump repeated his claims that illegal immigrants from the southern border were mostly criminals, bringing drugs into the country. Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan A major land grab by Trump He had promised a veto of the resolution ending his emergency declaration as soon as the measure was circulated on Capitol Hill. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives had passed the resolution to overturn the emergency last month, and 12 Republicans sided with Democratic Senators to clear the Senate in a 59-41 vote on Thursday afternoon. The renegade conservatives had condemned the emergency declaration for setting up a dangerous precedent for a president while emphasising that they still agreed with Mr Trump's tough border security policies. Just after the Senate vote, Mr Trump tweeted: ""VETO!"" Mr Trump had declared the emergency in February after Congress refused his requests for $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) to construct a border wall - a campaign promise. By doing so, he opened up access to billions in military funds that do not require approval from lawmakers. Democrats - and a handful of Republicans - were quick to label the move presidential overreach. Reaction to Trump's national emergency The president has maintained that the situation with migrants at the southern border is a national security and humanitarian crisis, while Democrats have accused him of fear-mongering. Following the veto, the resolution will return to the House on 26 March, Speaker for the House Nancy Pelosi said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While Democrats control the House, they would need a total of 67 votes in the Senate to override Mr Trump's veto. Given that only 12 out of 53 Republicans joined them to pass the initial resolution, it is unlikely that any override measure will be successful. ""House Republicans will have to choose between their partisan hypocrisy and their sacred oath to support and defend the constitution,"" Mrs Pelosi said in a statement after Mr Trump's announcement. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham shared his support of Mr Trump's decision. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The highest ranking Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said in a statement that Mr Trump ""holds the rule of law and our constitution in minimal regard"". ""There is no emergency; Congress has refused to fund his wall multiple times; Mexico won't pay for it; and a bipartisan majority in both chambers just voted to terminate his fake emergency,"" he said.

McVey hints at backing PM's deal,"This video can not be played McVey: ""People will have to vote for deal if they want Brexit"" Tory Brexiteer Esther McVey has hinted she will back Theresa May's EU deal next week, despite voting against it both times it came to the Commons. She resigned from cabinet in November over the deal, saying it did not ""honour the result of the referendum"". But speaking to Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, she said Leave-backing MPs will ""have to think a different way"" for the next vote. She also called for ministers who voted against the government to be sacked. Ms McVey accused her successor as Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, Justice Secretary David Gauke, and Business Secretary Greg Clark of ""destroying democracy"" and ""ripping up the rule books"" by defying the three-line whip on votes this week. DUP in talks with ministers over Brexit deal Will EU leaders agree to extending Brexit? Brexit delay: What just happened? Asked by Nick Robinson if MPs like her would ""hold their noses and vote"" for Mrs May's deal - which is expected to return to the Commons next week - Ms McVey said: ""Yes. They will. I don't know what the number is, but they will have to do that if they... want Brexit."" She accused the government of ""running down the clock"" and said Parliament had ""given away all of its leverage"" by voting to rule out leaving the EU without a deal. This video can not be played How MPs rejected a no-deal Brexit ""The [situation] now is people will have to take a bad deal rather than no deal,"" she said. Ms McVey said the prime minister had ""broken"" her promises to MPs over her red lines and, as a result, ""people are going to have to think a different way next week"". She said that although she had decided which way she would vote next week, she would not say. But pushed further by Nick Robinson, who asked if there was a chance she may be forced to, she said: ""Yes."" The Tory MP also criticised her former cabinet colleagues, who had either voted against the government or abstained on votes earlier this week over ruling out a no-deal Brexit. She said there was an ""an emboldened Remain cabinet... who now doesn't even adhere to collective responsibility [and] who can sit as bold as brass on the front bench and not vote with a three-lined whip"". Asked if they should be sacked, Ms McVey said: ""Of course you can't stay in a government. You can't rip up the rulebook. You are destroying democracy [and] destroying trust with the public.""

How emergency powers could be used to build Trump's wall,"This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall US President Donald Trump plans to make use of emergency powers to secure funding for his proposed US-Mexico border wall. Invoking a national emergency could enable Mr Trump to bypass Congress and access military funds and resources. But what are these emergency powers, and is using them that simple? A state of emergency is usually declared in times of national crisis. In this case, Mr Trump has claimed there is a migration crisis on the US-Mexico border. Declaring a national emergency gives the president ""access to special powers that are contained in more than 100 other laws"", said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program. Those powers effectively allow the president to bypass the usual political process. ""Obviously, the intent is to provide for badly needed flexibility when there are urgent crises which Congress does not have time to address,"" Ms Goitein said. Isthere really a border emergency? More than 2,000 people were turned away or arrested at the border each day during November 2018. Supporters of Mr Trump's plans for a wall have said the numbers constitute an emergency. Others argue the migration across the southern border is far lower than a decade ago, and many of the thousands of people who travelled north from countries like Honduras are presenting themselves as asylum seekers, looking to enter the country legally. 6 things that could topple Donald Trump's border wall How much of Trump's wall has been built? Ms Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, said she did not believe the situation constituted a national emergency. ""It needs to be something fast-moving, totally unforeseen, it is meant to be a stopgap measure,"" she said. ""This is not such a thing and it would be a tremendous abuse of power to invoke just to short-circuit the political process."" Ms Goitein pointed to two sections of the law which Mr Trump could take advantage of. One would allow the redirection of funds for military projects already approved by Congress, the other would require the administration to prove the wall amounts to a military construction. Neither are a ""slam dunk"" for the president, who must cite one of the laws as the legal basis for his declaration, Ms Goitein said. The National Emergencies Act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status - provided both houses agree and the president does not veto. With a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president invoking a national emergency. The dissenting Republicans include 2012 presidential candidate and new senator for Utah Mitt Romney, the Florida senator Marco Rubio, and the senator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski, who said the move was ""of dubious constitutionality"". The resolution would however still require Mr Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress is needed to overturn a presidential veto. Harry Truman, pictured in 1953, tried - unsuccessfully - to use the powers There is another option of blocking the move through the courts - which is what happened when President Harry Truman tried to nationalise the steel industry during the Korean War, setting a legal precedent. ""If Harry Truman couldn't nationalise the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border,"" Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, told CNN. How frequently do presidents usetheemergencyact? Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, used it 13 times, while his predecessor George W Bush used it 12 times. If Mr Trump goes ahead with declaring a national emergency, it would be the fourth of his administration. But emergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises - including blocking terrorism-linked entities from accessing funds or prohibiting investment in nations associated with human rights abuses. ""It's extremely rare for a president to declare a national emergency in a bid to fund domestic construction projects, particularly one that Congress has explicitly refused to fund,"" Andrew Boyle, an attorney in the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told the Associated Press news agency. ""The ones that former presidents declared are of a different sort."" Mr Trump's decision to apply the powers to overcome a partisan impasse over border security has struck politicians on both sides of the aisle as a deviation from the intended use of the act. ""It would be a pretty dramatic expansion of how this was used in the past,"" said the Republican senator Ron Johnson. Some previous uses were for issues like the H1N1 influenza epidemic and have since ended. Others are more general and continue to this day, like blocking the property of people ""engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities"". Perhaps the most well-known occasion a president used his powers was in the case of Franklin D Roosevelt, who used them to order the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese-Americans in the months after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbour. George W Bush used emergency powers in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Centre attack to sign off wiretapping and interrogation methods later decried as torture.

Interserve completes fast-track sale,"Interserve has a cleaning contract for Network Rail stations Control of one of Britain's biggest government contractors, Interserve, has moved to a new company after administrators were appointed. It comes after shareholders rejected a rescue deal for the company, which has 45,000 UK staff, and 68,000 globally. Under a pre-arranged agreement, administrators EY were installed and the assets moved immediately to a group controlled by Interserve's lenders. Interserve insisted that the deal would protect services and jobs. The company cleans schools and hospitals, runs catering and probation services, and manages construction projects. On Friday,shareholders voted 59.38% against a rescue plan to address Interserve's mounting debt pile.,external The plan would have seen their stake reduced to just 5%, with lenders being handed the lion's share of the business. But after the vote, Interserve said that ""in the absence of any viable alternative"" rescue plan it would formally apply to the High Court to go into administration. EY was appointed under a so-called pre-pack administration, an insolvency procedure in which a company arranges to move its assets to a another owner before administrators are officially appointed. It meant that Interserve could avoid a Carillion-style collapse. However, investors have seen the value of their shares wiped out under the financial restructuring. The lenders who are now in control of Interserve Group include banks RBS and HSBC, and investors Emerald Asset Management and Davidson Kempner Capital. In a statement, EY administrator Hunter Kelly said: ""This transaction secured the jobs of 68,000 employees, the majority of whom work in the UK, as well as ensuring there was no disruption to the vital public services that Interserve provides to the UK Government."" Debbie White, chief executive of Interserve Group, said: ""Interserve is fundamentally a strong business and with a competitive financial platform in place we see significant opportunities ahead as a best-in-class partner to the public and private sector."" A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ""We welcome this announcement. It brings the company the stability required for it to compete for future business and continue to deliver good value public services for the taxpayer."" Interserve accumulated debt after construction project delays and a failed energy-from-waste project in Derby and Glasgow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, the GMB union said earlier on Friday that Interserve's problems, which come after the failure of Carillion last year, showed it was ""time to turn the tide on the disastrous experiment"" of outsourcing public services. Kevin Brandstatter, the union's national officer, said: ""Ministers have learnt absolutely nothing from the Carillion fiasco and are hell-bent on outsourcing public sector contracts. ""Shambolic mismanagement is putting jobs put on the line and services in jeopardy. Our public services can't go on like this."" Although Interserve's contracts are expected to continue, there is still concern for jobs in the supply chain. The National Federation of Builders (NFB) said there would be thousands of workers wondering whether they still have a job, and called for changes in the way the government hands out contracts to big national companies. Richard Beresford, chief executive of the NFB, said it was time to reform ""the procurement process from its foundations to ensure that more regional contractors can compete and win work"". In addition to helping smaller companies, it would ""spread risk across fiscally responsible businesses who reinvest profits and are not bound by shareholders,"" he said. The outsourcing firm is one of the UK's largest public services providers.  The firm started in dredging and construction, and from there has diversified into a wide range of services, such as healthcare and catering, for clients in government and industry. It sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects. Interserve is the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5's Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. Hospital contracts include a a Â£35m contract at King George Hospital in east London for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance.

Topshop retail group 'exploring options',"Sir Philip Green is working on a restructuring of his Arcadia Group retail empire that includes Topshop and Miss Selfridge. The billionaire's company said in a statement that it was suffering ""an exceptionally challenging retail market"" in the UK. Arcadia was therefore ""exploring options"" to bolster the business. Job cuts and store closures are likely, but they would not be ""significant"", Arcadia insisted. There were reports on Friday that Sir Philip was considering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that would enable him to seek rent cuts and close unwanted stores. Arcadia said that it was issuing its statement in response to that media speculation, but made no mention about a CVA nor potential sales. ""Within an exceptionally challenging retail market and given the continued pressures that are specific to the UK high street we are exploring several options to enable the business to operate in a more efficient manner,"" Arcadia said. ""None of the options being explored involve a significant number of redundancies or store closures. The business continues to operate as usual including all payments being made to suppliers as normal,"" it added. CVAs can be used to cut shop rent bills, and other costs, but they are controversial and when House of Fraser used the arrangement it sparked a huge legal battle with landlords. News that one of the UK's biggest fashion retail groups is struggling comes after a string of High Street names hit financial trouble. Debenhams, New Look, Mothercare, House of Fraser, HMV and LK Bennett are among a roll-call of retailers hit by weak consumer confidence, higher costs, and the growth of online rivals. Philip Green 'paid harassment accuser Â£1m' Karren Brady quits Philip Green's empire Philip Green's Topshop facing boycott Many retail experts believe Topshop, Sir Philip's prize asset, has fallen out of favour with today's young consumers. Arcadia also owns Evans and Wallis. Last year Sir Philip was embroiled in claims - strongly denied - of bullying and inappropriate behaviour. He was also criticised over the demise of department store chain BHS, which, after he sold it for just Â£1, collapsed a year later. The reports earlier that Arcadia was working on turnaround plans suggested that formal talks with shop landlords were expected to begin in the next few weeks. It emerged in January that the business had hired advisers at Deloitte to explore a restructuring, prompted by a decline in sales and profits. The news comes just weeks after Baroness Karren Brady resigned from Arcadia's parent company Taveta, following the emergence of harassment allegations against Sir Philip.

George Michael art collection fetches ÃÂ£11m,"Michael, pictured in 2005, died in 2016 as a result of heart and liver disease Contemporary artworks owned by George Michael have sold for Â£11.3m at an auction, 27 months after his death. They included pieces by Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst. The highest price was for The Incomplete Truth, a 2006 Hirst work consisting of a dove preserved in formaldehyde, which sold for Â£911,250. The 53-year-old was a keen collector of works by the Young British Art movement and was friends with many artists. The money raised will go to causes that the philanthropic star supported. George Michael's art collection unveiled 'Everybody warmed to George Michael' Another of Hirst's works - Saint Sebastian, Exquisite Pain, a representation of the death of the Christian martyr using a bull encased in formaldehyde - sold for Â£875,250 at the London auction. The Incomplete Truth by Damien Hirst alongside other works from George Michael's collection Bridget Riley's 1982 painting Songbird, the first major work Michael acquired, fetched Â£791,250, while Hurricane, a 2007 work by Emin, sold for Â£431,250. Other lots sold on Thursday included three works by Michael Craig-Martin that reference Michael's 1998 notorious arrest for engaging in a sexual act in a public toilet. Untitled (SEX), Untitled (GOD) and Handcuffs sold for Â£125,000, Â£40,000 and Â£112,500 respectively. A life-size bronze gorilla by Angus Fairhurst that used to sit in Michael's garden also went under the hammer, fetching Â£118,750. Works by Angus Fairhurst and Bridget Riley were also sold on Thursday According to Cristian Albu from Christie's, Michael's ""most intense"" period of art-buying took place between 2004 and 2009. ""I'm sure he had advisors but I think he pleased himself and made up his own mind what he liked,"" Albu told the BBC's Vincent Dowd earlier this month. Christie's attributed the fact every lot sold on Thursday to both Michael's ""eye for contemporary art"" and ""the depth of feeling"" he continued to generate.

Students' climate strike spreads globallyThousands of school pupils protest in cities across Asia and Europe against climate change.World,"This video can not be played Climate change: Fears about effects of pollution and climate change Thousands of school pupils worldwide have abandoned classrooms for a day of protest against climate change. India, South Korea, Australia and the US are among the countries where teenagers are already on strike. The day of action is expected to embrace about 100 countries. They are inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who protests weekly outside Sweden's parliament. Scientists say tougher measures are needed to cut global warming. The Paris climate agreement of 2017 committed nearly 200 countries to keeping global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and to striving for a maximum of 1.5C.

What happened to Claudia?It's been 10 years since Claudia Lawrence vanished - and police are yet to solve her murder.," Claudia Lawrence’s house remains empty, preserved by her family in the hope she might one day return. For years her dresses hung unworn in the wardrobe, some with tags still attached. The remnants of her belongings are now pushed against the walls in haphazard piles. In the decade since she vanished - presumed murdered - a number of significant dates have passed, including her 40th and 45th birthdays. For her friends and family, it has been an unbearable time. Three days into the investigation, Claudia’s friends couldn’t imagine it going on another week, let alone a decade. They felt sure she would turn up. That changed for Suzy Cooper moments after the landlord of the Nag’s Head pub called to say the press were there and wanted to talk to her. She was wholly unprepared for what greeted her. Claudia and Suzy were so close they called each other “sister” “I opened the door and every paper and news channel you could imagine were there. Microphones and cameras were shoved in my face, people asking me this and that. It was horrendous. “It really hit me on the Saturday night when I saw the story on the news. I remember thinking ‘oh Claudia would hate that picture’ - she really disliked her picture being taken. “I thought it was going to be over in a day or two, for sure. How this has gone on for 10 years with no resolution, no clue, no nothing, I can’t fathom. “How can that happen in this day and age?” “I regularly go out for a walk. It might be a nice sunny day and I wonder‘Claudia, are you seeing this?’” Hands clasped in his lap, Peter Lawrence glances at a candle on the fireplace at his home in York, less than two miles from his daughter’s small terraced house in Heworth. The red wax pillar was given to him by the Archbishop of York as a symbol of hope in the bleak years following Claudia’s disappearance. Ali and Claudia were three years apart in age Peter and his ex-wife Joan had two children - Ali, born in 1971, followed three years later by Claudia. They brought them up in Malton, a North Yorkshire market town with strong horse racing connections, 16 miles from York. It was a comfortable upbringing. Claudia played the flute and on Saturdays the sisters would go for riding lessons in nearby Rillington. Horses became a life-long passion for the younger girl and she continued to ride until the time she disappeared. The family’s five-bedroom home had paddocks and the girls had their own ponies. In the winter the family looked after donkeys from Scarborough beach and their garden was used as a sanctuary for the animals to recover from a busy summer on the sand. Claudia’s teenage years were seemingly as content as her childhood - she would wander into the market square with friends and occasionally babysit for Peter’s friend Martin Dales, whose two daughters thought she was “glamorous”. Ali and Claudia went to nearby private schools and while close, were different in character. “Ali was more academically minded while Claudia was brave, adventurous, always wanting to do things,” says Peter. “She would go out for long rides and would help mucking out at the stables. She enjoyed school, although maybe not the work as much. But she was happy and had a lot of friends.” Claudia went on to study catering and by the time she was in her early 20s, she had worked in various kitchens before joining the University of York as a chef. Joan said she was a well-liked employee, the type who would volunteer for shifts at Christmas so colleagues could spend it with their children. “Chefs are not particularly well paid unless you get to be famous,” adds Peter. “But she had no aspirations to do that - she was really happy doing what she was doing.” It was working in York that prompted Claudia to move. She had become nervous about driving there in winter, so she bought a neat terraced house with a green door on the outskirts of the city centre. Heworth Road is dotted with typical suburban landmarks: a post office, a primary school, a Costcutter shop and a church on the corner. The Nag’s Head, a stone’s throw from her gate, was Claudia’s regular and the place where she often socialised with friends. Her home was also a 10-minute car journey to her job at Goodricke College on the university’s Heslington campus. But according to Joan, Claudia had been walking to work in the days leading up to her disappearance on Thursday, 19 March 2009, because her ageing Vauxhall Corsa was in the garage. Indeed, the 35-year-old was seen walking home from work the day before - cameras capturing her as she left work at 14:31 and spotting her at various points along the 45-minute route. Later that night, she spoke to Peter on the phone, then Joan, with whom she made plans to mark Mother’s Day. Claudia purchased the house in Heworth Road in 2007 “We’d both been watching Location, Location, Location on the television,” says Joan. “It was being filmed in Harrogate, and we have a friend there, so we just chatted about that. “She seemed absolutely fine.” “I dream about Claudia - we always talk about why she’s been missing and there’s always a different explanation. “I like the dreams because in some sort of way I’ve seen her but it really shakes me for the rest of the day. It’s almost like I don’t want to go back to reality, I just want to stay in the dream with her.” Suzy Cooper was sitting alone in the Nag’s Head waiting for Claudia to show up on the evening of 19 March when she realised something wasn’t quite right. The pair had arranged to meet for a cider, as they so often did. But when her friend failed to arrive Suzy sent her a text, joking about being “stood up”. When she called and it went straight to voicemail, she chalked it up to Claudia falling asleep and leaving her phone uncharged. “I was off work that week so the next morning, the Friday, I rang her and again it was switched off. That was totally out of character and at that point I knew something was wrong.” Suzy, Claudia and Jen King were part of a tight-knit group that regularly met at the Nag’s Head. The trio formed a close friendship soon after meeting at the pub in 2006 and spent several nights there a week. When they weren’t together, they were constantly texting or chatting on the phone. “We’d listen to each other moan, talk about our days or, if we were having a stressful time at work, then we’d say ‘oh, come on let’s just have a drink’,” says Jen. Claudia, Suzy, and Jen were close friends Suzy and Claudia were so close they rarely called each other by their first names, instead calling each other “sister”. While Jen, who was a barmaid at the pub, lived for a few months with Claudia in Heworth Road. “She was a simple person, in that she was fairly easily pleased,” says Jen. “She liked to buy a new top now and again, go to the pub, see her horse, listen to music. She didn’t desire the grand things in life, she just wanted a nice sunshine holiday and to have a tan.” It was this predictability that tipped Suzy off. When she couldn’t get hold of Claudia again the next day, she immediately rang Peter. “I told him Claudia hadn’t turned up when we arranged to meet and that she hadn’t answered my calls and that I was really worried. He drove straight over.” The pair were nervous as they entered Claudia’s house on 20 March. They feared she had been attacked or fallen down the stairs but the total absence of anything out of the ordinary was even more concerning. Her slippers were neatly by the door, dishes stacked in the sink. The jewellery she typically took off for work and left at home was on the chest of drawers. In the kitchen, next to the bathroom, her toothbrush had been left on the draining board. Her phone and rucksack containing her chef’s whites were missing. Everything suggested she left for work as planned. Peter Lawrence spoke to his daughter the night before she vanished Peter had already called the university and learned his daughter had not turned up for her shift the previous day. He walked outside, sat alone in his car and called 999 to report her missing. Within hours, Heworth was swarming with police. “When I called I expected them to say - given how long she’d been missing - to give it a day or two, but it was the complete opposite,” he says. “There were about 150 to 200 officers combing every inch of the route she would have taken to the university. It just all seemed very surreal.” According to police, the first 72 hours of a missing persons inquiry are the most critical. The intensity of the searches in and around Claudia’s home in those first few days reflected the fact that detectives knew they were working against the clock. But despite the speed at which North Yorkshire Police descended on Heworth Road, Claudia’s mother believes the initial investigation was plagued with mistakes from the outset. “In my mind the police were out of their depth,” says Joan. “It got so big, so quickly, that they didn’t know how to handle it.” York Press newspaper reporter Nicola Small was at work when North Yorkshire Police made its first media appeal two days after Claudia’s disappearance. “I remember being struck by the photo of her - she stood out. A smiling, attractive blonde who didn’t look like she’d had a troubled life. “There was nothing [in the press release] to suggest we wouldn’t soon be getting another saying she’d returned home safe and well.” Joan Lawrence is critical of the police for using this photo of Claudia But by Sunday, a second appeal struck a more worrying tone. A high-ranking officer had been assigned to the case and a press conference arranged for the next day. Chief reporter Mike Laycock suspected Claudia’s disappearance wasn’t a typical missing persons case and decided to put the story on the front page of Monday’s newspaper. He was right to follow his instinct. The next day, Det Ch Insp Lucy Pope told journalists she feared Claudia had been abducted. Sitting alongside her was a visibly shaken Peter, who described the wait for news as a “living nightmare”. “I just remember his face,” says Jen, who saw him later that day at the police station. “[I remember] him saying ‘things like this don’t happen to us’.” In York - a tourist city known for its Viking heritage and Gothic cathedral - the story struck a nerve, says Nicola. “Everybody wanted to know what the latest developments were and everybody had their own theory about what had happened. “These things didn’t happen here. Young women with everything to live for didn’t vanish without trace.” The case was handed to one of North Yorkshire Police’s most senior officers, Det Supt Ray Galloway. It quickly became the biggest investigation the force had dealt with in several years. Posters of Claudia were plastered on lampposts across the city and officers trawled Heworth, combing through undergrowth, checking a nearby stream and speaking to neighbours. Images of a bag and phone similar to Claudia’s missing items were released Her house was searched and largely discounted as a crime scene because there were no signs of struggle or foul play. A suggestion Claudia had left the country to live in Cyprus, where she had holidayed numerous times, was also dismissed because her bank cards and passport were in the house. Claudia left few digital clues as to her whereabouts. She didn’t use social media, own a computer, or use the internet on her Samsung D900. Unlike smartphones today, hers did not track her location. She was, however, a prolific texter. She replied to a message at 20:27 on 18 March but failed to respond to one received at 21:12. Analysis of her phone showed it was deliberately turned off at 12:10 the next day within an eight-mile radius of York. Detectives were certain Claudia had left for work on 19 March and that something had happened to her between Heworth Road and Goodricke College. A number of witnesses came forward, including a cyclist who saw a woman that morning matching Claudia’s description,  talking to a man dubbed by police as “the left-handed smoker”. They were spotted near the electricity substation at Melrosegate bridge at about 05:35. It was potentially significant because if Claudia had left for work as planned, she would have reached the bridge - a 10-minute walk from her house - by that time. A witness reported seeing a man and a woman talking by the bridge But it was not as far as the CCTV camera at the Melrosegate shops which had captured her walking home from work on 18 March, suggesting she never made it that far on foot the next morning. A different witness, however, came forward to report seeing a man and woman arguing on a grass verge next to a parked vehicle on University Way, around the time Claudia was due to start her shift. Both sightings were major lines of inquiry but despite numerous appeals, neither couple was ever traced. Six weeks after Claudia’s disappearance, the investigation was reclassified as a suspected murder case. While there was no body, crime scene or suspect, there was no proof of life either. Joan says she found out about the latest development in her daughter’s case from a TV news report. “I got such a shock, I couldn’t believe it,” she says. Joan Lawrence says she will never give up hope Joan has long been critical of the first police investigation. She says officers initially used a photo of Claudia with the wrong hair colour and that she wasn’t spoken to in the immediate aftermath of her daughter’s disappearance. “Ray Galloway came to see me once, a few days [later]. He never asked me what Claudia was like, what her hobbies were, he didn’t want to get to know her. “I told [police] that she didn’t look like that when she disappeared - her hair was much darker, but they carried on using that [photo] for a number of years.” Joan with Ali, left, and Claudia As the weeks passed, police were seemingly getting no further. Detectives hoped CCTV released in mid May of a man seen near Claudia’s home the morning of her disappearance might provide a crucial clue. At 05:07 he can be seen walking into Heworth Place towards an alley behind her house. Just over a minute later, he reappears and rejoins the main road. Mr Galloway told the York Press at the time that the man’s actions were “strange” and urged him to come forward so he could be excluded from the inquiry. He has never been identified. By June, the case had taken a different direction. Its lead detective told BBC Crimewatch that investigators were now focusing on allegations made about the chef’s love life. “Who was Claudia going out with? Who was she seeing?” Mr Galloway asked viewers. “Who was her boyfriend? Who was showing her maybe some unhealthy interest?” Former Det Supt Ray Galloway led the initial investigation In a second appearance on the show he made more direct claims, describing Claudia’s relationships as “complex and mysterious” - words that immediately became the subject of tabloid headlines. “It set the rumour mill whirring,” says former Met detective chief inspector Clive Driscoll. Mr Driscoll, who is credited with finally securing justice for the family of Stephen Lawrence, has previously examined Claudia’s case as part of a documentary. He believes Mr Galloway’s comments turned public opinion against her and had a detrimental effect on the investigation. Clive Driscoll was the face of a 2018 documentary - Stephen: The Murder that Changed a Nation “The way Ray Galloway went about it was wrong, he should have phrased it differently,” he says. “It painted a picture that Claudia somehow deserved what happened to her. It had a big impact on how people viewed her and subsequently how the public responded to the investigation.” Mr Galloway, who is no longer with the force, was contacted by the BBC about points raised in this article. He declined to comment. The maxim “find out how a person lived and you will find out how they died” is in chapter one of the National College of Policing’s murder investigation manual. It states that it is only in a minority of cases that there is no prior association between the offender and the victim; that understanding the lifestyle and routine of a victim is key to finding out why they died; and that the majority of women are killed by a partner or ex-partner. Claudia was seen on CCTV leaving work at the University of York The focus on Claudia’s love life was both a natural and legitimate line of inquiry. Mr Galloway would have been failing as senior investigating officer had he not pursued it. Former police inspector Martin Holleran, now a senior lecturer for police studies at York St John University, said the detective was faced with a tough decision. “It’s a huge balancing act. You need to put that information out because if you don’t you might not get the right people to come forward. “But once it’s out there you don’t have any control over the slant the press will put on it.” Mr Galloway’s public comments about Claudia’s “secret relationships” were indeed seized upon by journalists. “Claudia’s sex life, her alleged affairs, were represented in the press as being of key relevance to her case and status as a victim,” says Dr Charlotte Barlow, criminology lecturer at Lancaster University. “Some of the main phrases used to refer to her were things like ‘scarlet woman’ or ‘home-wrecker’ and it’s this kind of narrative and language which has underlying, highly gendered assumptions.” Dr Barlow says such wording is only really used to describe female victims and represents them as somehow responsible for their fate. “However, the blame and focus here should always be on the perpetrator, ensuring that they are held to account, and never on the victim.” Dr Karen Shalev-Greene, director for the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons, says there is often an element of “victim hierarchy” in how the press portray missing people. “The most ‘innocent’ victims get an almost angelic coverage while those with more ‘complex’ lives are portrayed differently, without a thought to the victim or the family.” Police suspected that Claudia had several lovers over a number of years - not unusual for a single woman of her age who was actively dating. But when coupled with the suggestion that some of them were married, she was seen as “the other woman”. The picture painted of Claudia in the press was not one her friends recognised. “If this was a man, this kind of behaviour would not have been an issue,” says Suzy. Jen defended Claudia when asked by the press about the chef’s love life “There was a marked change when the salacious stories started,” adds Jen. “They didn’t mention Claudia the great friend, the loving daughter, the chef who went to work even if she was on death’s door. “She might have been seeing someone, she might have been going on dates we necessarily didn’t know about but really, it was a non-thing as far as we were concerned. “She wasn’t exclusive with anyone at the time. She wasn’t married or had kids to look after, she was just living her life - and why not?” The allegations about their daughter’s love life were a surprise to her parents. Joan was furious and dismissed Mr Galloway’s comments. Peter thought them insensitive but conceded he wouldn’t have expected to know every detail of his daughter’s private life. “It was obviously difficult to hear and of course the media just went crazy with it,” he says. “But she was a 35-year-old single woman, it would have been more unusual if she hadn’t [had relationships].” North Yorkshire Police had started to consider jealousy and revenge as motives. A key focus was the Nag’s Head, where Claudia had met several men with whom she’d had relationships. Bed sheets were taken from the pub for examination and regulars were interviewed, to no avail. Meanwhile, at the York Press, armchair detectives were calling the newsroom with their theories and reporters heard repeated rumours concerning the university’s Ron Cooke Hub, which was being built in 2009. They were further fuelled by claims Claudia had been involved with men in the building trade. “With that building project there was a lot of concrete being put down and there was a suggestion she may have been dumped under there,” says Mike Laycock. The investigation on the whole appeared to be hampered by a reluctant public wary of being implicated in what had been portrayed as a lurid scandal. There were also a number of red herrings, including psychics who claimed they knew where Claudia was and a hoaxer who posted as her on Facebook. “The challenge is that you have to get people to come forward with information,” reflects Mr Driscoll. “But that was hindered because of how the case was handled.” With leads dwindling, the force scaled down the investigation in July 2010. The following February, Crimestoppers withdrew its £10,000 reward for information. “It does haunt me,” Mr Galloway said in an interview at the time, describing how he had spent many restless nights thinking about the case. “There is every potential that we have spoken to her killer.” By the time Det Supt Dai Malyn had completed his review of the Claudia Lawrence case for North Yorkshire Police, he had reached a far blunter conclusion. “I still strongly favour the theory that the person - or persons - responsible for Claudia’s disappearance was someone - or several people - who were close to her. “It was either very well-planned or there was a huge element of luck to have got away with it, so far at least. “In my view they have probably been helped by the fact that those closely associated with Claudia have withheld key information.” The detective’s comments in 2016 spoke to the frustration of a case which had left his force with a black mark in its unsolved crimes column for years. His team had spent two years unearthing new leads and theories - the most significant of which was considering the possibility that whatever happened to Claudia did so on 18 March and not the next day. It is a theory supported by Clive Driscoll, who thinks it far more likely she came to harm overnight. “It could have all gone horribly sour the moment Claudia finished that phone call with her mum. From the time she finished that conversation… is, in my mind, where the focus should lie.” The alley search was carried out six years after Claudia vanished Claudia’s house was forensically re-examined using techniques not available to the original team. This turned up new fingerprints and DNA that remain unidentified to this day. Det Supt Malyn stressed the growing importance of the alley behind Claudia’s home and officers searched it on their hands and knees. He suggested if something had happened at the property overnight those responsible would have used the alley. The review team discovered some used bleach and brown hair dye in Claudia’s bathroom and that her hair straighteners were missing The review also unearthed additional CCTV images similar to that released by the original inquiry team of the man seen near Claudia’s home on the morning of 19 March. The new footage was shot by the same camera the previous evening and appeared “to show the same man in the same place”, Det Supt Malyn said. The man walks into Heworth Place and out of shot before reappearing about a minute later, stopping briefly while someone up ahead walks across the road. North Yorkshire Police said he remains a key person to trace. Finally, in 2014 - five years after Claudia disappeared - police made the first arrests. A house in North Shields on Tyneside was searched and a pub in Acomb in York had its cellar dug up. For reasons that remain unknown, Claudia’s phone had been traced to that area in the weeks before she vanished. A 59-year-old man was held on suspicion of murder and a 46-year-old man was held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Both were released later that year without charge. The following year, hopes were again raised when four local men, who drank in the Nag’s Head, were arrested on suspicion of murder. Then in March 2016, the Crown Prosecution Service abandoned proceedings, citing a lack of evidence. North Yorkshire Police said at the time the case had “ultimately been compromised by the reluctance of some, and refusal of others, to co-operate”. The Nag’s Head, now under new management, was a key focus in the case The final blow came in late 2018 when police announced that attempts to identify a suspect from DNA obtained from a cigarette butt in Claudia’s car had drawn a blank. It meant that the £1m inquiry had stalled again. Despite thousands of names and statements being recorded, despite hundreds of interviews and searches, police still lacked that crucial piece of information. Det Supt Malyn’s disappointment was clear. The North Shields house was searched by forensics officers “I am sure that there are some people who know, or who have very strong suspicions about what happened to Claudia. For whatever reason they have either refused to come forward, or have been economical with the truth. “I am left with the inescapable conclusion that this case could still be solved if only people were honest with us. The fact that they are not is agonising for Claudia’s family and they should be ashamed of themselves.” Claudia’s case is now in a “reactive phase”, meaning it will only be reviewed if new information comes to light. Mr Driscoll - who cracked the Stephen Lawrence case after numerous police failures - believes the unsolved crime would benefit from an independent review, perhaps by a different force. “With the utmost respect to North Yorkshire Police, the case could do with a fresh pair of eyes,” he says. “It might mean they have to say, ‘listen, this is a bit embarrassing’, but at least it might provide some answers as to what has happened to this poor girl.” The force’s reluctance to take part in interviews on the 10th anniversary of the case is a wasted opportunity for “one big push” to solve it, says Mr Holleran. “Ten years on and loyalties change. People may struggle to live with the knowledge they possess and cracks may form. “Anniversaries such as this are an ideal opportunity to bring people forward again and get Claudia’s name back in the public’s mind.” Det Supt Dai Malyn led the review into Claudia’s case The BBC asked North Yorkshire Police a series of questions about the points raised in this article on a number of occasions during its production. In response, the force provided a statement from Det Supt Malyn which said his review was led by a “gold group” of experts from around the country that maximised “every opportunity” to establish what happened to Claudia. He said detectives would continue to investigate any new information, adding: “North Yorkshire Police will never give up on Claudia and her family.” The past decade has proved an agonising time for those close to Claudia. Peter has gained comfort by helping others caught up in the aftermath of a loved one’s disappearance and has been appointed OBE for his work. He has successfully campaigned for Claudia’s Law, which allows families to manage a missing relative’s finances and property - including his daughter’s. Claudia’s friendship group has fragmented as they wrestle with the inconceivable idea the killer could be known to them. For Suzy, it has been particularly hard - she has become withdrawn and finds social situations almost impossible. “I have pushed people away. I suppose that way if I don’t get close to anyone they can’t leave me or disappear,” she says. A mother’s instinct keeps Joan going. She refuses to believe her daughter is dead because she has “no cut-off feeling”. “I get up in the morning and see what the weather is like. If it’s snowing, Claudia wouldn’t have liked it - she hated the cold. In the supermarket I see tulips, her favourite flowers. “You have to keep going. If I stay in bed all day looking at four walls, what good will that do? “I will not give up [hope]. One day I will find out what happened to my daughter.” Built with Shorthand"

US presses Kim Jong-un to keep his wordThe US says it expects Kim Jong-un to live up to his commitment on a nuclear test moratorium.,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo answers questions at the State Department US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he expects North Korea's leader will live up to his commitment not to resume nuclear and missile tests. Mr Pompeo said Kim Jong-un had promised US President Donald Trump in Vietnam that testing would not resume. His comments follow a suggestion by North Korean-Vice Foreign Minister Choe Sun-hui that denuclearisation talks might end and testing could resume. The US says sanctions will remain until Pyongyang destroys all nuclear sites. Mr Pompeo told reporters on Friday that ""on multiple occasions [Mr Kim] spoke directly to the president and made a commitment that he would not resume nuclear testing, nor would he resume missile testing"" during their February summit. ""That's Chairman Kim's word,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""We have every expectation that he will live up to that commitment."" Earlier, Ms Choe said US diplomats had thrown away ""a golden opportunity"" during the summit when North Korea offered to dismantle its main Yongbyon nuclear complex. Talks in Hanoi collapsed when Mr Trump refused to lift any sanctionsuntil North Korea was completely denuclearised. But Mr Pompeo said he is ""hopeful"" that discussions will continue. ""I saw the remarks [Ms Choe] made - she left open the possibility negotiations would continue. It's the administration's desire that we continue to have conversations around this."" North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, seen here during the Hanoi summit Ms Choe said in Pyongyang that Mr Kim would decide whether to stick to the launch and test moratorium, and she expects him to ""clarify his position"" soon. ""We have no intention to yield to the US demands in any form, nor are we willing to engage in negotiations of this kind,"" she told reporters in North Korea, Russia's state Tass news agency reported. She accused the US of taking a ""gangster-like"" stance,according to the Associated Press,external, but added that ""personal relations between the two supreme leaders are still good and the chemistry is mysteriously wonderful"". Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea crisis in 300 words Ms Choe said that North Korea's demand during the recent summit was for five key economic sanctions to be lifted, not all sanctions, as Mr Trump said after talks broke down. ""What is clear is that the US has thrown away a golden opportunity this time,"" she said. ""I'm not sure why the US came out with this different description. We never asked for the removal of sanctions in their entirety."" Mr Trump and Mr Pompeo clearly stated after last month's talks that North Korean officials had asked for full sanctions relief. ""It was all about the sanctions. They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" he said. In Washington this week, the US special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, said that diplomacy was ""still very much alive"", though he did not say if there had been any negotiations since the summit, or outline any plans for further talks. North Korea 'unlikely to abandon nukes' Are the rules which have stopped nuclear war broken? The two leaders first met in Singapore last year, in an unprecedented summit between a US sitting president and a North Korean leader. Their second meeting was in Hanoi in February. At a news conference after the second summit, Mr Trump said no plans had been made for a third summit, but he expressed optimism about a ""good outcome"" in the future. Laure Bicker, BBC Seoul correspondent So does this mean a return to ""fire and fury""? Not quite. North Korea's tactic might be to hope this will initiate a reaction from the US. Pyongyang is aware that Donald Trump has boasted about his ability to get Mr Kim to stop firing missiles and testing nuclear missiles. ""As long as there's no testing,"" said Mr Trump, ""I'm in no rush."" After the two leaders failed to secure a deal in Hanoi, and with economic sanctions still in place, North Korea might be trying to hurry the US president along and get him back to the table with a better deal. It is worth noting Choe Sun-hui still praised the personal relationship between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. So the door to diplomacy is still open. Instead she blamed Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton for hardening the US position. North Korea also has hardliners of its own, who may perceive Kim Jong-un's 120-hour train trip to Hanoi and back as a failure. This announcement lets them know, along with the Trump administration, that Mr Kim is standing firm. Are the rules which have stopped nuclear war broken?

New Zealand mosque shootings kill 49,"This video can not be played Christchurch was put into lockdown as events unfolded Forty-nine people have been killed and 48 wounded in shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in the nation's deadliest attack. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described it as a terrorist attack and one of New Zealand's ""darkest days"". A gunman identifying himself as an Australian live-streamed the rampage at Al Noor mosque to Facebook. He had espoused racist, anti-immigrant views. Police say a man in his late 20s has been arrested and charged with murder. Two other men and one woman were also detained. No names have been made public. Firearms and explosive devices were recovered, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. Follow our live updates Mosque attacks mapped What is known about the suspects? The gunman live-streaming the attack from a head-mounted camera said he was a 28-year-old Australian called Brenton Tarrant. The footage showed him firing at men, women and children from close range inside the Al Noor mosque. Facebook said it had removed the suspect's Facebook and Instagram accounts and was working to remove any copies of the footage. The live-stream of the attack lasted for 17 minutes. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern: ""This can only be described as a terrorist attack"" The suspect who was charged appeared to have published a document online outlining his intentions as well as details about the plan for the attack. He is due in court on Saturday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the man as an ""extremist, right-wing"" terrorist. New Zealand Police Commissioner Bush confirmed that the man had not been known in advance to either New Zealand or Australian security services. Witnesses 'prayed for end to bullets' What are New Zealand's gun laws? Agonising wait for victims' families Bangladesh cricket team escapes shooting The first report of an attack came from the Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch at 13:40 on Friday (00:40 GMT). A gunman drove to the front door, entered and fired indiscriminately for about five minutes. One unnamed survivor told TV New Zealand that he had seen the gunman shoot a man in the chest. The attacker reportedly targeted the men's prayer room in the mosque, then moved to the women's room. Social media's role in Christchurch attack UK mosque security under review ""What I did was basically just waiting and praying, God please, let this guy run out of bullets,"" the witness said. ""He came to this side, he shot this side, he went to another room and went to the ladies' section and shot them. I just heard one of the ladies has died."" Armed police patrolled the streets following the shooting at the Al Noor mosque The gunman is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to another mosque in the suburb of Linwood where the second shooting occurred. One witness described how one of the worshippers had managed to disarm the man,external, who ran to a waiting car outside. This video can not be played Eyewitness: ""My hands were shaking so hard"" It is not clear where the arrests were made. Police also defused ""a number of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] attached to vehicles"", Mr Bush said. Mr Bush said a number of firearms had been recovered from both mosques, and explosive devices were found in a car belonging to one of the suspects. Authorities advised all mosques in the city to shut down until further notice. This video can not be played Pictures on social media show an arrest being made after the New Zealand mosque shootings According to the latest census figures, Muslims make up about 1.1% of New Zealand's population of 4.25 million. Numbers rose sharply as New Zealand took in refugees from various war-torn countries since the 1990s. Social media accounts in the name of Brenton Tarrant were used to post a lengthy, racist document in which the author identified the mosques that were later attacked. The man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. The document is called ""The Great Replacement"" - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. Although New Zealand police said they had charged a man in his late 20s with murder, they did not identify the man. The attack happened as players from the visiting Bangladesh national cricket team were on their way to pray at Al Noor mosque. They were ""minutes"" from being inside, team manager Khaled Mashud told the BBC. Bangladesh was due to play New Zealand on Saturday but the match has been cancelled. He added that the team were all ""safe and sound"" at their hotel but would travel home ""in the coming days"". ""Players were crying in the bus, they all were mentally affected,"" the former wicketkeeper said. ""It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack,"" Prime Minister Ardern told reporters. In a tweet, she said: ""What has happened in Christchurch is an extraordinary act of unprecedented violence. It has no place in New Zealand.

New Zealand in shock after worst-ever shooting,"Brenton Tarrant, 28, appeared in court on Saturday in relation to the mosque attacks The main suspect in the killings of 49 people in shootings at two mosques in New Zealand on Friday has appeared in court on a single murder charge. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, was brought to the dock in a white prison shirt and handcuffs. Further charges are expected to be made against him. PM Jacinda Ardern said Mr Tarrant had a firearms licence and owned five guns, adding: ""Our gun laws will change."" Two others are in custody. None of those detained had a criminal record. Mr Tarrant was described by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as an ""extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist"". The suspect, who stood silently during the brief hearing in Christchurch, was remanded in custody without a plea and is due to appear in court again on 5 April. The court judge ruled that the suspect's face should be pixellated in photographs and filming to preserve his fair trial rights. Reaction to the attacks How attacks unfolded The victims and missing Ms Ardern called the attack ""an act of terror"", and officials are still carrying out the identification of the victims. Ms Ardern said the guns used by the attacker appeared to have been modified, and that the suspect's car was full of weapons, suggesting ""his intention to continue with his attack"". Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, she said the suspect had obtained a gun licence in November 2017 that allowed him to buy the weapons used in the attack. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern: NZ ""gun laws will change... now is the time"" ""The mere fact... that this individual had acquired a gun licence and acquired weapons of that range, then obviously I think people will be seeking change, and I'm committing to that."" New Zealand's Attorney-General David Parker said the government would look into banning semi-automatic weapons, but that no final decision had been made. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws in a country with a strong gun lobby and culture of hunting have failed. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Christchurch All day on Saturday the people of Christchurch have been turning out to show their rejection of the hate that inspired Friday's horrific attacks. In ones and twos and in family groups, people have been coming by the hundred to a makeshift memorial set up on the edge of Hagley Park. Outside the two mosques that were attacked, people have been laying more flowers. Many have left hand-written notes. ""This is not New Zealand,"" one read. At one point a group of young men started quietly singing a traditional Maori song, their heads bowed, eyes closed. The mayor of Christchurch said the killer had come to the city with hate in his heart, to perform an act of terrorism. But she said he did not represent anything about the city. Still, there are lots of uncomfortable questions for the authorities here. The man now in custody, Brenton Tarrant, made no secret of his support for white supremacy. He had reportedly been planning the attacks for months. And yet he was not on any police watch list. He did not have any trouble getting a gun licence, nor in buying a collection of high-powered weapons. This video can not be played Linwood imam: We still love this country The suspect had ""travelled around the world with sporadic periods of time spent in New Zealand,"" Ms Ardern said, without formally identifying him. She said New Zealand intelligence services had been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists, but added: ""The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community nor the police for extremism."" More about the suspects Witnesses 'prayed for end to bullets' Before the attacks, social media accounts in the name of Brenton Tarrant were used to post a lengthy, racist document in which the author identified the mosques that were later attacked. The text is called The Great Replacement, a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. The man said he had began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. The suspect sent the document to 70 people,external, including to Ms Ardern's generic address, less than 10 minutes before the attack, the New Zealand Herald reports. The minimum legal age to own a gun is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons All gun owners must have a licence but most individual weapons do not have to be registered, one of the few countries where this is the case Applicants for a firearms licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records Once a licence has been issued, gun owners can buy as many weapons as they want More on the country's gun laws Relatives and friends have confirmed the identities of several victims, including: Daoud Nabi, 71, who is believed to have thrown himself in front of other people in the mosque to protect them Khaled Mustafa, a refugee from the war in Syria Hosne Ara, 42, killed while searching for her husband who uses a wheelchair - he survived Pakistan's foreign ministry named six of its nationals who were killed,external, and said another three missing were still being identified. Ms Ardern said financial support would be made available to those who had lost someone on whom they were financially dependent. A total of 48 people were wounded and 11 are said to be in a critical condition in hospital. Omar Nabi holds a phone with a picture of his father Daoud outside the court building Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel expressed ""revulsion"" at this ""act of terrorism"", saying: ""We have welcomed new people into our city. They're our friends, they're our neighbours."" Muslims make up about 1.1% of New Zealand's population of 4.25 million, according to the latest census figures. Numbers rose sharply as the country took in refugees from various war-torn countries since the 1990s. The first report of an attack came from the Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch during Friday prayers at 13:40 (00:40 GMT). A gunman drove to the mosque, parked nearby and began firing into the mosque as he walked in through the front entrance. He fired on men, women and children inside for about five minutes. He live-streamed the attack from a head-mounted camera and identified himself in the footage. Social media's role in attack Anger and solidarity at UK gathering The suspect is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to another mosque in the suburb of Linwood where the second shooting occurred. Police say they recovered firearms from both mosques, and explosive devices were found in a car belonging to one of the suspects.

Avalanche survivor's tribute to friends,"Mathieu Biselx, second from right, with his friends who he has paid tribute to A climber has paid tribute to his three friends who died following an avalanche in Ben Nevis on Tuesday. Mathieu Biselx, 30, from Switzerland, was the sole survivor of the slide in Number 5 Gully on the mountain, near Fort William. Two Frenchmen and a climber from Switzerland died. In a post on social media, Mr Biselx, who was injured, said: ""Raph, CÃ©dric and Adrien. Thank you for your friendship."" He thanked his friends for their inspiration and said that he and others were ""all here"" for the men's families. Mr Biselx ended his tribute to his friends with: ""I will carry you in my heart forever."" Mr Biselx, who has been receiving treatment in hospital in Glasgow, is the president of the Sion section of the Swiss Alpine Club. His companions were also club members. The avalanche is understood to have happened above the climbers. Winter 'back with a vengeance' Swiss and French climbers died in avalanche Third person dead after Ben Nevis avalanche A huge rescue operation was mounted involving Lochaber and Glencoe mountain rescue teams, Coastguard helicopter crews, military personnel, police and the ambulance service. Paul Boggis, a mountaineering instructor, was among climbers in the area who helped to carry the climbers from the scene of the accident. He said one of his clients had heard what they thought were shouts for help. Soon after, people could be seen heading for an area below Number 5 Gully, and then a Coastguard helicopter appeared close by. Mountain rescue teams, the coastguard, police and ambulance service were involved in the rescue effort Mr Boggis did not go with his clients to the slope beneath the gully for fear of further avalanches, and instead went for where a group of people had gathered around a casualty below the slope. He told BBC Scotland: ""We asked if we could help and we were asked if we could help with that casualty. ""The others had transceivers (emergency locator beacons), we didn't have transceivers, and they headed for the snow slope in the firing line of Number 5 Gully. ""So there were some very brave people on the scene who were helping the casualties."" Mr Boggis did his best to make the casualty he was with comfortable, before he and his two clients helped to carry him from the scene.

DUP in talks with ministers over Brexit deal,"The DUP say Brexit talks have ""enlarged and intensified"" in the past week Ministers have held talks with the Democratic Unionists to try to get them to back Theresa May's Brexit deal ahead of a third Commons vote on the package. The DUP are seeking further legal assurances about the deal, which has been decisively rejected by MPs twice. The PM has received a boost after Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet over Brexit policy last year,signalled she could vote for the deal next week. She said the prospect of a long Brexit delay called for ""different thinking"". MPs voted on Thursday to ask the EU to push the date of Brexit back from 29 March to 30 June if the Commons approves a deal by next Wednesday - allowing time for legislation to go through. However, if a deal is not agreed by then, EU leaders are contemplating a much longer delay. Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Does the UK need to hold European elections? Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay voted against the extension, despite saying in the Commons that voting for it would be in the ""national interest"". He told the BBC he would back a short extension to give time for legislation, but not a longer delay. ""If we don't have a deal, then we should leave with no deal,"" he said. ""That's always been my position. We shouldn't be afraid to leave with no deal."" This video can not be played Barclay: ""I'm proud we stopped attempt to frustrate Brexit"" The result prompted a number of Tory MPs to say they will back the deal in the next vote, due to take place by 20 March. And the DUP, which has opposed the deal up to now, are seeking further ""clarifications"" on the government's legal advice about the backstop - the controversial arrangement to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - and how the UK could exit it. MPs took part in a series of votes in the Commons A series of Brexit votes have taken place in the Commons: On Tuesday,MPs rejected Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for a second timeby 149 votes On Wednesday, MPs voted toreject the idea of the UK leaving the EU without a dealunder any circumstances Then, on Thursday, the Commonsvoted by 413 to 202 to seek an extension to Article 50- the legal mechanism by which the UK is due to leave the EU However, as things stand, the law has not been changed, as Wednesday and Thursday's votes were not legally binding. That means the UK is still set to leave on 29 March - with or without a deal. This video can not be played Political Correspondent Jonathan Blake explains what's next for Brexit While legally, there does not have to be a delay, politically it might be hard for Mrs May to avoid. Thursday's motion saw Parliament agree to two options for a delay: If MPs support Mrs May's deal next week - before a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on 21 March - then she will ask the EU for an extension of no later than 30 June But if they don't support her deal for a third time, there could be a much longer delay and the UK may have to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May Any delay will require the agreement of all other 27 EU members and talks about possible conditions could take place before the summit. European Council President Donald Tusk said EU leaderscould be open to a long extension""if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy"". David Lidington calls on MPs to ""reflect"" on the deal over the weekend Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who is regarded as Mrs May's de facto deputy, told the BBC that, although the risk of the UK leaving without a deal had ""diminished"" as a result of this week's votes, it could still happen unless an alternative solution was found. He urged MPs to ""reflect"" over the weekend on the deal on the table, which he said had the ""great virtue"" of having the backing of all 27 other EU governments and, most likely, the European Parliament too. ""I think there is some real impatience among the British public, and frankly among other EU governments, with this inability to agree in Westminster on the way forward,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The alternative, spelt out very clearly and accepted by the House of Commons, is that you don't just have a short technical extension to our membership. You almost certainly need a significantly longer one."" EU politicians breathe deep, shuddering sighs at the thought of prolonging the cross-Channel agony of the Brexit process. So will they or won't they agree to an extension? What conditions could they demand and how long would Brexit be delayed by? Like so many things to do with Brexit - the answer is: we're not 100% certain. Earlier this week, a number of EU leaders including France's Emmanuel Macron, Mark Rutte of the Netherlands and Spain's Pedro Sanchez sounded pretty hard-line. They wouldn't agree to delay Brexit, they said, unless the prime minister came up with a very good reason. EU leaders are frustrated, irritated and fatigued by the Brexit process but it's also worth bearing in mind that they have two specific audiences in mind these days when they take to the cameras. Read more from Katya? There are a range of views across the Commons on Brexit This remains unclear. Mrs May brought back additions to her deal after late night talks in Strasbourg on Monday to try and allay fears about the Irish backstop - the insurance policy to stop a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - as this had been the main sticking point when her deal was voted down the first time. Tuesday's vote showed that some critics had been won over, but while the PM was not defeated by such an historic margin as she was in January - 230 votes - she still lost by a significant margin. Kuenssberg: March Brexit almost certainly out of reach Now it is a case of persuading Brexiteer backbenchers in the European Research Group and the Democratic Unionist Party, as well as trying to win over members of the opposition. Some MPs have suggested looking into whether the backstop could be solvedby using Article 62 of the Vienna Convention- which would allow the UK to withdraw from any treaty if there had been ""a fundamental change of circumstances... which was not foreseen by the parties"". In a letter to the Times, cross-bench peer and QC Lord Pannick said the UK would be ""entitled to terminate the withdrawal agreement"" under this clause - although he questioned whether it would be ""wise politically"". Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said the government's Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, had considered the matter and would comment further if he thought it was necessary. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Public vote an ""option to break deadlock"" The past week's votes have exposed divisions in the main parties. More than half of Tory MPs - including seven cabinet ministers - voted against Mrs May's motion to put back the date when Britain leaves the EU. Downing Street said this was a ""natural consequence"" of Mrs May's decision to offer a free vote on an issue where there are ""strong views on all sides of the debate"". And in the Labour Party, 41 MPs rebelled against party orders on Thursday to abstain in a vote on a possible new referendum - with 24 supporting a referendum and 17 voting to oppose one. Five of those MPs haveresigned from their roles in the party as a result. Shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner said Thursday's vote was about securing an extension to negotiations and was not the right time to vote for another referendum. ""If it's the only way we can stop a no deal or a bad deal, then that is when it comes into play,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Gina Miller, who took the government to court to force them to consult Parliament on the Brexit process, also told the programme she did not believe Thursday was the right time to push for another referendum - but insisted the option was not off the table, despite being heavily defeated by MPs. ""You have to try and exhaust all the other options first and if parliament can't resolve it, it's at that point that it goes back to the people,"" she said.

McVey hints at backing for deal,"This video can not be played McVey: ""People will have to vote for deal if they want Brexit"" Tory Brexiteer Esther McVey has hinted she will back Theresa May's EU deal next week, despite voting against it both times it came to the Commons. She resigned from cabinet in November over the deal, saying it did not ""honour the result of the referendum"". But speaking to Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, she said Leave-backing MPs will ""have to think a different way"" for the next vote. She also called for ministers who voted against the government to be sacked. Ms McVey accused her successor as Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, Justice Secretary David Gauke, and Business Secretary Greg Clark of ""destroying democracy"" and ""ripping up the rule books"" by defying the three-line whip on votes this week. DUP in talks with ministers over Brexit deal Will EU leaders agree to extending Brexit? Brexit delay: What just happened? Asked by Nick Robinson if MPs like her would ""hold their noses and vote"" for Mrs May's deal - which is expected to return to the Commons next week - Ms McVey said: ""Yes. They will. I don't know what the number is, but they will have to do that if they... want Brexit."" She accused the government of ""running down the clock"" and said Parliament had ""given away all of its leverage"" by voting to rule out leaving the EU without a deal. This video can not be played How MPs rejected a no-deal Brexit ""The [situation] now is people will have to take a bad deal rather than no deal,"" she said. Ms McVey said the prime minister had ""broken"" her promises to MPs over her red lines and, as a result, ""people are going to have to think a different way next week"". She said that although she had decided which way she would vote next week, she would not say. But pushed further by Nick Robinson, who asked if there was a chance she may be forced to, she said: ""Yes."" The Tory MP also criticised her former cabinet colleagues, who had either voted against the government or abstained on votes earlier this week over ruling out a no-deal Brexit. She said there was an ""an emboldened Remain cabinet... who now doesn't even adhere to collective responsibility [and] who can sit as bold as brass on the front bench and not vote with a three-lined whip"". Asked if they should be sacked, Ms McVey said: ""Of course you can't stay in a government. You can't rip up the rulebook. You are destroying democracy [and] destroying trust with the public.""

US presses Kim Jong-un to keep his wordThe US says it expects Kim Jong-un to live up to his commitment on a nuclear test moratorium.US & Canada,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo answers questions at the State Department US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he expects North Korea's leader will live up to his commitment not to resume nuclear and missile tests. Mr Pompeo said Kim Jong-un had promised US President Donald Trump in Vietnam that testing would not resume. His comments follow a suggestion by North Korean-Vice Foreign Minister Choe Sun-hui that denuclearisation talks might end and testing could resume. The US says sanctions will remain until Pyongyang destroys all nuclear sites. Mr Pompeo told reporters on Friday that ""on multiple occasions [Mr Kim] spoke directly to the president and made a commitment that he would not resume nuclear testing, nor would he resume missile testing"" during their February summit. ""That's Chairman Kim's word,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""We have every expectation that he will live up to that commitment."" Earlier, Ms Choe said US diplomats had thrown away ""a golden opportunity"" during the summit when North Korea offered to dismantle its main Yongbyon nuclear complex. Talks in Hanoi collapsed when Mr Trump refused to lift any sanctionsuntil North Korea was completely denuclearised. But Mr Pompeo said he is ""hopeful"" that discussions will continue. ""I saw the remarks [Ms Choe] made - she left open the possibility negotiations would continue. It's the administration's desire that we continue to have conversations around this."" North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, seen here during the Hanoi summit Ms Choe said in Pyongyang that Mr Kim would decide whether to stick to the launch and test moratorium, and she expects him to ""clarify his position"" soon. ""We have no intention to yield to the US demands in any form, nor are we willing to engage in negotiations of this kind,"" she told reporters in North Korea, Russia's state Tass news agency reported. She accused the US of taking a ""gangster-like"" stance,according to the Associated Press,external, but added that ""personal relations between the two supreme leaders are still good and the chemistry is mysteriously wonderful"". Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea crisis in 300 words Ms Choe said that North Korea's demand during the recent summit was for five key economic sanctions to be lifted, not all sanctions, as Mr Trump said after talks broke down. ""What is clear is that the US has thrown away a golden opportunity this time,"" she said. ""I'm not sure why the US came out with this different description. We never asked for the removal of sanctions in their entirety."" Mr Trump and Mr Pompeo clearly stated after last month's talks that North Korean officials had asked for full sanctions relief. ""It was all about the sanctions. They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" he said. In Washington this week, the US special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, said that diplomacy was ""still very much alive"", though he did not say if there had been any negotiations since the summit, or outline any plans for further talks. North Korea 'unlikely to abandon nukes' Are the rules which have stopped nuclear war broken? The two leaders first met in Singapore last year, in an unprecedented summit between a US sitting president and a North Korean leader. Their second meeting was in Hanoi in February. At a news conference after the second summit, Mr Trump said no plans had been made for a third summit, but he expressed optimism about a ""good outcome"" in the future. Laure Bicker, BBC Seoul correspondent So does this mean a return to ""fire and fury""? Not quite. North Korea's tactic might be to hope this will initiate a reaction from the US. Pyongyang is aware that Donald Trump has boasted about his ability to get Mr Kim to stop firing missiles and testing nuclear missiles. ""As long as there's no testing,"" said Mr Trump, ""I'm in no rush."" After the two leaders failed to secure a deal in Hanoi, and with economic sanctions still in place, North Korea might be trying to hurry the US president along and get him back to the table with a better deal. It is worth noting Choe Sun-hui still praised the personal relationship between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. So the door to diplomacy is still open. Instead she blamed Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton for hardening the US position. North Korea also has hardliners of its own, who may perceive Kim Jong-un's 120-hour train trip to Hanoi and back as a failure. This announcement lets them know, along with the Trump administration, that Mr Kim is standing firm. Are the rules which have stopped nuclear war broken?

"Final Hatton Garden raider convictedAlarm specialist Michael Seed had denied being the mysterious ""Basil"" in the 2015 safe deposit raid.","Michael Seed's lawyers denied he was the mystery raider known as ""Basil"" The last suspect in the Hatton Garden heist has been found guilty of conspiracy to burgle. Michael Seed, 58, from Islington, nick-named ""Basil"", played a key role in the Â£14m safe deposit raid in 2015. Seed, an alarm specialist who denied the charges, was also found guilty of conspiring to hide the proceeds. He was jailed for 10 years for the burglary and eight years for the second charge, with the terms to run concurrently. Jurors at Woolwich Crown Court had been deliberating for more than a week and returned a majority verdict earlier of 10-2 on the first charge. The convictions come four years afterthe infamous heist. Seed became known as 'Basil' in the Hatton Garden gang Seed is believed to have let himself in to the building in London's diamond district using a set of keys. He was one of two men who climbed into the vault to loot 73 safe deposit boxes after the gang of ageing criminals drilled through the thick concrete wall during the 2015 Easter bank holiday weekend. Seed, who pays no taxes, claims no benefits and rarely uses a bank account, evaded capture for three years. Police raided his flat, in Islington, north London, located about two miles away from Hatton Garden, on 27 March last year. The electronics expert told a jury at Woolwich Crown Court he was not the man nicknamed ""Basil"" by the rest of the gang. But jurors returned a unanimous guilty verdict for the second charge of conspiracy to handle the proceeds after Â£143,000 worth of gold ingots, gems and jewellery was found in his bedroom. Seed is believed to have been melting down gold and breaking up jewellery on his bedroom workbench. This video can not be played The final member of gang that carried out the Hatton Garden heist has been found guilty He was cleared of conspiracy to burgle the high-end Chatila jewellery store in Bond Street over the late August bank holiday weekend in 2010 with members of the same gang. Prosecutors had alleged he posed as a BT engineer to tamper with the security system before the burglary, then used a 2G mobile phone jammer to block the alarm signal. On that occasion, thieves failed to drill into a safe containing Â£40 million worth of gems but made off with Â£1 million worth of jewellery from the shop's display cabinets. Hatton Garden gang ordered to pay Â£27.5m Who's who of the Hatton Garden gang Raiders may have dodged alarm with cloaks The jury of six men and six women deliberated for 35 hours and 35 minutes before returning their verdicts. Seed previously told the court he could have been on a family holiday in Cornwall or visiting his elderly mother, in Cambridge, at the time of the Hatton Garden burglary and told jurors he had never been known as Basil. Clockwise from top left Brian Reader, John Collins, Daniel Jones and Terry Perkins were described as the ringleaders of the heist His fellow Hatton Garden raiders Brian Reader, 80, John ""Kenny"" Collins, 78, Daniel Jones, 64, and Terry Perkins, whodied in prison last year aged 69, were all jailed in 2016. Collins and Reader are already out of prison but face going back to jail if they fail to pay back more than Â£6.5m of the proceeds police believe could still be under their control. Detectives believe the gang could have been operating undetected for decades before they were caught, but cannot link them to any other crimes. The Met Police released surveillance images of Seed with fellow raider John Collins The son of a university professor, Seed gained A-levels in physics, chemistry, maths and geology at a secondary modern school outside Cambridge. He then worked in an electronics factory making parts for submarine detectors. ""I have always had an interest in electronics"", Seed told jurors. ""It was a passion of mine."" He went on to study physics and electronics at Nottingham University, where he ""enjoyed recreational drugs"" and ""used to take LSD every weekend"" before his one previous run-in with the law. In 1984, aged 24, Seed was handed a three-year prison sentence for supplying controlled drugs of Class A and Class B after selling 10 LSD tablets and some cannabis to a friend. He was released after serving 21 months and moved into the one-bedroom council flat in Islington where he lived up until his arrest.

Avalanche survivor's tribute to friendsMathieu Biselx's three climbing companions died following the slide in a gully on Ben Nevis on Tuesday.,"Mathieu Biselx, second from right, with his friends who he has paid tribute to A climber has paid tribute to his three friends who died following an avalanche in Ben Nevis on Tuesday. Mathieu Biselx, 30, from Switzerland, was the sole survivor of the slide in Number 5 Gully on the mountain, near Fort William. Two Frenchmen and a climber from Switzerland died. In a post on social media, Mr Biselx, who was injured, said: ""Raph, CÃ©dric and Adrien. Thank you for your friendship."" He thanked his friends for their inspiration and said that he and others were ""all here"" for the men's families. Mr Biselx ended his tribute to his friends with: ""I will carry you in my heart forever."" Mr Biselx, who has been receiving treatment in hospital in Glasgow, is the president of the Sion section of the Swiss Alpine Club. His companions were also club members. The avalanche is understood to have happened above the climbers. Winter 'back with a vengeance' Swiss and French climbers died in avalanche Third person dead after Ben Nevis avalanche A huge rescue operation was mounted involving Lochaber and Glencoe mountain rescue teams, Coastguard helicopter crews, military personnel, police and the ambulance service. Paul Boggis, a mountaineering instructor, was among climbers in the area who helped to carry the climbers from the scene of the accident. He said one of his clients had heard what they thought were shouts for help. Soon after, people could be seen heading for an area below Number 5 Gully, and then a Coastguard helicopter appeared close by. Mountain rescue teams, the coastguard, police and ambulance service were involved in the rescue effort Mr Boggis did not go with his clients to the slope beneath the gully for fear of further avalanches, and instead went for where a group of people had gathered around a casualty below the slope. He told BBC Scotland: ""We asked if we could help and we were asked if we could help with that casualty. ""The others had transceivers (emergency locator beacons), we didn't have transceivers, and they headed for the snow slope in the firing line of Number 5 Gully. ""So there were some very brave people on the scene who were helping the casualties."" Mr Boggis did his best to make the casualty he was with comfortable, before he and his two clients helped to carry him from the scene.

UK outsourcer Interserve loses rescue vote,"Interserve has a cleaning contract for Network Rail stations Control of one of Britain's biggest government contractors, Interserve, has moved to a new company after administrators were appointed. It comes after shareholders rejected a rescue deal for the company, which has 45,000 UK staff, and 68,000 globally. Under a pre-arranged agreement, administrators EY were installed and the assets moved immediately to a group controlled by Interserve's lenders. Interserve insisted that the deal would protect services and jobs. The company cleans schools and hospitals, runs catering and probation services, and manages construction projects. On Friday,shareholders voted 59.38% against a rescue plan to address Interserve's mounting debt pile.,external The plan would have seen their stake reduced to just 5%, with lenders being handed the lion's share of the business. But after the vote, Interserve said that ""in the absence of any viable alternative"" rescue plan it would formally apply to the High Court to go into administration. EY was appointed under a so-called pre-pack administration, an insolvency procedure in which a company arranges to move its assets to a another owner before administrators are officially appointed. It meant that Interserve could avoid a Carillion-style collapse. However, investors have seen the value of their shares wiped out under the financial restructuring. The lenders who are now in control of Interserve Group include banks RBS and HSBC, and investors Emerald Asset Management and Davidson Kempner Capital. In a statement, EY administrator Hunter Kelly said: ""This transaction secured the jobs of 68,000 employees, the majority of whom work in the UK, as well as ensuring there was no disruption to the vital public services that Interserve provides to the UK Government."" Debbie White, chief executive of Interserve Group, said: ""Interserve is fundamentally a strong business and with a competitive financial platform in place we see significant opportunities ahead as a best-in-class partner to the public and private sector."" A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ""We welcome this announcement. It brings the company the stability required for it to compete for future business and continue to deliver good value public services for the taxpayer."" Interserve accumulated debt after construction project delays and a failed energy-from-waste project in Derby and Glasgow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, the GMB union said earlier on Friday that Interserve's problems, which come after the failure of Carillion last year, showed it was ""time to turn the tide on the disastrous experiment"" of outsourcing public services. Kevin Brandstatter, the union's national officer, said: ""Ministers have learnt absolutely nothing from the Carillion fiasco and are hell-bent on outsourcing public sector contracts. ""Shambolic mismanagement is putting jobs put on the line and services in jeopardy. Our public services can't go on like this."" Although Interserve's contracts are expected to continue, there is still concern for jobs in the supply chain. The National Federation of Builders (NFB) said there would be thousands of workers wondering whether they still have a job, and called for changes in the way the government hands out contracts to big national companies. Richard Beresford, chief executive of the NFB, said it was time to reform ""the procurement process from its foundations to ensure that more regional contractors can compete and win work"". In addition to helping smaller companies, it would ""spread risk across fiscally responsible businesses who reinvest profits and are not bound by shareholders,"" he said. The outsourcing firm is one of the UK's largest public services providers.  The firm started in dredging and construction, and from there has diversified into a wide range of services, such as healthcare and catering, for clients in government and industry. It sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects. Interserve is the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5's Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. Hospital contracts include a a Â£35m contract at King George Hospital in east London for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance.

What is known about suspects?,"Police officers stand guard near the scene of the deadly shooting in New Zealand The Christchurch mosque attacks were live-streamed on the internet by a man posting online under the name Brenton Tarrant. He said he was Australian. Distressing footage shows him firing indiscriminately at men, women and children at close range inside the Al Noor mosque on Friday. The individual had previously posted a rambling and expletive-filled document, espousing violent right-wing ideology. Reaction to the attacks A day later, the 28 year old appeared in court in Christchurch, charged with murder. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect had ""travelled around the world with sporadic periods of time spent in New Zealand"" and that he was currently living in Dunedin, south of Christchurch. ""I would not describe him as a long-term resident,"" she said ""The offender was in possession of a gun licence. I'm advised that this was acquired in November of 2017."" She said New Zealand intelligence services had been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists, but added: ""The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community nor the police for extremism."" Brenton Tarrant appeared in court in Christchurch in a white prison uniform. He was remanded in custody, with no bail application made. State-appointed lawyer Richard Peters says the defendant fired him and wanted to represent himself. ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability,"" Mr Peters said. ""He seemed to understand what was going on."" The man in the footage equipped himself with what appears to be a head-mounted camera to live-stream the attack in central Christchurch. The streams were broadcast online, including briefly on Facebook, showing the violence in graphic detail. A song which played in the suspect's car is known as a marching anthem for Serbian nationalist paramilitary units known as Chetniks during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. It praises Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted of genocide and war crimes. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack The names of men convicted of killing Muslims and migrants are written on the suspect's weaponry. One item has the words ""For Rotherham"" written on it, a reference to a child abuse scandal in the UK, while other wording references historical battles between European countries and the Ottoman Empire. Australian media reported that Brenton Tarrant was originally from Grafton, a town 600km (370 miles) north of Sydney, and had previously worked at a fitness facility. ""He never showed any extremist views or any crazy behaviour,""his former boss, Tracey Gray, told Seven News,external. The 16,500-word document he posted is entitled The Great Replacement - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. In it, the man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. This video can not be played New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern: 'This can only be described as a terrorist attack' Specifically, he referencesa lorry attack carried out by an Islamic State sympathiser in Sweden, France's decision to elect the moderate Emmanuel Macron as president, and ethnic diversity in France. Despite insisting that he is not motivated by fame, he acknowledges that he intends to survive the attack, and hopes it will spread fear. He chose the Al Noor mosque as his target three months ago, the document says. The central tenet of the conspiracy is that ""European peoples"" are dying out and being ""replaced"" by immigrants with a different, inferior and dangerous culture, says the BBC's Dominic Casciani. This is basically a code for hatred or fear of Muslims - part of the theory is that states and corporations are encouraging ""white genocide"" by pushing up immigration rates to keep global capitalism going, says our correspondent. Brenton Tarrant has travelled frequently, venturing to North Korea, Europe, Turkey and Pakistan. Bulgarian prosecutor general Sotir Tsatsarov said he visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia in 2016, stopping at historic battle sites in the area. He returned to Eastern Europe in November 2018 where he saw more historic sites in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Mr Tsatsarov said Bulgaria is now investigating whether he had ties with people in the country. Brenton Tarrant travelled extensively, but grew up in the Australian town of Grafton Turkish officials have confirmed he visited Turkey several times, and reportedly said an investigation was under way into his ""movements and contacts within the country"". A hotel owner in the far-north of Pakistan told the BBC that Brenton Tarrant had spent two nights in the area in October 2018. Syed Israr Hussain, who runs the Osho Thang hotel, said Tarrant expressed no visible hostility to Muslims or Islam. He said he was travelling alone and ""walked around the local area"" taking pictures like any other tourist. The area is popular with trekkers. A now deleted post on Mr Hussain's social media account from last October is attributed to Brenton Tarrant and reads: ""Pakistan is an incredible place filled with the most earnest kind hearted and hospitable people in the world."" Mr Hussain said Brenton Tarrant left those comments ""for the world to see"". He added he was ""shocked"" by the attack in Christchurch. There are also reports that Tarrant visited Afghanistan and China's Xinjiang region. Four people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack - three men and a woman, who was subsequently released without charge. Police say they do not believe they were connected to the attack. Of those, two remain in custody: a man who apparently went to help carrying a rifle, who has been charged with a firearms offence an 18-year-old, who appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream Prime Minister Ardern said none of those in custody had been on active security watch lists in New Zealand or Australia. This video can not be played Eyewitnesses have reported running for their lives to escape a shooter. ""I have asked our agencies this morning to work swiftly on assessing whether there was any activity on social media or otherwise, that should have triggered a response,"" the prime minister said.

Six firearms officers had gone to a block of flats in Wheeleys Lane, Lee Bank, to carry out an arrest when the shooting happened at about 05:00 GMT. The man - in his 50s - died at the scene, West Midlands Police said. The police watchdog said it was reviewing officers' bodycam footage, which it believed had captured the shooting. Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: ""My understanding at this stage is it has captured everything that took place during the incident - including the shot - that's my understanding. ""We are viewing the footage to see what takes place."" Mr Campbell said officers had been carrying out the execution of a warrant to ""try and arrest the individual"". ""They notified my office just before 6am that an officer had discharged their weapon and someone had been shot,"" he said. ""My team deployed to the scene. By that time the person had died at the scene."" A team of six firearms officers were executing the warrant on the building's fourth floor. IOPC staff visited the scene as part of their investigation Mr Campbell said it was carrying out a ""thorough"" investigation and forensic material was being taken and analysed. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called at 05:04 and found a man in cardiac arrest. ""CPR was already being performed, which ambulance staff took over and also administered advanced life support,"" a spokesman said. ""However, despite everyone's best efforts it sadly became apparent nothing could be done to save him.""

India, South Korea, Australia and the US are among the countries where teenagers are already on strike. The day of action is expected to embrace about 100 countries. They are inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who protests weekly outside Sweden's parliament. Scientists say tougher measures are needed to cut global warming. The Paris climate agreement of 2017 committed nearly 200 countries to keeping global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and to striving for a maximum of 1.5C.

Final Hatton Garden raider convicted,"Michael Seed's lawyers denied he was the mystery raider known as ""Basil"" The last suspect in the Hatton Garden heist has been found guilty of conspiracy to burgle. Michael Seed, 58, from Islington, nick-named ""Basil"", played a key role in the Â£14m safe deposit raid in 2015. Seed, an alarm specialist who denied the charges, was also found guilty of conspiring to hide the proceeds. He was jailed for 10 years for the burglary and eight years for the second charge, with the terms to run concurrently. Jurors at Woolwich Crown Court had been deliberating for more than a week and returned a majority verdict earlier of 10-2 on the first charge. The convictions come four years afterthe infamous heist. Seed became known as 'Basil' in the Hatton Garden gang Seed is believed to have let himself in to the building in London's diamond district using a set of keys. He was one of two men who climbed into the vault to loot 73 safe deposit boxes after the gang of ageing criminals drilled through the thick concrete wall during the 2015 Easter bank holiday weekend. Seed, who pays no taxes, claims no benefits and rarely uses a bank account, evaded capture for three years. Police raided his flat, in Islington, north London, located about two miles away from Hatton Garden, on 27 March last year. The electronics expert told a jury at Woolwich Crown Court he was not the man nicknamed ""Basil"" by the rest of the gang. But jurors returned a unanimous guilty verdict for the second charge of conspiracy to handle the proceeds after Â£143,000 worth of gold ingots, gems and jewellery was found in his bedroom. Seed is believed to have been melting down gold and breaking up jewellery on his bedroom workbench. This video can not be played The final member of gang that carried out the Hatton Garden heist has been found guilty He was cleared of conspiracy to burgle the high-end Chatila jewellery store in Bond Street over the late August bank holiday weekend in 2010 with members of the same gang. Prosecutors had alleged he posed as a BT engineer to tamper with the security system before the burglary, then used a 2G mobile phone jammer to block the alarm signal. On that occasion, thieves failed to drill into a safe containing Â£40 million worth of gems but made off with Â£1 million worth of jewellery from the shop's display cabinets. Hatton Garden gang ordered to pay Â£27.5m Who's who of the Hatton Garden gang Raiders may have dodged alarm with cloaks The jury of six men and six women deliberated for 35 hours and 35 minutes before returning their verdicts. Seed previously told the court he could have been on a family holiday in Cornwall or visiting his elderly mother, in Cambridge, at the time of the Hatton Garden burglary and told jurors he had never been known as Basil. Clockwise from top left Brian Reader, John Collins, Daniel Jones and Terry Perkins were described as the ringleaders of the heist His fellow Hatton Garden raiders Brian Reader, 80, John ""Kenny"" Collins, 78, Daniel Jones, 64, and Terry Perkins, whodied in prison last year aged 69, were all jailed in 2016. Collins and Reader are already out of prison but face going back to jail if they fail to pay back more than Â£6.5m of the proceeds police believe could still be under their control. Detectives believe the gang could have been operating undetected for decades before they were caught, but cannot link them to any other crimes. The Met Police released surveillance images of Seed with fellow raider John Collins The son of a university professor, Seed gained A-levels in physics, chemistry, maths and geology at a secondary modern school outside Cambridge. He then worked in an electronics factory making parts for submarine detectors. ""I have always had an interest in electronics"", Seed told jurors. ""It was a passion of mine."" He went on to study physics and electronics at Nottingham University, where he ""enjoyed recreational drugs"" and ""used to take LSD every weekend"" before his one previous run-in with the law. In 1984, aged 24, Seed was handed a three-year prison sentence for supplying controlled drugs of Class A and Class B after selling 10 LSD tablets and some cannabis to a friend. He was released after serving 21 months and moved into the one-bedroom council flat in Islington where he lived up until his arrest.

Social media's role,"This video can not be played Christchurch was put into lockdown as events unfolded A gunman opened fire in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 50 people and injuring 50 more. As he did so, he filmed the entire crime and live-streamed it directly to Facebook. What ensued was an exhausting race for social media pages to take the footage down, as it was replicated seemingly endlessly and shared widely in the wake of the attack. And through social media, it found its way onto the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video.

One pointed out: ""That is what the terrorist wanted."" The video, which shows a first-person view of the killings, has been widely circulated. About 10 to 20 minutes before the attack in New Zealand, someone posted on the /pol/section of 8chan, a message board popular with the alt-right.

Flags have been lowered to half mast at Downing Street and the Foreign Office, as well as in the British town of Christchurch in Dorset, which is twinned with its New Zealand namesake. Mohammed Kozbar, the vice president of the Muslim Association of Britain, said Muslims in the UK would not be intimidated by terror attacks. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, shared a post on Twitter urging Christians to go along to Friday prayers at local mosques. And the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, told the BBC that ""an attack against faith anywhere is an attack on faith everywhere"". By Alex Therrien from BBC News, at the East London Mosque There was sadness and solidarity, but also anger, at a vigil at the East London Mosque, held in memory of the victims of the New Zealand attack. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up as Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and faith leaders gave short speeches. But among many of the gatherers the BBC spoke to there was also anger and fear. Fear about whether such an attack could happen in the UK. And anger at what they see as the normalisation of Islamophobia in parts of the media and among politicians. ""These are the ones we should be pointing the finger at,"" said one man who refused to give his name. ""They are the ones who caused this."" The London mayor did not name politicians or the media directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and having a role in them becoming radicalised. ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use,"" he urged. The mayor added that diversity in London was a strength, not a weakness. ""We don't simply tolerate it - we embrace and respect it."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was due to attend a vigil at Glasgow Central Mosque on Friday evening, and said the events in New Zealand ""will feel very personal and close to home"" for Muslims. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, laid flowers at the High Commission of New Zealand in London, where members of an anti-terrorism group had gathered. MPs have observed a minute's silence in the House of Commons. British security minister Ben Wallace called the attack ""repugnant"" and said the UK ""stands shoulder to shoulder with New Zealand against terrorism"". He said he and Home Secretary Sajid Javid would speak to counter-terrorism police chiefs and the security services on Friday, ""to discuss what further measures we can take to protect our mosques and our communities from any threats here in the United Kingdom"". Mr Wallace added: ""Our police and security services treat all threats the same and all terrorists the same no matter what communities, religion or background they come from.  A terrorist is a terrorist and we shall deal with them exactly the same."" Bangladesh team 'minutes' from fatal shooting 'This can only be described as a terrorist attack' Mayor of London Mr Khan described the attacks as ""heartbreaking"". He said that, after discussions with Scotland Yard, there would be ""highly visible policing around mosques today, as well as armed response officers, as Londoners go to pray"". Imam Qari Asim talks to PC Plumber as he visits the Makkah Mosque in Leeds Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the national policing lead for counter-terrorism, said there was ""no intelligence linking these appalling events in Christchurch to the UK"". Mr Basu said there would be more ""reassurance patrols"" near places of worship and specific communities in the ""coming days"". He added that specific attention would be paid to mosques. Police Scotland and Greater Manchester Police also said patrols would be increased around mosques, but added there was no intelligence to suggest there was a specific threat. Greater Manchester Police said ""we know all too well the effects of terrorism"". Meanwhile, Met Chief Superintendent Nick Aldworth, who leads the government's counter-terrorism strategy, told BBC 5 Live that police would be assessing what impact the Christchurch attack could have on Britain. ""There's no doubt in my mind that, having seen what I've seen here, this is something that we within counter-terrorism should be responding to in the UK and ensuring our current plans and thinking is correct,"" he said. Sir Mark Rowley, the UK's former head of counter terrorism at the Met Police until last year, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although ""Western societies have always had racist thugs"" who commit crimes, in recent years they have become ""more organised and with more terrorist ambitions"". He said he thought social media had played a role and was ""a very big problem"". Downing Street and Home Secretary Mr Javid also criticised social media, saying Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should have been quicker to remove video footage - recorded by the gunman during the attack - from its platforms.

George Michael art collection fetches Â£9m,"Michael, pictured in 2005, died in 2016 as a result of heart and liver disease Contemporary artworks owned by George Michael have sold for Â£11.3m at an auction, 27 months after his death. They included pieces by Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst. The highest price was for The Incomplete Truth, a 2006 Hirst work consisting of a dove preserved in formaldehyde, which sold for Â£911,250. The 53-year-old was a keen collector of works by the Young British Art movement and was friends with many artists. The money raised will go to causes that the philanthropic star supported. George Michael's art collection unveiled 'Everybody warmed to George Michael' Another of Hirst's works - Saint Sebastian, Exquisite Pain, a representation of the death of the Christian martyr using a bull encased in formaldehyde - sold for Â£875,250 at the London auction. The Incomplete Truth by Damien Hirst alongside other works from George Michael's collection Bridget Riley's 1982 painting Songbird, the first major work Michael acquired, fetched Â£791,250, while Hurricane, a 2007 work by Emin, sold for Â£431,250. Other lots sold on Thursday included three works by Michael Craig-Martin that reference Michael's 1998 notorious arrest for engaging in a sexual act in a public toilet. Untitled (SEX), Untitled (GOD) and Handcuffs sold for Â£125,000, Â£40,000 and Â£112,500 respectively. A life-size bronze gorilla by Angus Fairhurst that used to sit in Michael's garden also went under the hammer, fetching Â£118,750. Works by Angus Fairhurst and Bridget Riley were also sold on Thursday According to Cristian Albu from Christie's, Michael's ""most intense"" period of art-buying took place between 2004 and 2009. ""I'm sure he had advisors but I think he pleased himself and made up his own mind what he liked,"" Albu told the BBC's Vincent Dowd earlier this month. Christie's attributed the fact every lot sold on Thursday to both Michael's ""eye for contemporary art"" and ""the depth of feeling"" he continued to generate.

Children's climate strike spreads worldwide,"This video can not be played Climate change: Fears about effects of pollution and climate change Thousands of school pupils worldwide have abandoned classrooms for a day of protest against climate change. India, South Korea, Australia and the US are among the countries where teenagers are already on strike. The day of action is expected to embrace about 100 countries. They are inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who protests weekly outside Sweden's parliament. Scientists say tougher measures are needed to cut global warming. The Paris climate agreement of 2017 committed nearly 200 countries to keeping global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and to striving for a maximum of 1.5C. What is a climate emergency? BBC Newsround - climate protests live page What does the Paris climate deal say?

On Thursday Greta Thunberg's campaigningearned her a Nobel Peace Prize nomination.

Australia's Education Minister Dan Tehan said ""students leaving school during school hours to protest is not something that we should encourage"". UK Education Secretary Damian Hinds echoed that concern, and the government said the disruption increased teachers' workloads and wasted lesson time. Young people protest across England Classroom walk-out over climate change But Environment Secretary Michael Gove backed the protesting children, saying in a video: ""Dear school climate strikers, we agree.""

What is known about NZ shooting suspects?,"Police officers stand guard near the scene of the deadly shooting in New Zealand The Christchurch mosque attacks were live-streamed on the internet by a man posting online under the name Brenton Tarrant. He said he was Australian. Distressing footage shows him firing indiscriminately at men, women and children at close range inside the Al Noor mosque on Friday. The individual had previously posted a rambling and expletive-filled document, espousing violent right-wing ideology. Reaction to the attacks A day later, the 28 year old appeared in court in Christchurch, charged with murder. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect had ""travelled around the world with sporadic periods of time spent in New Zealand"" and that he was currently living in Dunedin, south of Christchurch. ""I would not describe him as a long-term resident,"" she said ""The offender was in possession of a gun licence. I'm advised that this was acquired in November of 2017."" She said New Zealand intelligence services had been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists, but added: ""The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community nor the police for extremism."" Brenton Tarrant appeared in court in Christchurch in a white prison uniform. He was remanded in custody, with no bail application made. State-appointed lawyer Richard Peters says the defendant fired him and wanted to represent himself. ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability,"" Mr Peters said. ""He seemed to understand what was going on."" The man in the footage equipped himself with what appears to be a head-mounted camera to live-stream the attack in central Christchurch. The streams were broadcast online, including briefly on Facebook, showing the violence in graphic detail. A song which played in the suspect's car is known as a marching anthem for Serbian nationalist paramilitary units known as Chetniks during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. It praises Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted of genocide and war crimes. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack The names of men convicted of killing Muslims and migrants are written on the suspect's weaponry. One item has the words ""For Rotherham"" written on it, a reference to a child abuse scandal in the UK, while other wording references historical battles between European countries and the Ottoman Empire. Australian media reported that Brenton Tarrant was originally from Grafton, a town 600km (370 miles) north of Sydney, and had previously worked at a fitness facility. ""He never showed any extremist views or any crazy behaviour,""his former boss, Tracey Gray, told Seven News,external. The 16,500-word document he posted is entitled The Great Replacement - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. In it, the man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. This video can not be played New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern: 'This can only be described as a terrorist attack' Specifically, he referencesa lorry attack carried out by an Islamic State sympathiser in Sweden, France's decision to elect the moderate Emmanuel Macron as president, and ethnic diversity in France. Despite insisting that he is not motivated by fame, he acknowledges that he intends to survive the attack, and hopes it will spread fear. He chose the Al Noor mosque as his target three months ago, the document says. The central tenet of the conspiracy is that ""European peoples"" are dying out and being ""replaced"" by immigrants with a different, inferior and dangerous culture, says the BBC's Dominic Casciani. This is basically a code for hatred or fear of Muslims - part of the theory is that states and corporations are encouraging ""white genocide"" by pushing up immigration rates to keep global capitalism going, says our correspondent. Brenton Tarrant has travelled frequently, venturing to North Korea, Europe, Turkey and Pakistan. Bulgarian prosecutor general Sotir Tsatsarov said he visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia in 2016, stopping at historic battle sites in the area. He returned to Eastern Europe in November 2018 where he saw more historic sites in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Mr Tsatsarov said Bulgaria is now investigating whether he had ties with people in the country. Brenton Tarrant travelled extensively, but grew up in the Australian town of Grafton Turkish officials have confirmed he visited Turkey several times, and reportedly said an investigation was under way into his ""movements and contacts within the country"". A hotel owner in the far-north of Pakistan told the BBC that Brenton Tarrant had spent two nights in the area in October 2018. Syed Israr Hussain, who runs the Osho Thang hotel, said Tarrant expressed no visible hostility to Muslims or Islam. He said he was travelling alone and ""walked around the local area"" taking pictures like any other tourist. The area is popular with trekkers. A now deleted post on Mr Hussain's social media account from last October is attributed to Brenton Tarrant and reads: ""Pakistan is an incredible place filled with the most earnest kind hearted and hospitable people in the world."" Mr Hussain said Brenton Tarrant left those comments ""for the world to see"". He added he was ""shocked"" by the attack in Christchurch. There are also reports that Tarrant visited Afghanistan and China's Xinjiang region. Four people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack - three men and a woman, who was subsequently released without charge. Police say they do not believe they were connected to the attack. Of those, two remain in custody: a man who apparently went to help carrying a rifle, who has been charged with a firearms offence an 18-year-old, who appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream Prime Minister Ardern said none of those in custody had been on active security watch lists in New Zealand or Australia. This video can not be played Eyewitnesses have reported running for their lives to escape a shooter. ""I have asked our agencies this morning to work swiftly on assessing whether there was any activity on social media or otherwise, that should have triggered a response,"" the prime minister said.

And the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, told the BBC that ""an attack against faith anywhere is an attack on faith everywhere"". By Alex Therrien from BBC News, at the East London Mosque There was sadness and solidarity, but also anger, at a vigil at the East London Mosque, held in memory of the victims of the New Zealand attack. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up as Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and faith leaders gave short speeches. But among many of the gatherers the BBC spoke to there was also anger and fear. Fear about whether such an attack could happen in the UK. And anger at what they see as the normalisation of Islamophobia in parts of the media and among politicians. ""These are the ones we should be pointing the finger at,"" said one man who refused to give his name. ""They are the ones who caused this."" The London mayor did not name politicians or the media directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and having a role in them becoming radicalised. ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use,"" he urged. The mayor added that diversity in London was a strength, not a weakness. ""We don't simply tolerate it - we embrace and respect it.""

Greater Manchester Police said ""we know all too well the effects of terrorism"". Meanwhile, Met Chief Superintendent Nick Aldworth, who leads the government's counter-terrorism strategy, told BBC 5 Live that police would be assessing what impact the Christchurch attack could have on Britain. ""There's no doubt in my mind that, having seen what I've seen here, this is something that we within counter-terrorism should be responding to in the UK and ensuring our current plans and thinking is correct,"" he said. Sir Mark Rowley, the UK's former head of counter terrorism at the Met Police until last year, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although ""Western societies have always had racist thugs"" who commit crimes, in recent years they have become ""more organised and with more terrorist ambitions"". He said he thought social media had played a role and was ""a very big problem"". Downing Street and Home Secretary Mr Javid also criticised social media, saying Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should have been quicker to remove video footage - recorded by the gunman during the attack - from its platforms.

The attacks in Christchurch, which have left 49 dead and at least 40 injured, have been condemned by public figures. The Queen said she was ""deeply saddened"" by the shootings, and PM Theresa May called it ""sickening"". It comes as police have increased patrols at British mosques to provide reassurance. Senior counter-terrorism experts and members of the security services were also due to hold talks with the home secretary on how mosques in the UK can be best protected.

She added that her ""thoughts and prayers are with all New Zealanders"" at this ""tragic time"". The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in a joint message with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, called the attack ""senseless"", saying: ""No person should ever have to fear attending a sacred place of worship."" They ended the message with the Maori words Kia Kaha, meaning ""stay strong"". Mrs May also condemned the ""horrifying terrorist attack"", saying: ""My thoughts are with all of those affected by this sickening act of violence.""

Flags have been lowered to half mast at Downing Street and the Foreign Office, as well as in the British town of Christchurch in Dorset, which is twinned with its New Zealand namesake. Mohammed Kozbar, the vice president of the Muslim Association of Britain, said Muslims in the UK would not be intimidated by terror attacks. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, shared a post on Twitter urging Christians to go along to Friday prayers at local mosques. And the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, told the BBC that ""an attack against faith anywhere is an attack on faith everywhere"". By Alex Therrien from BBC News, at the East London Mosque There was sadness and solidarity, but also anger, at a vigil at the East London Mosque, held in memory of the victims of the New Zealand attack. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up as Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and faith leaders gave short speeches. But among many of the gatherers the BBC spoke to there was also anger and fear. Fear about whether such an attack could happen in the UK. And anger at what they see as the normalisation of Islamophobia in parts of the media and among politicians. ""These are the ones we should be pointing the finger at,"" said one man who refused to give his name. ""They are the ones who caused this."" The London mayor did not name politicians or the media directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and having a role in them becoming radicalised. ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use,"" he urged. The mayor added that diversity in London was a strength, not a weakness. ""We don't simply tolerate it - we embrace and respect it."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was due to attend a vigil at Glasgow Central Mosque on Friday evening, and said the events in New Zealand ""will feel very personal and close to home"" for Muslims. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, laid flowers at the High Commission of New Zealand in London, where members of an anti-terrorism group had gathered. MPs have observed a minute's silence in the House of Commons. British security minister Ben Wallace called the attack ""repugnant"" and said the UK ""stands shoulder to shoulder with New Zealand against terrorism"". He said he and Home Secretary Sajid Javid would speak to counter-terrorism police chiefs and the security services on Friday, ""to discuss what further measures we can take to protect our mosques and our communities from any threats here in the United Kingdom"". Mr Wallace added: ""Our police and security services treat all threats the same and all terrorists the same no matter what communities, religion or background they come from.  A terrorist is a terrorist and we shall deal with them exactly the same."" Bangladesh team 'minutes' from fatal shooting 'This can only be described as a terrorist attack' Mayor of London Mr Khan described the attacks as ""heartbreaking"". He said that, after discussions with Scotland Yard, there would be ""highly visible policing around mosques today, as well as armed response officers, as Londoners go to pray"". Imam Qari Asim talks to PC Plumber as he visits the Makkah Mosque in Leeds Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the national policing lead for counter-terrorism, said there was ""no intelligence linking these appalling events in Christchurch to the UK"".

UK outsourcing giant loses rescue vote,"Interserve has a cleaning contract for Network Rail stations Control of one of Britain's biggest government contractors, Interserve, has moved to a new company after administrators were appointed. It comes after shareholders rejected a rescue deal for the company, which has 45,000 UK staff, and 68,000 globally. Under a pre-arranged agreement, administrators EY were installed and the assets moved immediately to a group controlled by Interserve's lenders. Interserve insisted that the deal would protect services and jobs. The company cleans schools and hospitals, runs catering and probation services, and manages construction projects. On Friday,shareholders voted 59.38% against a rescue plan to address Interserve's mounting debt pile.,external The plan would have seen their stake reduced to just 5%, with lenders being handed the lion's share of the business. But after the vote, Interserve said that ""in the absence of any viable alternative"" rescue plan it would formally apply to the High Court to go into administration. EY was appointed under a so-called pre-pack administration, an insolvency procedure in which a company arranges to move its assets to a another owner before administrators are officially appointed. It meant that Interserve could avoid a Carillion-style collapse. However, investors have seen the value of their shares wiped out under the financial restructuring. The lenders who are now in control of Interserve Group include banks RBS and HSBC, and investors Emerald Asset Management and Davidson Kempner Capital. In a statement, EY administrator Hunter Kelly said: ""This transaction secured the jobs of 68,000 employees, the majority of whom work in the UK, as well as ensuring there was no disruption to the vital public services that Interserve provides to the UK Government."" Debbie White, chief executive of Interserve Group, said: ""Interserve is fundamentally a strong business and with a competitive financial platform in place we see significant opportunities ahead as a best-in-class partner to the public and private sector."" A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ""We welcome this announcement. It brings the company the stability required for it to compete for future business and continue to deliver good value public services for the taxpayer."" Interserve accumulated debt after construction project delays and a failed energy-from-waste project in Derby and Glasgow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, the GMB union said earlier on Friday that Interserve's problems, which come after the failure of Carillion last year, showed it was ""time to turn the tide on the disastrous experiment"" of outsourcing public services. Kevin Brandstatter, the union's national officer, said: ""Ministers have learnt absolutely nothing from the Carillion fiasco and are hell-bent on outsourcing public sector contracts. ""Shambolic mismanagement is putting jobs put on the line and services in jeopardy. Our public services can't go on like this."" Although Interserve's contracts are expected to continue, there is still concern for jobs in the supply chain. The National Federation of Builders (NFB) said there would be thousands of workers wondering whether they still have a job, and called for changes in the way the government hands out contracts to big national companies. Richard Beresford, chief executive of the NFB, said it was time to reform ""the procurement process from its foundations to ensure that more regional contractors can compete and win work"". In addition to helping smaller companies, it would ""spread risk across fiscally responsible businesses who reinvest profits and are not bound by shareholders,"" he said. The outsourcing firm is one of the UK's largest public services providers.  The firm started in dredging and construction, and from there has diversified into a wide range of services, such as healthcare and catering, for clients in government and industry. It sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects. Interserve is the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5's Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water.

Six firearms officers had gone to a block of flats in Wheeleys Lane, Lee Bank, to carry out an arrest when the shooting happened at about 05:00 GMT. The man - in his 50s - died at the scene, West Midlands Police said. The police watchdog said it was reviewing officers' bodycam footage, which it believed had captured the shooting. Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: ""My understanding at this stage is it has captured everything that took place during the incident - including the shot - that's my understanding. ""We are viewing the footage to see what takes place."" Mr Campbell said officers had been carrying out the execution of a warrant to ""try and arrest the individual"". ""They notified my office just before 6am that an officer had discharged their weapon and someone had been shot,"" he said. ""My team deployed to the scene. By that time the person had died at the scene."" A team of six firearms officers were executing the warrant on the building's fourth floor. IOPC staff visited the scene as part of their investigation Mr Campbell said it was carrying out a ""thorough"" investigation and forensic material was being taken and analysed. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called at 05:04 and found a man in cardiac arrest. ""CPR was already being performed, which ambulance staff took over and also administered advanced life support,"" a spokesman said. ""However, despite everyone's best efforts it sadly became apparent nothing could be done to save him.""

"Killers and Cure to headline GlastonburyJanet Jackson, Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus and Tame Impala are also announced for the festival.Entertainment & Arts","Some of the 2019 Glastonbury line-up (L-R): The Killers, Billie Eilish, Stormzy, Janelle Monae, The Cure The Killers and The Cure will top the bill at the 2019 Glastonbury Festival this June, it's been revealed. They're among more than 60 acts joiningthis year's line-up, including R&B legends Janet Jackson and Lauryn Hill. Stormzy had already been revealed as the Friday night headliner; while Kylie Minogue will play the coveted ""legend slot"" on Sunday afternoon. The festival kicks off on Worthy Farm on 26 June, with full coverage on BBC radio, television and online. Other acts announced on Friday morning include: George Ezra Miley Cyrus Christine & The Queens Jorja Smith Liam Gallagher Wu Tang Clan Vampire Weekend Anne-Marie The Streets Billie Eilish Sigrid Tame Impala Two Door Cinema Club Janet Jackson is making her Glastonbury debut, with her first UK concert in eight years The Chemical Brothers Idles Years & Years Bastille Little Simz RosalÃ­a Johnny Marr Loyle Carner Mavis Staples Neneh Cherry Jon Hopkins Diplo BBC Sounds: Listen to tracks from the Glastonbury line-up Although the three Pyramid Stage headliners are all male, 42% of the currently-announced line-up is female, highlighting the festival's commitment to gender parity. ""The gender balance is something I consider at every stage of the booking process,"" said festival organiser Emily Eavis in an interview last month. ""We're a little way off being 50/50 across the whole festival, but in 2017 the Park Stage was 50/50 and that will be the case on other stages this year. We're definitely moving in the right direction."" The Cure's headline performance is their first since 1995 and their fourth overall, meaning they tie with Coldplay as the festival's most-frequent headliners. The Killers previously topped the bill in 2007; while Kylie was booked for the top slot in 2005, before breast cancer forced her to pull out. ""It will be 14 years since I was originally meant to appear there and so much has happened up to now,"" said the singer, as she announced her return last December. ""I can't wait to see you all there to share this special show."" Glastonbury is expected to announce the rest of the bill closer to the festival itself. The event sold out in just half an hour last October, but cancelled tickets will be put back on sale on Sunday, 28 April. Eavis recently confirmed that The Prodigy had been booked to play prior to frontman Keith Flint's tragic death last week.

Adler: Will EU agree to extension?,"Theresa May will need to formally ask the EU's 27 other leaders for an extension In contrast to the sound and fury coming out of Westminster on Thursday night, the silence on EU leaders' Twitter accounts was deafening. In part it is surely a stunned silence. Europe's politicians gaze open mouthed at the maelstrom of division and chaos currently whirling through the House of Commons. Three years after the UK voted to leave the EU - two weeks before the official Brexit day - Parliament appears to be in meltdown with no unifying solution in sight. EU politicians breathe deep, shuddering sighs at the thought of prolonging the cross-Channel agony of the Brexit process. So will they or won't they agree to an extension? What conditions could they demand and how long would Brexit be delayed by? Like so many things to do with Brexit - the answer is: we're not 100% certain. Brexit: A really simple guide What just happened with Brexit? EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat Earlier this week, a number of EU leaders including France's Emmanuel Macron, Mark Rutte of the Netherlands and Spain's Pedro Sanchez sounded pretty hard-line. They wouldn't agree to delay Brexit, they said, unless the prime minister came up with a very good reason. EU leaders are frustrated, irritated and fatigued by the Brexit process but it's also worth bearing in mind that they have two specific audiences in mind these days when they take to the cameras: - UK MPs whom the EU wishes to pressure into voting for Theresa May's negotiated deal or something else Brussels believes to be realistic -  EU citizens about to cast their ballots in the upcoming elections for the European parliament. The EU's intended message to them: We're tough on those who mess with our club, so don't vote for Eurosceptic nationalists like Marine Le Pen! EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier gave a speech on Brexit's impact on the EU in Bucharest EU leaders' silence after Thursday's vote by the House of Commons to delay Brexit may also have been because they realise - whatever their individual opinions on an extension - that they are obliged by law to come to a unanimous decision. And they won't reach that decision until they are all stuck in a room together, which they will be at an EU summit in a week's time. In the meantime, former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage says he is lobbying countries to make sure at least one of them vetoes a Brexit delay. But that rather overplays Mr Farage's power of influence on European governments. His claim is little more than a publicity stunt. Business âexasperatedâ after Brexit vote EU sticks to Brexit script in final sprint EU in bleak mood in 'crunch' Brexit week The EU's final decision on an extension will be dictated by political and economic self-interest. Delaying Brexit will prolong the uncertainty for European businesses and citizens - and ensure that the issue continues to hang over EU affairs. But EU leaders don't want to be blamed by their voters for a costly no-deal Brexit either. An extension might avoid that. So, tough talk aside, realpolitik is likely to win the day. It could be a longer-term extension, favoured by European Council President Donald Tusk in order to give the UK time for a ""rethink"", he says. Or a shorter extension, if Mrs May can show next week that she's close to parliament approving her deal. EU leaders will probably say yes to a Brexit extension, even if it's through gritted teeth, though they may decide not take a final decision next week. MPs reject PM's Brexit deal by 149 votes.

Is Vienna Convention the answer?,"The backstop plan for the Irish border remains the key sticking point for Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. The backstop is designed to ensure that there can never be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, after Brexit. While the EU and the UK government have both stressed that this legal guarantee is intended to be temporary, some MPs are concerned that it could keep the UK permanently tied to the EU after leaving the union. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, was asked on Thursday if there could be a debate to consider whether there might be a solution to this involvingArticle 62 of the Vienna Convention.,external So, what is it? The Vienna Convention is the treaty that lays down the rules about treaties - legal agreements between countries. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Article 62 of the treaty says that if there has been ""a fundamental change of circumstances"" following the conclusion of a treaty ""which was not foreseen by the parties"", then the countries involved would be allowed to withdraw from the treaty. Ms Leadsom declined to have a debate on the matter, saying that Attorney General Geoffrey Cox had considered the matter and would comment further if he thought it was necessary. Mr Cox said on Tuesday that if there is no solution found to stop the backstop arrangements coming into place, ""the UK has no unilateral exit right to leave, unless there were a fundamental change of circumstance under Article 62 of the Vienna convention on the law of treaties"". So, what would count as a ""fundamental change""? Jonathan Kelly, an international law expert at the firm Cleary Gottlieb, said: ""A 'fundamental change' might be an outbreak of war, a revolution or something that completely changes the character of the international political landscape."" The International Court of Justice, which rules on such matters, has been clear that it sets the bar very high. It ruled in 1997,externalagainst the use of Article 62 to get out of a treaty between Hungary and Slovakia to build a dam on the River Danube. In that judgement, it said that the claim of fundamental changes could only be applied in ""exceptional cases"". Hungary had claimed that since the treaty was signed in 1977, there had been profound political changes in the region (such as Czechoslovakia splitting) and a change to the economic systems in force, but the court ruled those were not sufficiently exceptional. Mr Cox clarified that the sorts of changes he was referring to would be, ""either because of some fundamental political change in Northern Ireland, or some fundamental change of circumstance going to the essential basis of the agreement"". Richard Gordon QC, a constitutional expert at Brick Court Chambers, told BBC News: ""The point of the backstop is that if a solution is not found to the Irish border it will come into force, so to argue that it was unforeseen and exceptional would be very difficult.""

Duckenfield case 'breathtakingly unfair'Ben Myers QC made the claim in his closing speech in defence of Mr Duckenfield.Liverpool,"Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans The prosecution of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield was ""breathtakingly unfair"" as he was made to take the blame for others, a jury has heard. Ben Myers QC made the claim in his closing speech at Preston Crown Court in defence of the 74-year-old. He denies gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans, on 15 April 1989. Mr Myers also said ""it must be one of the most heartbreaking cases ever to come before an English court"". He said it was obvious now, but not then, of the dangers of putting large numbers of people in confined spaces in pens. Football was plagued by hooliganism in the 1970s and 1980s and was a ""world away"" from today's game, he said. ""It affected how police planned the event and how they would react as matters unfolded."" He said it was ""humbling"" to be addressing the court ""because of the scale of the case and the scale of the loss"". The barrister told the jury failings at Hillsborough included faulty police radios, poor signage, a reduction in police manpower and stadium structure - none of which was Mr Duckenfield's fault. He said his client was an ""excellent police officer"" who less than three weeks to prepare for the game after being promoted. ""He was faced with something that no-one had foreseen, no-one had planned for and no-one could deal with."" Mr Myers said the jury was being invited to ""give him criminal responsibility for a decade of incompetence on the part of others"". The barrister told the court the case against his client, who chose not to give evidence, was heavily based on hindsight, adding: ""In the real world you get one go."" He said the Hillsborough stadium ""was potentially lethal"" and there had been a ""history of near-misses"". ""It's like giving a captain a ship that's already sinking and judging him on how well he sails it,"" Mr Myers added. ""The system he was working with was riddled with system faults. It's not a fair start."" The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster At one point he turned to the defendant and said: ""Look at him now. Someone has to stand up for him. We do that, and we do it with vigour. He is an ageing man and not in the best of health."" Mr Myers said it would be ""very wrong indeed"" to convict Mr Duckenfield ""as a way of expressing"" sympathy over what happened. Mr Myers also said it was ""utterly wrong and deeply unfair"" that the jury was shown video footage of the disaster by the prosecution. He said: ""It is not right to bridge evidential gaps with emotion and strong feeling."" On Thursday, prosecutor Richard Matthews QC said Mr Duckenfield had ""ultimate responsibility"" and should have made ""lifesaving decisions"". Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster. Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, denies failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety Act. The trial continues.

Zoopla bans housing benefit discrimination,"This video can not be played Stephen Tyler says housing benefit discrimination forced him to sleep in his car People receiving housing benefit can no longer be barred from renting properties advertised on one of the UK's largest listing sites. Zoopla says it will prohibit landlords posting ""No DSS"" ads, a commonly-used acronym of the now defunct Department of Social Security. The National Housing Federation and Shelter found that one in 10 agents in England refused to let to DSS tenants. The BBC found the policy was enforced even if tenants could afford the rent. Approximately 889,000 people in England receive housing benefit to help pay their rent. Online ads 'refusing' tenants on benefits Landlords who say 'no DSS' flout the law Yet according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG), around half of landlords would not be willing to let to them. Last August, Birmingham resident Stephen Tyler told theVictoria Derbyshire programmethat housing benefit discrimination had forced him to sleep in his car. The wheelchair user said: ""We have been trying to find accommodation since we were evicted from our last property when we asked for adaptations to be made for wheelchair access. ""I phone anything up to 20 landlords, estate agents, a day and none of them will accept DSS."" In November, the National Housing Federation and charity Shelter published analysis of 86,000 letting agent adverts on Zoopla, which found that 8,710 of the postings contained the words ""no DSS"" or ""no housing benefit"". Other adverts implied that no one on benefits was welcome - for example by saying ""professionals only"". While it is not unlawful to refuse people on benefits, Shelter said it was likely to contravene the Equality Act. Earlier this month, Housing Minister Heather Wheeler called for the practice to be stopped, and said the government would explore the option of making it illegal. She warned that if the sector was unwilling to take action then the government would ""explore all options to remove this practice"". Benefit claimant Michelle Hunte said she had found it very hard to find a place to live, after being evicted from a flat in London in 2016. ""I woke up every day at 6am to look for a home,"" she said. ""Everywhere I looked online said 'No DSS' - Gumtree, Facebook, everywhere."" She ended up living in a bed and breakfast, while her six children lived elsewhere. ""It was so stressful being apart from my family. I'm now suffering from anxiety and depression."" TheNational Landlords Association,external(NLA) andResidential Landlord's Association,external(RLA) have said the blanket restrictions should not be used. Charlie Bryant, managing director of Zoopla, said: ""We fully support the recommendations of the NLA and the RLA, which oppose blanket bans against tenants in receipt of housing-related benefits, and are pleased to be taking action which clarifies this position."" The move follows increasing pressure on mortgage lenders, insurers, property agents and property ad sites not to discriminate against people on benefits. This month NatWest Bank said it would change its restrictions on buy-to-let mortgages - which in one case led to a landlord receiving a demand for the revocation of an existing mortgage while being refused a re-mortgage after she rented the property to a tenant on housing benefits. Parliament's Work and Pensions Committee haslaunched an inquiry,externalinto discrimination against benefits claimants. It is quizzing lenders, landlords, agents and benefit recipients and running an online survey of claimants who have had problems finding a place to rent or problems with their landlords. A legal case last year saw a single mother win compensation for discrimination from a lettings agency that refused to consider her as a tenant because she was on benefits. She argued that the restriction indirectly discriminated against women, especially single women, because they are proportionately more likely to be claiming housing benefit than single men, according to official figures.

"UK outsourcing giant faces crunch voteContractor Interserve, which employs 45,000 people in the UK, is putting its rescue plan to shareholders.","Interserve has a cleaning contract for Network Rail stations Outsourcing giant Interserve faces a crunch vote on Friday over its proposed rescue plan. If shareholders fail to back the debt-for-equity deal, the firm could go into administration by the weekend. The firm employs 65,000 staff worldwide, 45,000 in the UK, cleaning schools and hospitals, running probation services and building roads and bridges. Interserve has said the company ""is in a critical financial situation"". It accumulated debt after construction project delays and a failed energy-from-waste project in Derby and Glasgow and hopes shareholders will agree to the strategy, although it would dilute shareholders' holdings. Attention focused on Interserve's financial situation after fellow contracting and construction giant Carillion collapsed in January last year with debts of Â£1.5bn. Following Carillion's collapse, the government launched a pilot of so-called ""living wills"" for contractors, designed to ensure that if companies fail, other contractors are ready to step in to fulfill contracts. Interserve is one of five suppliers taking part. Simon Jack: Interserve facing administration Interserve agrees rescue plan with creditors The proposed rescue plan involves cutting the firm's debts from nearly Â£650m to Â£275m. Interserve would issue new shares which it would give to its creditors in exchange for debt. That would hand lenders the lion's share of the firm, and existing shareholders would be left with heavily watered-down shareholdings totalling just 5% of the firm's worth. ""Our plan preserves some value for shareholders. This will not be the case if the proposals are voted down,"" the firm said. Interserve's largest shareholder, Coltrane Asset Management, has opposed the proposed rescue. The New York-based hedge fund has been pushing for an alternative deal whereby a smaller proportion of the firm goes to lenders, and shareholders retain a larger holding. If no rescue plan is approved the company is likely to go into a pre-pack administration, which would wipe out shareholders entirely but allow the firm to keep operating. A pre-pack administration lets a company sell itself, or its assets, as a going concern, without affecting the operation of the business. Administrators take over the running of the business to protect creditors and shareholders lose their investments. Interserve rescue plan prompts share collapse Government reassures over Interserve The outsourcing firm is one of the UK's largest public services providers.  The firm started in dredging and construction, and from there has diversified into a wide range of services, such as healthcare and catering, for clients in government and industry. It sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects. It is the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5's Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. And at King George Hospital in east London, for instance, Interserve has a Â£35m contract for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance. Both the rescue deal and the pre-pack administration are designed to keep those contracts going and jobs in place, at least in the short term. BBC business editor Simon Jack Interserve, one of the government's biggest providers of public services, may go into administration later. The firm is holding a crucial shareholder vote to decide whether to accept a rescue plan which would see its lenders write off hundreds of millions of pounds in debt in exchange for new shares. It employs 45,000 people in the UK and relies on contracts to serve schools, hospital and the army for 70% of its revenue. The company is drowning in Â£650m of debt and its woes have invited comparisons with failed contractor Carillion which went bust just over a year ago. However, the government - which put Interserve under intense supervision 18 months ago - insists that if the rescue deal is not approved and the company does go bust, there is a plan to bring the company out of administration over this weekend. This arrangement will see the lenders take control of the company, essential services will not be interrupted, but current shareholders will see their shares rendered worthless. That includes the company's biggest shareholder, US firm Coltrane Asset Management, which has opposed the deal but is thought to be interested in buying pieces of the company after administration. Whatever happens on Friday, the financial disaster at Interserve is certain to revive the debate around the role of the private sector in providing public services. The firm's shares have plunged over the past year. Just over a year ago, they were worth 100p each. Currently they're trading at 9.6p each. The RMT union said that events around Interserve suggested the current business model of using outside contractors for public services was ""broken"". The union said the Interserve contract to clean and service railway stations in the southern section should be taken over by Network Rail. General Secretary of the RMT Union, Mick Cash, said bringing the contracts in-house would ""avoid a repeat of the Carillion chaos."" ""âOnce again we see the reality of bandit capitalism and its toxic impact on our public services. The time has come to end this obsession with the private sector speculators and return to the principles of public services run and owned by the public, free from this corrosive nonsense,"" he said.

Two boys killed in hit-and-run crash,"Sanjay, 10, and Pawanveer Singh, 23 months, died at the scene of the crash Two young brothers have died in a hit-and-run car crash in Wolverhampton. Sanjay Singh, aged 10, and Pawanveer Singh, 23 months, were in a BMW being driven by their mother when it was in collision with an Audi S3. Police have urged the driver of the Audi, who left the scene on Thursday evening, to come forward. The 31-year-old driver of a third car, a Bentley, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. A taxi driver said two cars had passed him at a ""very fast"" speed about a mile away from the scene of the crash on Birmingham New Road. Police are yet to trace the driver of the Audi, which police said hit the family's BMW Ambulance crews arrived at the Lawnswood Avenue junction to find members of the public tending to the injured. Paramedics tried to save the brothers - from Dudley, police said - but they were pronounced dead at the scene. The mother, whose injuries were not life-threatening, was taken to hospital but has since been released. A family statement issued by West Midlands Police said: ""Our family are grieving over the tragic deaths of our two beautiful children, as well as dealing with the shock of the horrific crash."" Det Sgt Paul Hughes said the boys' mother was physically well but added: ""I don't think any of us can comprehend what she and her family must be going through."" A mother and her two sons were in their BMW when it was struck by the Audi, police said Describing how two cars had sped past him, taxi driver Tanveer Hussain said: ""I was further up the road, by McDonald's, and two cars overtook me. If I am doing 35 to 40, they were doing much more."" He said he then pulled over when he came upon the crash site. ""I got out of my car and other lads tended to the children. What I saw was terrible,"" Mr Hussain said. ""It was too much. The mother was just in shock."" Police have confirmed the speed of the vehicles involved was being investigated. A witness described hearing an ""almighty bang"" Another witness, who lives nearby but did not want to be named, said:  ""I didn't see it but I heard it - two cars must have been racing. Latest news from the West Midlands ""My son ran to the window and said 'they are racing dad' and then we heard an almighty bang. ""My Mrs ran down to see if she could help and all the police and ambulance workers were there. You could see the police officers stopping the traffic were really, really distressed."" Police said the family was being supported by specialist officers Det Sgt Hughes appealed directly to the driver of the Audi to make contact with the police. ""Do the right thing, contact us and give us your version of events. ""You may not be fully aware of the full tragic circumstances but you now need to speak to us,"" he said. Police have also urged people who saw a white Bentley Continental convertible and a blue Audi S3 travelling along Birmingham New Road around the time to get in touch. The crash happened on a road covered by an injunction forbidding people from so-called car cruising. Prohibited activities include speeding, driving in convoy, racing and performing stunts between the hours of 15:00 and 07:00. The road was reopened at 03:40.

"Man shot dead by armed policeThe man in his 50s was shot in Birmingham during an ""intelligence-led operation"", police said.","A team of six firearms officers had gone into the fourth floor of the building in Lee Bank A man has been shot dead by armed police in Birmingham city centre during an ""intelligence-led operation"". Six firearms officers had gone to a block of flats in Wheeleys Lane, Lee Bank, to carry out an arrest when the shooting happened at about 05:00 GMT. The man - in his 50s - died at the scene, West Midlands Police said. The police watchdog said it was reviewing officers' bodycam footage, which it believed had captured the shooting. Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: ""My understanding at this stage is it has captured everything that took place during the incident - including the shot - that's my understanding. ""We are viewing the footage to see what takes place."" Mr Campbell said officers had been carrying out the execution of a warrant to ""try and arrest the individual"". ""They notified my office just before 6am that an officer had discharged their weapon and someone had been shot,"" he said. ""My team deployed to the scene. By that time the person had died at the scene."" A team of six firearms officers were executing the warrant on the building's fourth floor. IOPC staff visited the scene as part of their investigation Mr Campbell said it was carrying out a ""thorough"" investigation and forensic material was being taken and analysed. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called at 05:04 and found a man in cardiac arrest.

"Killers and Cure to headline GlastonburyJanet Jackson, Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus and Tame Impala are also announced for the festival.","Some of the 2019 Glastonbury line-up (L-R): The Killers, Billie Eilish, Stormzy, Janelle Monae, The Cure The Killers and The Cure will top the bill at the 2019 Glastonbury Festival this June, it's been revealed. They're among more than 60 acts joiningthis year's line-up, including R&B legends Janet Jackson and Lauryn Hill. Stormzy had already been revealed as the Friday night headliner; while Kylie Minogue will play the coveted ""legend slot"" on Sunday afternoon. The festival kicks off on Worthy Farm on 26 June, with full coverage on BBC radio, television and online. Other acts announced on Friday morning include: George Ezra Miley Cyrus Christine & The Queens Jorja Smith Liam Gallagher Wu Tang Clan Vampire Weekend Anne-Marie The Streets Billie Eilish Sigrid Tame Impala Two Door Cinema Club Janet Jackson is making her Glastonbury debut, with her first UK concert in eight years The Chemical Brothers Idles Years & Years Bastille Little Simz RosalÃ­a Johnny Marr Loyle Carner Mavis Staples Neneh Cherry Jon Hopkins Diplo BBC Sounds: Listen to tracks from the Glastonbury line-up Although the three Pyramid Stage headliners are all male, 42% of the currently-announced line-up is female, highlighting the festival's commitment to gender parity. ""The gender balance is something I consider at every stage of the booking process,"" said festival organiser Emily Eavis in an interview last month. ""We're a little way off being 50/50 across the whole festival, but in 2017 the Park Stage was 50/50 and that will be the case on other stages this year. We're definitely moving in the right direction."" The Cure's headline performance is their first since 1995 and their fourth overall, meaning they tie with Coldplay as the festival's most-frequent headliners. The Killers previously topped the bill in 2007; while Kylie was booked for the top slot in 2005, before breast cancer forced her to pull out. ""It will be 14 years since I was originally meant to appear there and so much has happened up to now,"" said the singer, as she announced her return last December. ""I can't wait to see you all there to share this special show."" Glastonbury is expected to announce the rest of the bill closer to the festival itself. The event sold out in just half an hour last October, but cancelled tickets will be put back on sale on Sunday, 28 April. Eavis recently confirmed that The Prodigy had been booked to play prior to frontman Keith Flint's tragic death last week.

"Liberal Democrats suspend former leaderDavid Steel said he had ""assumed"" former MP Cyril Smith was an abuser, but took no action.Scotland politics","Lord Steel gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in Manchester on Wednesday The Liberal Democrats have suspended former leader David Steel over remarks he made to a child abuse inquiry about the late MP Cyril Smith. Lord Steel said he asked Smith in 1979 about claims he abused boys at a Rochdale hostel in the 1960s. He said he came away from the conversation ""assuming"" that Smith had committed the offences but claimed it was ""nothing to do with me"". A Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesman said an investigation would take place. The spokesman said: ""Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on 13th March 2019 the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed. ""The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation. That work will now commence. ""It is important that everyone in the party, and in wider society, understands the importance of vigilance and safeguarding to protect people from abuse, and that everyone has confidence in the seriousness with which we take it. ""We appreciate the difficult work that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is doing on behalf of the victims and survivors of abuse, and the country as a whole."" Leader 'assumed' Cyril Smith was an abuser The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard that no formal inquiry was held by the party into the claims against Smith, which were investigated by the police in 1969 but no prosecution was brought. Smith served as a Labour councillor in Rochdale in the 1960s before becoming the Liberal and then Liberal Democrat MP for the town between 1972 and 1992. Allegations that he abused a number of boys found a wider public spotlight after he died in 2010. Lord Steel, 80, told the inquiry he discussed the allegations with Smith in 1979, after an article appeared in Private Eye. He said Smith had told him ""it was correct, the matter had been investigated by police, no further action was taken and that was the end of the story"". Cyril Smith (left) and David Steel (right) discussed the allegations in 1979 Lord Steel said he had ""assumed"" that Smith had committed the offences, but said he took no further action because: ""It was before he was an MP, before he was even a member of my party. It had nothing to do with me."" Lord Steel also described recommending Smith for a knighthood in 1988 and said he did not pass on any allegations about the sexual abuse of children because ""I was not aware of any such allegations other than the matter referred toâ¦which appeared to have been fully investigated"". And he said it had not occurred to him that children could still have been at risk from Smith. In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, Lord Steel said: ""I would like to clarify what happened in 1979 when I asked Cyril Smith about the report in Private Eye. ""As I told the inquiry yesterday I did not have that report with me when I tackled him, nor did we discuss the details in it. ""He admitted to me that the report was correct in that he had been investigated by the police at the time and no action taken against him. ""I had already told the inquiry in writing that in my opinion he had been abusing his position in Rochdale Council [that is to gain access to council-run children's homes], but that had been properly a matter for the police and the council, and not for me as he was neither an MP nor even a member of the Liberal Party at the time. ""I was in no position to re-open the investigation."" The statement continued: ""I am reinforced in my view by reading the previous report of the inquiry sent to me today, which says inter alia 'the Crown Prosecution Service found that the advice which had previously been given could not be faulted (given the law and guidance in place at the time)' and that the honours scrutiny committee had seriously considered his nomination for a knighthood and sent a 'warning of risk' letter to Margaret Thatcher as PM, and that 'clearly she took a similar view' as he was granted the knighthood. ""It is unfortunate that some sections of the media have chosen to extract certain passages of evidence and present them without the full context. ""The inquiry has a serious and sensitive job to undertake and spinning evidence to generate sensationalist headlines only serves to distract from panel's search of the truth."" Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon who is acting on behalf of seven victims in the abuse inquiry, said Lord Steel's admission that he assumed Smith had committed offences would ""cause victims great anger"". He added: ""Steel's inaction was an appalling dereliction of duty and I hope the inquiry will condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Lord Steel became the Liberal MP for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles in 1965, and became the party's leader in 1976 after the resignation of Jeremy Thorpe, who later stood trial on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder. He was elected as an MSP when the Scottish Parliament opened in 1999, and was appointed as the parliament's first presiding officer. He has been a life peer in the House of Lords since 1997.

Two boys killed in hit-and-run crashThe 23-month-old and 10-year-old children were travelling with their mother when the crash happened.Birmingham & Black Country,"Sanjay, 10, and Pawanveer Singh, 23 months, died at the scene of the crash Two young brothers have died in a hit-and-run car crash in Wolverhampton. Sanjay Singh, aged 10, and Pawanveer Singh, 23 months, were in a BMW being driven by their mother when it was in collision with an Audi S3. Police have urged the driver of the Audi, who left the scene on Thursday evening, to come forward. The 31-year-old driver of a third car, a Bentley, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. A taxi driver said two cars had passed him at a ""very fast"" speed about a mile away from the scene of the crash on Birmingham New Road. Police are yet to trace the driver of the Audi, which police said hit the family's BMW Ambulance crews arrived at the Lawnswood Avenue junction to find members of the public tending to the injured. Paramedics tried to save the brothers - from Dudley, police said - but they were pronounced dead at the scene. The mother, whose injuries were not life-threatening, was taken to hospital but has since been released. A family statement issued by West Midlands Police said: ""Our family are grieving over the tragic deaths of our two beautiful children, as well as dealing with the shock of the horrific crash."" Det Sgt Paul Hughes said the boys' mother was physically well but added: ""I don't think any of us can comprehend what she and her family must be going through."" A mother and her two sons were in their BMW when it was struck by the Audi, police said Describing how two cars had sped past him, taxi driver Tanveer Hussain said: ""I was further up the road, by McDonald's, and two cars overtook me. If I am doing 35 to 40, they were doing much more."" He said he then pulled over when he came upon the crash site. ""I got out of my car and other lads tended to the children. What I saw was terrible,"" Mr Hussain said. ""It was too much. The mother was just in shock."" Police have confirmed the speed of the vehicles involved was being investigated. A witness described hearing an ""almighty bang"" Another witness, who lives nearby but did not want to be named, said:  ""I didn't see it but I heard it - two cars must have been racing. Latest news from the West Midlands ""My son ran to the window and said 'they are racing dad' and then we heard an almighty bang. ""My Mrs ran down to see if she could help and all the police and ambulance workers were there. You could see the police officers stopping the traffic were really, really distressed."" Police said the family was being supported by specialist officers Det Sgt Hughes appealed directly to the driver of the Audi to make contact with the police. ""Do the right thing, contact us and give us your version of events. ""You may not be fully aware of the full tragic circumstances but you now need to speak to us,"" he said. Police have also urged people who saw a white Bentley Continental convertible and a blue Audi S3 travelling along Birmingham New Road around the time to get in touch. The crash happened on a road covered by an injunction forbidding people from so-called car cruising. Prohibited activities include speeding, driving in convoy, racing and performing stunts between the hours of 15:00 and 07:00. The road was reopened at 03:40.

Man Ã¢ÂÂfeels sorryÃ¢ÂÂ for brother's killer,"Chris Frost, pictured on a family holiday to Fuerteventura, died in August The brother of a man who died after his friend punched him says he felt sorry for the killer when he saw him ""broken"" and apologetic in court. Chris Frost, 31, died after hitting his head on the ground following a punch outside a Cambridge pub in August. On WednesdayDennis Hurworth was jailed for manslaughterand as he was led from the dock the father-of-one mouthed ""I'm sorry"" to Mr Frost's family. Luke Frost said: ""One of the things my sister keeps saying is 'nobody wins'."" He said: ""Seeing him mouth the words 'I'm sorry' and seeing him quite visibly broken, I and my sister said the same thing - I just felt sorry for him, because he's got a son."" Dennis Hurworth said in a letter to the judge he wished the victim's family would forgive him Hurworth and Mr Frost had been ""play fighting"" while drinking at The Brook pub on 17 August before outside Hurworth became angry and hit his friend. Mr Frost, from Lode in Cambridgeshire, ""fell to the floor like a ruler"" and died in hospital from a brain injury the next day. Hurworth, of Nuns Way, Cambridge, had initially denied manslaughter but changed his plea and in a letter to the judge said: ""More than anything else I wish I could bring him back, undo what I'd done and wish Chris' family would forgive me."" He was jailed for four years. Chris (right) on his sister Abbey's wedding day with his brother Luke (left), father Vernon and mother Jane Mr Frost's younger brother Luke, who travelled from his home in Barcelona for the sentencing, said he would be open to meeting his brother's killer in the future. ""At the moment I'm angry with him, but I think the prospect of forgiveness is there,"" he said. ""I do believe that for both our sakes, for him to absolve himself of what he did and for us to really move on, forgiveness is really important."" Chris (left) was the eldest of his siblings He said that while in the hospital with Mr Frost waiting for his organs to be retrieved for donation - which he was ""hugely proud"" had saved lives - the family ""thought a lot about Dennis"". ""I know people that have thrown a punch, people in our family have thrown a punch so you think 'is it just a really, really terrible accident?'. Is he beside himself with regret and grief and thinking 'my life is ruined'? ""I think it changed slightly, when he originally had the first chance to plead guilty, he didn't and we saw him in court - you do start to build up an image and an idea of the person. ""It really wasn't until the final moments where he pleaded guilty and had the letter, we all saw him and he did look broken, he looked remorseful and that can change your opinion quite quickly of somebody.""

Killers and Cure to headline Glastonbury,"Some of the 2019 Glastonbury line-up (L-R): The Killers, Billie Eilish, Stormzy, Janelle Monae, The Cure The Killers and The Cure will top the bill at the 2019 Glastonbury Festival this June, it's been revealed.

""The gender balance is something I consider at every stage of the booking process,"" said festival organiser Emily Eavis in an interview last month.

UK outsourcing giant faces crunch vote,"Interserve has a cleaning contract for Network Rail stations Outsourcing giant Interserve faces a crunch vote on Friday over its proposed rescue plan. If shareholders fail to back the debt-for-equity deal, the firm could go into administration by the weekend. The firm employs 65,000 staff worldwide, 45,000 in the UK, cleaning schools and hospitals, running probation services and building roads and bridges. Interserve has said the company ""is in a critical financial situation"". It accumulated debt after construction project delays and a failed energy-from-waste project in Derby and Glasgow and hopes shareholders will agree to the strategy, although it would dilute shareholders' holdings. Attention focused on Interserve's financial situation after fellow contracting and construction giant Carillion collapsed in January last year with debts of Â£1.5bn. Following Carillion's collapse, the government launched a pilot of so-called ""living wills"" for contractors, designed to ensure that if companies fail, other contractors are ready to step in to fulfill contracts. Interserve is one of five suppliers taking part. Simon Jack: Interserve facing administration Interserve agrees rescue plan with creditors The proposed rescue plan involves cutting the firm's debts from nearly Â£650m to Â£275m. Interserve would issue new shares which it would give to its creditors in exchange for debt. That would hand lenders the lion's share of the firm, and existing shareholders would be left with heavily watered-down shareholdings totalling just 5% of the firm's worth. ""Our plan preserves some value for shareholders. This will not be the case if the proposals are voted down,"" the firm said. Interserve's largest shareholder, Coltrane Asset Management, has opposed the proposed rescue. The New York-based hedge fund has been pushing for an alternative deal whereby a smaller proportion of the firm goes to lenders, and shareholders retain a larger holding. If no rescue plan is approved the company is likely to go into a pre-pack administration, which would wipe out shareholders entirely but allow the firm to keep operating. A pre-pack administration lets a company sell itself, or its assets, as a going concern, without affecting the operation of the business. Administrators take over the running of the business to protect creditors and shareholders lose their investments. Interserve rescue plan prompts share collapse Government reassures over Interserve The outsourcing firm is one of the UK's largest public services providers.  The firm started in dredging and construction, and from there has diversified into a wide range of services, such as healthcare and catering, for clients in government and industry. It sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects. It is the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5's Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. And at King George Hospital in east London, for instance, Interserve has a Â£35m contract for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance. Both the rescue deal and the pre-pack administration are designed to keep those contracts going and jobs in place, at least in the short term. BBC business editor Simon Jack Interserve, one of the government's biggest providers of public services, may go into administration later. The firm is holding a crucial shareholder vote to decide whether to accept a rescue plan which would see its lenders write off hundreds of millions of pounds in debt in exchange for new shares. It employs 45,000 people in the UK and relies on contracts to serve schools, hospital and the army for 70% of its revenue. The company is drowning in Â£650m of debt and its woes have invited comparisons with failed contractor Carillion which went bust just over a year ago. However, the government - which put Interserve under intense supervision 18 months ago - insists that if the rescue deal is not approved and the company does go bust, there is a plan to bring the company out of administration over this weekend. This arrangement will see the lenders take control of the company, essential services will not be interrupted, but current shareholders will see their shares rendered worthless. That includes the company's biggest shareholder, US firm Coltrane Asset Management, which has opposed the deal but is thought to be interested in buying pieces of the company after administration. Whatever happens on Friday, the financial disaster at Interserve is certain to revive the debate around the role of the private sector in providing public services. The firm's shares have plunged over the past year. Just over a year ago, they were worth 100p each. Currently they're trading at 9.6p each. The RMT union said that events around Interserve suggested the current business model of using outside contractors for public services was ""broken"". The union said the Interserve contract to clean and service railway stations in the southern section should be taken over by Network Rail. General Secretary of the RMT Union, Mick Cash, said bringing the contracts in-house would ""avoid a repeat of the Carillion chaos."" ""âOnce again we see the reality of bandit capitalism and its toxic impact on our public services. The time has come to end this obsession with the private sector speculators and return to the principles of public services run and owned by the public, free from this corrosive nonsense,"" he said.

Wetherspoon's profits plunge by 19%,"Wetherspoons warned last year that food and drink prices would rise due to increased costs Profits at UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon fell 19% in the six months to the end of January. It blamed a rise in labour costs, interest payments, utility bills, repairs and depreciation for the fall. Its chairman, Brexit supporter Tim Martin, who generally accompanies results announcements with his colourful opinions,  expressed concern that Brexit would be reversed. This, he said, would have ""adverse economic consequences"". He blamed ""the establishment"" for a ""barrage of negative economic forecasts"". Mr Martin is currently touring 100 of his 900 pubs, talking to punters about the merits of leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March. Wetherspoons chairman Tim Martin has said prices may have to rise The company, which also owns pubs in Ireland, is replacing champagneand prosecco with non-European Union sparkling wines. There has also been a switch in the beers available. Wheat beer and alcohol-free beer from the UK are replacing beers brewed in Germany. Although profits fell sharply, sales at the chain are continuing to rise. Wetherspoon's revenues rose by 7%, and like-for-like sales by more than 6%. Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, said the industry as a whole was struggling: ""The wafer-thin margins within the industry are susceptible to any spike in costs, which leaves the pubs vulnerable from an investment perspective.""

Mosque witness 'prayed for bullets to end'VideoVideoN Zealand PM: 'This is a terrorist attack'VideoVideoFootage shows Christchurch arrestVideoVideoN Zealand shootings: 'Unprecedented event'Bangladesh team escape fatal shooting,"This video can not be played Eyewitnesses reported running for their lives to escape a shooter. As information about the deadly mosque shootings in New Zealand continues to emerge, survivors have recounted horrifying details. The violence began when a gunman, dressed in dark clothing, opened fire in the Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch on Friday. A prayer session had been going on inside. Witnesses said they ran for their lives after hearing gunshots. One unnamed survivor who had blood on his clothes told local media that he saw the gunman shoot a man in the chest. The witness estimated that the shooting lasted for 20 minutes and that up to 60 people may have been injured. ""I was thinking he must run out of bullets,"" he told broadcaster TVNZ.

I just heard one of the ladies has died. ""My brother was there and I don't know if he's safe or not."" Another man, who survived by hiding, said people had broken through windows to escape.

""I saw on the floor - the bullet shells - so many hundreds."" Eyewitness Carl Pomare was driving past the mosque with a co-worker when he saw people ""running for their lives"". ""The next second there was rapid fire. These people were being knocked down like ten-pins. I saw them being hit from behind and they were falling to the ground,"" he said. Mr Pomare and his colleague set up a cordon with another car and began helping the victims. ""We were in a group of about six people who just happened to be there at the time - all civilians helping these people who were lying on the ground fighting for their lives.""

Armed police patrol following a shooting at the Al Noor mosque ""We were trying to keep these people alive until the ambulances could get through. ""People were begging for our help.

Zoopla bars 'no housing benefit' rental ads,"This video can not be played Stephen Tyler says housing benefit discrimination forced him to sleep in his car People receiving housing benefit can no longer be barred from renting properties advertised on one of the UK's largest listing sites. Zoopla says it will prohibit landlords posting ""No DSS"" ads, a commonly-used acronym of the now defunct Department of Social Security. The National Housing Federation and Shelter found that one in 10 agents in England refused to let to DSS tenants. The BBC found the policy was enforced even if tenants could afford the rent. Approximately 889,000 people in England receive housing benefit to help pay their rent. Online ads 'refusing' tenants on benefits Landlords who say 'no DSS' flout the law Yet according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG), around half of landlords would not be willing to let to them. Last August, Birmingham resident Stephen Tyler told theVictoria Derbyshire programmethat housing benefit discrimination had forced him to sleep in his car. The wheelchair user said: ""We have been trying to find accommodation since we were evicted from our last property when we asked for adaptations to be made for wheelchair access. ""I phone anything up to 20 landlords, estate agents, a day and none of them will accept DSS."" In November, the National Housing Federation and charity Shelter published analysis of 86,000 letting agent adverts on Zoopla, which found that 8,710 of the postings contained the words ""no DSS"" or ""no housing benefit"". Other adverts implied that no one on benefits was welcome - for example by saying ""professionals only"". While it is not unlawful to refuse people on benefits, Shelter said it was likely to contravene the Equality Act. Earlier this month, Housing Minister Heather Wheeler called for the practice to be stopped, and said the government would explore the option of making it illegal. She warned that if the sector was unwilling to take action then the government would ""explore all options to remove this practice"". Benefit claimant Michelle Hunte said she had found it very hard to find a place to live, after being evicted from a flat in London in 2016. ""I woke up every day at 6am to look for a home,"" she said. ""Everywhere I looked online said 'No DSS' - Gumtree, Facebook, everywhere."" She ended up living in a bed and breakfast, while her six children lived elsewhere. ""It was so stressful being apart from my family. I'm now suffering from anxiety and depression."" TheNational Landlords Association,external(NLA) andResidential Landlord's Association,external(RLA) have said the blanket restrictions should not be used. Charlie Bryant, managing director of Zoopla, said: ""We fully support the recommendations of the NLA and the RLA, which oppose blanket bans against tenants in receipt of housing-related benefits, and are pleased to be taking action which clarifies this position."" The move follows increasing pressure on mortgage lenders, insurers, property agents and property ad sites not to discriminate against people on benefits. This month NatWest Bank said it would change its restrictions on buy-to-let mortgages - which in one case led to a landlord receiving a demand for the revocation of an existing mortgage while being refused a re-mortgage after she rented the property to a tenant on housing benefits. Parliament's Work and Pensions Committee haslaunched an inquiry,externalinto discrimination against benefits claimants. It is quizzing lenders, landlords, agents and benefit recipients and running an online survey of claimants who have had problems finding a place to rent or problems with their landlords. A legal case last year saw a single mother win compensation for discrimination from a lettings agency that refused to consider her as a tenant because she was on benefits. She argued that the restriction indirectly discriminated against women, especially single women, because they are proportionately more likely to be claiming housing benefit than single men, according to official figures.

Police are yet to trace the driver of the Audi, which police said hit the family's BMW Ambulance crews arrived at the Lawnswood Avenue junction to find members of the public tending to the injured. Paramedics tried to save the brothers - from Dudley, police said - but they were pronounced dead at the scene.

What I saw was terrible,"" Mr Hussain said. ""It was too much. The mother was just in shock."" Police have confirmed the speed of the vehicles involved was being investigated. A witness described hearing an ""almighty bang"" Another witness, who lives nearby but did not want to be named, said:  ""I didn't see it but I heard it - two cars must have been racing. Latest news from the West Midlands ""My son ran to the window and said 'they are racing dad' and then we heard an almighty bang. ""My Mrs ran down to see if she could help and all the police and ambulance workers were there. You could see the police officers stopping the traffic were really, really distressed."" Police said the family was being supported by specialist officers Det Sgt Hughes appealed directly to the driver of the Audi to make contact with the police. ""Do the right thing, contact us and give us your version of events. ""You may not be fully aware of the full tragic circumstances but you now need to speak to us,"" he said. Police have also urged people who saw a white Bentley Continental convertible and a blue Audi S3 travelling along Birmingham New Road around the time to get in touch.

Gun-maker faces lawsuit over Sandy Hook,"An AR-15 style assault rifle was used during a shooting in Sandy Hook A Connecticut court has ruled that families of schoolchildren killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting can sue American gun-maker Remington. In a 5-4 vote, the US state's Supreme Court said the lawsuit could proceed on the basis of state consumer protection laws. The gun was used by Adam Lanza, who killed 27 people, including 20 elementary school students. The ruling is a rare legal defeat for an arms firm in a mass shooting case. The lawsuit, by relatives of nine victims and one survivor, points to the ""militaristic"" marketing of Remington's AR-15 rifle. 2018 'worst year for US school shootings' America's gun culture in 10 charts Five reasons US gun control won't happen ""The families' goal has always been to shed light on Remington's calculated and profit-driven strategy to expand the AR-15 market and court high-risk users, all at the expense of Americans' safety,"" said Josh Koshoff, a lawyer for the victims' families. ""Today's decision is a critical step toward achieving that goal."" Remington did not immediately respond to a request by the BBC for comment. Proceedings were initially delayed after the firmfiled for bankruptcy last yearin the wake of slumping sales. An initial suit against Remington was thrown out in 2016 and an appeal by the families was taken to the state's highest court last year. It is expected to go to the US Supreme Court. Under US law, gun makers and dealers are shielded by legislation from legal liability if any of their weapons are used in criminal activity. Exceptions are made, however, in the case of harmful marketing. A wave of school shootings in recent years has brought debate around America's gun laws sharply into focus. ""It seemed kind of unbelievable that this industry would enjoy that kind of protection,"" said David Wheeler, a father of a Sandy Hook victim, in an interview with the Financial Times. ""It's hard not to look at this [ruling] and think the states are perhaps swinging to a more sensible place."" A wave of school shootings in recent years has brought debate around America's gun laws sharply into focus. In response, some US retailers have raised the age limit for certain firearms purchases to 21 or stopped stocking semi-automatic weapons. Last month, the country's House of Representatives approved a bill expanding background checks for all gun sales. Critics of the legislation say the changes would not have stopped many of recent shootings, and President Trump has pledged to veto the bill if it passes the US Senate. Lanza killed 20 students and six staff at the school. He had earlier shot his mother dead. As police closed in on the school, he killed himself.

Key UK contractor faces administration,"Interserve has a cleaning contract for Network Rail stations Outsourcing giant Interserve faces a crunch vote on Friday over its proposed rescue plan. If shareholders fail to back the debt-for-equity deal, the firm could go into administration by the weekend. The firm employs 65,000 staff worldwide, 45,000 in the UK, cleaning schools and hospitals, running probation services and building roads and bridges. Interserve has said the company ""is in a critical financial situation"". It accumulated debt after construction project delays and a failed energy-from-waste project in Derby and Glasgow and hopes shareholders will agree to the strategy, although it would dilute shareholders' holdings. Attention focused on Interserve's financial situation after fellow contracting and construction giant Carillion collapsed in January last year with debts of Â£1.5bn. Following Carillion's collapse, the government launched a pilot of so-called ""living wills"" for contractors, designed to ensure that if companies fail, other contractors are ready to step in to fulfill contracts. Interserve is one of five suppliers taking part. Simon Jack: Interserve facing administration Interserve agrees rescue plan with creditors The proposed rescue plan involves cutting the firm's debts from nearly Â£650m to Â£275m. Interserve would issue new shares which it would give to its creditors in exchange for debt. That would hand lenders the lion's share of the firm, and existing shareholders would be left with heavily watered-down shareholdings totalling just 5% of the firm's worth. ""Our plan preserves some value for shareholders. This will not be the case if the proposals are voted down,"" the firm said. Interserve's largest shareholder, Coltrane Asset Management, has opposed the proposed rescue. The New York-based hedge fund has been pushing for an alternative deal whereby a smaller proportion of the firm goes to lenders, and shareholders retain a larger holding. If no rescue plan is approved the company is likely to go into a pre-pack administration, which would wipe out shareholders entirely but allow the firm to keep operating. A pre-pack administration lets a company sell itself, or its assets, as a going concern, without affecting the operation of the business. Administrators take over the running of the business to protect creditors and shareholders lose their investments. Interserve rescue plan prompts share collapse Government reassures over Interserve The outsourcing firm is one of the UK's largest public services providers.  The firm started in dredging and construction, and from there has diversified into a wide range of services, such as healthcare and catering, for clients in government and industry. It sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects. It is the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5's Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. And at King George Hospital in east London, for instance, Interserve has a Â£35m contract for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance. Both the rescue deal and the pre-pack administration are designed to keep those contracts going and jobs in place, at least in the short term. BBC business editor Simon Jack Interserve, one of the government's biggest providers of public services, may go into administration later. The firm is holding a crucial shareholder vote to decide whether to accept a rescue plan which would see its lenders write off hundreds of millions of pounds in debt in exchange for new shares. It employs 45,000 people in the UK and relies on contracts to serve schools, hospital and the army for 70% of its revenue. The company is drowning in Â£650m of debt and its woes have invited comparisons with failed contractor Carillion which went bust just over a year ago. However, the government - which put Interserve under intense supervision 18 months ago - insists that if the rescue deal is not approved and the company does go bust, there is a plan to bring the company out of administration over this weekend. This arrangement will see the lenders take control of the company, essential services will not be interrupted, but current shareholders will see their shares rendered worthless. That includes the company's biggest shareholder, US firm Coltrane Asset Management, which has opposed the deal but is thought to be interested in buying pieces of the company after administration. Whatever happens on Friday, the financial disaster at Interserve is certain to revive the debate around the role of the private sector in providing public services. The firm's shares have plunged over the past year. Just over a year ago, they were worth 100p each. Currently they're trading at 9.6p each. The RMT union said that events around Interserve suggested the current business model of using outside contractors for public services was ""broken"". The union said the Interserve contract to clean and service railway stations in the southern section should be taken over by Network Rail. General Secretary of the RMT Union, Mick Cash, said bringing the contracts in-house would ""avoid a repeat of the Carillion chaos."" ""âOnce again we see the reality of bandit capitalism and its toxic impact on our public services. The time has come to end this obsession with the private sector speculators and return to the principles of public services run and owned by the public, free from this corrosive nonsense,"" he said.

Will EU leaders agree to extending Brexit?,"Theresa May will need to formally ask the EU's 27 other leaders for an extension In contrast to the sound and fury coming out of Westminster on Thursday night, the silence on EU leaders' Twitter accounts was deafening. In part it is surely a stunned silence. Europe's politicians gaze open mouthed at the maelstrom of division and chaos currently whirling through the House of Commons. Three years after the UK voted to leave the EU - two weeks before the official Brexit day - Parliament appears to be in meltdown with no unifying solution in sight. EU politicians breathe deep, shuddering sighs at the thought of prolonging the cross-Channel agony of the Brexit process. So will they or won't they agree to an extension? What conditions could they demand and how long would Brexit be delayed by? Like so many things to do with Brexit - the answer is: we're not 100% certain. Brexit: A really simple guide What just happened with Brexit? EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat Earlier this week, a number of EU leaders including France's Emmanuel Macron, Mark Rutte of the Netherlands and Spain's Pedro Sanchez sounded pretty hard-line. They wouldn't agree to delay Brexit, they said, unless the prime minister came up with a very good reason. EU leaders are frustrated, irritated and fatigued by the Brexit process but it's also worth bearing in mind that they have two specific audiences in mind these days when they take to the cameras: - UK MPs whom the EU wishes to pressure into voting for Theresa May's negotiated deal or something else Brussels believes to be realistic -  EU citizens about to cast their ballots in the upcoming elections for the European parliament. The EU's intended message to them: We're tough on those who mess with our club, so don't vote for Eurosceptic nationalists like Marine Le Pen! EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier gave a speech on Brexit's impact on the EU in Bucharest EU leaders' silence after Thursday's vote by the House of Commons to delay Brexit may also have been because they realise - whatever their individual opinions on an extension - that they are obliged by law to come to a unanimous decision. And they won't reach that decision until they are all stuck in a room together, which they will be at an EU summit in a week's time. In the meantime, former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage says he is lobbying countries to make sure at least one of them vetoes a Brexit delay. But that rather overplays Mr Farage's power of influence on European governments. His claim is little more than a publicity stunt. Business âexasperatedâ after Brexit vote EU sticks to Brexit script in final sprint EU in bleak mood in 'crunch' Brexit week The EU's final decision on an extension will be dictated by political and economic self-interest. Delaying Brexit will prolong the uncertainty for European businesses and citizens - and ensure that the issue continues to hang over EU affairs. But EU leaders don't want to be blamed by their voters for a costly no-deal Brexit either. An extension might avoid that. So, tough talk aside, realpolitik is likely to win the day. It could be a longer-term extension, favoured by European Council President Donald Tusk in order to give the UK time for a ""rethink"", he says. Or a shorter extension, if Mrs May can show next week that she's close to parliament approving her deal. EU leaders will probably say yes to a Brexit extension, even if it's through gritted teeth, though they may decide not take a final decision next week. MPs reject PM's Brexit deal by 149 votes. Video, 00:00:34MPs reject PM's Brexit deal by 149 votes What just happened? What do deal documents say?

Man âfeels sorryâ for brother's killer,"Chris Frost, pictured on a family holiday to Fuerteventura, died in August The brother of a man who died after his friend punched him says he felt sorry for the killer when he saw him ""broken"" and apologetic in court. Chris Frost, 31, died after hitting his head on the ground following a punch outside a Cambridge pub in August. On WednesdayDennis Hurworth was jailed for manslaughterand as he was led from the dock the father-of-one mouthed ""I'm sorry"" to Mr Frost's family. Luke Frost said: ""One of the things my sister keeps saying is 'nobody wins'."" He said: ""Seeing him mouth the words 'I'm sorry' and seeing him quite visibly broken, I and my sister said the same thing - I just felt sorry for him, because he's got a son."" Dennis Hurworth said in a letter to the judge he wished the victim's family would forgive him Hurworth and Mr Frost had been ""play fighting"" while drinking at The Brook pub on 17 August before outside Hurworth became angry and hit his friend. Mr Frost, from Lode in Cambridgeshire, ""fell to the floor like a ruler"" and died in hospital from a brain injury the next day. Hurworth, of Nuns Way, Cambridge, had initially denied manslaughter but changed his plea and in a letter to the judge said: ""More than anything else I wish I could bring him back, undo what I'd done and wish Chris' family would forgive me."" He was jailed for four years. Chris (right) on his sister Abbey's wedding day with his brother Luke (left), father Vernon and mother Jane Mr Frost's younger brother Luke, who travelled from his home in Barcelona for the sentencing, said he would be open to meeting his brother's killer in the future. ""At the moment I'm angry with him, but I think the prospect of forgiveness is there,"" he said. ""I do believe that for both our sakes, for him to absolve himself of what he did and for us to really move on, forgiveness is really important."" Chris (left) was the eldest of his siblings He said that while in the hospital with Mr Frost waiting for his organs to be retrieved for donation - which he was ""hugely proud"" had saved lives - the family ""thought a lot about Dennis"". ""I know people that have thrown a punch, people in our family have thrown a punch so you think 'is it just a really, really terrible accident?'. Is he beside himself with regret and grief and thinking 'my life is ruined'? ""I think it changed slightly, when he originally had the first chance to plead guilty, he didn't and we saw him in court - you do start to build up an image and an idea of the person. ""It really wasn't until the final moments where he pleaded guilty and had the letter, we all saw him and he did look broken, he looked remorseful and that can change your opinion quite quickly of somebody.""

"Forty dead in New Zealand mosque shootingsPM Jacinda Ardern described the shootings as a terrorist attack and one of New Zealand's ""darkest days"".","This video can not be played Christchurch was put into lockdown as events unfolded Forty-nine people have been killed and 48 wounded in shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in the nation's deadliest attack. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described it as a terrorist attack and one of New Zealand's ""darkest days"". A gunman identifying himself as an Australian live-streamed the rampage at Al Noor mosque to Facebook. He had espoused racist, anti-immigrant views. Police say a man in his late 20s has been arrested and charged with murder. Two other men and one woman were also detained. No names have been made public. Firearms and explosive devices were recovered, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. Follow our live updates Mosque attacks mapped What is known about the suspects? The gunman live-streaming the attack from a head-mounted camera said he was a 28-year-old Australian called Brenton Tarrant. The footage showed him firing at men, women and children from close range inside the Al Noor mosque. Facebook said it had removed the suspect's Facebook and Instagram accounts and was working to remove any copies of the footage. The live-stream of the attack lasted for 17 minutes. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern: ""This can only be described as a terrorist attack"" The suspect who was charged appeared to have published a document online outlining his intentions as well as details about the plan for the attack. He is due in court on Saturday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the man as an ""extremist, right-wing"" terrorist. New Zealand Police Commissioner Bush confirmed that the man had not been known in advance to either New Zealand or Australian security services. Witnesses 'prayed for end to bullets' What are New Zealand's gun laws? Agonising wait for victims' families Bangladesh cricket team escapes shooting The first report of an attack came from the Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch at 13:40 on Friday (00:40 GMT). A gunman drove to the front door, entered and fired indiscriminately for about five minutes. One unnamed survivor told TV New Zealand that he had seen the gunman shoot a man in the chest. The attacker reportedly targeted the men's prayer room in the mosque, then moved to the women's room. Social media's role in Christchurch attack UK mosque security under review ""What I did was basically just waiting and praying, God please, let this guy run out of bullets,"" the witness said. ""He came to this side, he shot this side, he went to another room and went to the ladies' section and shot them. I just heard one of the ladies has died."" Armed police patrolled the streets following the shooting at the Al Noor mosque The gunman is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to another mosque in the suburb of Linwood where the second shooting occurred. One witness described how one of the worshippers had managed to disarm the man,external, who ran to a waiting car outside. This video can not be played Eyewitness: ""My hands were shaking so hard"" It is not clear where the arrests were made. Police also defused ""a number of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] attached to vehicles"", Mr Bush said. Mr Bush said a number of firearms had been recovered from both mosques, and explosive devices were found in a car belonging to one of the suspects. Authorities advised all mosques in the city to shut down until further notice. This video can not be played Pictures on social media show an arrest being made after the New Zealand mosque shootings According to the latest census figures, Muslims make up about 1.1% of New Zealand's population of 4.25 million. Numbers rose sharply as New Zealand took in refugees from various war-torn countries since the 1990s. Social media accounts in the name of Brenton Tarrant were used to post a lengthy, racist document in which the author identified the mosques that were later attacked. The man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. The document is called ""The Great Replacement"" - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. Although New Zealand police said they had charged a man in his late 20s with murder, they did not identify the man. The attack happened as players from the visiting Bangladesh national cricket team were on their way to pray at Al Noor mosque. They were ""minutes"" from being inside, team manager Khaled Mashud told the BBC. Bangladesh was due to play New Zealand on Saturday but the match has been cancelled. He added that the team were all ""safe and sound"" at their hotel but would travel home ""in the coming days"". ""Players were crying in the bus, they all were mentally affected,"" the former wicketkeeper said. ""It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack,"" Prime Minister Ardern told reporters. In a tweet, she said: ""What has happened in Christchurch is an extraordinary act of unprecedented violence. It has no place in New Zealand. Many of those affected will be members of our migrant communities - New Zealand is their home - they are us."" US President Donald Trump offered his ""warmest sympathy and best wishes"" to New Zealand. ""The US stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content?

In a 5-4 vote, the US state's Supreme Court said the lawsuit could proceed on the basis of state consumer protection laws. The gun was used by Adam Lanza, who killed 27 people, including 20 elementary school students. The ruling is a rare legal defeat for an arms firm in a mass shooting case. The lawsuit, by relatives of nine victims and one survivor, points to the ""militaristic"" marketing of Remington's AR-15 rifle. 2018 'worst year for US school shootings' America's gun culture in 10 charts Five reasons US gun control won't happen ""The families' goal has always been to shed light on Remington's calculated and profit-driven strategy to expand the AR-15 market and court high-risk users, all at the expense of Americans' safety,"" said Josh Koshoff, a lawyer for the victims' families. ""Today's decision is a critical step toward achieving that goal."" Remington did not immediately respond to a request by the BBC for comment. Proceedings were initially delayed after the firmfiled for bankruptcy last yearin the wake of slumping sales. An initial suit against Remington was thrown out in 2016 and an appeal by the families was taken to the state's highest court last year. It is expected to go to the US Supreme Court. Under US law, gun makers and dealers are shielded by legislation from legal liability if any of their weapons are used in criminal activity. Exceptions are made, however, in the case of harmful marketing. A wave of school shootings in recent years has brought debate around America's gun laws sharply into focus. ""It seemed kind of unbelievable that this industry would enjoy that kind of protection,"" said David Wheeler, a father of a Sandy Hook victim, in an interview with the Financial Times. ""It's hard not to look at this [ruling] and think the states are perhaps swinging to a more sensible place."" A wave of school shootings in recent years has brought debate around America's gun laws sharply into focus. In response, some US retailers have raised the age limit for certain firearms purchases to 21 or stopped stocking semi-automatic weapons. Last month, the country's House of Representatives approved a bill expanding background checks for all gun sales. Critics of the legislation say the changes would not have stopped many of recent shootings, and President Trump has pledged to veto the bill if it passes the US Senate. Lanza killed 20 students and six staff at the school. He had earlier shot his mother dead. As police closed in on the school, he killed himself.

"US threw away golden opportunity, N Korea says","North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, seen here during the Hanoi summit North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may break off denuclearisation talks with the US and resume missile and nuclear testing, a senior official says. Vice Foreign Minister Choe Sun-hui told foreign diplomats the US threw away ""a golden opportunity"" at a recent summit between President Trump and Mr Kim. North Korea had offered to dismantle its main Yongbyon nuclear complex. Buttalks collapsed after Mr Trump refused to lift sanctionsunless North Korea destroyed all its nuclear sites. Mr Kim is set to make an official announcement on his position regarding future talks with the US soon, Ms Choe said in Pyongyang. ""We have no intention to yield to the US demands in any form, nor are we willing to engage in negotiations of this kind,"" she told reporters in North Korea, Russia's state Tass news agency reported. She accused the US of taking a ""gangster-like"" stance,according to the Associated Press,external, but added that ""personal relations between the two supreme leaders are still good and the chemistry is mysteriously wonderful"". Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea crisis in 300 words Ms Choe said that North Korea's demand during the recent summit was for five key economic sanctions to be lifted, not all sanctions, as Mr Trump said after talks broke down. ""What is clear is that the US has thrown away a golden opportunity this time,"" she said. ""I'm not sure why the US came out with this different description. We never asked for the removal of sanctions in their entirety."" Mr Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo clearly stated after talks in February that North Korean officials had asked for full sanctions relief. ""It was all about the sanctions. They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" he said. In Washington this week, the US special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, said that diplomacy was ""still very much alive"", though he did not say if there had been any negotiations since the summit, or outline any plans for further talks. North Korea 'unlikely to abandon nukes' Are the rules which have stopped nuclear war broken? The two leaders first met in Singapore last year, in an unprecedented summit between a US sitting president and a North Korean leader. Their second meeting was in Hanoi in February. At a news conference after the Hanoi summit, Mr Trump said no plans had been made for a third summit, but he expressed optimism about a ""good outcome"" in the future. Laure Bicker, BBC Seoul correspondent So does this mean a return to ""fire and fury""? Not quite. North Korea's tactic might be to hope this will initiate a reaction from the US. Pyongyang is aware that Donald Trump has boasted about his ability to get Mr Kim to stop firing missiles and testing nuclear missiles. ""As long as there's no testing,"" said Mr Trump, ""I'm in no rush."" After the two leaders failed to secure a deal in Hanoi, and with economic sanctions still in place, North Korea might be trying to hurry the US president along and get him back to the table with a better deal. It is worth noting Choe Sun-hui still praised the personal relationship between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. So the door to diplomacy is still open. Instead she blamed Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton for hardening the US position. North Korea also has hardliners of its own, who may perceive Kim Jong-un's 120-hour train trip to Hanoi and back as a failure. This announcement lets them know, along with the Trump administration, that Mr Kim is standing firm. Are the rules which have stopped nuclear war broken?

Prisoners in England to be taught code,"Reoffending costs the UK government billions of pounds each year The government is to fund a scheme that will see ""carefully vetted"" prisoners taught to code in order to better prepare them for the world of work. The project is part of a Â£1.2m effort to increase the digital skills of people from disadvantaged groups. The courses will be led by volunteers and industry experts and prisoners will work on real-world projects with external clients. They will start with basic coding before moving to a more advanced level. An award of Â£100,000 will be given to fund the project in two prisons initially - Humber and Holme House, in County Durham - as well as an employment hub in Sheffield. The hope is that the trials will eventually lead to a network of coding workshops in UK prisons. The programme is modelled on the Last Mile project in the San Quentin prison, in California, which has helped almost 500 offenders find jobs after release, with none of those taking part reoffending. That compares with a national reoffending rate in the US of 55%. Reoffending in the UK is estimated to cost around Â£15bn, according to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Minster for Digital Margot James said: ""The government is committed to stopping the cycle of reoffending and a valuable asset to prevent recidivism is employment. ""Equipping offenders with coding skills will help them into life-changing work and give them a path to a hugely rewarding career."" Microsoft teaches blind children to code Neil Barnby, who has been teaching coding to prisoners at HMP Humber, as part of an organisation called Code 4000, said: ""The workshops are reducing reoffending at a measurable rate, because we keep in touch with our graduates. ""We are constantly seeing success after success. ""When I started teaching in prisons, I thought that if I could change just one life, turn one person away from crime, then I have achieved something truly marvellous. ""I look back on the years that I have been teaching coding in prisons and can see all the lives I have had a part in changing for the better. ""Not just the ex-offenders but their families and, more importantly, their children. ""It is an enormous sense of achievement - and with this funding, I look forward to changing even more lives."" Prisoners will learn HTML, CSS and Javascript, before moving on to more advanced concepts such as Git, TDD, MVC, databases and full stack development. They will then work on real-world projects for external clients, with money earned being ploughed back into the project. Stage three of the process will see them working for clients on temporary day release, with the aim of helping them find full-time employment as developers when their jail terms are complete.

MPs vote to seek delay to Brexit,"MPs have voted by 413 to 202 - a majority of 211 - for Prime Minister Theresa May to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit. It means the UK may not now leave on 29 March as previously planned. Mrs May says Brexit could be delayed by three months, to 30 June, if MPs back her  deal in a vote next week. If they reject her deal again then she says she will seek a longer extension - but any delay has to be agreed by the 27 other EU member states. LIVE: Reaction as MPs vote to seek Brexit delay Brexit delay 'only a stay of execution' Brexit delay: What just happened? Most Conservative MPs voted against delaying Brexit - including seven cabinet members - meaning Mrs May had to rely on Labour and other opposition votes to get it through. But some Labour frontbenchers resigned to defy party orders to abstain on a vote on holding another referendum. Shadow housing minister Yvonne Fovargue, shadow education minister Emma Lewell-Buck, shadow business minister Justin Madders, Ruth Smeeth, a shadow ministerial aide, and Labour whip Stephanie Peacock, all quit their roles to oppose one. Theresa May, who has long insisted that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March with or without a withdrawal deal, voted to delay Brexit. She had been forced to offer MPs a vote on delaying Brexit after they rejected her withdrawal agreement by a large margin, for a second time, and then voted to reject a no-deal Brexit. She has warned that extending the departure date beyond three months could harm trust in democracy - and mean that the UK would have to take part in May's European Parliament elections. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Brexit: What could happen next? Does the UK need to hold European elections? Downing Street said the government was still preparing for a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May is planning to hold another ""meaningful vote"" on her withdrawal deal by Wednesday - after it was overwhelmingly rejected on two previous occasions. If she wins that vote, she will ask for a one-off extension to Brexit get the necessary legislation through Parliament at an EU summit on Thursday - if not she could ask for a longer extension. A spokesman for the European Commission said extending Article 50, the mechanism taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March, would need the ""unanimous agreement"" of all EU member states. And it would be for the leaders of those states ""to consider such a request, giving priority to the need to ensure the functioning of the EU institutions and taking into account the reasons for and duration of a possible extension"". It is still technically possible that we could leave the EU at the end of this month - the law has not changed. But politically it is now almost entirely out of reach. The prime minister is accepting she will miss one of the biggest targets she has ever set herself. Tonight's vote is awkward for another reason, as it again displays the Conservatives' fundamental divisions. This is more than a quarrel among friends, but a party that is split down the middle on one of the most vital questions this administration has posed, with cabinet ministers, as well as backbench Brexiteers, lining up to disagree with Theresa May. Read more from Laura Downing Street said this was a ""natural consequence"" of Mrs May's decision to offer a free vote on an issue where there are ""strong views on all sides of the debate"". Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss tweeted: ""I voted against a delay to Brexit. As a delay was passed by Parliament, I want to see deal agreed ASAP so we can minimise to short, technical, extension."" Seven cabinet ministers - Ms Truss, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - voted against the government motion. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matthew Hancock said ""it is still possible to deliver Brexit on the 29 March"" Health Secretary Matthew Hancock said it would be ""extremely difficult"" but ""still possible to deliver Brexit on 29 March with a deal"". He said there were now two options: ""To vote for the deal and leave in orderly way or a long delay and I think that would be a disaster."" MPs earlier rejected an attempt to secure another Brexit referendum by 334 votes to 85. And they also rejected a cross-party plan to allow MPs to take control of the Brexit process to hold a series of votes on the next steps, by the narrow margin of two votes. Following the votes, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated his support for a further referendum after earlier ordering his MPs not to vote for one. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Public vote an ""option to break deadlock"" He said: ""Today I reiterate my conviction that a deal can be agreed based on our alternative plan that can command support across the House. ""I also reiterate our support for a People's Vote - not as a political point-scoring exercise but as a realistic option to break the deadlock."" Labour abstained when MPs voted on the referendum proposal, tabled by Independent Group MP Sarah Wollaston, arguing that now was not the right time to push for a public vote. But 17 Labour MPs defied party orders and voted to oppose another referendum - while 24 Labour MPs rebelled to vote in favour of one. Among frontbenchers to quit over the issue, Ms Peacock said: ""It is with deep regret I tonight resigned from Labour's front bench, because I believe we should respect the result of the 2016 vote to leave the European Union."" Labour's plan to delay Brexit to allow Parliamentary time for MPs to ""find a majority for a different approach"" was defeated by 318 to 302 votes.

May to try to persuade MPs for third timeThe PM wants MPs to vote on her Brexit deal for a third time before next week's EU summit.UK Politics,"The DUP say Brexit talks have ""enlarged and intensified"" in the past week Ministers have held talks with the Democratic Unionists to try to get them to back Theresa May's Brexit deal ahead of a third Commons vote on the package. The DUP are seeking further legal assurances about the deal, which has been decisively rejected by MPs twice. The PM has received a boost after Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet over Brexit policy last year,signalled she could vote for the deal next week. She said the prospect of a long Brexit delay called for ""different thinking"". MPs voted on Thursday to ask the EU to push the date of Brexit back from 29 March to 30 June if the Commons approves a deal by next Wednesday - allowing time for legislation to go through. However, if a deal is not agreed by then, EU leaders are contemplating a much longer delay. Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Does the UK need to hold European elections? Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay voted against the extension, despite saying in the Commons that voting for it would be in the ""national interest"". He told the BBC he would back a short extension to give time for legislation, but not a longer delay. ""If we don't have a deal, then we should leave with no deal,"" he said. ""That's always been my position. We shouldn't be afraid to leave with no deal."" This video can not be played Barclay: ""I'm proud we stopped attempt to frustrate Brexit"" The result prompted a number of Tory MPs to say they will back the deal in the next vote, due to take place by 20 March. And the DUP, which has opposed the deal up to now, are seeking further ""clarifications"" on the government's legal advice about the backstop - the controversial arrangement to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - and how the UK could exit it. MPs took part in a series of votes in the Commons A series of Brexit votes have taken place in the Commons: On Tuesday,MPs rejected Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for a second timeby 149 votes On Wednesday, MPs voted toreject the idea of the UK leaving the EU without a dealunder any circumstances Then, on Thursday, the Commonsvoted by 413 to 202 to seek an extension to Article 50- the legal mechanism by which the UK is due to leave the EU However, as things stand, the law has not been changed, as Wednesday and Thursday's votes were not legally binding. That means the UK is still set to leave on 29 March - with or without a deal. This video can not be played Political Correspondent Jonathan Blake explains what's next for Brexit While legally, there does not have to be a delay, politically it might be hard for Mrs May to avoid. Thursday's motion saw Parliament agree to two options for a delay: If MPs support Mrs May's deal next week - before a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on 21 March - then she will ask the EU for an extension of no later than 30 June But if they don't support her deal for a third time, there could be a much longer delay and the UK may have to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May Any delay will require the agreement of all other 27 EU members and talks about possible conditions could take place before the summit. European Council President Donald Tusk said EU leaderscould be open to a long extension""if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy"". David Lidington calls on MPs to ""reflect"" on the deal over the weekend Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who is regarded as Mrs May's de facto deputy, told the BBC that, although the risk of the UK leaving without a deal had ""diminished"" as a result of this week's votes, it could still happen unless an alternative solution was found. He urged MPs to ""reflect"" over the weekend on the deal on the table, which he said had the ""great virtue"" of having the backing of all 27 other EU governments and, most likely, the European Parliament too. ""I think there is some real impatience among the British public, and frankly among other EU governments, with this inability to agree in Westminster on the way forward,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The alternative, spelt out very clearly and accepted by the House of Commons, is that you don't just have a short technical extension to our membership. You almost certainly need a significantly longer one."" EU politicians breathe deep, shuddering sighs at the thought of prolonging the cross-Channel agony of the Brexit process. So will they or won't they agree to an extension? What conditions could they demand and how long would Brexit be delayed by? Like so many things to do with Brexit - the answer is: we're not 100% certain. Earlier this week, a number of EU leaders including France's Emmanuel Macron, Mark Rutte of the Netherlands and Spain's Pedro Sanchez sounded pretty hard-line. They wouldn't agree to delay Brexit, they said, unless the prime minister came up with a very good reason. EU leaders are frustrated, irritated and fatigued by the Brexit process but it's also worth bearing in mind that they have two specific audiences in mind these days when they take to the cameras. Read more from Katya? There are a range of views across the Commons on Brexit This remains unclear. Mrs May brought back additions to her deal after late night talks in Strasbourg on Monday to try and allay fears about the Irish backstop - the insurance policy to stop a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - as this had been the main sticking point when her deal was voted down the first time. Tuesday's vote showed that some critics had been won over, but while the PM was not defeated by such an historic margin as she was in January - 230 votes - she still lost by a significant margin. Kuenssberg: March Brexit almost certainly out of reach Now it is a case of persuading Brexiteer backbenchers in the European Research Group and the Democratic Unionist Party, as well as trying to win over members of the opposition. Some MPs have suggested looking into whether the backstop could be solvedby using Article 62 of the Vienna Convention- which would allow the UK to withdraw from any treaty if there had been ""a fundamental change of circumstances... which was not foreseen by the parties"". In a letter to the Times, cross-bench peer and QC Lord Pannick said the UK would be ""entitled to terminate the withdrawal agreement"" under this clause - although he questioned whether it would be ""wise politically"". Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said the government's Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, had considered the matter and would comment further if he thought it was necessary. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Public vote an ""option to break deadlock"" The past week's votes have exposed divisions in the main parties. More than half of Tory MPs - including seven cabinet ministers - voted against Mrs May's motion to put back the date when Britain leaves the EU. Downing Street said this was a ""natural consequence"" of Mrs May's decision to offer a free vote on an issue where there are ""strong views on all sides of the debate"". And in the Labour Party, 41 MPs rebelled against party orders on Thursday to abstain in a vote on a possible new referendum - with 24 supporting a referendum and 17 voting to oppose one. Five of those MPs haveresigned from their roles in the party as a result. Shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner said Thursday's vote was about securing an extension to negotiations and was not the right time to vote for another referendum. ""If it's the only way we can stop a no deal or a bad deal, then that is when it comes into play,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Gina Miller, who took the government to court to force them to consult Parliament on the Brexit process, also told the programme she did not believe Thursday was the right time to push for another referendum - but insisted the option was not off the table, despite being heavily defeated by MPs. ""You have to try and exhaust all the other options first and if parliament can't resolve it, it's at that point that it goes back to the people,"" she said.

"Honours panel 'told of Savile abuse in 1998'The committee received a letter that said ""reports of a paedophilia nature"" could emerge about Savile.UK","The committee that recommends people for knighthoods received allegations of child sexual abuse against Jimmy Savile in 1998, an inquiry has heard. The head of the Honours Committee also resisted pressure from Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to knight Savile, according to letters seen by the probe. Savilesexually abused at least 72 people, including eight who were raped. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuseis investigating both institutions and public figures. Savile, who died in 2011, was ultimately knighted in 1990 in recognition of his charity work. How did Savile get away with it? The victims' stories Thatcher fought to knight Savile The Westminster strand of the inquiry heard civil servants were wary of Savile as early as 1984. In letters exchanged with then prime minister Mrs Thatcher's secretary, committee head Lord Robert Armstrong cited interviews with Savile published in the Sun the previous year in which the BBC DJ boasted about sleeping with hundreds of girls, having people assaulted, and telling a suicidal man how he could take his own life. ""My committee did not feel that sufficient time has elapsed since Mr Savile's unfortunate revelations in the popular press in April of this year,"" Lord Armstrong wrote. ""He is much in the public eye and it is unlikely that the lurid details of his story will have been forgotten. I fear it would be best if Mr Savile were to wait a little longer."" He later refused to include him in the birthday honours list, saying time had ""served only to strengthen the doubts felt about a knighthood for Mr Savile"". He had been advised awarding a knighthood to Savile would bring the honours system into ""disrepute"", he wrote. This video can not be played ""Jane"" was abused by Savile when she was staying in hospital aged 16 In 1998, the committee received an anonymous letter that said ""reports of a paedophilia nature"" could emerge about Savile and allegations about his involvement with boys. It said: ""While within limits and bounds homosexuality can be rationalised in a modern society, we must not lose sight that paedophilia goes beyond any boundaries which right-minded people of whatever political persuasions find abhorrent."" Giving evidence to the inquiry, senior civil servant Helen MacNamara - who currently heads the Honours and Appointments Secretariat - said such a letter would now be passed to police immediately. She added that she did not know how the letter was dealt with at the time or if any concerns were raised with authorities. Jimmy Savile report: Key sections Jimmy Savile and the NHS 'How could this be allowed to happen?' The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces, and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. The inquiry is being led by Prof Alexis Jay, a former director of social services who headed the inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham.

'Active shooter' after NZ mosque attack,"This video can not be played Christchurch was put into lockdown as events unfolded Forty-nine people have been killed and 48 wounded in shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in the nation's deadliest attack. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described it as a terrorist attack and one of New Zealand's ""darkest days"". A gunman identifying himself as an Australian live-streamed the rampage at Al Noor mosque to Facebook. He had espoused racist, anti-immigrant views. Police say a man in his late 20s has been arrested and charged with murder. Two other men and one woman were also detained. No names have been made public. Firearms and explosive devices were recovered, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. Follow our live updates Mosque attacks mapped What is known about the suspects? The gunman live-streaming the attack from a head-mounted camera said he was a 28-year-old Australian called Brenton Tarrant. The footage showed him firing at men, women and children from close range inside the Al Noor mosque. Facebook said it had removed the suspect's Facebook and Instagram accounts and was working to remove any copies of the footage. The live-stream of the attack lasted for 17 minutes. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern: ""This can only be described as a terrorist attack"" The suspect who was charged appeared to have published a document online outlining his intentions as well as details about the plan for the attack.

Armed police patrolled the streets following the shooting at the Al Noor mosque The gunman is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to another mosque in the suburb of Linwood where the second shooting occurred.

Authorities advised all mosques in the city to shut down until further notice. This video can not be played Pictures on social media show an arrest being made after the New Zealand mosque shootings According to the latest census figures, Muslims make up about 1.1% of New Zealand's population of 4.25 million. Numbers rose sharply as New Zealand took in refugees from various war-torn countries since the 1990s. Social media accounts in the name of Brenton Tarrant were used to post a lengthy, racist document in which the author identified the mosques that were later attacked. The man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. The document is called ""The Great Replacement"" - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. Although New Zealand police said they had charged a man in his late 20s with murder, they did not identify the man. The attack happened as players from the visiting Bangladesh national cricket team were on their way to pray at Al Noor mosque. They were ""minutes"" from being inside, team manager Khaled Mashud told the BBC. Bangladesh was due to play New Zealand on Saturday but the match has been cancelled. He added that the team were all ""safe and sound"" at their hotel but would travel home ""in the coming days"". ""Players were crying in the bus, they all were mentally affected,"" the former wicketkeeper said. ""It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack,"" Prime Minister Ardern told reporters. In a tweet, she said: ""What has happened in Christchurch is an extraordinary act of unprecedented violence. It has no place in New Zealand. Many of those affected will be members of our migrant communities - New Zealand is their home - they are us."" US President Donald Trump offered his ""warmest sympathy and best wishes"" to New Zealand. ""The US stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Pictures on social media show an arrest being made after the New Zealand mosque shootings According to the latest census figures, Muslims make up about 1.1% of New Zealand's population of 4.25 million. Numbers rose sharply as New Zealand took in refugees from various war-torn countries since the 1990s. Social media accounts in the name of Brenton Tarrant were used to post a lengthy, racist document in which the author identified the mosques that were later attacked. The man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. The document is called ""The Great Replacement"" - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. Although New Zealand police said they had charged a man in his late 20s with murder, they did not identify the man. The attack happened as players from the visiting Bangladesh national cricket team were on their way to pray at Al Noor mosque. They were ""minutes"" from being inside, team manager Khaled Mashud told the BBC. Bangladesh was due to play New Zealand on Saturday but the match has been cancelled. He added that the team were all ""safe and sound"" at their hotel but would travel home ""in the coming days"". ""Players were crying in the bus, they all were mentally affected,"" the former wicketkeeper said. ""It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack,"" Prime Minister Ardern told reporters. In a tweet, she said: ""What has happened in Christchurch is an extraordinary act of unprecedented violence. It has no place in New Zealand. Many of those affected will be members of our migrant communities - New Zealand is their home - they are us."" US President Donald Trump offered his ""warmest sympathy and best wishes"" to New Zealand. ""The US stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content?

Zoopla bars 'No DSS' rental ads,"This video can not be played Stephen Tyler says housing benefit discrimination forced him to sleep in his car People receiving housing benefit can no longer be barred from renting properties advertised on one of the UK's largest listing sites. Zoopla says it will prohibit landlords posting ""No DSS"" ads, a commonly-used acronym of the now defunct Department of Social Security. The National Housing Federation and Shelter found that one in 10 agents in England refused to let to DSS tenants. The BBC found the policy was enforced even if tenants could afford the rent. Approximately 889,000 people in England receive housing benefit to help pay their rent. Online ads 'refusing' tenants on benefits Landlords who say 'no DSS' flout the law Yet according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG), around half of landlords would not be willing to let to them. Last August, Birmingham resident Stephen Tyler told theVictoria Derbyshire programmethat housing benefit discrimination had forced him to sleep in his car. The wheelchair user said: ""We have been trying to find accommodation since we were evicted from our last property when we asked for adaptations to be made for wheelchair access. ""I phone anything up to 20 landlords, estate agents, a day and none of them will accept DSS."" In November, the National Housing Federation and charity Shelter published analysis of 86,000 letting agent adverts on Zoopla, which found that 8,710 of the postings contained the words ""no DSS"" or ""no housing benefit"". Other adverts implied that no one on benefits was welcome - for example by saying ""professionals only"". While it is not unlawful to refuse people on benefits, Shelter said it was likely to contravene the Equality Act. Earlier this month, Housing Minister Heather Wheeler called for the practice to be stopped, and said the government would explore the option of making it illegal. She warned that if the sector was unwilling to take action then the government would ""explore all options to remove this practice"". Benefit claimant Michelle Hunte said she had found it very hard to find a place to live, after being evicted from a flat in London in 2016. ""I woke up every day at 6am to look for a home,"" she said. ""Everywhere I looked online said 'No DSS' - Gumtree, Facebook, everywhere."" She ended up living in a bed and breakfast, while her six children lived elsewhere. ""It was so stressful being apart from my family. I'm now suffering from anxiety and depression."" TheNational Landlords Association,external(NLA) andResidential Landlord's Association,external(RLA) have said the blanket restrictions should not be used. Charlie Bryant, managing director of Zoopla, said: ""We fully support the recommendations of the NLA and the RLA, which oppose blanket bans against tenants in receipt of housing-related benefits, and are pleased to be taking action which clarifies this position."" The move follows increasing pressure on mortgage lenders, insurers, property agents and property ad sites not to discriminate against people on benefits. This month NatWest Bank said it would change its restrictions on buy-to-let mortgages - which in one case led to a landlord receiving a demand for the revocation of an existing mortgage while being refused a re-mortgage after she rented the property to a tenant on housing benefits. Parliament's Work and Pensions Committee haslaunched an inquiry,externalinto discrimination against benefits claimants. It is quizzing lenders, landlords, agents and benefit recipients and running an online survey of claimants who have had problems finding a place to rent or problems with their landlords. A legal case last year saw a single mother win compensation for discrimination from a lettings agency that refused to consider her as a tenant because she was on benefits. She argued that the restriction indirectly discriminated against women, especially single women, because they are proportionately more likely to be claiming housing benefit than single men, according to official figures.

Brexit delay: What just happened?What could happen next?Does the UK need to hold European elections?,"Three more months of Brexit debate, then? British MPs have voted for a delay in the Brexit process for three months or more, after struggling to agree on what terms the UK should leave the European Union on 29 March. You might think, after months of division, infighting and uncertainty that surely,surely, this means everything will go smoothly from here. Well... no. Here's what just happened, why it matters, and what might happen next. Members of Parliament have struggled to agree how Britain should leave the EU on 29 March. Deals proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May (and agreed with the EU) have twice failed to get through the House of Commons. Now, MPs hope their 413 to 202 vote on Thursday will help them agree a deal. Any problem? Yes - the Brexit deadline is legally binding, and can't be extended without the agreement of all 27 other EU countries. Even if the deadline is extended to help prompt the divided British Parliament (and divided governing Conservative Party) to agree a Brexit deal, there's no guarantee they will. Latest updates A really simple guide to Brexit This is all coming to a head now because the British government triggered the start of the two-year departure process on 29 March 2017. With days to go until that finishing post, it's no clearer on what terms the UK should pull out (on trade, the transition period and the status of the Irish border, for example). Brexit: What could happen next? The prime minister's two (rather similar) proposals have failed to get the backing of a majority in Parliament, partly because the more hardline but influential Brexiteers within her own party have snubbed her proposals. Which leaves us where we are now. There are serious concerns that leaving the EU without a deal in place could damage the economy and lead to shortages or price increases in food and medicine, among other consequences. MPs voted on Wednesday to rule out leaving with no deal, but that vote isn't binding. Here are 10 ways a no-deal could affect people Now MPs hope that the delay of three months or more they agreed on Thursday can help them finally find a consensus. If only it were that straightforward. The British government can't just click its fingers and extend the deadline. It will need to make a convincing case to the 27 other EU countries as towhythe deadline should be extended. The EU would then need to agree that this is the best way forward. The question of how long it should be extended also now comes into play. How can Brexit date be delayed? What do MPs actually want from Brexit? On Thursday, the British Parliament agreed that Brexit could be delayed by three months, until 30 June. However, that is on the condition that MPs agree a deal by next Wednesday so there is enough breathing space before it's implemented. But the only deal on the table right now is the same one MPs rejected on Tuesday. What's to say it won't be rejected again? On the other hand, the EU has indicated that it wants a longer deadline. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Donald Tusk, the European Council president who represents all EU members' interests, said on Thursday he would urge those countries ""to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it"". That agreement would have to come at a summit in Brussels next week. For this to happen, the EU has said it would want the UK to demonstrate a clear strategy. What Europe thinks of extending deadline But a longer deadline still wouldn't offer a guarantee that the British Parliament would agree a deal in that time - it might just prolong the arguments. And a longer delay (that would still need to be agreed by both parties) would probably, awkwardly, require the UK to take part in European elections in late May. So could there be a second referendum? That too was ruled out by MPs on Thursday. One of the biggest bones of contention is what should happen to the so-called backstop. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border - physical checks or infrastructure - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK leaves the EU. The backstop is a safety net, an arrangement that will apply to the Irish border after Brexit if a wider deal or technological solution can't be found that keeps the border as frictionless as it is today. But Conservative Brexiteers are concerned that the backstop could keep the UK indefinitely locked into an arrangement with the EU, if no alternative is found. Will the EU accept a Brexit delay?

What could happen next?Does the UK need to hold European elections?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

How the child sexual abuse inquiry works,"Inquiry chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, led the probe into child abuse in Rotherham The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. But it was dogged with controversy after being announced in July 2014, with chairwomen coming and going and lawyers quitting their posts. Following the death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile in 2011, hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children. The spotlight has also fallen on sexual assaults carried out in schools, children's homes and at NHS sites. Jimmy Savile died in 2011 At the same time, there have been claims of past failures by police and prosecutors to properly investigate allegations. The inquiry was announced by the then Home Secretary Theresa May to ""expose those failures and learn the lessons"" from the past. When it was announced, the inquiry was expected to take about five years to complete. When finished, it will publish a final report of recommendations. It has already published aninterim report,externalwith 18 recommendations - some of which have been acted upon - plus other investigation reports. The inquiry is divided into public hearings into specific areas of concern, with witnesses giving evidence under oath; research into institutional failures in child protection, and theTruth Project,,externalin which victims share their experiences with the inquiry either in private interviews or written form. The inquiry will not seek to determine civil or criminal liability of individuals or organisations but may reach ""findings of fact"" in relation to this. Allegations of child abuse received by the inquiry will be referred to police and material related to Scotland, Northern Ireland or British Overseas Territories will be passed on to the authorities there. A separateinquiry looking at the abuse of children in care in Scotland,externalhas been set up by the Scottish Government. The inquiry is being led byProf Alexis Jay,external, a former director of social services who headed theinquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. She is being assisted by apanel of advisers,external: law professor and human rights expert Malcolm Evans; child protection barrister Ivor Frank; and lawyer Drusilla Sharpling, a former Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, who has worked as an inspector of constabulary since 2009. A separate panel, made up of eight members,represents victims and survivors,externaland advises the inquiry on all aspects of its work. There is also a Victims and Survivors' Forum. Brian Altman QC is lead counsel,externalto the inquiry. The inquiry's public hearings consisted of15 separate investigations,external. The inquiry is investigating: the institutional responses to the sexual exploitation of children by organised abuse networks alleged failings at Lambeth Council; the Roman Catholic Church; residential schools, and the support services and legal remedies available to victims and survivors current child protection policies and practices in religious institutions in England and Wales - including non-conformist Christian denominations, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism and Buddhism, as well as tuition classes, groups and camps linked to religious beliefs the effective leadership of child protection institutions tasked with safeguarding them against sexual abuse the institutional responses to child sexual abuse allegations against the late Lord Janner, the former Labour peer who in 2015 was ruled unfit to stand trial on child sex abuse charges As of October 2020,eight of its investigations are complete,external. Their conclusions included: the Church of England failed to protect children from sexual abuse, andcreated a culture where abusers ""could hide"", with more support given to alleged perpetrators than to survivors authorities in the UK are failing to use the powers they haveto stop British sex offenders travelling abroadto abuse children. As of 31 March 2018,only about 0.2 per cent,externalof the 58,637 registered sex offenders in England and Wales had their foreign travel restricted internet companies must do more to tackle""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuseon their platforms, including more stringent age checks and screening images before publication hundreds of children were sexually abused bypredatory foster carers and residential home staff who were allowed to thrive, with Nottingham City and Nottinghamshire County councils accused of exposing vulnerable children to repeated rapes and physical abuse political institutionsfailed to respond to historical claims of child sexual abusebut there was no evidence of an organised paedophile network at Westminster thousands of people forcibly sent abroad as children, many of whom were abused in institutions,should receive compensation. The government has subsequently opened a compensation scheme to pay Â£20,000 each to about 2,000 eligible survivors the former council leader in Rochdale, Richard Farnell, ""lied"" in evidenceto the inquiry and his claim that he was unaware of abuse in a hostel, school and other places in the town over 20 years ""defies belief"". He rejected those conclusions children in custody in England and Wales are still at risk of physical and sexual abuse, withmore than 1,000 reported incidents between 2009 and 2017 the Catholic schools system ""prioritised monks and their own reputationsover the protection of children"", meaning pupils suffered ""appalling"" abuse over a 40-year period An interim reportconcluded that common responses to child abuse ""deflected responsibility away from perpetrators and institutions"". John Glynn is among the victims of the UK's child migrant policy The main bone of contention in the inquiry's early years was who is in charge. The first chairwoman, appointed in July 2014, was Baroness Butler-Sloss. However, sheresigned just one week laterafter concerns arose around her links to the establishment - namely her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, who was attorney general in the 1980s. In September 2014, Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf was named the new head, but after disclosing she had been to five dinners with the late Lord Brittan - one of the people facing accusations at the time, which have since been dropped - shequit by the end of October. In February 2015, Justice Lowell Goddard, a serving judge of the High Court of New Zealand, took over the reins and was in charge as the inquiry began hearing directly from victims and survivors. But by August 2016, she hadresigned from her postas well due to ""compounding difficulties"" and her family life. A number of lawyers have also resigned or been removed from the process. In November 2016, the largest of the victims' groups involved in the inquiry, the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association, said it hadlost confidence in the inquiry's leadership. But despite threatening to pull out of the inquiry, they remain core participants. A legal case relating to allegations of abuse relating to Lord Janner has been dropped. The case had previously caused hearings to be delayed because of an ""overlap"" with the criminal investigation. It wasconfirmed in March that the hearings would go aheadin October, with some proceedings taking place in private. Lord Janner's family have always maintained his innocence. IICSA is funded by the Home Office and spent Â£35.3m in the 2019/20 financial year. According to the financial report,about Â£12.3m was on staffing with nearly Â£12m on legal costs,external. Previous total annual costs were Â£36.6m in2018/19,external; Â£28.5m in2017/18,external; Â£20.8m in2016/17,external; and Â£14.7m in2015/16.,external Prof Jay was paid Â£190,522 in the past financial year, plus Â£35,536 accommodation allowance.

Analysis: How did Savile get away with it?,"Jimmy Savile presenting Top of the Pops in 1973 Back in 1980,  a nine-year-old boy called Dan Davies went to see Jimmy Savile at a recording of Jim'll Fix It. Watching his demeanour on set between takes left him, he says, feeling disturbed. ""He seemed cold, odd. I just felt uncomfortable."" As an adult, Mr Davies interviewed Savile again and again.  He knew there was something dark about him but he did not know what. Thirty-five years after that first encounter, he published what is the most comprehensive account of Savile's life and crimes.  And yet he had been as surprised as anyone when the flood of revelations about him emerged two years before. How did Savile get away with it? In 1971, a 15-year-old girl was found dead.  She was known to her friends as Samantha. In the papers she was called Claire McAlpine where she was described as a ""dolly dancer"" on Top of the Pops. The death, from an overdose of sleeping pills, was front page news. Just before, her mother had contacted the BBC to complain that a DJ had seduced her. In her diary she is said to have described seeing two DJs.  Savile was not suspected of sleeping with her but the inquiry was described by Dame Janet Smith as ""wholly inadequate"" - more concerned about protecting the reputation of the BBC than getting at the truth. In a separate inquiry, Savile admitted to the bosses at Radio One that their suspicions were right. He had been taking girls - 14 year olds - back to his flat from Top of the Pops but only because they did not have a place to stay for the night.  Doreen Davies, a former Radio One executive, said it seemed to be entirely plausible - kind hearted. Dame Janet Smith says the BBC failed to investigate the ""warning signs"" adequately.  She does not believe that senior managers knew about Jimmy Savile but she certainly thinks there was a corporate failure to take the issue of protecting young people. What's perhaps even more surprising is that when there were front page stories about Top of the Pops in the 1970s, the BBC's Board of Management were pleased that Savile went to the papers to discuss life behind the scenes at Top of the Pops. In the interview, he describes how it was like a high class discotheque and that, yes, he did go on dates but he only visited homes when parents were present.  He was approaching 50 at the time. Dame Janet Smith accepts that attitudes towards older men having relationships with young girls has changed but adds that it is not an excuse for the BBC. Canon David Winter is a former head of religious broadcasting for the BBC.  He has written a shelf  of books on theology.  He was also Savile's boss. In the 1970s, Savile presented a programme called Speakeasy.  He brought a large youth audience and was happy to do programmes on moral and ethical issues. Savile, Canon Winter said, would in private ""go on about girls"" and so one day he questioned how this squared with the DJ's ""professed Roman Catholic faith"".  Savile said it was simple, he would get in to heaven because of his charity work. So did Canon Winter think Savile was abusing young girls?  He didn't.  He thought it was bluster - the invention of an odd mother-obsessed loner.  He suspected he was gay.   He also adds he and his colleagues were probably ""deluded by celebrity"". The Dame Janet Smith report is filled with similar stories. Savile did not spend time with colleagues, he didn't even in the 70s give the BBC a phone number.  The head of Radio One's press office, Rodney Collins, rang Leeds General Infirmary's porters office if he wanted to get hold of him. Some, however, suspected the truth.   Wilfred De'Ath was a BBC radio producer in the 1960s.  Since then his life has had many ups and downs.  He has lost touch with his family,  become homeless and had a spell in prison for theft. But back in the early 60s his lifestyle was rather more orderly and he made a programme called Teenscene.   One day he decided he would interview Savile.  Savile agreed, so long as they could meet first in a restaurant on London's Edgware Road.  When De'Ath arrived he found Savile with a young girl.  ""Prepubescent"", he says. Afterwards he spoke again to Savile and asked if he wasn't ""living dangerously"".  That was, he says, as brave as he got.  The idea of reporting the incident was he feels  ""out of the question - it wasn't a moral issue"".  Savile was daring him to say something knowing that he could deny everything.   He was, he says, also ""physically intimidating"". It is something that appears again and again in the report.  Staff are said to have received complaints from victims and done nothing.  Some 117 people gave evidence saying they had heard rumours or seen things that were inappropriate but did not report them. The culture, Dame Janet says,  was to turn a ""blind eye"" - especially towards stars. With Stuart Hall she goes much further, naming two senior managers who she says should have done more.  It wasn't just a matter of missing a few ""warning signs"". And today?  Dame Janet says ""whistle-blowing"" is now easier but says many of the same fears about the consequences still exist.

Thatcher fought to knight Savile,"Lady Thatcher sought the honour for Savile's charity work Senior civil servants repeatedly warned Margaret Thatcher about the risks of giving Jimmy Savile a knighthood in the 1980s, one describing the broadcaster as a ""strange and complex man"". Newly released documents show the ex-prime minister lobbied officials for recognition of Savile's charity work. But mandarins rebuffed her requests, citing Savile's ""manner of life"" and fears he might exploit the honour. Savile, a friend of the former PM, was ultimately knighted in 1990. The previously secret documents were obtainedby the Sun newspaper,externalfollowing a Freedom of Information request. The Cabinet Office said there was no indication in them that the prime minister or any officials knew about the allegations of sexual abuse and paedophilia against Savile - which emerged in full after his death in 2011. The heavily redacted papers show that Lady Thatcher first wrote to Sir Robert Armstrong, the most senior civil servant in the country at the time and chair of the honours committee, about the issue of a knighthood for Savile in 1983. Sir Robert vetoed the idea, saying it was too soon after ""unfortunate revelations"" in which the entertainer had boasted to the media of having sex with women he met while running charity marathons. The prime minister raised the matter again just months later but Sir Robert said ""lurid details"" were unlikely to be have been forgotten and it ""would be best if Mr Savile were to wait a little longer"". ""We remain worried,"" he added. ""Fears have been expressed that Mr Savile might not be able to refrain from exploiting a knighthood in a way which brought the honours system into disrepute."" After further requests were also turned down, the prime minister's private secretary Nigel Wicks wrote to Sir Robert in 1986 saying that she was ""most disappointed that Mr Savile's name has not been recommended"". He added: ""She [Thatcher] wonders how many more times his name is to be pushed aside, especially in view of all the great work he had done for Stoke Mandeville [hospital]."" At the time, the government was leading a high-profile promotional campaign warning about the dangers of Aids and Sir Robert wrote back stating that Savile's acknowledged ""sexual promiscuity"" should not be encouraged. ""The case of Jimmy Savile is difficult. Mr Savile is a strange and complex man. He deserves high praise for the lead he offers in giving quiet background help to the sick. But he has made no attempt to deny the accounts in the press about his private life."" Sir Robert's successor, Sir Robin Butler, refused another request from No 10 in 1987, suggesting that to honour Savile would ""not benefit the honours system in the eyes of the public"". He wrote: ""My committee and I still fear that his manner of life - on his own confession - has been such that a high award for him would be an unhelpful signal when we are still grappling with an Aids problem which threatens to intensify."" The documents released cover all correspondence between ministers and civil servants on the issue. They do not shed any light on why, after repeated refusals, Savile was finally awarded a knighthood in 1990 - weeks after Lady Thatcher stood down as PM. The Cabinet Office initially refused the FOI request, citing concerns about the potential impact of publication on continuing investigations into alleged abuse by Savile at hospitals, care homes and on BBC premises. The Sun appealed against the decision and the Information Commissioner ruled that there was a ""compelling public interest"" to release the files. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""There is no indication in the papers that anything was known then about the allegations that have subsequently come to light about Jimmy Savile. The honours process was followed in accordance with the system at the time."" A report earlier this year detailed 214 crimes recorded against Savile across 28 police force areas spanning several decades. More than 90 people - who are among 450 alleged victims of abuse - are pursuing legal action against the broadcaster's estate and his former employers in the wake of the revelations. Previously released correspondence showed that Savile wrote to Lady Thatcher in 1980 and she subsequently invited him to Chequers. The PM regularly attended New Year's Eve parties thrown by the broadcaster. Savile raised Â£30m for good causes and was awarded an OBE in 1971.

"Bloody Sunday murder charges for soldierThe sole prosecution is seen as a ""terrible disappointment"" by some of the families of the 13 people killed.Northern Ireland","James Wray and William McKinney were among 13 people shot dead at a civil rights march A former British soldier faces murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. The sole prosecution is seen as a ""terrible disappointment"" by some of the families of the 13 people killed. They were shot dead at a civil rights march on 30 January 1972. The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Bloody Sunday decision reaction What next after Bloody Sunday charges? What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Internment, protest and Bloody Sunday,external Bloody Sunday prosecution decision in pictures The shootings led to widespread anger in Derry and further afield. This video can not be played What was Bloody Sunday? On the same day as the funerals were held for 11 of the Bloody Sunday victims, the British Embassy in Dublin was burned to the ground by an angry crowd. Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. BBC News NI's Home Affairs Correspondent Julian O'Neill said it could be a ""period of months"" before Soldier F makes his first court appearance. The former paratrooper is being referred to only as Soldier F because all military witnesses were granted anonymity through the Saville Inquiry into the circumstances around the killings. The PPS said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute 16 other soldiers and two Official IRA men. James Wray's brother Liam said he was ""very saddened for the other families"" of those killed on Bloody Sunday. ""Their hearts must be broken,"" he said. ""It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved."" He added: ""There are a lot of sad and heartbroken people today."" A number of relatives of those killed walked to Derry city centre ahead of the PPS decision. William McKinney's brother Michael said it was ""disappointing"" for families who had not received news of prosecutions. Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: ""It has been a long road for the families... and today will be another extremely difficult day for many of them. ""We wanted to meet them personally to explain the decisions taken and to help them understand the reasons."" Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she feels ""let down by a law and a justice system that's supposed to protect people"". This video can not be played Linda Nash, whose brother William was killed on Bloody Sunday says: ""We will keep going"". ""I'm feeling devastated.

This video can not be played One soldier will be prosecuted over Bloody Sunday, the PPS said Soldier F gave evidence anonymously to the Saville Inquiry in 2003 and admitted firing 13 rounds on Bloody Sunday. His assertion that there were ""gunmen and bombers killed"" was rejected in Lord Saville's report. The Saville Inquiry stated that there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot father-of-six Paddy Doherty, who was unarmed. Saville also found there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot an unarmed Bernard McGuigan on Bloody Sunday as he went to the aid of Patrick Doherty, waving a white handkerchief. At the Saville Inquiry, Soldier F admitted he had shot 17-year-old Michael Kelly - but he said that he had only fired at people with bombs or weapons. However, Saville concluded Mr Kelly was unarmed. The Saville Inquiry found that both William McKinney and James Wray could have been shot by Soldier F and three other soldiers. The inquiry report also stated Soldier F had changed his story over the years. Bloody Sunday gained notoriety around the world, partly due to the image of a Catholic priest waving a bloodstained handkerchief as he tried to help a victim Mr Herron said the decisions to prosecute announced on Thursday ""relate only to allegations of criminal conduct on Bloody Sunday itself"". ""Consideration will now be given to allegations of perjury in respect of those suspects reported by police,"" he said. by Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent Bloody Sunday might have happened 47 years ago, but it has cast a very long shadow, extending far beyond victims' families and those involved. It fuelled the Troubles and, two decades after they ended, it will once again throw a searchlight on how Northern Ireland deals with its past. Legacy issues, as they are termed, can poison the present day and they have been allowed to fester. Bloody Sunday has fed into the ongoing debate, with the government considering legislation as part of its next steps. Will that involve a de facto amnesty from prosecutions in future, and whom might that cover? This is the bigger picture against the backdrop of the Bloody Sunday decisions, significant as they are in their own right. The intention to charge a former soldier has clawed at emotions not just in Derry, but among bereaved families and victims in thousands of other Troubles cases left pondering truth and justice. The case could come before a court for a preliminary hearing quite quickly, says the legal expert, Joshua Rozenberg. He expects Soldier F to be brought before a court in Northern Ireland and to be named. UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government would offer full legal support to Soldier F - including paying his legal costs and providing welfare support. ""We are indebted to those soldiers who served with courage and distinction to bring peace to Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The welfare of our former service personnel is of the utmost importance."" He said the the Ministry of Defence is working ""to drive through a new package of safeguards to ensure our armed forces are not unfairly treated."" ""And the Government will urgently reform the system for dealing with legacy issues,"" he said. ""Our serving and former personnel cannot live in constant fear of prosecution."" Following Mr Williamson's statement, lawyers acting on behalf of the family of William Nash said they had contacted the Northern Ireland attorney general accusing the defence secretary of contempt of court. A public inquiry conducted by a senior judge in 1972 was branded a whitewash by victims' families. This video can not be played Liam Wray expressed relief that a soldier was to be prosecuted for his brother's murder After decades of campaigning, a fresh inquiry was eventually ordered by then prime minister Tony Blair in 1998. Lord Saville's 5,000-page report stated none of the casualties was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury and that soldiers had lost their self-control. The prime minister at the time of the report's publication, David Cameron, apologised for the soldiers' conduct, saying the killings were unjustified and unjustifiable, A police investigation into Bloody Sunday followed Lord Saville's 12-year, Â£200m public inquiry. A file was sent to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in November 2016. In total, police reported 20 suspects to the PPS - 18 of them former soldiers, one of whom died last year. Papers before prosecutors included 668 witness statements and numerous photos, video and audio evidence. The march began shortly after 15:00 GMT on 30 January 1972, and the intended destination was the city centre. However, Army barricades blocked marchers. The majority of demonstrators were instead directed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. Graffitti appeared on Free Derry Corner after the announcement on Thursday After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. Two people were shot and wounded. At 16:07, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10, soldiers began to open fire. According to Army evidence, 21 soldiers fired their weapons, discharging 108 live rounds between them. Tense wait for Bloody Sunday decision What happened on Bloody Sunday?

Key UK contractor faces administrationThe outsourcing giant has been seeking support for a rescue deal from shareholders and lenders.Business,"Interserve has a cleaning contract for Network Rail stations Outsourcing giant Interserve faces a crunch vote on Friday over its proposed rescue plan. If shareholders fail to back the debt-for-equity deal, the firm could go into administration by the weekend. The firm employs 65,000 staff worldwide, 45,000 in the UK, cleaning schools and hospitals, running probation services and building roads and bridges. Interserve has said the company ""is in a critical financial situation"". It accumulated debt after construction project delays and a failed energy-from-waste project in Derby and Glasgow and hopes shareholders will agree to the strategy, although it would dilute shareholders' holdings. Attention focused on Interserve's financial situation after fellow contracting and construction giant Carillion collapsed in January last year with debts of Â£1.5bn. Following Carillion's collapse, the government launched a pilot of so-called ""living wills"" for contractors, designed to ensure that if companies fail, other contractors are ready to step in to fulfill contracts. Interserve is one of five suppliers taking part. Simon Jack: Interserve facing administration Interserve agrees rescue plan with creditors The proposed rescue plan involves cutting the firm's debts from nearly Â£650m to Â£275m. Interserve would issue new shares which it would give to its creditors in exchange for debt. That would hand lenders the lion's share of the firm, and existing shareholders would be left with heavily watered-down shareholdings totalling just 5% of the firm's worth. ""Our plan preserves some value for shareholders. This will not be the case if the proposals are voted down,"" the firm said. Interserve's largest shareholder, Coltrane Asset Management, has opposed the proposed rescue. The New York-based hedge fund has been pushing for an alternative deal whereby a smaller proportion of the firm goes to lenders, and shareholders retain a larger holding. If no rescue plan is approved the company is likely to go into a pre-pack administration, which would wipe out shareholders entirely but allow the firm to keep operating. A pre-pack administration lets a company sell itself, or its assets, as a going concern, without affecting the operation of the business. Administrators take over the running of the business to protect creditors and shareholders lose their investments. Interserve rescue plan prompts share collapse Government reassures over Interserve The outsourcing firm is one of the UK's largest public services providers.  The firm started in dredging and construction, and from there has diversified into a wide range of services, such as healthcare and catering, for clients in government and industry. It sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects. It is the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5's Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. And at King George Hospital in east London, for instance, Interserve has a Â£35m contract for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance. Both the rescue deal and the pre-pack administration are designed to keep those contracts going and jobs in place, at least in the short term. BBC business editor Simon Jack Interserve, one of the government's biggest providers of public services, may go into administration later. The firm is holding a crucial shareholder vote to decide whether to accept a rescue plan which would see its lenders write off hundreds of millions of pounds in debt in exchange for new shares. It employs 45,000 people in the UK and relies on contracts to serve schools, hospital and the army for 70% of its revenue. The company is drowning in Â£650m of debt and its woes have invited comparisons with failed contractor Carillion which went bust just over a year ago. However, the government - which put Interserve under intense supervision 18 months ago - insists that if the rescue deal is not approved and the company does go bust, there is a plan to bring the company out of administration over this weekend. This arrangement will see the lenders take control of the company, essential services will not be interrupted, but current shareholders will see their shares rendered worthless. That includes the company's biggest shareholder, US firm Coltrane Asset Management, which has opposed the deal but is thought to be interested in buying pieces of the company after administration. Whatever happens on Friday, the financial disaster at Interserve is certain to revive the debate around the role of the private sector in providing public services. The firm's shares have plunged over the past year. Just over a year ago, they were worth 100p each. Currently they're trading at 9.6p each. The RMT union said that events around Interserve suggested the current business model of using outside contractors for public services was ""broken"". The union said the Interserve contract to clean and service railway stations in the southern section should be taken over by Network Rail. General Secretary of the RMT Union, Mick Cash, said bringing the contracts in-house would ""avoid a repeat of the Carillion chaos."" ""âOnce again we see the reality of bandit capitalism and its toxic impact on our public services. The time has come to end this obsession with the private sector speculators and return to the principles of public services run and owned by the public, free from this corrosive nonsense,"" he said.

"Police bait thieves with fake masterpieceAfter a day of mourning the loss of a masterpiece, an Italian mayor reveals it was all a trick.Europe","This copy of Crucifixion, by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, is housed in Budapest Police in Italy are unconcerned about the daring theft of a Flemish master's painting - because they had replaced it with a fake a month ago. The painting by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, worth millions, apparently vanished from a church on Wednesday. Thieves used a hammer to smash open its display case and made off in a car. Hours later, Italian police revealed they had heard rumours of the planned heist - and installed cameras to catch the thieves in the act. The painting of the crucifixion had also been replaced with a copy, and the original kept safe and sound, they said. It all happened in the town of Castelnuovo Magra in Liguria, where the painting of the crucifixion is kept in a side alcove of the Santa Maria Maddalena church. The surveillance footage of the raid is now being carefully studied and investigators are chasing down those responsible. Earlier, before the switch was revealed, Mayor Daniele Montebello told Italy's Ansa news agency that the painting was ""a work of inestimable value, a hard blow for our community"". Stolen Degas painting found on a bus The mystery of the stolen Klimt The world's most famous missing painting On Wednesday night, he revealed he had been in on the ruse, explaining that ""today for investigative reasons we could not reveal anything"". He also thanked members of the church for holding their peace - ""because some faithful had noticed that the one on display was not the original, but did not reveal the secret"". Pieter Brueghel the Younger was the son of another Flemish artist - Pieter Bruegel the Elder - and is famous for both his own paintings and the copies he made of his father's work.
