UK Brexit negotiator calls for 'realism' from EU,"Lord Frost (left) and Michel Barnier (right) will meet on Tuesday for the latest round of trade talks The UK's chief Brexit negotiator has called for ""realism"" from the EU ahead of the next round of trade talks beginning in London. Lord Frost said there was ""still time"" for the two sides to agree a post-Brexit trade deal for next year. But he said the EU needed to recognise the UK's negotiating position came from that of a ""sovereign state"". His words follow a pledge from Boris Johnson to walk away from the talks if a deal isn't done by 15 October. The EU said it would ""do everything in [its] power to reach an agreement"" with the UK, but ""will be ready"" for a no-deal scenario. The exchange also comes afterNo 10 revealed it would be introducing new legislationon customs rules in Northern Ireland, in case the negotiations fail. The announcement has led to concerns from Brussels that the UK would not deliver on the withdrawal agreement, made ahead of its exit from the bloc in January. But the government said the legislation would only result in ""minor clarifications"" and it was committed to the earlier deal. 'One train of thought in DUP' on NI Protocol New Brexit law will not 'tear up' EU trade plans What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The transition period - which sees the UK following a number of the EU's rules while the two sides try to negotiate a trade deal - is due to end on 31 December. If a deal is not made and ratified by parliaments across Europe by then, the UK will move onto trading with the bloc on World Trade Organisation rules, which would involve tariffs. Critics fear this would damage the economy. Mr Johnson has ruled out any extension to the talks and, despite both sides admitting to little progress recently, he has set a deadline of mid-October - when the European Council is due to meet. In an email to Conservative Party members on Monday, the prime minister said if there was no agreement by that date, ""then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on"". This video can not be played BBC Reality Checkâs Chris Morris looks at where the UK and EU are struggling to agree on their future relationship Lord Frost, who has led the UK's team of negotiators in talks since March, will meet his opposite number from the EU, Michel Barnier, on Tuesday at the start of the eighth round of talks between the two sides. He was introduced as a peer for the first time in the House of Lords earlier, having been ennobled by Mr Johnson in July. Lord Frost was introduced in the House of Lords earlier Speaking ahead of his meeting with Mr Barnier, Lord Frost promised to ""drive home our clear message that we must make progress this week if we are to reach an agreement in time"". Lord Frost added: ""We have now been talking for six months and can no longer afford to go over well-trodden ground. We need to see more realism from the EU about our status as an independent country. ""As we have done from the beginning in public and in private, I will reinforce our simple, reasonable request for a free trade agreement based on those the EU has signed before with like-minded partners."" Lord Frost said the UK had ""listened closely"" to the bloc's team and ""signalled flexibility"" on where it can move, but added: ""We have repeatedly made clear that key elements of our position derive from the fundamentals of being a sovereign state, and it's time for the EU to fully recognise this reality."" He said the UK was ""ramping up"" preparations for a no-deal outcome, but also said he hoped progress could be made this week. Beyond all the talk, there is a genuine frustration in government that the EU is yet to treat the UK as if it were a fully sovereign country. That's matched on the EU side by similar irritation that the UK won't budge. But the bad tempers do not necessarily mean that a deal won't be reached. And all the blood curdling vows don't mean that in the end there won't be compromise. Read more from Laura European Commission spokesman Dan Ferie said the EU had ""engaged constructively and in good faith"" with the talks so far and would be ""fully concentrated on making the most out of this week's negotiating round"". But, while he said the bloc shared the UK's ""desire to reach a deal quickly"", it should be ""in line with the EU's long-term economic and political interests"". Mr Ferie added: ""The EU has made numerous constructive proposals to move the negotiations forward. ""And Michel Barnier has repeatedly said that there needs to be enough time later this year for the European Parliament and the Council to have their say on any agreement. ""Whether or not there is an agreement in place by the end of the year, the UK's decision to leave the single market and the customs union will inevitably create barriers to trade across border exchanges that do not exist today.""

New Brexit law will not 'tear up' EU trade plans,"The government will introduce a new law that could change post-Brexit customs plans with the EU - but No 10 denied it would ""tear up"" the existing treaty. The two sides agreed in 2019 on the terms of the UK's exit, including on future trade in Northern Ireland. Reports suggested a new law could ""override"" the legal force of that deal - the withdrawal agreement. But Downing Street said it would only make ""minor clarifications in extremely specific areas"". No 10 confirmed the new UK Internal Market Bill will be published on Wednesday. The EU said the ""full implementation"" of the withdrawal agreement was a ""prerequisite for the negotiations on the future partnership"" between the bloc and the UK. Ministers plan laws overriding part of Brexit deal What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The news comes at the start of another week of negotiations on that future trade deal. The so-called transition period - which has been in place since the UK left the EU in January - will end on 31 December and the two sides are trying to secure an agreement to take its place. But Boris Johnson said if a deal was not reached by the European Council meeting on 15 October, both sides should ""move on"" - meaning the UK would go on to trade with the bloc on international trading terms. Beyond all the talk, there is a genuine frustration in government that the EU is yet to treat the UK as if it were a fully sovereign country. That's matched on the EU side by similar irritation that the UK won't budge. But the bad tempers do not necessarily mean that a deal won't be reached. And all the blood curdling vows don't mean that in the end there won't be compromise. Read more from Laura Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said if the government's latest moves were negotiating tactics, they were not ""very effective"". She told BBC News: ""It undermines all the progress that's been made over the last several months and completely jeopardises a future trading relationship."" Boris Johnson signed the withdrawal agreement in January The two sides signed off on a withdrawal agreement last year ahead of the UK leaving the bloc on 31 January. The document covered a number of areas, from how much the UK would have to pay for its ""divorce bill"" through to intentions for a future relationship. But one of the biggest sticking points throughout negotiations had been how to handle the issue of Northern Ireland. Both the UK and EU sides were committed to protecting the peace process in the region and preventing any reintroduction of border checks on the island of Ireland. But they also accepted the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would become the UK's border with the EU, so customs rules needed to be respected and adhered to. The UK and EU settled on the Northern Ireland Protocol. This would see Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU customs rules after the transition period - meaning customs declarations would be needed for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, as well as some new checks on goods going from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. It was unpopular with some sections of the Tory backbenches and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which had been supporting the government until that point. But the agreement was passed through Parliament and the Northern Ireland Protocol became part of the international treaty. Both the UK and EU are committed to no new border checks on the island of Ireland No 10 has said it is committed to the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol. And it said it was continuing its work with the EU in a joint committee to iron out issues around how it would work in practice. However, it said it wanted to have something in place to protect trade across the four nations of the UK if an agreement was not reached by the end of the year. The text of the bill has yet to be published, so we cannot say for definite what will be included in its wording. But Downing Street said one thing it would do is allow ministers to unilaterally decide what particular goods were ""at risk"" of entering the EU when passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and therefore subject to EU tariffs. The law would also give ministers the powers to scrap export declarations on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and would make it clear that EU state aid requirements - where governments give financial support to homegrown businesses - would only apply in Northern Ireland. But the government insists the bill only introduces ""limited and reasonable steps"" to ""remove ambiguity"" - not ""overriding"" the withdrawal agreement, as government sources had suggested on Sunday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the Northern Ireland Protocol is ""essential"" There has been concern from Brussels over the messages coming out from Downing Street. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that she trusted the UK government ""to implement the Withdrawal Agreement, an obligation under international law and prerequisite for any future partnership"". And she added that the Northern Ireland Protocol was ""essential to protect peace and stability on the island and integrity of the single market"". Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neilltweeted,externalany threat of backtracking on the protocol would be a ""treacherous betrayal which would inflict irreversible harm on the all-Ireland economy and the Good Friday Agreement"". She has co-signed a joint letter from anti-Brexit parties in Northern Ireland to the prime minister and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, saying it would be ""entirely unacceptable [to] abandon these safeguards and mitigations"". Labour accused the government of ""misleading the public"" over having a so-called ""oven-ready deal"" for Brexit. This video can not be played Failing to implement the EU Withdrawal Agreement would be âcompletely pig-headedâ, the shadow Northern Secretary says. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Parliament supported the Withdrawal Agreement earlier on this year. He has made promises and signed a treaty around these arrangements for Northern Ireland, and he now seems to be backing out of that."" And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid,externalthe move would ""significantly increase"" the likelihood of leaving the transition period without a trade deal, and the ""resulting damage to the economy will be entirely Tory-inflicted. What charlatans"". But government sources told the BBC the legislation was ""not intended to derail the talks"", and a spokeswoman said the UK would continue to approach talks with the EU in good faith. ""As a responsible government, we are considering fallback options in the event this is not achieved, to ensure the communities of Northern Ireland are protected,"" she added.

Russia's Navalny out of coma after poisoning,"Alexei Navalny was flown to Berlin for treatment in August after falling ill on a plane Doctors treating Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny say he is out of an induced coma and his condition, since being poisoned, has improved. He is responding to verbal stimuli, they said. Mr Navalny, 44, was flown to Germany after falling ill on a flight in Siberia in August. His team allege he was poisoned on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who denies any involvement. German doctors say the Putin critic was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. On Monday, the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin said in a statement thatMr Navalny was being weaned off mechanical ventilation,external. ""He is responding to verbal stimuli. It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning,"" it said. It also said doctors were in close contact with Mr Navalny's wife. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, tweeted,external: ""News about Alexei. Today he was taken out of induced coma. Gradually he will be switched off from a ventilator. He responds to speech and to being addressed to."" Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who in recent years has become the most prominent opposition politician in Putin's Russia. Mr Navalny fell ill on 20 August on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea at Tomsk airport. ""Alexei started moaning and screaming. He was clearly in pain. He was lying on the floor in the part of the plane reserved for cabin crew,""a passenger seated near Mr Navalny on the plane told BBC Russian. The plane was diverted to Omsk, where the opposition politician was admitted to an emergency hospital. Russian officials initially refused to allow Mr Navalny to be transferred abroad for medical treatment but after three days he was flown by air ambulance to Berlin. Mr Navalny is being treated at the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin, Germany Last week, doctors in Germany said the results of toxicology tests carried out at a military laboratory gave ""unequivocal proof"" that Mr Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Doctors in Omsk insisted that no poisonous substances had been detected in Mr Navalny's body when he was under their care. On Monday, the Kremlin said it was ""absurd"" to blame Russia for Mr Navalny's poisoning. ""Attempts to somehow associate Russia with what happened are unacceptable to us, they are absurd,"" Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the allegation that Novichok was used was not backed up by evidence. A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. A UK investigation blamed the Russian state. On Monday, the British government summoned the Russian ambassador to the UK ""to register deep concern about the poisoning"". ""It's completely unacceptable that a banned chemical weapon has been used and Russia must hold a full, transparent investigation,""Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday.,external. In Germany there is growing pressure for Chancellor Angela Markel to take a tougher stance over the incident. Last week, she said Mr Navalny was the victim of attempted murder and that the world would look to Russia for answers. Analysis by Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin Alexei Navalny's condition has improved but the German-Russian relationship looks far less healthy. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas says that if Moscow fails to co-operate with investigations into the poisoning within the next few days, Berlin will start talking to European partners about sanctions. An even more explosive threat is that for the first time Angela Merkel's government is no longer ruling out halting building work on the nearly completed pipeline Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to bring Russian gas to Germany using a pipeline beneath the Baltic Sea. But stopping the project would be costly. Around 120 European companies are involved and the total cost is more than â¬9bn (Â£8bn; $10.6bn). Germany would have to pay damages. Chancellor Merkel may be under pressure. But German society is divided on how to deal with the Kremlin and German attitudes towards Russia are varied and complex. So tough anti-Moscow rhetoric is not a vote-winner. If action is needed, Mrs Merkel's preference will be targeted and co-ordinated action with the rest of the EU. A spokesman for the German government said on Monday that it was too early to make a decision about Nord Stream. He said that Russia had ""serious questions"" to answer but that a response could not be expected in ""three to four days"". The project must be completed despite current ""difficulties"", said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak according to Interfax news agency. TheEuropean Union has demanded a ""transparent"" investigation,externalby the Russian government. USPresident Donald Trump has refused to condemn Russiasaying the case was ""tragic"" but he has not seen proof of Mr Putin's involvement. When asked on Monday about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Mr Trump re-iterated US opposition to the gas project. There have been a number of previous attacks on high-profile critics or opponents of President Putin, including politicians, intelligence officers and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied involvement. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has led nationwide protests against the Russian authorities. He first made his mark in 2008 when he started blogging about alleged malpractice and corruption at some of Russia's big state-controlled corporations. Russia's vociferous Putin critic He has called Mr Putin's party a place of ""crooks and thieves"" that is ""sucking the blood out of Russia"", and has faced attacks in the past. However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in recent elections because of a conviction for embezzlement. He denies the crime, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism. Two hours that saved Navalny's life Russia's vociferous Putin critic What are Novichok nerve agents?

Birmingham stabbings victim 'was light of our life',"Jacob Billington was out with friends when he was stabbed on Sunday A 23-year-old man who was stabbed to death in Birmingham city centre has been named as Jacob Billington. Mr Billington was attacked in Irving Street in the early hours of Sunday while he was out with old school friends, police said. Seven other people were injured at four locations over a period of 90 minutes. A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. West Midlands Police said Mr Billington, from Crosby, Merseyside, was on a school reunion night out with friends. One of the group, also 23, was seriously injured and remains in hospital in a critical condition. Latest updates on Birmingham stabbings In a statement Mr Billington's family said: ""Jacob was the light of our life and we have been devastated by his loss. ""He was a funny, caring and wonderful person who was loved by every single person he met. ""He lit up every room with his boundless energy and witty humour and the loss of such a special person will be felt by all who knew him for years to come."" This video can not be played Birmingham stabbings: Witness chases knifeman after attack Police were first called out just after 00:30 BST on Sunday at Constitution Hill, where a man sustained a superficial injury. About 20 minutes later they were sent to Livery Street, near Snow Hill railway station, where they found a 30-year-old man with critical injuries and a woman who was also hurt. At 01:50, officers were despatched to Irving Street, where Mr Billington was found with fatal injuries and his friend seriously hurt. About 10 minutes later, police were called to Hurst Street, in the city's Gay Village, to find a 22-year-old woman had been critically injured and two men less badly hurt. Police initially reported the critically injured man's age as 19 and the critically injured woman's as 32. The attacks happened at four locations across Birmingham city centre The suspect was arrestedat an address in the Selly Oak area of the cityat about 04:00 on Monday and remains in custody. Three other people, two men and a woman, from the same property were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Ch Supt Steve Graham said: ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with Jacob's family and friends after receiving such shocking news, particularly for those who were sharing their night out with him. ""It's utterly shocking that a friends' reunion should end so brutally. ""Equally the families of the other victims have been left devastated by the events of Sunday morning and we are working hard to discover what led to the apparently random attacks."" Questions have been raised about how the suspect was able to move around the city for 90 minutes. Responding to this, Chief Constable Dave Thompson said: ""Engaging in an ill-informed critique of this investigation, particularly at such an early stage, is both unhelpful and simply makes the job of the police harder."" Mr Thompson described the knife attacks as ""extraordinary"", adding: ""These are events quite unlike anything I have seen on our streets before.""

Lockdown restrictions extended in west of Scotland,"More than 1.1 million people are now affected by tougher restrictions on home visits after they were extended to two more areas in the west of Scotland. The measures came into force in East Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire at midnight after a rise in cases. The rules had already been reimposed in Glasgow city, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire last week. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said acting quickly now could ""stem the tide of transmission"" in the area. But she has warned that there is a""definite trend"" of rising case numbers across Scotland. What are the rules in the new lockdown areas? Measures werereimposed in parts of the greater Glasgow arealast week in response to a rise in coronavirus cases. People are being told not to host people from other households inside their own homes, or visit another person's home. Meetings in pubs and restaurants and outdoor areas are still permitted - although the Scottish government said the hospitality sector would be monitored in the coming days to see whether restrictions should be extended. A further 78 positive cases were reported in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board on Monday. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""The hope is that we will stem the tide"" Ms Sturgeon said it was ""too early"" to say whether the fresh lockdown had had any effect on cases. The measures are targeted at household meetings, with Ms Sturgeon saying it was ""still the view of public health teams that the significant factor driving transmission is people meeting up in their own homes"". She said local authorities in the area would ""pay close attention to hospitality"" and would encourage people to act responsibly while using bars and restaurants. The widened restrictions - which also mean there should only be ""essential"" visits to people in hospitals and care homes - will be reviewed in a week's time. Ms Sturgeon said the measures are not yet being extended to Lanarkshire or Inverclyde - noting that levels of infection were ""significantly lower"" in Inverclyde. The restrictions will now apply to apply to 179,000 people living in Renfrewshire and 108,000 in East Dunbartonshire. The city of Glasgow has a population of 633,120, while there are 95,530 people in East Renfrewshire and 88,930 in West Dunbartonshire. Ms Sturgeon said it was ""regrettable we are in this position"", but that the measures banning household visits were ""considered proportionate but also the most effective"". She added: ""If we act quickly and preventatively now, we can stem the tide of transmission and avoid having other restrictions put in place."" The first minister had earlier warned that a continuing rise in Covid-19 cases in Scotland could see her government ""put the brakes"" on the planned easing of some restrictions. An average of 152 positive tests have been recorded each day over the past week - compared to 14 per day six weeks ago. The number of hospital admissions and deaths has not risen as sharply, although Ms Sturgeon warned that ""this may just be a matter of time"". IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

Caerphilly county to go under local lockdown,"This video can not be played Health Minister Vaughan Gething says he had to act after a ""sustained"" rise in cases The county borough of Caerphilly is to be placed under a local lockdown from 18:00 BST on Tuesday after a ""rapid"" rise in coronavirus cases. No-one will be able to leave or enter the borough without good reason, the Welsh Government said. Face masks will be required for everyone over 11 in shops within the area. People will not be able to meet indoors with others in theirextended household, nor make overnight stays. The Welsh Government said that at 55.4 cases per 100,000 population, Caerphilly county had the highest rate in Wales and one of the highest in the UK. How do I spot the symptoms of coronavirus? How do I get a coronavirus test? How close to developing a vaccine are we? It is the first local restriction announced in Wales since the start of the pandemic. Schools, bars and restaurants are not being closed under the restrictions. Care visits will be able to go ahead. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething blamed the rise in cases on people socialising in their homes. The changes mean people cannot enter or leave Caerphilly county borough - which includes Caerphilly town, Ystrad Mynach, Blackwood, Newbridge and Risca - without a ""reasonable excuse"". That includes work, if people are unable to work from home, or making a compassionate visit to a loved one, or to give care. Mr Gething said there had been a ""significant rise in cases"" in the borough over a short space of time, linked to travel abroad and people socialising indoors ""not following social distancing guidelines"". ""A lot of these cases are in younger people and thankfully, at the moment, most of these are mild."" Mr Gething told BBC Wales: ""Social distancing had broken down in large parts. ""There's been a sustained rise in cases and we've been able to trace that back to activity that has largely taken place in people's homes."" He said he knew people would be disappointed but the Welsh Government had to act after ""the sustained rise in cases"". Mr Gething said there had not been an increase in the number of people seeking medical attention but he said ""it would take two or three weeks to see that sort of impact"". Caerphilly council leader Philippa Marsden said: ""We need to create a break in the cycle of infection we are seeing in Caerphilly borough at the moment and unfortunately that means introducing new, tougher restrictions."" People will only be able to meet others outdoors for the time being as indoor meetings and gatherings will be restricted People will not be allowed to enter or leave the Caerphilly area without a reasonable excuse, such as care visits or to go to work if they are unable to work from home Everyone over 11 will be required to wear face coverings in shops Caerphilly council has already temporarily suspended visiting to care homes Source:Welsh Government,external More detail on what is considered a reasonable excuse for leaving or entering the area is expected on Tuesday. The new restrictions will apply to everyone living within the Caerphilly council area. The rules will be kept under review and enforced by the council and police, the Welsh Government said. More than 1,600 people have been tested in Caerphilly county in the past week Caerphilly county has had more new cases in the past week than anywhere else in Wales. The number of cases on Friday - 31 - was the highest in the county for a single day since the pandemic began. Caerphilly is still outside the highest case rates in the UK, which istopped by Bolton(116 per 100,000 at the most recent count) and includes Manchester and Tameside (both 50 cases per 100,000). Caerphilly county includes Blackwood (pictured), Caerphilly town, Ystrad Mynach, Risca and Newbridge Community testing started in Caerphilly county borough at the weekend. A total of 450 people were tested and 19 were found positive. The positivity rate of 4% indicated that the virus was circulating in the community, the Welsh Government said. Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said he was disappointed a local lockdown had become necessary. ""Critically, any such local lockdown must be for as short a time as possible,"" he said. Plaid Cymru South Wales East MS Delyth Jewell said: ""As cases rise across Wales the Welsh Government must now make face coverings mandatory in shops across the country.

Seven Greek islands put on England quarantine list,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps says the government now has the âdata and capacityâ to add and remove islands from quarantine list. Travellers arriving in England from seven Greek islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Wednesday, Grant Shapps has said. The islands affected are Crete, Lesvos, Mykonos, Santorini, Serifos, Tinos, and Zakynthos (also known as Zante). The government says islands can be treated differently from their mainland countries if infection rates differ. But airlines have been critical of the time it has taken - Easyjet's boss said the change was ""too little, too late"". You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? UK split over Portugal quarantine rules Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Speaking to MPs in the Commons, Transport Secretary Mr Shapps said the government would use better data to pinpoint risks on popular islands. He said that would provide ""increased flexibility"" to add or remove them from the quarantine list for England - distinct from mainland destinations - as infection rates change. He said this would ""help boost"" the UK's travel industry while continuing to keeping the travelling public safe. Mr Shapps said the coronavirus infection rate was still too high in Spain's Balearic and Canary Islands to remove them from the list of destinations from where travellers returning to England must quarantine. Travellers returning to England from Santorini must self-isolate for 14 days He said the government was ""working actively on the practicalities"" of using coronavirus testing to cut the 14-day quarantine period for people arriving in the UK from high-risk countries. Purely testing people on arrival ""would not work"", Mr Shapps said, but quarantine combined with testing was ""more promising."" ""My officials are now working with health experts with the aim of cutting the quarantine period without adding to infection risk or infringing our overall NHS test capacity,"" he said. He added that if someone was unable to quarantine for 14 days after returning to the UK ""it might be best not to travel"". Beth Maybury, who is on holiday is Crete, says she feels more comfortable there than in the UK because it is ""less crowded"". The 24-year-old from Leeds, who will return to England before the quarantine deadline, said: ""Bars etc just seem a lot quieter, the hotel seems not even at half capacity so there's plenty of room round the pool or beach. There just seems to be a lot more awareness in terms of masks too."" Karl Brown, who is on holiday in Santorini with partner Lauren, says he ""can't believe"" it is on the quarantine list because the island is ""quiet"" and social distancing is in place. The couple are due to fly back on Wednesday and say they are trying to change their flight as they are due back at work. Devolved governments set their own travel rules and there are variations across the UK nations on some countries, including Greece. Travellers arriving in Walesfrom six Greek islands must already quarantine- these islands are Crete, Lesvos, Mykonos, Paros and Antiparos and Zakynthos. The Scottish government has imposed quarantine restrictionson the whole country of Greece. Northern Ireland currently has Greece onits list of countries exempt from quarantine,external. For months, the UK government has been lukewarm about the idea of only applying travel quarantine on a regional basis. Last week it came under sustained pressure from bosses in the aviation sector. They're desperate to know when international travel might recover in a meaningful way. One airport boss was scathing, accusing the government of ""overseeing the demise of UK aviation"". The Welsh government also then decided its travel quarantine would, in the case of Greece, be managed on a regional level, with six Greek islands added to its list. The UK government says its decision to regionalise quarantine now for England is driven by improved availability of data at a regional level in countries abroad. But the change isn't silencing the critics. Easyjet is the latest big name in travel to lay into the government. Its boss told me the situation is too confusing and much of the damage has already been done. His warning to ministers: come-up with a substantial recovery plan for UK aviation or much of the damage to the sector will be permanent. Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon described the government's handling of the pandemic as ""chaotic"", saying that ""for months"" there had been no restrictions on travellers entering the UK. ""By the time restrictions were introduced, we were one of only a handful of countries in the world who had failed to take action,"" he said. Johan Lundgren, the boss of airline Easyjet, told the BBC the government's latest change to its quarantine rules was ""too little, too late"", as the peak of the summer holiday season had passed. ""This is something we have argued for a long time - it should not have been a blanket instrument when it comes to quarantine. It should be based on risk and on a much more targeted approach,"" he said. He urged the government to devise a plan for UK aviation, warning that the sector would not recover in a meaningful way without one. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? A spokesman for British Airways' owner IAG said it was ""evident"" in July that islands should be treated separately and the government was ""too slow in making obvious decisions"". ""For most families, summer is now over and the damage to the industry and the economy is done,"" he said. ""We need to get on with (testing). We are way behind other countries on what has to be a more nuanced approach."" Airport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee welcomed the change in approach but said it was unlikely to significantly improve consumer confidence, while quarantine was ""devastating the UK aviation industry"". Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK carriers, said a testing regime was ""urgently required"". Heathrow Airport welcomed the announcement that testing to shorten quarantine was being considered by the government and that air bridges to islands would be used where appropriate. ""If introduced, these vital policy changes would show the government understands how critical the restoration of air travel is to this country's economic recovery,"" a statement said.

Prince Harry repays cottage renovation cost,"The Duke of Sussex has paid back the cost of refurbishing Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle. The cost, estimated at Â£2.4m in 2018-19, was covered by taxpayers through the Sovereign Grant, but the duke and duchess said they would repay it when they stepped back from royal duties. Prince Harry's spokesman said he had paid the bill in full by making a contribution to the grant. The property will remain a UK residence for the duke and his family. Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royals No other option but to step back, says Harry It comes days after the couple announced they hadreached a deal with Netflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. A multi-year deal will encompass documentaries, docu-series, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming. Frogmore Cottage sits in a secluded spot on the Queen's Windsor estate in Berkshire Frogmore Cottage should have been a rather lovely family home. Instead it became one of the reasons why, eventually, Harry and Meghan left Britain and the official side of the Royal Family. The cost of renovation - Â£2.4m in 2018-19, with more to come after that - provoked critical commentary, and a wave of largely illusory stories about what the money had been spent on. Just as the couple were setting up their first place together and creating a home for their child, they were subject to what they thought was unfair and intrusive comment. For decades, taxpayer funding has been a sticky subject for the Royal Family; it is a point of purchase for critics, who point to the Sovereign Grant and to the costs of security and ask whether the monarchy lives extravagantly and provides value for money. In the negotiations over the couple stepping back from royal duties early this year, money - inevitably - was a serious issue. It was Harry and Meghan who announced that they would repay the cost of renovating Frogmore Cottage. In such way a line is drawn, and the couple may perceive themselves to be free of any of the obligations they once laboured under. And Frogmore Cottage stands empty, a rather lonely monument to an unhappy chapter in the royal story. The duke's spokesman said of the repayment: ""This contribution as originally offered by Prince Harry has fully covered the necessary renovation costs of Frogmore Cottage, a property of Her Majesty The Queen, and will remain the UK residence of the duke and his family."" Last year's royal accounts showed the cost of the renovations was Â£2.4 million and was covered by the grant. It is the money given to the Queen by the government and pays for the salaries of the royal household, official travel and upkeep of palaces. The payment is based on the profits of theCrown Estate,external, a property business owned by the monarch but run independently. Revenue from the Crown Estate does not belong to the Queen, but goes straight to the Treasury which then grants it back to the Queen as a Sovereign Grant to support the monarch's official business. Harry and Meghan agreed to pay back the money as part of the plans drawn up when they quit as senior working royals in March.

Rise in UK coronavirus cases a 'great concern',"This video can not be played People need to ""start taking this very seriously again"" â Prof Jonathan Van Tam The latest ""big change"" in coronavirus infections across the UK is of ""great concern"", England's deputy chief medical officer has warned. Prof Jonathan Van Tam said people have ""relaxed too much"" over the summer and ""we have got to start taking this very seriously again"". If not, the UK will have ""a bumpy ride over the next few months"", he warned. He said that infections among younger people in EU countries had later filtered through to older age groups. France and Spain are among a number of European countries that have seen a sharp rise in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, after lockdown restrictions were eased and testing for the disease was ramped up. On Monday, Spain became the first country in western Europe to record 500,000 infections, after tallying more than 26,000 new infections over the weekend. Prof Van Tam's comments came as more parts of the UK are to face tougher restrictions following a rise in the number of cases. On Sunday UK authoritiesannounced 2,988 new cases- the highest figure since 22 May, while a further 2,948 cases were reported in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Monday. Stricter rules on home visits will beextended to two more areas in the west of Scotlandfrom midnight. In Wales,the county borough of Caerphilly is to be placed under a local lockdownfrom 18:00 BST on Tuesday. The 'moonshine weddings' breaking Bradford's lockdown How close are we to developing a vaccine? ""People have relaxed too much, now is the time for us to re-engage, and to realise that this a continuing threat to us,"" Prof Van Tam said. The rise in cases we have seen over the past two days seems like quite a large jump. But it is still well short of where we were in the spring. The official figures show we hit 6,000 cases a day at points, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. Testing was only largely taking place in hospitals so virtually none of the infections in the community were being picked up. Estimates suggest there were about 100,000 cases a day at the peak. So the fact that we have got close to 3,000 a day now when mass testing is available (albeit clearly not picking up every case) means we are a long way from where we were. But there is alarm within government. While the majority of cases are in younger age groups, the more they rise the harder it becomes to keep the virus away from more vulnerable people. Prof Van Tam added that hospital admissions and deaths were ""at a very low level"" in the UK and the rise in cases was most prominent among those aged between 17 and 21 - but the country risks following the trajectory of some EU countries. ""Where case numbers rise initially in the younger parts of the population they do in turn filter through and start to give elevated rates of disease and hospital admissions in the older age groups, and we know that then becomes a serious public health problem,"" he said. ""The fact that 17 to 21-year-olds are not becoming ill means they are lucky, but they also forget because the disease is not severe for them that they are potent spreaders."" Prof Van Tam added that the trend had moved away from ""specific hotspots"", such as the one that occurred in Leicester last month. Instead, ""there is a more general and creeping geographic trend across the UK that disease levels are now beginning to turn up"". He urged public health officials and politicians to think about how the virus is managed not in the short term, but over the next six months and ""until the spring"". BBC health editor Hugh Pym said it was a ""blunt warning"" about the spread of the virus from Prof Van Tam, who implied the next week would be critical as officials and ministers studied the emerging data. ""This is a wake up call for the public to get real about social distancing from a medical leader who is clearly worried,"" our correspondent added. It comes after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a change in England's quarantine policy, adopting an approach which allows islands to be treated differently to a country's mainland. He said travellersarriving in England from seven Greek islandswill have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Wednesday.

'I wake up and hope we have no lockdown',"Northampton has become the area with the highest rate of new coronavirus cases in England A town where hundreds of factory workers tested positive for Covid-19 now has the highest rate of new cases in England. What does that mean for traders on an already struggling High Street? Even before nearly 300 people tested positive for coronavirus at a sandwich factory, Northampton was already on a watchlist. The county's police chief hadwarned the town was ""odds on""for a lockdown unless people took precautions. Residents were urged to""limit contact"" with people ""outside their household"". When news broke of the positive tests at the Greencore site, borough council leader Jonathan Nunn described it as a""huge disaster""but said the authority hoped to avoid a lockdown. The town has lost major department stores in recent years, leaving large empty units on the main shopping street. A local lockdown, like the one less than 40 miles (64km)  away in Leicester, would have further serious implications. For many businesses in the town, it is a nervous time. Wes Souter said while his business has some ""ballast"" accumulated from 40 years on the high street, newer ones only have a few weeks in reserve Steffans Jewellers has been a feature of Northampton town centre for more than 40 years. Owner Wes Souter said sales have been ""very positive"" since the national lockdown was eased but is concerned about the pressure the pandemic is putting on business owners. ""I worked through the darkest hours of lockdown,"" he said, revealing how he spent days in the closed Abington Square-based business dealing with online orders and ""fearing we were going to have looting"". He said: ""This is a story of anxiety and fear. For a lot of business owners that is what it looks like."" Northampton's town centre has lost a number of major retail stores in recent years With the busy Christmas period approaching, Mr Souter said he has not been able to have a holiday this year. The potential for a Northampton lockdown has added to his concerns, with questions swirling around whether he would be able to furlough staff or which businesses would have to close. ""If the advice is go into lockdown, stay away from town centres but businesses don't have to close and we don't get assistance, what happens then? ""It is the waking up every morning thinking 'I hope Northampton doesn't get locked down today'."" By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit In total, 262 new cases of coronavirus were recorded in Northampton in the week ending last Saturday - three times as many as the previous week. There were 97 cases recorded on 10 August alone and 94 the day after, although these figures were initially higher until the data was updated on Wednesday. While this gives Northampton the highest rate of new infections in England for the week - nearly 117 in every 100,000 residents - across England overall, the rate was 12 per 100,000. However, the vast majority of Northampton's cases for the week - 208 - came from the Moulton area of the town, which is also home to the Greencore factory. The next highest area was the town centre and Semilong, where 12 cases were recorded in the week to 15 August. Cafe Track's outside seating area would be within two metres of the Market Square coronavirus testing centre Northampton town centre had its strugglesbefore the world had even heard of Covid-19. On Abington Street - the main thoroughfare - about a third of units are vacant, with retail giants like M&S, BHS and House of Fraser having disappeared from the town centre landscape. The borough council has acknowledged it ""wanted something better for the town"" and last year unveiled plans to use money from the government's Future High Streets Fund to tackle some of the long-standing issues. One thing they want is more independent shops and cafes. Cafe Track, situated in the central Market Square and operating as a social enterprise, fits the bill perfectly. Tom Cliffe's cafe has not reopened since lockdown Yet the eatery, which helps people with autism into employment, has not reopened since the country entered lockdown. Owner Tom Cliffe said they were planning to do so on 3 August, but a Covid-19 testing centre opened right outside the cafe's doors. While Mr Cliffe says such testing is essential, he had to postpone the reopening as only six people can sit inside the cafe. You might also like: 'I was living in a tent in a graveyard' 'Floods flung the door open as I was tattooing' Will a Â£50 voucher get this bike-shy town moving? He said the centre is essential to try and prevent the town going into a local lockdown but is hoping it can be moved elsewhere. Ultimately though, Mr Cliffe wants to help do everything to avoid lockdown: ""If that means it is negative for us but saves the town then that's a good thing. ""There's a lot of small, independent and brilliant businesses that would struggle."" Staff members Matthew and Spencer greet shoppers with masks and disposable gloves at Vintage Guru One of those independent businesses is Vintage Guru, a two-storey St Giles Street shop which features a market place style cluster of small traders. It turned two on Tuesday and owner Julie Teckman said trading figures have remained stable since it was able to reopen. But she said the ""town is really struggling"" and while some customers ""act like nothing has happened,"" others are ""really worried"". Mrs Teckman said figures showing Covid-19 cases in the town often only cause confusion. ""Some days we are in the top 10, others we are not so people don't know what is true,"" she said. She said she hopes the authorities can ""pull off"" avoiding a local lockdown. ""The town centre has been knocked down and it hasn't had a chance to get back up again. ""It is all very well having loans to keep us ticking over, but you need to know there is something to come back to.""

Five bars warned over social distancing measuresThe venues have 48 hours to comply with Covid guidelines or risk being ordered to close.Wales,"This video can not be played Ian Cottrell said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing Five bars in Cardiff city centre have been ordered to improve the way they operate in order to comply with social distancing guidance. It follows ""concern"" raised by health officials about a video which showed crowds of clubbers appearing to ignore guidelines at Coyote Ugly bar. Cardiff council said Coyote Ugly, along with Peppermint, Mocka Lounge, Rum and Fizz, and Gin and Juice had 48 hours to make changes. They could otherwise face closure.

It shows crowds outside the Coyote Ugly bar at about 00:30 BST on Saturday, but the venue said it adhered to coronavirus rules and turned away large crowds. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said people needed to be responsible. ""I saw the videos and I was really concerned,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""It is disappointing that people are congregating in large numbers without having any regard to social distancing."" He added: ""It's more about people taking more individual and collective responsibilities. We all have to do our part."" The council said its officers visited Coyote Ugly over the weekend and the venue ""acted quickly to resolve a number of identified issues"". South Wales Police said officers spoke with staff at the venue on Friday evening, and the venue was also visited on Saturday ""to try and prevent similar issues this evening and in the future"". South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said the issue was for councils but police ""can intervene"" if people break the law. But he added: ""I don't think it's a policing issue. The alternative is to shut the night-time economy. ""If you have crowds behaving in an irresponsible way... they are not just an issue for the police, they are an issue of public health. The problem has to be solved collectively."" Coyote Ugly said it was ""very careful"" to comply with all the rules. Meanwhile, Carmarthenshire council is asking people to comply with rules after a cluster of cases which, it said, centred around a presentation evening held on Saturday August 29 at Drefach Cricket and Football Club, organised in ""breach of coronavirus regulations"". It said 12 people who are linked to the evening have tested positive for Covid-19 and other attendees will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. In astatement,external, the club said some senior players had tested positive and it ""immediately advised Public Health Wales and are liaising with them on a continuing basis"".

"Footballer who lost 7st in lockdown nets hat-trickKieran Amos ""ballooned"" to 21st before a weight loss challenge and had not played for seven years.","Kieran Amos scored a hat-trick in the first league game of the season A man who lost 7st (44kg) in lockdown so he could return to football notched a hat-trick in the first league game of the season. Kieran Amos, 24, tipped the scales at 21st 6lb (136kg) in March and had not played competitively since an ankle injury seven years ago. But he signed for Sawbridgeworth Town FC after completing a challenge to lose 5st (32kg) by the manager. The centre-half said his three-goal haul on Saturday was ""crazy"". Amos's goals helped fire his side to a 5-2 victory against Southend Manor. Four days earlier he netted a 91st-minute winner against higher division side Romford in the FA Cup extra preliminary round.

Amos, from Bishop's Stortford, played football throughout his childhood and in the Essex Senior League before suffering an injury aged 17. ""I snapped my ankle and had to have reconstruction surgery,"" he said. ""After that I went off to university and that's where it all started in terms of the weight gain. ""I'd be going out, having a kebab after a night out and not really looking after myself or eating correctly. ""Before I knew it I'd kind of ballooned over a period of time."" Amos said he ""ballooned"" to more than 21st after an ankle injury and going to university Sawbridgeworth manager Lee Mackman told Amos if he managed to lose 5st he could start training with the Essex Senior League side. During lockdown, Amos took up running with his brother who was training to join the Marines. ""The first run I only did 1km and I stopped about four or five times,"" he said, ""I started calorie counting and was running about six or seven times a week."" The centre-half was Sawbridgeworth Town FC's first signing of the new season By the time pre-season came around Amos had hit his weight loss target and started training with the team. He is now down to 14st 6lb (91.6kg) and said he felt ""mentally and physically in the best shape I've been in for a very long time"". Amos said it was ""unbelievable"" to score the winner in an FA Cup game and he ""didn't think the week could be topped"" until he scored a hat-trick four days later.

Pupil badly injured in shooting on way to school,"This video can not be played An air ambulance was called to the scene A 15-year-old boy is in a critical condition after he was shot on the way to school. Officers were called just after 08:40 BST to the Grange Farm estate in Kesgrave, Suffolk, where a person was later seen receiving medical treatment. Kesgrave High School said it had been told the incident involved one of its Year 11 students. The victim, who was shot once, was flown to hospital. Suffolk Police have arrested a boy, 15, in connection with the shooting. The suspect, who is said to be from the Woodbridge area, was arrested by armed police on suspicion of attempted murder. Updates as pupil shot on way to school This video can not be played Police cordons remain in place around the Grange Farm estate An Essex and Herts Air Ambulance landed on an area of grass and took off just before 10:00. Police said they were treating the shooting ""as an isolated incident"" and do ""not believe there is any wider threat to the local community"". The Suffolk force said it was thought a single shot was fired in the incident. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Jones said: ""Following this serious incident our priority is to keep everyone safe."" ""There will be more police officers on patrol and to provide reassurance in the area and I would ask for anyone with information about this incident to come forward,"" he added. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the House of Commons: ""I think we're all shocked and saddened to learn about the incident in which a young person was seriously hurt on their way to school in Suffolk today. ""Our thoughts are very much with the young person, their family and the whole school community at this very difficult time."" Eyewitness Andy Watts told the BBC he was out walking his dog when he heard ""a gunshot and then I heard a great big scream"". ""It sounded like scaffolding falling down originally because it was a big, big crash,"" he said. ""I saw them working on the young lad over on the green; he was over there for quite a while while they were attending to him, a lot of ambulance staff and paramedics working on him."" Phil Bennett, 38, said his father lived near the scene in Kesgrave and heard a gunshot. Mr Bennett said he drove to check on his parents at their home in Lyon Close after seeing vague details of the incident on Facebook and becoming concerned. ""My dad heard a gunshot,"" he said. ""He's a retired paramedic - he's heard a lot of gunshots in his time, so he stayed indoors. ""The next thing he knew there were police piling in, then it's a scene of crime. ""It's hard to believe this has happened 100 metres from my mum's front door, that someone's been shot. It's terrible what's going on."" Kate Scotter, BBC News Kesgrave is a small town on the edge of Ipswich that has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. It has two primary schools and a high school and is packed with families. I've been to the scene of the shooting, in the heart of the town's Grange Farm estate, and the sense of shock about what's happened is palpable. This is a tight-knit community where many people know and look out for each other. The police have reassured people that this is an ""isolated incident"" but the feeling of concern remains. Kesgrave High, which said the pupil was on his way to school at the time of the incident, said in a statement: ""Students in school are safe and we are managing the situation in constant, close communication with the police."" It is understood Monday was the first day back at school for its Year 11 pupils following the coronavirus lockdown and the summer holiday. Friends Walk and Through Jollys have been closed off and there is a partial closure in Ropes Drive. Police have urged the public to avoid these areas.

Arena bomber drew suspicion ahead of blast,"This video can not be played The names of the 22 victims were read out at the start of the inquiry Several people raised suspicions about the Manchester Arena suicide bomber in the minutes before he killed 22 people. Salman Abedi was reported to police and security ahead of the attack but one witness felt he was ""fobbed off"", a public inquiry has heard. The witness had approached Abedi and asked him what was in his backpack while another said he thought he saw the suicide bomber praying. Hundreds were injured in the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. Inquiry proceedings began with Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the hearing at Manchester Magistrates' Court, reading the names of the 22 people who died on 22 May 2017. ""What happened that night was the most devastating terrorist attack in the UK for many years,"" he said. ""The inquiry will leave no stone unturned."" Families, lawyers and chairman of the inquiry Sir John Saunders, a retired High Court judge, stood with heads bowed for a minute's silence before Mr Greaney's opening. Sir John then formally opened the inquiry, adding ""this is an exercise in establishing the truth"". This video can not be played Lisa Roussos: ''It should be about transparency'' ""If I conclude things went wrong then I shall say so, but we are not looking for scapegoats. We are searching for the truth,"" he said. ""The explosion killed 22 people, including children, the youngest was eight years old. ""Salman Abedi blew himself up in the explosion but he intended as many people as possible would die with him."" The most sensitive evidence is likely to be heard at closed hearings, with both press and public excluded because of the risk to national security. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? The public inquiry follows a trial in which a jury found Hashem Abedi guilty of helping his older sibling to plan the atrocity. He wasjailed for at least 55 yearson 20 August for the 22 murders. The inquiry will, among other things, look at the emergency response to the attack In his opening statement, Mr Greaney told the inquiry ""experts consider that on 22 May there were missed opportunities to identify Salman Abedi as a threat and take mitigating action"". While there is evidence that suspicions were raised by members of the public in the minutes before the attack, ""no steward or British Transport Police (BTP) officer appear to have identified him as suspicious"", the inquiry heard. Mr Greaney said experts concluded: ""If the presence of a potential suicide bomber had been reported, it is very likely that mitigating actions would've been taken that could have reduced the impact of the attack. ""This is because there was sufficient time between Abedi first being spotted by, and also reported to staff and his attack to effectively react."" Paul Greaney QC read the names of each of those murdered by suicide bomber Salman Abedi during the first day of the inquiry One member of the public, William Drysdale, spotted Salman Abedi and thought he was praying, less than an hour before he detonated his bomb. A second witness, Julie Merchant, approached BTP officer Jessica Bullough around 32 minutes before the deadly bombing to point out Abedi. Mr Greaney said Ms Merchant cannot recall the details of the conversation with the officer but that it was ""to do with praying and political correctness"". The officer cannot remember the conversation taking place, the hearing was told. She was the first police officer to enter the City Rooms, where the bomb was detonated, after the attack, showing considerable bravery, Mr Greaney added. CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up Two more witnesses, known only as A and B, also saw a man matching Salman Abedi's description acting suspiciously. Mr A challenged Abedi, asking him what he had in his backpack. The witness then spoke to a Mohammed Agha, an employee of Showsec which provided security to the Arena on behalf of the venue's owners SMG, at 22.14, some 17 minutes before the detonation but said he was ""fobbed off."" Mr Agha spoke to colleague Kyle Lawler about the matter, eight minutes before the bomb went off. But neither security control nor anyone else was informed about the suspicious activity, the hearing was told, although Mr Lawler said in a statement he tried to contact control but could not get through. He then spotted the man get up and start walking towards the arena entrance. His statement continued: ""I just froze and did not get anything out on the radio. I knew at that point it was too late."" The hearings will take place in a room specially converted from two courtrooms at Manchester Magistrates' Court Mr Greaney also said expert evidence would be heard about risk assessments at the Arena. ""There was no effective risk assessments that considered the threats from terrorism at Manchester Arena in early 2017, despite the severe threat level,"" he said. The possible role of Salman Abedi's family in radicalising the suicide bomber and his brother needs to be assessed, the inquiry also heard. Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing Mr Greaney told the inquiry: ""Ismail Abedi, the brother of the killers, has been required by the inquiry legal team to answer a series of questions relating to what might, in general terms, be described as the issue of radicalisation. ""To date, he has declined to answer these questions on the basis that he maintains that his answers may tend to incriminate him."" He said similar requests to the brothers' parents, Ramadan and Samia, who are believed to be in Libya, ""have not been responded to, at least not in any substantive way"". The chairman will make a report and recommendations once all the evidence has been heard by the inquiry, which is expected to take up to six months.

'Insanity' of rugby star's alcohol battle,"This video can not be played Rhys Thomas says he is speaking out to try to educate others ""How could I be an alcoholic? I'm not that guy with the brown paper bag."" For athletes like retired Wales international Rhys Thomas and former boxing champion Russell Pearce, addiction at one time seemed incompatible with professional sport. Both drank heavily during their careers before seeking help for alcoholism in retirement. They want to raise awareness and educate others, inside and outside sport, to prevent more people suffering. ""I just feel a duty to be honest,"" said Thomas, who retired in 2012 following a heart attack while training with the Scarlets. After a quadruple bypass operation he was put on a transplant waiting list, fitted with a pump to help reduce hispulmonary hypertension,externaland forced to limit all fluids to two and a half litres, or less than four and a half pints a day. ""Things got pretty drastic and in my state, you know, where I'm on a heart transplant list and I'm drinking to those levels with a wire coming out of my stomach, which if it gets pulled would almost certainly kill me,"" the 38-year-old added. Sporty people likely to drink more alcohol, survey finds 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' Acclaimed scientist gets brain surgery for alcohol addiction The prop forward, from Newport, said he struggled to cope with the loss of his sport, career and health. ""I'd wake up in the morning and have like a little 200ml glass of water... and then go out for the day and have no mixers because I had to have it straight because there was extra fluid... and to me at the time, it seemed completely acceptable, but I mean, this was insanity"". The Johannesburg-born father-of-four said he would have ""panic attacks, where I thought I was having another heart attack, but all self-induced - like this did not have to happen"". Rhys Thomas surges forward for the Scarlets in a Pro 12 match with Aironi Rugby in 2011 Thomas, who has been sober for a year, said he was speaking out now to try to educate others about the disease. He said he had had an ""amazing"" rugby career and incredible amounts of fun but had he been better educated and informed about mental health and addiction the outcome may have been different. He added there had been an improvement in sport, with support put in place, but he wants to share his story in the hope of helping others. Russell Pearce thinks there is extra pressure in high-level sport For former boxing champion Russell Pearce, rock bottom came after an arrest. ""I was on my own in that cell thinking about the highs of my career, standing on the podium listening to the national anthem, to sitting in that cell for stealing alcohol - it's quite a big come down."" When Pearce turned professional at 18 he soon learnt he got paid the same money whether he won or lost and fighting soon became a means to help him drink. ""That's when things started to slide - the realisation that I could turn up, not really try, get paid and then go out with my friends again"". The 33-year-old's career soon slipped away and he found himself in a small flat in his hometown of Welshpool, Powys, drinking bottles of vodka every day. ""When the money did dry up I ended up going to my local shop, stealing alcohol just to fund my habit, I got caught and consequently I was arrested"". While in a prison cell, he was visited by someone from the drugs and alcohol charity Kaleidoscope who helped him turn his life around. The retired boxer is now a support worker for the charity, and will be three years sober next month. Pearce added he feels there is extra pressure in high-level sport which may prevent some athletes from seeking help if they know where to get it. ""There's not enough awareness around addiction. If someone had asked me when I was boxing, who do you turn to if you think you've got a drink problem, or any addiction, I wouldn't have had a clue"". A study co-written by researchers at Swansea University in 2017 suggested the prevalence of substance abuse in sport posed a heightened risk of addiction for people who are already vulnerable. It found the competitive culture and demands of sport, as well as the end of a sporting career, can create an environment where abuse and addiction develops. Wales' minimum alcohol price 'won't tackle middle class drinkers' Former Wales forward reveals alcohol battle Sian Edwards, involved in postgraduate research into addiction in sport, believes there is still a lot of stigma and shame which can make it difficult for people to talk about. The Cardiff Metropolitan University PhD student said most people did not understand addiction. ""One of the difficulties in addiction is that we try and have this single picture of what addiction looks like and actually, there isn't really a typical picture of addiction. It affects all people from all walks of life in lots of different ways - there are lots of different types of addictive behaviour"" She added sport and alcohol often went hand in hand but it could often mask the warning signs of addiction. ""It can sometimes be difficult to see how someone can be addicted if at the same time they can go out onto the rugby pitch or into the boxing ring, or whatever sport it might be and go and perform in a way that most people could never do"".

Lockdown restrictions extended in west of ScotlandMore than 1.1 million people will be affected by the measures after the inclusion of two more areas.,"More than 1.1 million people are now affected by tougher restrictions on home visits after they were extended to two more areas in the west of Scotland. The measures came into force in East Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire at midnight after a rise in cases. The rules had already been reimposed in Glasgow city, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire last week. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said acting quickly now could ""stem the tide of transmission"" in the area. But she has warned that there is a""definite trend"" of rising case numbers across Scotland. What are the rules in the new lockdown areas? Measures werereimposed in parts of the greater Glasgow arealast week in response to a rise in coronavirus cases. People are being told not to host people from other households inside their own homes, or visit another person's home. Meetings in pubs and restaurants and outdoor areas are still permitted - although the Scottish government said the hospitality sector would be monitored in the coming days to see whether restrictions should be extended. A further 78 positive cases were reported in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board on Monday. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""The hope is that we will stem the tide"" Ms Sturgeon said it was ""too early"" to say whether the fresh lockdown had had any effect on cases. The measures are targeted at household meetings, with Ms Sturgeon saying it was ""still the view of public health teams that the significant factor driving transmission is people meeting up in their own homes"". She said local authorities in the area would ""pay close attention to hospitality"" and would encourage people to act responsibly while using bars and restaurants. The widened restrictions - which also mean there should only be ""essential"" visits to people in hospitals and care homes - will be reviewed in a week's time. Ms Sturgeon said the measures are not yet being extended to Lanarkshire or Inverclyde - noting that levels of infection were ""significantly lower"" in Inverclyde. The restrictions will now apply to apply to 179,000 people living in Renfrewshire and 108,000 in East Dunbartonshire. The city of Glasgow has a population of 633,120, while there are 95,530 people in East Renfrewshire and 88,930 in West Dunbartonshire. Ms Sturgeon said it was ""regrettable we are in this position"", but that the measures banning household visits were ""considered proportionate but also the most effective"". She added: ""If we act quickly and preventatively now, we can stem the tide of transmission and avoid having other restrictions put in place."" The first minister had earlier warned that a continuing rise in Covid-19 cases in Scotland could see her government ""put the brakes"" on the planned easing of some restrictions. An average of 152 positive tests have been recorded each day over the past week - compared to 14 per day six weeks ago. The number of hospital admissions and deaths has not risen as sharply, although Ms Sturgeon warned that ""this may just be a matter of time"". IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

Rise in cases may 'put brakes' on lockdown easing,"This video can not be played The first minister said a resurgence of cases could see some restrictions being re-imposed A rise in coronavirus cases could see the Scottish government ""put the brakes"" on further changes to lockdown restrictions, Nicola Sturgeon has said. A total of 146 new cases of the virus were reported on Monday. The first minister said the continued rise must be taken ""really seriously"". The restrictions will be reviewed on Thursday, but Ms Sturgeon said it was unlikely Scotland would move to the next phase in her government's route map out of lockdown. And she said a ""resurgence"" of cases could see restrictions being re-imposed. An average of 152 positive tests have been recorded each day over the past week - compared to 14 per day six weeks ago. However, this has not yet resulted in a spike in hospital admissions, with 256 people currently being treated for Covid-19. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said there was a ""very definite trend"" of increasing case numbers over recent weeks. More than 200 cases were recorded on Sunday -the highest number since May- with a particular increase in the Greater Glasgow area, where fresh restrictions on household visits has been imposed. The new cases reported on Monday represented 2.4% of people tested, having regularly been below 1% two weeks ago. The first minister said the figures should not come as a surprise and had echoed the way cases had increased in other countries as they reopened. She said the virus currently seemed to be spreading among younger people, who were ""less likely"" to become seriously ill, and that this may be why hospital admissions have not risen as sharply. However, Ms Sturgeon said this context ""cannot and really must not be a source of complacency"". She said the virus can still be a ""really nasty disease"" for young people, and that it will ""eventually seep into older and more vulnerable groups"". Ms Sturgeon will reveal the outcome of the next review of lockdown measures at Holyrood on Thursday. She said Scotland would not move to phase four of the ""route map"" until the virus ""is no longer considered a significant threat to public health"". And she warned: ""It may be that we have to put the brakes on some further changes too"". The government had previously indicated that from 14 September, soft play areas and entertainment venues such as theatres and music venues could reopen, along with a limited reopening of stadiums. The first minister added: ""The current situation in Greater Glasgow and Clyde is a reminder that if we see a resurgence in cases then restrictions may have to be re-imposed rather than being relaxed."" Later this week the Scottish government will roll out a coronavirus contact tracing app, which will help track down people who have been in close proximity to those who test positive. Ms Sturgeon said everyone would be encouraged to download the Protect Scotland app, stressing that it does not track people's location and that ""your data is not passed on and remains private and confidential"". She said downloading the app was ""a small but really important individual step we can take for our collective wellbeing"". IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

What's the story about young people and Covid-19?,"Younger people are more likely to be coming into contact with each other and have larger social groups First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says there is evidence Covid-19 is spreading much quicker among younger people, which is why hospital admissions have not risen at the same rate as case numbers. What can we tell about current infection rates among Scotland's population? The coronavirus testing strategy has changed hugely in Scotland over the last few months, so care needs to be taken when analysing who is being infected. During the peak of the outbreak in Scotland, most of the people being tested were hospital admissions - essentially those who had become ill enough from the virus that they needed treatment. Those people tended to be older, because younger people weren't getting as sick. It's likely that many younger people were infected - but they simply weren't being tested. Rise in cases may 'put brakes' on lockdown easing Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Antonia Ho, aconsultant in infectious disease,externaland viral epidemiologist at the University of Glasgow, says that widespread community testing means this is no longer the case, with much milder infections now being detected. ""Proportionally more younger people are being tested now because they were never sick enough during the height of the pandemic to be tested,"" she says. Clearly, if you begin testing lots more young people, then more positive results will be found. But Dr Ho says it is possible to see the changing shape of the epidemic in Scotland by analysing the proportion of positive tests across different age groups. Doing this means it's possible to compare infection rates over the course of the outbreak, as it adjusts for the changing testing strategy. And this method shows that there are indeed a higher proportion of younger people testing positive when compared with older age groups. Using NHS Scotland data,externalto work out the average rate of positive tests over the past seven days, the highest proportion is found in the 20-24 age group (4.1%). This is followed by the 15-19 age group, where 2.7% of tests were positive. This compares with 0.3% in the 85-plus age group and 0.7% for those aged between 75 and 84. Dr Ho believes older age groups are naturally going to be much more cautious, even as lockdown restrictions are eased, given the risk to them of being infected. This contrasts sharply with most younger people, she says. ""Younger age groups have been cooped up for months on end and also perceive themselves as having less risk. There's also less social distancing than older groups,"" she says. These age groups are also much more likely to have larger social groups and, through work or socialising, come into contact with a wider group of people. It's worth nothing that these rates are still well down from the peak of the epidemic, when a 30%-50% positive test rate was routinely seen in the older age groups, with 20%-25% rates in younger groups too. This next chart uses broader age groups to make it easier to see the changes in infection rates over time. Dr Ho warns that the current pattern of infections could get even worse as we head into winter and more socialising takes place indoors, where the risk of infections being spread is higher. ""Also young people live with older people, so potentially they can pass that infection onto their parents or grandparents,"" she says. At the peak of the outbreak in mid-April, there were more than 1,500 people in hospital being treated for Covid-19, with over 200 in intensive care. The numbers have been mainly declining since then and there have been relatively few new admissions to hospital since the beginning of June. Scotland's national clinical director, Jason Leitch, says this is a reflection of the fact that young people do not get as sick from coronavirus. But he says the current low rates of hospital admissions shouldn't be used as an excuse for complacency as some young people still become ""very unwell"" with the virus. ""[New] people are being admitted to hospital with this disease,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""I've got a pal who's 41 - a very fit paramedic and he has been ill for three-and-a-half months... It's not to be trifled with. You should be cautious of it."" Dr Ho says she has also seen evidence of young people seeing longer-term symptoms, even if their initial infection was mild. ""Although young people tend to get less sick we're seeing increasing numbers of people reporting long-term symptoms like breathlessness or feeling very fatigued,"" she told BBC Scotland. And Dr Ho believes there could be further risks as the winter flu season approaches. She says influenza ""overloads our hospital system"" every year - and no-one knows yet what a flu-Covid co-infection could look like. ""Potentially the [co-infection] could be very severe,"" Dr Ho says, adding that everyone should be getting a flu vaccine this year to help reduce the load on the NHS. ""Everyone is praying for a Covid vaccine. But we already have a reasonably effective flu vaccine - so go and get it.""

Young people breaking virus rules risk âsecond waveâ,"The UK could see a second spike in coronavirus cases if young people don't follow social distancing rules, the health secretary says. A third of all cases in England last week were people aged between 20 and 29. ""The numbers have been going up. And we've seen in other countries where this leads, and it is not a good place,"" Matt Hancock says. Students starting university this month is a ""concern"", he adds. Speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat, the health secretary pointed to France and Spain, ""where that second wave started largely amongst younger people, it then spreads"". ""And now we're seeing a sharp rise in the number of people in hospital and the number of people who are dying in those countries. ""That hasn't happened here yet. And if people follow the social distancing rules, then we can stop that from happening here."" On Sunday the governmentannounced 2,988 new cases- the highest figure since 22 May, while a further 2,948 were reported in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Monday. The seven-day rate of new cases of Covid-19 in the UK has risen above 20 cases per 100,000 people. In the seven days to 7 September the rate stood at 21.3 cases per 100,000, up from 13.9 in the previous week (the seven days to August 31). A rate of 20 cases per 100,000 or above, if reported in other countries, is the level at which the government considers imposing quarantine conditions on people travelling to the UK. Leeds has been added to the lockdown watchlist. Officials said there had been an increase in music events,house parties and illegal raves in the city. Meanwhile, up to 300 people who attendeda charity football match near Sunderlandhave been asked to self-isolate for two weeks after 28 people who attended the event tested positive. Anda school in Suffolkhas closed after five members of teaching staff tested positive. The health secretary stressed how serious coronavirus can be for young people, even though they are less likely to die or get seriously ill. ""Long Covid is really serious. And people can be in a bad way for months and months and months,"" he says. ""The second really important message is that younger people spread the disease, even if they don't have symptoms. ""Don't kill your gran by catching coronavirus and then passing it on. And you can pass it on before you've had any symptoms at all."" She got ill when the pandemic hit - and still is How do I get a coronavirus test? What are the local lockdown rules? The health secretary denied that rules meant to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the UK are unclear. ""The rules are really clear, which is indoors you should socialise with only one other household and outdoors with groups of six as a maximum (in England). ""The message is really clear. The question is, how much are you willing to risk the lives of yourself and others by breaking the social distancing rules?"" Some have complained that the government encouraging people to spend money in pubs and restaurants, via the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, and go back into the office, is contradictory to stopping the spread. But Hancock insists ""Covid-secure workplaces are safe"", as are pubs and restaurants as long as you ""follow social distancing when you're there"". My boss wants me in the office - what are my rights? Matt Hancocktold LBC,externalareas in the UK that saw a rise in coronavirus cases over the summer were some of the most deprived. But in recent days the rise is among ""more affluent younger people"". The health secretary also outlined a new system of testing for people returning from holiday. He claimed that doing a temperature check at the border - which doesn't happen in the UK but does in other countries - ""doesn't work"" because the virus can ""incubate for a period inside your body without a test being able to pick it up"". Testing people eight days after they have returned is ""one of the things we'd like to bring in as soon as it's practical to do it"", Hancock said. It's suggested this could reduce the 14-day quarantine period when returning from countries with a higher number of cases. Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? There is understandable concern about the rise in infections that has been seen. But it needs context - at the peak of the pandemic in spring around 100,000 new cases a day were being seen it is estimated. Some of the rise seen in recent weeks is down to more testing, but that won't be the only factor. It was always going to be the case that as people mix more (to go to work and school, not just socialising) and summer ends (respiratory viruses tend to do better in the colder months) cases would go up. The crucial question is by how much and to what extent will they spill over into older, more vulnerable age groups. If it can be contained to younger age groups, who are at such low risk of complications, it would in theory not be much of a problem. But achieving that is going to be difficult. The social distancing that is now becoming a routine part of our everyday lives and the test and trace teams in place will help. But sadly hospitalisations and deaths will soon start going up - they do every winter because of flu even though we have a vaccine and some immunity. Keeping that rise as low as possible - while allowing society to function with children going to school and people being able to work - is the tightrope we will all now need to walk.

Netflix boss: Remote working has negative effects,"Reed Hastings (L) with co-chief executive Ted Sarandos (R) Netflix's chairman has said working from home has no positive effects and makes debating ideas harder. But Reed Hastings, who founded the platform, also said its 8,600 employees would not have to return to the office until most of them had received an approved coronavirus vaccine. And he predicted most people would continue to work from home on one day a week even after the pandemic was over. A new UK government ad campaign is now askingworkers to return to workplaces. The Wall Street Journal newspaper,externalasked Mr Hastings if he had seen any benefits from staff working from home. ""No. I don't see any positives,"" he replied âNot being able to get together in person, particularly internationally, is a pure negative,â Mr Hastings told the Wall Street Journal. âIâve been super-impressed at peopleâs sacrifices.â Netflix is used by almost 200 million households worldwide. And it has already resumed producing its own series, documentaries and films. âWeâre up and running in much of Europe and much of Asia,"" Mr Hastings said. ""And weâve got a few things going on already in [Los Angeles],â he added. âThe hope is that, through September and October, we can really get - with proper testing - a lot more running.â Other leading technology companies, however, have suggested employees may never return to the office.

UK split over Portugal quarantine,"People arriving in Wales and Scotland from Portugal must now self-isolate for 14 days, but the rules covering England and Northern Ireland are unchanged. The difference between the nations has been criticised as confusing. The rules for Wales apply from 04:00 BST on Friday, while in Scotland they begin 24 hours later on Saturday. Cases in Portugal have risen in the past week beyond the threshold at which ministers generally consider imposing 14-day mandatory self-isolation. The Department for Transport said decisions around adding or removing countries from the quarantine list ""take into account a range of factors"" - including how many people are being tested. ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus,"" said a spokesperson, adding it would closely monitor the situation. What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? The latest quarantine rulesintroduced in Walesapply to travellers from Portugal, Gibraltar, six Greek islands and French Polynesia. The six islands are Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos (or Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Scotland has alreadyreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceand has now addedPortugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100k in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. Changes to the rules for arrivals from Greece coming to England have been considered - but Greece will stay on its safe list for now. In Portugal, the seven-day infection rate has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. This is above the threshold of 20 which is when the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Greece's rate overall is below the threshold at 13.8 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: ""There are no English additions or removals today. We continue to keep the travel corridor list under constant review and won't hesitate to remove countries if needed."" ""Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can and do change at very short notice."" He said the government takes several factors into account, including the prevalence of the virus as well as the level and rate of change, how many tests the country is doing, the extent of the contained outbreak and the government's actions. Northern Ireland's department of health also confirmed that NI would not make any further changes at present. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? The changes have drawn criticism from industry experts as well as holidaymakers. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters and dividing the United Kingdom,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches and it's impossible to understand the government's own criteria any more on when to add or remove a country. ""The current strategy has to change. The weekly reviews have been causing anxiety and financial pain for so many consumers and travel firms,"" he added. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""Days of speculation around this announcement meant many people rushed to pay extortionate prices for flights back to England to avoid having to quarantine on their return - only to now find out there was no need. ""The government knows this and yet it continues to offer no clarity around how these decisions are made."" One aviation boss described travelling abroad right now as ""quarantine roulette"" because the list of destinations which are affected keeps changing. But the governments in Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardiff are now clearly at odds over which countries pose a clear risk. Portugal's infection rate is above the UK government's benchmark of 20 cases of the virus for every 100,000 people. But the UK government has surprised us all and not added Portugal to the list for England. It's not clear why. Greece is even more complicated as the Welsh government is opting for a policy where only people arriving from certain Greek islands have to self-isolate while Scotland has introduced a quarantine for arrivals from across Greece. For months the travel industry has been lobbying the UK government for an approach where they consider particular regions in a country but ministers in London are not keen on the idea. The quarantine was already hard or impossible to police. But discrepancies between different UK nations makes it even harder as someone could, theoretically, fly into Newcastle from Greece and drive into Scotland. That person should self-isolate for 14 days, but no-one will be checking. Some holidaymakers have told the BBC they havepaid as much as Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. The 45-year-old said the situation was ""absolutely disgusting"". ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now. We've lost an extra night in our villa - we won't get that back - we've got a hire car, so we're taking that back a day early."" She added: ""The government just change the goalposts left, right and centre at the moment. It's embarrassing."" Damian Martin from Swansea - who is currently on holiday in Lagos, Portugal - said he only arrived earlier on Thursday. ""Work had been full on so I decided to go,"" said Damian ""I had already switched my holiday from Spain and I won't be able to come back early,"" he said. ""I will be able to self-isolate, I think, but I work for a supermarket so will have to check in with them."" He added: ""I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. During May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed.

Was your foreign holiday worth it?,"Queuing to get a socially-distanced sunbathing spot on the beach. Wearing your face mask to the hotel bar. Finding out halfway through your trip that you'll have to quarantine when you get home. People are going abroad for holidays for the first time in months, but as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, is it worth the hassle? Several plans have fallen through forGrace Wildingso far this summer. The 19-year-old trainee teacher had been looking forward to a big family holiday in a villa in Spain, but they postponed the trip for fears her baby nephew could catch the virus. Grace and her boyfriendAlfie Archer, 18, had also booked a trip to Cape Verde, but it was cancelled due to the pandemic. The couple didn't want to lose the opportunity to soak up some sun on their first summer holiday together, and they felt that the virus posed a low risk to them as young and healthy people - so they began hunting for a last-minute deal. ""I'd say I feel safer here than home definitely. The same rules are applied but everyone actually follows them here,"" says Grace from her hotel in Playa de las Americas, Tenerife. The Liverpool Hope University student from Halton, Cheshire, says she was glad to hear flight attendants reminding people to wear face masks on the plane, and that she waited patiently in line for temperature checks at the airport in Tenerife, and happily shared her details with local contact tracers. In Grace and Alfie's hotel, everyone wears face coverings at all times until they reach their rooms, sun loungers, or dinner tables. ""Wearing the masks in the heat can be a bit of a nuisance at times, but this is the climate we've decided to put ourselves in so we will abide by the rules like everyone else,"" she says. Grace Wilding says everyone's following coronavirus rules at her hotel in Playa de las Americas In restaurants ""you're greeted with hand sanitiser before you sit down"", she says. And the couple has mostly steered clear of going to the beach, where officials make people queue up to get a sunbathing spot that's a safe distance from other holidaymakers. In keeping with the theme of the summer so far, more of Grace's plans were scuppered whenthe UK's quarantine rules changed for Spain- including the Canary Islands - while they were away. Grace and Alfie are now having to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to the UK. Where can I go on holiday and what are the restrictions? What are my holiday travel and insurance rights? Spain quarantine: 'We found out three minutes after landing' Grace admits the couple wouldn't have gone to Tenerife if they had known they would have to quarantine when they came back. Alfie worries about the two weeks of income he will lose, because he is a joiner so cannot work while isolating. But Grace remains upbeat. She says the news meant they enjoyed the holiday ""probably even more"" as they made the most of their last days of relative freedom before flying home. ""I wouldn't hold back on booking another holiday,"" Grace adds. ""The world can't stop for any longer, in my opinion."" AsBen Osbornedescribes his family holiday over the phone, his voice is partly drowned out by the sound of his sons shouting and playing at their rented apartment in Lake Como, Italy. ""They're having a fantastic time,"" he laughs. The family of five, from Hereford, have been to water parks, on day trips, and spent a lot of time at the pool they share with others in the apartment block. Ben, who works for Vodafone as a customer solutions architect, says the pandemic hasn't got in the way of their holiday at all. They've even taken a mini-break from social distancing. Ben, 39, and his wife Nadia, 37, decided they wouldn't be too strict on their children adhering to Italy's one-metre rule during the 11-day holiday, so they have mixed with other young families staying in the complex. Ben says this doesn't mean they have completely given up on social distancing and the adults are remaining wary around each other. But he says three-year-old Cooper has ""absolutely no concept of staying away from people"" and so the rules have also been relaxed for his older brothers Ashton, 10, and Carter, eight. The Osbornes found Lake Como to be much quieter than on their previous trips Hygiene rules such as mandatory swimming caps didn't stop Ashton and Carter enjoying the pool The only time the pandemic brought the mood down was during the Osbornes' journey to their idyllic destination. The worst part was navigating the not-so-idyllic Luton Airport, which Ben describes as a ""nightmare"". He recalls only one shop was open - Boots - and that it was difficult to find any empty seats in the airport because so many were cordoned off. But the flight itself ""wasn't too bad"", he says. The family wore face coverings but did have to sit next to strangers, without any social distancing. The Osbornes have been to Lake Como before, and are enjoying the fact there are far fewer Brits than usual. ""We quite like to go away to experience different cultures, [so] what's really nice is I've not heard any English language,"" Ben says. He adds that it's a blessing to not have to queue for the supermarket, as we have grown used to in the UK. The only visible signs of the virus, to Ben, were people wearing face coverings in shops, and mandatory swimming caps in the pool. ""If someone had plonked us here and we didn't know about coronavirus, we wouldn't know the difference. You honestly wouldn't know that there's a pandemic."" Julie Grinter's friends told her she was ""completely mad"" for deciding to go ahead with her three-week holiday to Portugal, after the country failed to make it on to the UK government's quarantine-free list. But Julie, 50, points out that you could catch coronavirus in the supermarket at home, let alone on a plane. ""You can't stay inside for the rest of your life so you've got to take the precautions and get on with life,"" she says. The choice of destination might have horrified Julie's friends, but she and her partner Matthew Boulden, 52, felt extremely safe. After flying to Lisbon they went on a road trip to the Algarve and enjoyed being almost the only tourists, wherever they went. ""It's just absolutely deserted. There's just nobody there,"" says Julie, who works for a consultancy firm in the City of London. The couple ate out regularly, and while most dining was outside to help reduce the spread of the virus, Julie points out that the Portuguese climate meant that was never a problem. Impeccable service, high hygiene standards, free drinks from grateful waiters, and chats with less-than-busy chefs all added to the couple's feeling that they'd stumbled into a luxurious private dining experience. Restaurants owners on Julie's road trip told her they were struggling with a lack of customers Julie, who says many beaches were deserted, took this photo of the popular Praia da Rainha in Cascais Crowds at Praia da Rainha in Cascais, in the pre-coronavirus world of August 2016 But Julie from Surbiton, south-west London, admits the solitude wasn't always a relief. Tourism is a major industry in Portugal and is popular with British holidaymakers, with almost three million UK visitors a year. The restaurants often lacked ""a bit of atmosphere"", she says, adding that the staff were anxious for the future, and owners were ""hacked off"" and ""obviously devastated"" that their countrystill has not made it on to the UK's quarantine-free lists. ""You do feel massively sorry for them because they are just desperate for business,"" she says. Portugal's border is open to British citizens, but the UK government advisesagainst travel to most parts unless the trip is essential,external. On arrival to the mainland, travellers have to do a health screening, and those going to Madeira, Porto Santo or the Azores must take a coronavirus test on arrival or before travelling. Cheap flights, deserted beaches and a free cocktail or two mean now that Julie is home, she's spending her 14 days of isolation persuading her previously horrified friends that Portugal is the place to be in a pandemic. ""If you can just work from home when you get back, it's ideal."" ForAdam Welch, a self-imposed month of minimal social contact at home in Kirkham, Lancashire, is the price he's paying for a five-night getaway to Croatia. The 18-year-old and three friends have formed a temporary household bubble at an Airbnb in Split. In order to reduce the chance of spreading the virus to one another, or to anyone else on their return to the UK, the friends agreed to minimise their social contact with anyone for 14 days before going away and 14 days after getting back. ""I just think it comes down to thinking of other people,"" Adam says. The pandemic led to exams and celebrations being cancelled in Adam's final year of college, so the sacrifice of semi-quarantine will be worth it to ""let my hair down"" on holiday, he says. ""If someone said to me at the start of the year, 'if you go on holiday you have to isolate for 14 days afterwards in your house', I'd be like: 'no way. I can't do that, it sounds so hard'. But now it just sounds easy."" So far in Split, the four friends have enjoyed eating out, going out for drinks, exploring the city, and snorkelling off picture-perfect beaches. People have to wear masks in shops and on public transport in Croatia but locals aren't observing social distancing at all, Adam says. While it's weird to see, he adds, it's a nice break from the rules and regulations in place in the UK. Adam Welch says he's happy to give up Croatia's nightclubs in favour of its beaches In the hiatus between finishing college and starting university in York in September, Adam admits he's tempted by Croatia's nightclubs, which are open albeit with some additional cleaning measures to combat the spread of the virus. But Adam says the ""lads' holiday"" will be a more muted affair than it would have been in normal times. ""At the end of the day, we're in a nice apartment, we can just get some drinks from a shop and stuff like that, and chill out with each other. We can definitely have a really good time and we don't have to go clubbing.""

Young people breaking virus rules risk âsecond waveâThe health secretary says new coronavirus spikes in France and Spain started with young people.NewsbeatComments,"The UK could see a second spike in coronavirus cases if young people don't follow social distancing rules, the health secretary says. A third of all cases in England last week were people aged between 20 and 29. ""The numbers have been going up. And we've seen in other countries where this leads, and it is not a good place,"" Matt Hancock says. Students starting university this month is a ""concern"", he adds. Speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat, the health secretary pointed to France and Spain, ""where that second wave started largely amongst younger people, it then spreads"". ""And now we're seeing a sharp rise in the number of people in hospital and the number of people who are dying in those countries. ""That hasn't happened here yet. And if people follow the social distancing rules, then we can stop that from happening here."" On Sunday the governmentannounced 2,988 new cases- the highest figure since 22 May, while a further 2,948 were reported in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Monday. The seven-day rate of new cases of Covid-19 in the UK has risen above 20 cases per 100,000 people. In the seven days to 7 September the rate stood at 21.3 cases per 100,000, up from 13.9 in the previous week (the seven days to August 31). A rate of 20 cases per 100,000 or above, if reported in other countries, is the level at which the government considers imposing quarantine conditions on people travelling to the UK. Leeds has been added to the lockdown watchlist. Officials said there had been an increase in music events,house parties and illegal raves in the city. Meanwhile, up to 300 people who attendeda charity football match near Sunderlandhave been asked to self-isolate for two weeks after 28 people who attended the event tested positive. Anda school in Suffolkhas closed after five members of teaching staff tested positive. The health secretary stressed how serious coronavirus can be for young people, even though they are less likely to die or get seriously ill. ""Long Covid is really serious. And people can be in a bad way for months and months and months,"" he says. ""The second really important message is that younger people spread the disease, even if they don't have symptoms. ""Don't kill your gran by catching coronavirus and then passing it on. And you can pass it on before you've had any symptoms at all."" She got ill when the pandemic hit - and still is How do I get a coronavirus test? What are the local lockdown rules? The health secretary denied that rules meant to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the UK are unclear. ""The rules are really clear, which is indoors you should socialise with only one other household and outdoors with groups of six as a maximum (in England). ""The message is really clear. The question is, how much are you willing to risk the lives of yourself and others by breaking the social distancing rules?"" Some have complained that the government encouraging people to spend money in pubs and restaurants, via the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, and go back into the office, is contradictory to stopping the spread. But Hancock insists ""Covid-secure workplaces are safe"", as are pubs and restaurants as long as you ""follow social distancing when you're there"". My boss wants me in the office - what are my rights? Matt Hancocktold LBC,externalareas in the UK that saw a rise in coronavirus cases over the summer were some of the most deprived. But in recent days the rise is among ""more affluent younger people"". The health secretary also outlined a new system of testing for people returning from holiday. He claimed that doing a temperature check at the border - which doesn't happen in the UK but does in other countries - ""doesn't work"" because the virus can ""incubate for a period inside your body without a test being able to pick it up"". Testing people eight days after they have returned is ""one of the things we'd like to bring in as soon as it's practical to do it"", Hancock said. It's suggested this could reduce the 14-day quarantine period when returning from countries with a higher number of cases. Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? There is understandable concern about the rise in infections that has been seen. But it needs context - at the peak of the pandemic in spring around 100,000 new cases a day were being seen it is estimated. Some of the rise seen in recent weeks is down to more testing, but that won't be the only factor. It was always going to be the case that as people mix more (to go to work and school, not just socialising) and summer ends (respiratory viruses tend to do better in the colder months) cases would go up. The crucial question is by how much and to what extent will they spill over into older, more vulnerable age groups. If it can be contained to younger age groups, who are at such low risk of complications, it would in theory not be much of a problem. But achieving that is going to be difficult. The social distancing that is now becoming a routine part of our everyday lives and the test and trace teams in place will help. But sadly hospitalisations and deaths will soon start going up - they do every winter because of flu even though we have a vaccine and some immunity. Keeping that rise as low as possible - while allowing society to function with children going to school and people being able to work - is the tightrope we will all now need to walk.

Which parts of Greece are on England's quarantine list?,"More than 50 countries had suspended routes to the UK because of the rapid spread of a new variant of Covid, but some of them have now lifted those restrictions. On 24 December, theUK banned travel from South Africaamid concerns over another new strain of the virus linked to that country. People who have transited through South Africa in the past 10 days will also be banned. However, UK and Irish nationals as well as the UK visa holders and permanent residents are exempt, but they will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. It had already been pretty difficult to travel abroad - because of quarantine rules either at your destination or when returning to the UK. Here are some of the requirements currently in place. EU countries held discussions on Tuesday and decided to lift the compete travel ban, allowing national citizens, foreign residents and key workers to travel from the UK to their home country, if they have a negative Covid test. But EU countries are free to set their own rules on border controls, so the exact rules vary from country to country. France:French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers are among those able to travel again - if they have had a recent negative test. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests  - which give results in about 30 minutes - will be accepted. Netherlands: Anyone arriving from the UK will need to have had a so-called PCR test to enter. These can take more than 24 hours to turn around, as they need to be processed in a lab. Belgium: Between 23 and 31 December, only those who are resident in Belgium, Belgian citizens and a limited number of strictly necessary journeys will be allowed from the UK. No prior test is necessary, but there will be strict controls on the Passenger Locator form and a quarantine of 7 days, followed by a compulsory PCR test. Spain: Flights from Britain have been stopped until further notice, except for those carrying Spanish citizens or people with Spanish residency. Travellers have to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Italy: Only Italian citizens will be allowed to return from the UK, along with those who urgently need to enter the country. They will have to have a PCR test before departing and spend two weeks in quarantine in Italy. Germany:Flights and passenger transport by rail, bus and ship is banned until 6 January. From 1 January 2021, transport operators can apply to the German authorities for an exemption to transport people who are resident in Germany. People arriving from the UK will need to either present a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours, or be tested when entering the country. Even with a negative test, travellers will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with the possibility for a test and release after five days Ireland:Passengers arriving by plane or ferry from England, Wales and Scotland are banned until 31 December, regardless of nationality. Essential workers are exempt China:Direct flights to and from the UK have been suspended indefinitely Canada:Passenger flights from the UK were stopped for 72 hours from midnight on Sunday (Monday 05:00 GMT), but on Christmas Eve the measure was extended indefinitely India:All flights from the UK are suspended until 31 December US:New York City has introduced quarantine rules for international travellers, who must stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. Arrivals from the UK will be checked on by sheriff's deputies This isnot a complete list of countries, as so many have taken measures. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office hasupdates on the latest advice for UK travellers,externalto other countries. Many restrictions in place to limit the spread of coronavirus mean travel options are limited. InEngland, people who live in a tier four ""stay at home"" area or a tier three ""very high alert"" area have been told to avoid travel, including overnight stays, unless it is necessary. InWales, people can only travel internationally for essential reasons. From December 28, Wales will go in to a lockdown, meaning people should only leave their area for essential reasons. InNorthern Ireland, people have been told to ""avoid all unnecessary travel"" from 26 December, when a six-week lockdown starts. InScotland, people living in higher risk level three or four areas should avoid unnecessary travel. Most people arriving in the UK from many destinations - including British nationals - must quarantine for 10 days. Exceptions are made for the Common Travel Area - the Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - or people coming from countries in travel corridors with the UK. It means there have been only a small number of destinations with no restrictions at either end. What are the Covid regulations where you live? There are hopes that the newcoronavirus vaccineswill make travel to more destinations possible in the coming months. People arriving in England can now cut their quarantine period by at least half if they pay for a private Covid test after five days and it comes back negative. But the government will only allow certain test providers to take part in the scheme, and they havestruggled under the weight of demand. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also suggested rapid testing - which can give a result in under an hour - could eventually""open the way"" for quarantine-free travel.

Public Health Wales data also showed 1,251 more people had tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total to 75,986. Each of Wales' seven health boards reported at least one new Covid-related death on Thursday. Cwm Taf Morgannwg reported the highest number, with eight new deaths.

Blaenau Gwent still has the highest case rate - the number of new cases per 100,000 people over seven days - of any county in Wales, measuring at 405.1 in the week up to 23 November. It is slightly lower than yesterday's figure of 415.1. It is followed by Torfaen (333.1), Newport (298.7) and Neath Port Talbot (294.5). Gwynedd (23.1) and Conwy (28.2) have the lowest case rates in the country.

More than 1.4 million coronavirus tests have been carried out in Wales since the start of the pandemic Acute patients from Powys are usually treated across the border at hospitals in England, so deaths of Powys residents usually only appear in registrations reported later by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). ThoseONS figures- which are higher - also count both confirmed and suspected cases of Covid, as well as deaths in all settings, including care homes, hospices and people's own homes.

Lockdown could be put in place in Caerphilly,"Caerphilly has 43.1 cases of coronavirus per 100,000 people A local lockdown could be put in place in Caerphilly county if ""necessary"", the leader of the council has warned. Philippa Marsden told BBC Radio Wales any decision would be made after advice was taken from Public Health Wales. She was speaking aftera class of 21 pupils was told to self-isolate for two weeks after a member of staff tested positive for Covid-19. There were 31 new cases in Caerphilly on Monday, with a total of 98 reported in the last seven days. Its seven-day figure for cases per 100,000 people now stands at 54.1, and total cases since reporting started stands at 905. One class at St Gwladys Primary School in Bargoed must stay at home, although the school remains open. A school in Cardiff has alsotold 30 pupils to self isolate. School staff in Bridgend, Cwmbran and Carmarthen test positive Class to self-isolate at Caerphilly school after positive test Covid-19 at Cardiff Ysgol Bro Edern leaves 30 pupils self-isolating ""Local authorities cannot act alone,"" Ms Marsden said. ""It's about us doing this together through Public Health Wales, the health board and, ultimately, Welsh Government."" Children at St Gwladys Primary School in Caerphilly county have been told to self-isolate Ms Marsden said she would ""absolutely"" consider closing bars and clubs if social distancing rules were not followed. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, had earlier told BBC Radio Wales ""a very close eye"" was being kept on Caerphilly. Following the publication of Monday's figures, Dr Shankar said: ""I would appeal to everyone in the Caerphilly area that if you have even the mildest of Covid-19 symptoms, a high temperature or fever, a new and persistent cough, or a loss or change in your sense of smell or taste, or even if you feel generally unwell with no explanation, to make use of the local testing unit at Caerphilly Leisure Centre. ""As children return to schools, I understand that parents will be concerned at reports of positive cases. ""I would urge you to follow advice from the school or local authority and only withdraw children from school when asked to do so. ""Social distancing measures that are in place are designed to prevent the spread of the disease beyond the 'bubbles' established in schools."" Caerphilly council said it ""fully"" appreciated the situation at St Gwladys Primary School ""will cause concern to parents and children at the school"". Caerphilly county has had more new cases in the past week - 98 - than anywhere else in Wales and more than the area has seen since the end of April. The number of cases on Friday - 31 - was the highest in the county for a single day since the pandemic began. The case rate for the past seven days - 54.1 cases per 100,000 people - is also one of the biggest increases in the UK, after Bolton and Rossendale in Lancashire and Hertsmere in south-east England. Where there have been local interventions or lockdowns so far - mostly in north-west England and the Midlands - the case rate has been usually been between 70 and 90 cases per 100,000. Birmingham was put on a ""watch list"" when it reached 31 cases per 100,000 but the issues were in particular neighbourhoods. More than 1,600 people have been tested in Caerphilly county in the past week Caerphilly is still outside the highest 10 case rates in the UK, which istopped by Bolton(116 per 100,000 at the most recent count) and includes Manchester and Tameside (both 50 cases per 100,000). Rhondda Cynon Taff has also seen a recent spike, although with fewer positive tests than Caerphilly. Young people breaking rules risk 'second wave' Most positive tests in Wales since end of June What do the stats tell us in Wales? Public health officials have also been concerned at the numbers of young people testing positive. Just under 14% of those tested in Wales are in their 20s. Nearly 28% of positive tests are people in their 20s and 30s. But this does not translate into hospital cases. Currently, only 5.5% of positive cases in Welsh hospitals are people in their 20s and 30s, according to Public Health Wales figures. Nearly two-thirds are aged over 70. A walk-in test centre opened outside Caerphilly Leisure Centre on Saturday. The school and council said the parents of all the affected children had been contacted and they were working with the contact tracing system to protect other pupils and the wider community. Caseshave also been confirmed at schoolsin Bridgend, Maesteg, Cwmbran and Carmarthen. Meanwhile, a cafe in Caerphilly has closed after one of its staff tested positive for Covid-19. Caerphilly Mountain Snack Bar has shut for 14 days, but it said all other members of staff have tested negative. Calvin Evans, who owns the Aviary bar on Cardiff Road, said he had decided to close temporarily, less than four weeks after it reopened. ""There's no point in putting the staff and customers... in jeopardy for the sake of another week's worth of business,"" he said. ""It is a hard decision, but it's just not worth it for a bit of profit. ""We've got young members of staff there, we've got staff with elderly family members, it's just not worth that risk.""

"Birmingham stabbings victim 'was light of our life'Jacob Billington's family say he was ""such a special person"" and they are ""devastated by his loss"".","Jacob Billington was out with friends when he was stabbed on Sunday A 23-year-old man who was stabbed to death in Birmingham city centre has been named as Jacob Billington. Mr Billington was attacked in Irving Street in the early hours of Sunday while he was out with old school friends, police said. Seven other people were injured at four locations over a period of 90 minutes. A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. West Midlands Police said Mr Billington, from Crosby, Merseyside, was on a school reunion night out with friends. One of the group, also 23, was seriously injured and remains in hospital in a critical condition. Latest updates on Birmingham stabbings In a statement Mr Billington's family said: ""Jacob was the light of our life and we have been devastated by his loss. ""He was a funny, caring and wonderful person who was loved by every single person he met. ""He lit up every room with his boundless energy and witty humour and the loss of such a special person will be felt by all who knew him for years to come."" This video can not be played Birmingham stabbings: Witness chases knifeman after attack Police were first called out just after 00:30 BST on Sunday at Constitution Hill, where a man sustained a superficial injury. About 20 minutes later they were sent to Livery Street, near Snow Hill railway station, where they found a 30-year-old man with critical injuries and a woman who was also hurt. At 01:50, officers were despatched to Irving Street, where Mr Billington was found with fatal injuries and his friend seriously hurt. About 10 minutes later, police were called to Hurst Street, in the city's Gay Village, to find a 22-year-old woman had been critically injured and two men less badly hurt. Police initially reported the critically injured man's age as 19 and the critically injured woman's as 32. The attacks happened at four locations across Birmingham city centre The suspect was arrestedat an address in the Selly Oak area of the cityat about 04:00 on Monday and remains in custody. Three other people, two men and a woman, from the same property were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Ch Supt Steve Graham said: ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with Jacob's family and friends after receiving such shocking news, particularly for those who were sharing their night out with him. ""It's utterly shocking that a friends' reunion should end so brutally. ""Equally the families of the other victims have been left devastated by the events of Sunday morning and we are working hard to discover what led to the apparently random attacks."" Questions have been raised about how the suspect was able to move around the city for 90 minutes.

Prince Harry repays Â£2.4m cottage renovation cost,"The Duke of Sussex has paid back the cost of refurbishing Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle. The cost, estimated at Â£2.4m in 2018-19, was covered by taxpayers through the Sovereign Grant, but the duke and duchess said they would repay it when they stepped back from royal duties. Prince Harry's spokesman said he had paid the bill in full by making a contribution to the grant. The property will remain a UK residence for the duke and his family. Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royals No other option but to step back, says Harry It comes days after the couple announced they hadreached a deal with Netflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. A multi-year deal will encompass documentaries, docu-series, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming. Frogmore Cottage sits in a secluded spot on the Queen's Windsor estate in Berkshire Frogmore Cottage should have been a rather lovely family home. Instead it became one of the reasons why, eventually, Harry and Meghan left Britain and the official side of the Royal Family. The cost of renovation - Â£2.4m in 2018-19, with more to come after that - provoked critical commentary, and a wave of largely illusory stories about what the money had been spent on. Just as the couple were setting up their first place together and creating a home for their child, they were subject to what they thought was unfair and intrusive comment. For decades, taxpayer funding has been a sticky subject for the Royal Family; it is a point of purchase for critics, who point to the Sovereign Grant and to the costs of security and ask whether the monarchy lives extravagantly and provides value for money. In the negotiations over the couple stepping back from royal duties early this year, money - inevitably - was a serious issue. It was Harry and Meghan who announced that they would repay the cost of renovating Frogmore Cottage. In such way a line is drawn, and the couple may perceive themselves to be free of any of the obligations they once laboured under. And Frogmore Cottage stands empty, a rather lonely monument to an unhappy chapter in the royal story. The duke's spokesman said of the repayment: ""This contribution as originally offered by Prince Harry has fully covered the necessary renovation costs of Frogmore Cottage, a property of Her Majesty The Queen, and will remain the UK residence of the duke and his family."" Last year's royal accounts showed the cost of the renovations was Â£2.4 million and was covered by the grant. It is the money given to the Queen by the government and pays for the salaries of the royal household, official travel and upkeep of palaces. The payment is based on the profits of theCrown Estate,external, a property business owned by the monarch but run independently. Revenue from the Crown Estate does not belong to the Queen, but goes straight to the Treasury which then grants it back to the Queen as a Sovereign Grant to support the monarch's official business. Harry and Meghan agreed to pay back the money as part of the plans drawn up when they quit as senior working royals in March. Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royals No other option but to step back, says Harry 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Assange in dock as extradition hearing resumes,"Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange appeared in the dock at London's Old Bailey as his fight against extradition to the US resumed. The 49-year-old, who has been in Belmarsh Prison for 16 months, is wanted over the publication of classified documents in 2010 and 2011. He told the judge at the start of Monday's hearing he does not consent to extradition - as new charges emerged. If convicted in the US, he faces a possible penalty of 175 years in jail. During Monday's hearing, the court heard Mr Assange, an Australian national, was re-arrested minutes earlier on a new indictment issued in June, during lockdown, by the US government. It contained 18 charges, including plotting to hack computers and conspiring to obtain and disclose national defence information. Profile: Julian Assange A timeline of the Julian Assange saga How will the UK decide on Assange extradition? Edward Fitzgerald QC, representing Mr Assange, said he had not seen his client in person for six months in part due to the pandemic - and he told the court the latest indictment had been made ""at the 11th hour"" without warning. But a bid to rule out the new charges failed, with District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruling they must be heard in the context of the extradition request. A separate request for an adjournment to allow Mr Assange's lawyers to respond to the new charges was also refused. Meanwhile, crowds of supporters gathered outside the Old Bailey, including Mr Assange's father John Shipton and the fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood. ""I'm an activist, I am very frightened, I've lost days and years of sleep worrying about Julian Assange,"" Dame Vivienne told reporters. Dame Vivienne Westwood said she was ""frightened"" for Mr Assange ""Julian Assange is the trigger, he is shining the light on all the corruption in the world."" Mr Shipton said his son was being treated like a hardened criminal. He said: ""Julian's in a glass box, he finds it very difficult to hear anything.  I can't hear anything, I'm upstairs in the gallery."" A mobile billboard van drove past featuring a ""Don't extradite Assange. Journalism is not a crime"" slogan and a picture of his face. The hearing will last four weeks and is expected to hear from witnesses, including academics who will give evidence on journalistic practices. Mr Assange was jailed for 50 weeks in May 2019 for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He sought refuge in the embassy for seven years from 2012until he was arrested in April 2019. A previous hearing at Woolwich Crown Court was adjourned shortly before the coronavirus pandemic prompted the UK's lockdown.

Netflix boss: Remote working is âa pure negativeâ,"Reed Hastings (L) with co-chief executive Ted Sarandos (R) Netflix's chairman has said working from home has no positive effects and makes debating ideas harder. But Reed Hastings, who founded the platform, also said its 8,600 employees would not have to return to the office until most of them had received an approved coronavirus vaccine. And he predicted most people would continue to work from home on one day a week even after the pandemic was over. A new UK government ad campaign is now askingworkers to return to workplaces. The Wall Street Journal newspaper,externalasked Mr Hastings if he had seen any benefits from staff working from home. ""No. I don't see any positives,"" he replied âNot being able to get together in person, particularly internationally, is a pure negative,â Mr Hastings told the Wall Street Journal. âIâve been super-impressed at peopleâs sacrifices.â Netflix is used by almost 200 million households worldwide. And it has already resumed producing its own series, documentaries and films. âWeâre up and running in much of Europe and much of Asia,"" Mr Hastings said. ""And weâve got a few things going on already in [Los Angeles],â he added. âThe hope is that, through September and October, we can really get - with proper testing - a lot more running.â Other leading technology companies, however, have suggested employees may never return to the office. In May, Twitter saidstaff could work from home ""for ever"". Fujitsu has alsomade plans to allow staff to work from home permanently. And Facebook and Google have saidemployees can work remotely until at least the end of the year. What are the new working from home rules?

Man arrested over Birmingham stabbings,"The attacks happened at four locations across Birmingham city centre A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after one person died and seven others were injured in stabbings across Birmingham city centre. The 27-year-old suspect was arrested at an address in the Selly Oak area of the city at about 04:00 BST, West Midlands Police said. Officers said he was also being held over seven counts of attempted murder. The attacks happened at four Birmingham locations over a period of 90 minutes in the early hours of Sunday. This video can not be played Forensic officers seen at property in Selly Oak Forensic officers have been seen conducting searches at an end-of-terrace house in a cul-de-sac in Selly Oak, where neighbours said a police raid took place in the early hours. Eyewitness Robert McLeod, who said he saw two men and a woman walking, stated: ""He looked like he just wanted to walk through them. ""But the three people obviously stopped, cos... when someone's walking in, you sort of get out the way.... He just launched at her chest and neck and started stabbing at her chest and neck. ""The armed response... comes to me and I say 'look, he's gone down there, it's a dead-end street' so they went down, but they couldn't find him."" This video can not be played Birmingham stabbings: Witness chases knifeman after attack Selly Oak resident John Astley said he was woken by a loud bang during the night and saw a police van parked outside the neighbouring property. He said: ""I think there were three people living there. They have only been there a few months, since July or something like that. ""I had a look out of the front bedroom window and I just noticed there was a police van. I could hear a lot of noise coming from next door and it sounded like they were doing a search."" This video can not be played Nikita Denton told the BBC how she helped a victim Officers were first called out just after 00:30 on Sunday at Constitution Hill, where a man sustained a superficial injury. About 20 minutes later they were called to Livery Street, near Snow Hill railway station, where a 19-year-old man was critically injured and a woman was also hurt. At 01:50, police were sent to Irving Street, where a 23-year-old man suffered fatal injuries and another man was seriously hurt. This video can not be played West Midlands Police released CCTV footage on Sunday evening of a man they wanted to trace Ten minutes later, they were called to Hurst Street, in the city's Gay Village, where a 32-year-old woman was critically injured and two men were less badly hurt. Police say they are treating the attacks as ""random"" at this stage. Ch Supt Steve Graham said: ""Officers worked through yesterday and into the early hours of this morning in a bid to trace the man we believe responsible for these terrible crimes. ""We issued CCTV footage of the suspect and had a strong response from the public. I'd like to thank everyone who shared our appeal and who provided information to the investigation. ""Clearly this is a crucial development but our investigation continues."" Police cordons around the crime scenes are being lifted A hotline number andwebsite have been set up,externalfor members of the public to provide information, while some streets remain closed on Monday as investigations continue. Julia Robinson, the manager of Birmingham Southside Business Improvement District, described the ""chaos"" she saw as events unfolded on Sunday. Julia Robinson described seeing ""chaos"" ""I run a warden service in the city and they stand down at about midnight but that night it had been quite busy so we were getting them taxis from a local venue at about 1:30 to 1:45. ""We heard the screaming then a lot of people running and went outside to see what was going on. ""There was a man and a couple that had been injured, a man covered in blood, there was a girl on the ground who appeared to be bleeding quite profusely, people trying to help her. ""Then it was a case of standing back and we were doing our bit really to help with crowd control and to try and get everyone out of the area so the emergency services could do their job."" The attack locations remained closed into Monday morning Questions have been raised about how the suspect was able to move around the city for 90 minutes. Birmingham MP Shabana Mahmood said she ""shares the same concerns as everybody else"", but the priority was supporting the police with their investigation. She said: ""There will be a more appropriate stage to have a more forensic sort of detail about the way that the incident unfolded, and also the police response, and I will certainly be asking those questions as well. ""But for now I'm encouraged... the police have described a strong response to their CCTV footage appeal."" Latest updates on Birmingham stabbings West Midlands mayor Andy Street told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was not right to say the police response was too slow. ""It's very easy to comment on a police investigation while it's live. I don't intend to fall into that trap,"" he said. ""[There are] lots of questions as to what happened during that two-hour period, but there's people making lots of assumptions from things that they quite frankly don't know."" He also said what happened in the early hours of Sunday ""does not define Birmingham"". ""We have to see it as a one-off random [incident], and what will define the city is our response to it now,"" he said. This video can not be played Video posted on social media shows a number of emergency service vehicles at the scene West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson said the events had left the city ""in shock"". ""I'm pleased officers moved so quickly to compile and analyse the evidence available to track down the suspect and make an arrest. I hope this offers some comfort to the people of the West Midlands who have been so understandably worried. ""I'd also like to place on record my sincere thanks to the brave and hardworking police, hospital and ambulance staff who have acted so quickly to help the victims of this atrocity. My thoughts are with all those affected."" Extra officers from the neighbouring Staffordshire and West Mercia forces were deployed in the city centre on Monday.

"Jammie Dodgers production to halt as staff strikeStaff at Burton's Biscuits' Edinburgh plant, which also makes Wagon Wheels, are threatening strikes.Business","Production of Wagon Wheels and Jammie Dodger biscuits could be halted at an Edinburgh factory this month as staff strike over pay, a union has warned. The GMB union accused Burton's Biscuits, which also makes Maryland cookies, of making a ""derisory"" pay offer that had ""insulted"" workers. It said staff would stage three 24-hour walkouts, with the first on Wednesday. A Burton's Biscuits spokesman said it was ""shocked"" at GMB's request for a 7% pay rise but keen to resume talks. More than 400 workers are employed at its Edinburgh factory, which makes around 7.5 million biscuits a day. Marmite says pub shutdown means no larger jars GMB members at the plant voted by a majority of 91% for industrial action after management refused to increase a 1.6% annual pay rise offer. The union said indefinite work to rule and an overtime ban will start tomorrow from 2pm, followed by strikes on 9, 16 and 23 September. The factory also makes Wagon Wheels GMB Scotland organiser Benny Rankin said: ""Burton's stubborn stance on this year's pay offer is an insult to staff that have worked throughout the lockdown at management's insistence. ""Their refusal to meaningfully engage with a workforce that deserve so much better means we have been left with little choice but to strike for a decent pay offer."" Burton's Biscuits, which is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan investment company, said the union was being unreasonable. ""Against the backdrop of growing economic uncertainty, the country entering a depression and rising levels of unemployment, we have made what we consider to be a series of very fair and reasonable offers, enabling us to provide job security alongside increased earnings.

Lockdown restrictions extended in west of ScotlandFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the move following a continued increase in positive cases.Scotland,"More than 1.1 million people are now affected by tougher restrictions on home visits after they were extended to two more areas in the west of Scotland. The measures came into force in East Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire at midnight after a rise in cases. The rules had already been reimposed in Glasgow city, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire last week. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said acting quickly now could ""stem the tide of transmission"" in the area. But she has warned that there is a""definite trend"" of rising case numbers across Scotland. What are the rules in the new lockdown areas? Measures werereimposed in parts of the greater Glasgow arealast week in response to a rise in coronavirus cases. People are being told not to host people from other households inside their own homes, or visit another person's home. Meetings in pubs and restaurants and outdoor areas are still permitted - although the Scottish government said the hospitality sector would be monitored in the coming days to see whether restrictions should be extended. A further 78 positive cases were reported in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board on Monday. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""The hope is that we will stem the tide"" Ms Sturgeon said it was ""too early"" to say whether the fresh lockdown had had any effect on cases. The measures are targeted at household meetings, with Ms Sturgeon saying it was ""still the view of public health teams that the significant factor driving transmission is people meeting up in their own homes"". She said local authorities in the area would ""pay close attention to hospitality"" and would encourage people to act responsibly while using bars and restaurants. The widened restrictions - which also mean there should only be ""essential"" visits to people in hospitals and care homes - will be reviewed in a week's time. Ms Sturgeon said the measures are not yet being extended to Lanarkshire or Inverclyde - noting that levels of infection were ""significantly lower"" in Inverclyde. The restrictions will now apply to apply to 179,000 people living in Renfrewshire and 108,000 in East Dunbartonshire. The city of Glasgow has a population of 633,120, while there are 95,530 people in East Renfrewshire and 88,930 in West Dunbartonshire. Ms Sturgeon said it was ""regrettable we are in this position"", but that the measures banning household visits were ""considered proportionate but also the most effective"". She added: ""If we act quickly and preventatively now, we can stem the tide of transmission and avoid having other restrictions put in place."" The first minister had earlier warned that a continuing rise in Covid-19 cases in Scotland could see her government ""put the brakes"" on the planned easing of some restrictions. An average of 152 positive tests have been recorded each day over the past week - compared to 14 per day six weeks ago. The number of hospital admissions and deaths has not risen as sharply, although Ms Sturgeon warned that ""this may just be a matter of time"". IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

"Breaking|Breaking newsPrince Harry repays Â£2.4m cottage renovation costHe has paid back the cost of renovating Frogmore Cottage to the Sovereign Grant, the duke's spokesman says.UK","The Duke of Sussex has paid back the cost of refurbishing Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle. The cost, estimated at Â£2.4m in 2018-19, was covered by taxpayers through the Sovereign Grant, but the duke and duchess said they would repay it when they stepped back from royal duties. Prince Harry's spokesman said he had paid the bill in full by making a contribution to the grant. The property will remain a UK residence for the duke and his family. Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royals No other option but to step back, says Harry It comes days after the couple announced they hadreached a deal with Netflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. A multi-year deal will encompass documentaries, docu-series, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming. Frogmore Cottage sits in a secluded spot on the Queen's Windsor estate in Berkshire Frogmore Cottage should have been a rather lovely family home. Instead it became one of the reasons why, eventually, Harry and Meghan left Britain and the official side of the Royal Family. The cost of renovation - Â£2.4m in 2018-19, with more to come after that - provoked critical commentary, and a wave of largely illusory stories about what the money had been spent on. Just as the couple were setting up their first place together and creating a home for their child, they were subject to what they thought was unfair and intrusive comment. For decades, taxpayer funding has been a sticky subject for the Royal Family; it is a point of purchase for critics, who point to the Sovereign Grant and to the costs of security and ask whether the monarchy lives extravagantly and provides value for money. In the negotiations over the couple stepping back from royal duties early this year, money - inevitably - was a serious issue. It was Harry and Meghan who announced that they would repay the cost of renovating Frogmore Cottage. In such way a line is drawn, and the couple may perceive themselves to be free of any of the obligations they once laboured under. And Frogmore Cottage stands empty, a rather lonely monument to an unhappy chapter in the royal story. The duke's spokesman said of the repayment: ""This contribution as originally offered by Prince Harry has fully covered the necessary renovation costs of Frogmore Cottage, a property of Her Majesty The Queen, and will remain the UK residence of the duke and his family."" Last year's royal accounts showed the cost of the renovations was Â£2.4 million and was covered by the grant. It is the money given to the Queen by the government and pays for the salaries of the royal household, official travel and upkeep of palaces. The payment is based on the profits of theCrown Estate,external, a property business owned by the monarch but run independently. Revenue from the Crown Estate does not belong to the Queen, but goes straight to the Treasury which then grants it back to the Queen as a Sovereign Grant to support the monarch's official business. Harry and Meghan agreed to pay back the money as part of the plans drawn up when they quit as senior working royals in March. Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royals No other option but to step back, says Harry 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Primark post-lockdown sales head for Â£2bn,"The owner of High Street fashion chain Primark has said sales have been higher than expected since stores reopened after lockdown, but are still lower than last year. Associated British Foods said sales since reopening would hit Â£2bn by the end of the year. However, that would be 12% lower on a like-for-like basis than in 2019. Primark's four biggest stores, in Birmingham, Manchester and London, were especially hard hit, it said. ""If the four large UK destination city centre stores are excluded, the decline is 5%,"" it added. Primark's biggest UK store is in Birmingham and has 160,000 sq ft of floorspace. The next largest, in Manchester, is 155,000 sq ft. Its two stores on London's Oxford Street are 82,000 sq ft and 70,000 sq ft respectively. Retail sales rise despite fewer High Street visits Primark says no to Â£30m job retention payment ""After a period of store closure, we are encouraged by the strength of our sales,"" AB Foods said in its latest trading update. ""In the latest four-week UK market data for sales in all channels, Primark achieved our highest-ever value and volume shares for this time of year."" The firm said trading in its food divisions had also been better than predicted so far in the fourth quarter. ""Since reopening Primark stores, we have seen increasing numbers of transactions driven by footfall,"" it added. ""The average basket size was initially significantly higher than last year, reflecting some pent-up demand, and while this out-performance has reduced in recent weeks, it remains higher than a year ago. ""We have continued our policy of offering the best prices, and markdowns for the period since reopening have been low."" Primark had made it clear before its stores reopened on 15 June thatthere would be no special discountsto shift stock. AB Foods said full-year profits at Primark in the year to 12 September would be at least at the top end of its previously advised Â£300m to Â£350m range. Last year, the equivalent figure was Â£913m. AB Foods said its grocery revenues would be bigger than last year, with growth in brands such as Twinings tea and Ryvita crispbread. However, it said sales of Ovaltine were held back by the impact of coronavirus on impulse sales, particularly in Thailand and Vietnam.

Jammie Dodgers production to halt as staff strike,"Production of Wagon Wheels and Jammie Dodger biscuits could be halted at an Edinburgh factory this month as staff strike over pay, a union has warned. The GMB union accused Burton's Biscuits, which also makes Maryland cookies, of making a ""derisory"" pay offer that had ""insulted"" workers. It said staff would stage three 24-hour walkouts, with the first on Wednesday. A Burton's Biscuits spokesman said it was ""shocked"" at GMB's request for a 7% pay rise but keen to resume talks. More than 400 workers are employed at its Edinburgh factory, which makes around 7.5 million biscuits a day. Marmite says pub shutdown means no larger jars GMB members at the plant voted by a majority of 91% for industrial action after management refused to increase a 1.6% annual pay rise offer. The union said indefinite work to rule and an overtime ban will start tomorrow from 2pm, followed by strikes on 9, 16 and 23 September. The factory also makes Wagon Wheels GMB Scotland organiser Benny Rankin said: ""Burton's stubborn stance on this year's pay offer is an insult to staff that have worked throughout the lockdown at management's insistence. ""Their refusal to meaningfully engage with a workforce that deserve so much better means we have been left with little choice but to strike for a decent pay offer."" Burton's Biscuits, which is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan investment company, said the union was being unreasonable. ""Against the backdrop of growing economic uncertainty, the country entering a depression and rising levels of unemployment, we have made what we consider to be a series of very fair and reasonable offers, enabling us to provide job security alongside increased earnings. ""Alongside the challenging environment, this action may only serve to jeopardise our employees' ongoing job security.""

Footballer who lost 7st in lockdown nets hat-trick,"Kieran Amos scored a hat-trick in the first league game of the season A man who lost 7st (44kg) in lockdown so he could return to football notched a hat-trick in the first league game of the season. Kieran Amos, 24, tipped the scales at 21st 6lb (136kg) in March and had not played competitively since an ankle injury seven years ago. But he signed for Sawbridgeworth Town FC after completing a challenge to lose 5st (32kg) by the manager. The centre-half said his three-goal haul on Saturday was ""crazy"". Amos's goals helped fire his side to a 5-2 victory against Southend Manor. Four days earlier he netted a 91st-minute winner against higher division side Romford in the FA Cup extra preliminary round.

Amos, from Bishop's Stortford, played football throughout his childhood and in the Essex Senior League before suffering an injury aged 17. ""I snapped my ankle and had to have reconstruction surgery,"" he said. ""After that I went off to university and that's where it all started in terms of the weight gain. ""I'd be going out, having a kebab after a night out and not really looking after myself or eating correctly. ""Before I knew it I'd kind of ballooned over a period of time."" Amos said he ""ballooned"" to more than 21st after an ankle injury and going to university Sawbridgeworth manager Lee Mackman told Amos if he managed to lose 5st he could start training with the Essex Senior League side. During lockdown, Amos took up running with his brother who was training to join the Marines. ""The first run I only did 1km and I stopped about four or five times,"" he said, ""I started calorie counting and was running about six or seven times a week."" The centre-half was Sawbridgeworth Town FC's first signing of the new season By the time pre-season came around Amos had hit his weight loss target and started training with the team. He is now down to 14st 6lb (91.6kg) and said he felt ""mentally and physically in the best shape I've been in for a very long time"". Amos said it was ""unbelievable"" to score the winner in an FA Cup game and he ""didn't think the week could be topped"" until he scored a hat-trick four days later.

Shapps set to announce 'regional travel corridors',"This video can not be played Grant Shapps says the government now has the âdata and capacityâ to add and remove islands from quarantine list. Travellers arriving in England from seven Greek islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Wednesday, Grant Shapps has said. The islands affected are Crete, Lesvos, Mykonos, Santorini, Serifos, Tinos, and Zakynthos (also known as Zante). The government says islands can be treated differently from their mainland countries if infection rates differ. But airlines have been critical of the time it has taken - Easyjet's boss said the change was ""too little, too late"". You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? UK split over Portugal quarantine rules Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Speaking to MPs in the Commons, Transport Secretary Mr Shapps said the government would use better data to pinpoint risks on popular islands. He said that would provide ""increased flexibility"" to add or remove them from the quarantine list for England - distinct from mainland destinations - as infection rates change. He said this would ""help boost"" the UK's travel industry while continuing to keeping the travelling public safe. Mr Shapps said the coronavirus infection rate was still too high in Spain's Balearic and Canary Islands to remove them from the list of destinations from where travellers returning to England must quarantine. Travellers returning to England from Santorini must self-isolate for 14 days He said the government was ""working actively on the practicalities"" of using coronavirus testing to cut the 14-day quarantine period for people arriving in the UK from high-risk countries. Purely testing people on arrival ""would not work"", Mr Shapps said, but quarantine combined with testing was ""more promising."" ""My officials are now working with health experts with the aim of cutting the quarantine period without adding to infection risk or infringing our overall NHS test capacity,"" he said. He added that if someone was unable to quarantine for 14 days after returning to the UK ""it might be best not to travel"". Beth Maybury, who is on holiday is Crete, says she feels more comfortable there than in the UK because it is ""less crowded"". The 24-year-old from Leeds, who will return to England before the quarantine deadline, said: ""Bars etc just seem a lot quieter, the hotel seems not even at half capacity so there's plenty of room round the pool or beach.

For months, the UK government has been lukewarm about the idea of only applying travel quarantine on a regional basis. Last week it came under sustained pressure from bosses in the aviation sector. They're desperate to know when international travel might recover in a meaningful way. One airport boss was scathing, accusing the government of ""overseeing the demise of UK aviation"". The Welsh government also then decided its travel quarantine would, in the case of Greece, be managed on a regional level, with six Greek islands added to its list.

""By the time restrictions were introduced, we were one of only a handful of countries in the world who had failed to take action,"" he said. Johan Lundgren, the boss of airline Easyjet, told the BBC the government's latest change to its quarantine rules was ""too little, too late"", as the peak of the summer holiday season had passed. ""This is something we have argued for a long time - it should not have been a blanket instrument when it comes to quarantine.

Shapps set to announce 'regional travel corridors'The move would mean England could apply quarantine rules to specific areas of another country.UK,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps says the government now has the âdata and capacityâ to add and remove islands from quarantine list. Travellers arriving in England from seven Greek islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Wednesday, Grant Shapps has said. The islands affected are Crete, Lesvos, Mykonos, Santorini, Serifos, Tinos, and Zakynthos (also known as Zante). The government says islands can be treated differently from their mainland countries if infection rates differ. But airlines have been critical of the time it has taken - Easyjet's boss said the change was ""too little, too late"". You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? UK split over Portugal quarantine rules Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Speaking to MPs in the Commons, Transport Secretary Mr Shapps said the government would use better data to pinpoint risks on popular islands. He said that would provide ""increased flexibility"" to add or remove them from the quarantine list for England - distinct from mainland destinations - as infection rates change. He said this would ""help boost"" the UK's travel industry while continuing to keeping the travelling public safe. Mr Shapps said the coronavirus infection rate was still too high in Spain's Balearic and Canary Islands to remove them from the list of destinations from where travellers returning to England must quarantine. Travellers returning to England from Santorini must self-isolate for 14 days He said the government was ""working actively on the practicalities"" of using coronavirus testing to cut the 14-day quarantine period for people arriving in the UK from high-risk countries. Purely testing people on arrival ""would not work"", Mr Shapps said, but quarantine combined with testing was ""more promising."" ""My officials are now working with health experts with the aim of cutting the quarantine period without adding to infection risk or infringing our overall NHS test capacity,"" he said. He added that if someone was unable to quarantine for 14 days after returning to the UK ""it might be best not to travel"". Beth Maybury, who is on holiday is Crete, says she feels more comfortable there than in the UK because it is ""less crowded"". The 24-year-old from Leeds, who will return to England before the quarantine deadline, said: ""Bars etc just seem a lot quieter, the hotel seems not even at half capacity so there's plenty of room round the pool or beach. There just seems to be a lot more awareness in terms of masks too.""

Pupil badly injured in shooting on way to schoolA teenage boy has been arrested in connection with the shooting of the Year 11 student.Suffolk,"This video can not be played An air ambulance was called to the scene A 15-year-old boy is in a critical condition after he was shot on the way to school. Officers were called just after 08:40 BST to the Grange Farm estate in Kesgrave, Suffolk, where a person was later seen receiving medical treatment. Kesgrave High School said it had been told the incident involved one of its Year 11 students. The victim, who was shot once, was flown to hospital. Suffolk Police have arrested a boy, 15, in connection with the shooting. The suspect, who is said to be from the Woodbridge area, was arrested by armed police on suspicion of attempted murder. Updates as pupil shot on way to school This video can not be played Police cordons remain in place around the Grange Farm estate An Essex and Herts Air Ambulance landed on an area of grass and took off just before 10:00. Police said they were treating the shooting ""as an isolated incident"" and do ""not believe there is any wider threat to the local community"". The Suffolk force said it was thought a single shot was fired in the incident. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Jones said: ""Following this serious incident our priority is to keep everyone safe."" ""There will be more police officers on patrol and to provide reassurance in the area and I would ask for anyone with information about this incident to come forward,"" he added. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the House of Commons: ""I think we're all shocked and saddened to learn about the incident in which a young person was seriously hurt on their way to school in Suffolk today. ""Our thoughts are very much with the young person, their family and the whole school community at this very difficult time."" Eyewitness Andy Watts told the BBC he was out walking his dog when he heard ""a gunshot and then I heard a great big scream"". ""It sounded like scaffolding falling down originally because it was a big, big crash,"" he said. ""I saw them working on the young lad over on the green; he was over there for quite a while while they were attending to him, a lot of ambulance staff and paramedics working on him."" Phil Bennett, 38, said his father lived near the scene in Kesgrave and heard a gunshot. Mr Bennett said he drove to check on his parents at their home in Lyon Close after seeing vague details of the incident on Facebook and becoming concerned. ""My dad heard a gunshot,"" he said. ""He's a retired paramedic - he's heard a lot of gunshots in his time, so he stayed indoors. ""The next thing he knew there were police piling in, then it's a scene of crime. ""It's hard to believe this has happened 100 metres from my mum's front door, that someone's been shot. It's terrible what's going on."" Kate Scotter, BBC News Kesgrave is a small town on the edge of Ipswich that has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. It has two primary schools and a high school and is packed with families. I've been to the scene of the shooting, in the heart of the town's Grange Farm estate, and the sense of shock about what's happened is palpable. This is a tight-knit community where many people know and look out for each other. The police have reassured people that this is an ""isolated incident"" but the feeling of concern remains. Kesgrave High, which said the pupil was on his way to school at the time of the incident, said in a statement: ""Students in school are safe and we are managing the situation in constant, close communication with the police."" It is understood Monday was the first day back at school for its Year 11 pupils following the coronavirus lockdown and the summer holiday. Friends Walk and Through Jollys have been closed off and there is a partial closure in Ropes Drive. Police have urged the public to avoid these areas.

"New Brexit law will not 'tear up' EU trade plansNo 10 confirms new legislation could change trade rules in Northern Ireland, but deny the measures are extreme.UK PoliticsComments","The government will introduce a new law that could change post-Brexit customs plans with the EU - but No 10 denied it would ""tear up"" the existing treaty. The two sides agreed in 2019 on the terms of the UK's exit, including on future trade in Northern Ireland. Reports suggested a new law could ""override"" the legal force of that deal - the withdrawal agreement. But Downing Street said it would only make ""minor clarifications in extremely specific areas"". No 10 confirmed the new UK Internal Market Bill will be published on Wednesday. The EU said the ""full implementation"" of the withdrawal agreement was a ""prerequisite for the negotiations on the future partnership"" between the bloc and the UK. Ministers plan laws overriding part of Brexit deal What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The news comes at the start of another week of negotiations on that future trade deal. The so-called transition period - which has been in place since the UK left the EU in January - will end on 31 December and the two sides are trying to secure an agreement to take its place. But Boris Johnson said if a deal was not reached by the European Council meeting on 15 October, both sides should ""move on"" - meaning the UK would go on to trade with the bloc on international trading terms. Beyond all the talk, there is a genuine frustration in government that the EU is yet to treat the UK as if it were a fully sovereign country. That's matched on the EU side by similar irritation that the UK won't budge. But the bad tempers do not necessarily mean that a deal won't be reached. And all the blood curdling vows don't mean that in the end there won't be compromise. Read more from Laura Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said if the government's latest moves were negotiating tactics, they were not ""very effective"". She told BBC News: ""It undermines all the progress that's been made over the last several months and completely jeopardises a future trading relationship."" Boris Johnson signed the withdrawal agreement in January The two sides signed off on a withdrawal agreement last year ahead of the UK leaving the bloc on 31 January. The document covered a number of areas, from how much the UK would have to pay for its ""divorce bill"" through to intentions for a future relationship. But one of the biggest sticking points throughout negotiations had been how to handle the issue of Northern Ireland. Both the UK and EU sides were committed to protecting the peace process in the region and preventing any reintroduction of border checks on the island of Ireland. But they also accepted the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would become the UK's border with the EU, so customs rules needed to be respected and adhered to. The UK and EU settled on the Northern Ireland Protocol. This would see Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU customs rules after the transition period - meaning customs declarations would be needed for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, as well as some new checks on goods going from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. It was unpopular with some sections of the Tory backbenches and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which had been supporting the government until that point. But the agreement was passed through Parliament and the Northern Ireland Protocol became part of the international treaty. Both the UK and EU are committed to no new border checks on the island of Ireland No 10 has said it is committed to the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol. And it said it was continuing its work with the EU in a joint committee to iron out issues around how it would work in practice. However, it said it wanted to have something in place to protect trade across the four nations of the UK if an agreement was not reached by the end of the year. The text of the bill has yet to be published, so we cannot say for definite what will be included in its wording. But Downing Street said one thing it would do is allow ministers to unilaterally decide what particular goods were ""at risk"" of entering the EU when passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and therefore subject to EU tariffs. The law would also give ministers the powers to scrap export declarations on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and would make it clear that EU state aid requirements - where governments give financial support to homegrown businesses - would only apply in Northern Ireland. But the government insists the bill only introduces ""limited and reasonable steps"" to ""remove ambiguity"" - not ""overriding"" the withdrawal agreement, as government sources had suggested on Sunday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the Northern Ireland Protocol is ""essential"" There has been concern from Brussels over the messages coming out from Downing Street. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that she trusted the UK government ""to implement the Withdrawal Agreement, an obligation under international law and prerequisite for any future partnership"". And she added that the Northern Ireland Protocol was ""essential to protect peace and stability on the island and integrity of the single market"". Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neilltweeted,externalany threat of backtracking on the protocol would be a ""treacherous betrayal which would inflict irreversible harm on the all-Ireland economy and the Good Friday Agreement"". She has co-signed a joint letter from anti-Brexit parties in Northern Ireland to the prime minister and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, saying it would be ""entirely unacceptable [to] abandon these safeguards and mitigations"". Labour accused the government of ""misleading the public"" over having a so-called ""oven-ready deal"" for Brexit. This video can not be played Failing to implement the EU Withdrawal Agreement would be âcompletely pig-headedâ, the shadow Northern Secretary says. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Parliament supported the Withdrawal Agreement earlier on this year. He has made promises and signed a treaty around these arrangements for Northern Ireland, and he now seems to be backing out of that."" And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid,externalthe move would ""significantly increase"" the likelihood of leaving the transition period without a trade deal, and the ""resulting damage to the economy will be entirely Tory-inflicted. What charlatans"". But government sources told the BBC the legislation was ""not intended to derail the talks"", and a spokeswoman said the UK would continue to approach talks with the EU in good faith. ""As a responsible government, we are considering fallback options in the event this is not achieved, to ensure the communities of Northern Ireland are protected,"" she added.

Emma Barnett to present Radio 4's Woman's HourThe 5 Live presenter will fill the shoes of Jane Garvey and Jenni Murray.,"This video can not be played The broadcaster thanked her 5 Live audience for making the show 'such a wonderful place' Broadcaster Emma Barnett will be the new presenter of Woman's Hour. The 5 Live and Newsnight presenter will step into the shoes of Jane Garvey and Dame Jenni Murray, who have both decided to step down from the show. Barnett is already associated with the Radio 4 programme, presenting its late-night spin-off and regularly chairing the Woman's Hour Power List. She first hosted Woman's Hour at the age of 26, making her the youngest presenter in the show's history. Woman's Hour, which offers a female perspective on the world, is one of the longest-running programmes on British radio, first launching in 1946 on the BBC Light Programme. The 45-minute show is broadcast every morning at 10:00 on BBC Radio 4. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Staff on the show were told of Barnett's appointment on Monday morning. Unlike the current arrangement, where Garvey and Dame Jenni share presenting duties, Barnett will be the main host from Monday to Thursday each week. An additional presenter will be appointed to host the Friday and Saturday editions. ""I can't wait to get to know the many listeners of Woman's Hour a lot, lot better,"" said the presenter. ""What adventures we are going to have together - all starting in the year that this BBC institution, the radio mothership, turns 75.

The move will mean the end of Barnett's mid-morning show on 5 Live, which has seen presenter named best speech broadcaster at the 2020 Radio Academy Awards (ARIAs) and radio broadcaster of the year 2018 by the Broadcasting Press Guild. She will continue to present Newsnight on BBC Two. Garvey, who has hosted the show since 2007, announced she was leaving last week. ""It's been a real privilege to play a small part in the history of this very special radio programme,"" she said, adding how proud she was of its relationship with its listeners. ""On one unforgettable day, I interviewed David Cameron in the morning, and Mary J Blige in the afternoon. There's no other job like it,"" she said. ""But famous people are not the reason people engage with Woman's Hour. It's because the programme still talks about the subjects and challenges no one else goes near. I'm very proud of our relationship with the audience and the trust they place in us."" Garvey will now go on to host her own new Radio 4 series in the new year. Woman's Hour presenters Jenni Murray (left) and Jane Garvey in 2016 Earlier this summer, Garvey's colleague Dame Jenni Murray announced she was to leave the show after 33 years. Dame Jenni, who is the longest-serving presenter in the Radio 4 show's 74-year history, will present her final show on 1 October. Barnett started her career with the trade publication Media Week before joining the Daily Telegraph as its first digital media editor. She was later appointed women's editor - where she steered coverage away from fashion and celebrities towards more weighty issues, and launched the award-winning site Telegraph Wonder Women. She started broadcasting on the commercial radio station LBC in 2011, initially working on the late night ""graveyard shift"", and jumped ship to 5 Live in 2014. There, she established herself as a fearless and inquisitive interviewer. The Times dubbed her ""the BBC's new Rottweiler"", while Jeremy Paxman described her as his favourite political interviewer. ""Being interviewed on the radio by Barnett is like being interviewed by a basketful of cobras,"" observed The Telegraph's Charlotte Runcie last year. ""She is single-handedly rebuilding the BBC's reputation as the home of the heavyweight political interview."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn on Woman's Hour During the 2017 election campaign, Barnett made headlines while questioning Jeremy Corbyn, then-leader of the Labour Party, over the cost of his party's plan to offer free childcare to two-year-olds. While Corbyn struggled to remember the details of his plan, Barnett gave listeners a running commentary: ""You're logging into your iPadâ¦ you've had a phone call while you're in here and you don't know how much it's going to cost."" Afterwards, Barnett received a hostile response from some Corbyn supporters, who accused her of being ""biased"" and a ""Tory"". He later defended the presenter, saying: ""Under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone throw personal abuse at anyone else because they're doing the job they they've been employed to do."" Barnett also made broadcasting history by hosting the BBC's first joint live radio and TV phone-in with a Prime Minister, Theresa May. The broadcaster, who booked the interview herself, spent two days rehearsing the encounter, with her editor standing in as the Prime Minister. She told the Express she had prepared three separate versions of her questions, so she could switch her response depending on May's reactions. ""An interview is an intellectual game of chess,""she said,external. ""Especially one like that."" This video can not be played The Duchess of Cornwall says the âworst bitâ of lockdown has been not seeing her family Earlier this year, she hosted her 5 Live show from Clarence House where Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, guest edited the programme and discussed life under lockdown. Last year, Barnett published her first book, It's About Bloody Time, Period - a frank, funny and myth-busting exploration of menstruation. Motivated by her own experiences of endometriosis and IVF, the book aimed to break the taboos around discussing periods and fertility. ""Women's issues are everyone's issues,""she told students at the London School of Economics at the time,external. ""I really enjoy disrupting what is expected of me. Don't get yourself put in a box."" After news broke of her  new role at Women's Hour, fellow broadcasters and fans shared their congratulations online. Allow Twitter content?

Five bars warned over social distancing measuresThe Cardiff city centre venues have 48 hours to comply with Covid guidelines or risk being ordered to close.Wales,"This video can not be played Ian Cottrell said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing Five bars in Cardiff city centre have been ordered to improve the way they operate in order to comply with social distancing guidance. It follows ""concern"" raised by health officials about a video which showed crowds of clubbers appearing to ignore guidelines at Coyote Ugly bar. Cardiff council said Coyote Ugly, along with Peppermint, Mocka Lounge, Rum and Fizz, and Gin and Juice had 48 hours to make changes. They could otherwise face closure. ""It is the responsibility of businesses to ensure that social distancing is maintained and their premises can be used in a way that is safe for customers and staff and minimises the potential for Covid-19 to spread,"" said the council's cabinet member for environment, Michael Michael. ""Ensuring the city centre is safe to visit is a priority and scenes like those seen on St Mary Street at the weekend are simply unacceptable. ""Businesses should be in no doubt that we will take action against any premises that aren't operating in a safe manner. ""Officers will be returning to the businesses issued with improvement notices, and visiting others across the city, and will not hesitate to issue closure notices if needed."" Social distance plea to avoid new 'harsh lockdown' What are the latest social distancing rules? Minority of young people 'ruining it for majority' The footage,externalwas captured by Ian Cottrell on lower St Mary Street in Cardiff and was posted on social media. It shows crowds outside the Coyote Ugly bar at about 00:30 BST on Saturday, but the venue said it adhered to coronavirus rules and turned away large crowds. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said people needed to be responsible. ""I saw the videos and I was really concerned,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""It is disappointing that people are congregating in large numbers without having any regard to social distancing."" He added: ""It's more about people taking more individual and collective responsibilities. We all have to do our part."" The council said its officers visited Coyote Ugly over the weekend and the venue ""acted quickly to resolve a number of identified issues"". South Wales Police said officers spoke with staff at the venue on Friday evening, and the venue was also visited on Saturday ""to try and prevent similar issues this evening and in the future"". South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said the issue was for councils but police ""can intervene"" if people break the law. But he added: ""I don't think it's a policing issue. The alternative is to shut the night-time economy. ""If you have crowds behaving in an irresponsible way... they are not just an issue for the police, they are an issue of public health. The problem has to be solved collectively."" Coyote Ugly said it was ""very careful"" to comply with all the rules. Meanwhile, Carmarthenshire council is asking people to comply with rules after a cluster of cases which, it said, centred around a presentation evening held on Saturday August 29 at Drefach Cricket and Football Club, organised in ""breach of coronavirus regulations"". It said 12 people who are linked to the evening have tested positive for Covid-19 and other attendees will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. In astatement,external, the club said some senior players had tested positive and it ""immediately advised Public Health Wales and are liaising with them on a continuing basis"".

Jammie Dodgers production to halt as staff revolt,"Production of Wagon Wheels and Jammie Dodger biscuits could be halted at an Edinburgh factory this month as staff strike over pay, a union has warned. The GMB union accused Burton's Biscuits, which also makes Maryland cookies, of making a ""derisory"" pay offer that had ""insulted"" workers. It said staff would stage three 24-hour walkouts, with the first on Wednesday. A Burton's Biscuits spokesman said it was ""shocked"" at GMB's request for a 7% pay rise but keen to resume talks. More than 400 workers are employed at its Edinburgh factory, which makes around 7.5 million biscuits a day. Marmite says pub shutdown means no larger jars GMB members at the plant voted by a majority of 91% for industrial action after management refused to increase a 1.6% annual pay rise offer. The union said indefinite work to rule and an overtime ban will start tomorrow from 2pm, followed by strikes on 9, 16 and 23 September. The factory also makes Wagon Wheels GMB Scotland organiser Benny Rankin said: ""Burton's stubborn stance on this year's pay offer is an insult to staff that have worked throughout the lockdown at management's insistence. ""Their refusal to meaningfully engage with a workforce that deserve so much better means we have been left with little choice but to strike for a decent pay offer."" Burton's Biscuits, which is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan investment company, said the union was being unreasonable. ""Against the backdrop of growing economic uncertainty, the country entering a depression and rising levels of unemployment, we have made what we consider to be a series of very fair and reasonable offers, enabling us to provide job security alongside increased earnings. ""Alongside the challenging environment, this action may only serve to jeopardise our employees' ongoing job security."" He said the firm wanted to find a ""mutually acceptable solution"" and was willing to resume talks with the union. ""We also hope that we can return to full production as soon as possible and move forward in a spirit of unity and co-operation in a safe, enjoyable and productive working environment."" Burtons, which also makes Cadbury biscuits under a perpetual licence, has three sites in the UK employing 2,200 workers.

Arena bomber 'seen praying an hour before blast',"This video can not be played The names of the 22 victims were read out at the start of the inquiry Several people raised suspicions about the Manchester Arena suicide bomber in the minutes before he killed 22 people. Salman Abedi was reported to police and security ahead of the attack but one witness felt he was ""fobbed off"", a public inquiry has heard. The witness had approached Abedi and asked him what was in his backpack while another said he thought he saw the suicide bomber praying. Hundreds were injured in the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. Inquiry proceedings began with Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the hearing at Manchester Magistrates' Court, reading the names of the 22 people who died on 22 May 2017. ""What happened that night was the most devastating terrorist attack in the UK for many years,"" he said. ""The inquiry will leave no stone unturned."" Families, lawyers and chairman of the inquiry Sir John Saunders, a retired High Court judge, stood with heads bowed for a minute's silence before Mr Greaney's opening. Sir John then formally opened the inquiry, adding ""this is an exercise in establishing the truth"". This video can not be played Lisa Roussos: ''It should be about transparency'' ""If I conclude things went wrong then I shall say so, but we are not looking for scapegoats. We are searching for the truth,"" he said. ""The explosion killed 22 people, including children, the youngest was eight years old. ""Salman Abedi blew himself up in the explosion but he intended as many people as possible would die with him."" The most sensitive evidence is likely to be heard at closed hearings, with both press and public excluded because of the risk to national security. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? The public inquiry follows a trial in which a jury found Hashem Abedi guilty of helping his older sibling to plan the atrocity. He wasjailed for at least 55 yearson 20 August for the 22 murders. The inquiry will, among other things, look at the emergency response to the attack In his opening statement, Mr Greaney told the inquiry ""experts consider that on 22 May there were missed opportunities to identify Salman Abedi as a threat and take mitigating action"". While there is evidence that suspicions were raised by members of the public in the minutes before the attack, ""no steward or British Transport Police (BTP) officer appear to have identified him as suspicious"", the inquiry heard. Mr Greaney said experts concluded: ""If the presence of a potential suicide bomber had been reported, it is very likely that mitigating actions would've been taken that could have reduced the impact of the attack. ""This is because there was sufficient time between Abedi first being spotted by, and also reported to staff and his attack to effectively react."" Paul Greaney QC read the names of each of those murdered by suicide bomber Salman Abedi during the first day of the inquiry One member of the public, William Drysdale, spotted Salman Abedi and thought he was praying, less than an hour before he detonated his bomb. A second witness, Julie Merchant, approached BTP officer Jessica Bullough around 32 minutes before the deadly bombing to point out Abedi. Mr Greaney said Ms Merchant cannot recall the details of the conversation with the officer but that it was ""to do with praying and political correctness"". The officer cannot remember the conversation taking place, the hearing was told. She was the first police officer to enter the City Rooms, where the bomb was detonated, after the attack, showing considerable bravery, Mr Greaney added. CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up Two more witnesses, known only as A and B, also saw a man matching Salman Abedi's description acting suspiciously. Mr A challenged Abedi, asking him what he had in his backpack. The witness then spoke to a Mohammed Agha, an employee of Showsec which provided security to the Arena on behalf of the venue's owners SMG, at 22.14, some 17 minutes before the detonation but said he was ""fobbed off."" Mr Agha spoke to colleague Kyle Lawler about the matter, eight minutes before the bomb went off. But neither security control nor anyone else was informed about the suspicious activity, the hearing was told, although Mr Lawler said in a statement he tried to contact control but could not get through. He then spotted the man get up and start walking towards the arena entrance. His statement continued: ""I just froze and did not get anything out on the radio. I knew at that point it was too late."" The hearings will take place in a room specially converted from two courtrooms at Manchester Magistrates' Court Mr Greaney also said expert evidence would be heard about risk assessments at the Arena. ""There was no effective risk assessments that considered the threats from terrorism at Manchester Arena in early 2017, despite the severe threat level,"" he said. The possible role of Salman Abedi's family in radicalising the suicide bomber and his brother needs to be assessed, the inquiry also heard. Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing Mr Greaney told the inquiry: ""Ismail Abedi, the brother of the killers, has been required by the inquiry legal team to answer a series of questions relating to what might, in general terms, be described as the issue of radicalisation. ""To date, he has declined to answer these questions on the basis that he maintains that his answers may tend to incriminate him."" He said similar requests to the brothers' parents, Ramadan and Samia, who are believed to be in Libya, ""have not been responded to, at least not in any substantive way"". The chairman will make a report and recommendations once all the evidence has been heard by the inquiry, which is expected to take up to six months.

India climbs second to US as Covid cases surge,"For the last few days India has added more than 75,000 daily infections daily India has recorded more than 90,000 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking its total above that of Brazil. The country now has the second-largest number of confirmed cases in the world, 4,204,613. It has reported 71,642 deaths, the third-highest in the world. The surge in reported infections has mostly come from five states. The rise comes as the government continues to lift restrictions to try to boost an economy that lost millions of jobs when the virus hit in March. For the last seven days India's caseload has galloped, adding more than 75,000 daily infections per day. More than 60% of the active cases are coming from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. Cases have also begun spiking in the capital, Delhi, as well, with more than 3,200 infections recorded on Sunday, the city's highest in more than two months. An upsurge of Covid-19 in many rural areas has also led to an uptick in numbers. The virus has struck a remote tribe in India's Andamans islands, with 10 members of the Greater Andamanese testing positive over the past month. The rise in cases is also partly a reflection of increased testing - the number of daily tests conducted across the country has risen to more than a million. Although India has a low death rate from the disease, nearly 1,000 deaths have been recorded every day from across the country for the last seven days. In early August India became the third country in the world to pass two million cases. India went into a stringent lockdown in March in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, whose numbers were only in the hundreds then. It began to ease out of it in phases in June to promote economic activity, even as cases continued to spike. The pandemic and the lockdown caused massive disruptions to economic activity during the quarter. India's economy shrank by 23.9% in the three months to the end of June, the worst slump since the country started releasing quarterly data in 1996. How many Covid-19 deaths is India missing?

"Breaking|Breaking newsRussia's Navalny out of coma after poisoningRussia's poisoned opposition figure Alexei Navalny is out of an induced coma and his condition has improved, says Berlin hospitalEurope","Alexei Navalny was flown to Berlin for treatment in August after falling ill on a plane Doctors treating Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny say he is out of an induced coma and his condition, since being poisoned, has improved. He is responding to verbal stimuli, they said. Mr Navalny, 44, was flown to Germany after falling ill on a flight in Siberia in August. His team allege he was poisoned on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who denies any involvement. German doctors say the Putin critic was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. On Monday, the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin said in a statement thatMr Navalny was being weaned off mechanical ventilation,external. ""He is responding to verbal stimuli. It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning,"" it said. It also said doctors were in close contact with Mr Navalny's wife. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, tweeted,external: ""News about Alexei. Today he was taken out of induced coma. Gradually he will be switched off from a ventilator. He responds to speech and to being addressed to."" Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who in recent years has become the most prominent opposition politician in Putin's Russia. Mr Navalny fell ill on 20 August on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea at Tomsk airport. ""Alexei started moaning and screaming. He was clearly in pain. He was lying on the floor in the part of the plane reserved for cabin crew,""a passenger seated near Mr Navalny on the plane told BBC Russian. The plane was diverted to Omsk, where the opposition politician was admitted to an emergency hospital. Russian officials initially refused to allow Mr Navalny to be transferred abroad for medical treatment but after three days he was flown by air ambulance to Berlin. Mr Navalny is being treated at the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin, Germany Last week, doctors in Germany said the results of toxicology tests carried out at a military laboratory gave ""unequivocal proof"" that Mr Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Doctors in Omsk insisted that no poisonous substances had been detected in Mr Navalny's body when he was under their care. On Monday, the Kremlin said it was ""absurd"" to blame Russia for Mr Navalny's poisoning. ""Attempts to somehow associate Russia with what happened are unacceptable to us, they are absurd,"" Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the allegation that Novichok was used was not backed up by evidence. A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. A UK investigation blamed the Russian state. On Monday, the British government summoned the Russian ambassador to the UK ""to register deep concern about the poisoning"". ""It's completely unacceptable that a banned chemical weapon has been used and Russia must hold a full, transparent investigation,""Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday.,external. In Germany there is growing pressure for Chancellor Angela Markel to take a tougher stance over the incident. Last week, she said Mr Navalny was the victim of attempted murder and that the world would look to Russia for answers. Analysis by Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin Alexei Navalny's condition has improved but the German-Russian relationship looks far less healthy. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas says that if Moscow fails to co-operate with investigations into the poisoning within the next few days, Berlin will start talking to European partners about sanctions. An even more explosive threat is that for the first time Angela Merkel's government is no longer ruling out halting building work on the nearly completed pipeline Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to bring Russian gas to Germany using a pipeline beneath the Baltic Sea. But stopping the project would be costly. Around 120 European companies are involved and the total cost is more than â¬9bn (Â£8bn; $10.6bn). Germany would have to pay damages. Chancellor Merkel may be under pressure. But German society is divided on how to deal with the Kremlin and German attitudes towards Russia are varied and complex. So tough anti-Moscow rhetoric is not a vote-winner. If action is needed, Mrs Merkel's preference will be targeted and co-ordinated action with the rest of the EU. A spokesman for the German government said on Monday that it was too early to make a decision about Nord Stream. He said that Russia had ""serious questions"" to answer but that a response could not be expected in ""three to four days"". The project must be completed despite current ""difficulties"", said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak according to Interfax news agency. TheEuropean Union has demanded a ""transparent"" investigation,externalby the Russian government. USPresident Donald Trump has refused to condemn Russiasaying the case was ""tragic"" but he has not seen proof of Mr Putin's involvement. When asked on Monday about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Mr Trump re-iterated US opposition to the gas project. There have been a number of previous attacks on high-profile critics or opponents of President Putin, including politicians, intelligence officers and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied involvement. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has led nationwide protests against the Russian authorities. He first made his mark in 2008 when he started blogging about alleged malpractice and corruption at some of Russia's big state-controlled corporations. Russia's vociferous Putin critic He has called Mr Putin's party a place of ""crooks and thieves"" that is ""sucking the blood out of Russia"", and has faced attacks in the past. However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in recent elections because of a conviction for embezzlement. He denies the crime, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism. Two hours that saved Navalny's life Russia's vociferous Putin critic What are Novichok nerve agents?

LiveLiveFoden & Greenwood apologise for 'Covid-19 breach' but leave England campEngland boss Gareth Southgate addresses the media to look forward to Tuesday's match against Denmark.BBC Sport,"Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood out of England squad Players broke quarantine guidelines after win over Iceland Manager Gareth Southgate calls them ""naive"" England face Denmark in Copenhagen on Tuesday England beat Iceland 1-0 on Saturday Mantej Mann Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) That's it from us - thanks for joining our live text coverage. It's worth remembering that there is still a Nations League match happening tomorrow night. Join us on Tuesday for live text commentary of England's match against Denmark (19:45 BST). Until then... Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) ...Aaaaaand breathe! It's been a busy afternoon and we now know Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood are to leave the England camp after breaking coronavirus quarantine guidelines in Iceland. The Football Association is investigating the breaches after Saturday's1-0 Nations League victory. Manchester City midfielder Foden, 20, and Manchester United forward Greenwood, 18, both made their senior international debuts in the game. You can read the full storyhere. Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Manchester City have also had their say on the situation surrounding Phil Foden. ""It
is clear that Philâs actions were totally inappropriate,"" say the club. ""His
behaviour not only directly contravenes strict guidelines related to Covid-19,
but also falls well below the standard expected of a Manchester City player and
England international. ""The club supports the FA regarding this incident, and officials from the Club are
now in touch in relation to Philâs enforced early return to the UK. ""We
have no further comment to make on this matter."" Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Simon StoneBBC Sport Manchester United have responded to the news of Mason Greenwood's exclusion from the England squad. âManchester United are liaising
with the Football Association and are disappointed with the actions of Mason
Greenwood over this situation,"" said a Manchester United spokesperson. It is understood the club do not expect he will
have to quarantine as there is no travel restriction with Iceland. However, they will
make a decision on his eligibility to return to training in due course. Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood are the latest players to have been withdrawn from the England squad, afterdefender Harry Maguire stepped down in August. The Manchester United defender, 27, had been given a suspended prison sentence on the Greek island of Syros. He wasfound guiltyof aggravated assault, resisting arrest and repeated attempts of bribery. Southgate said withdrawing Maguire was ""in the best interests of all parties"". #bbcfootball Digby the Dog:When you think how much the England cricket team sacrificed to give fans cricket to watch this summer (Archer excludes) - and Foden and Greenwood couldnât stay in for one night. Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) That's all from the England boss for now. So we now know Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood will be returning to England after breaching quarantine rules in Iceland. However, Southgate is still working his way through the facts before he decides any further action against the pair, and he says ""nobody from outside our party has been into the areas of the hotel we are occupying"". And after all that, there is still a Nations League game to play against Denmark tomorrow. I have a feeling we might not yet have heard the end of this one... Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Gareth Southgate:""We have to treat every incident repeatedly. These are two boys I don't know particularly well at the moment so I cannot speak in great depth. I've got to try to speak with them later in the appropriate way. They have apologised but everything has happened so quickly and we have to get to the facts. ""This is the job [England manager] like no other. All management roles are difficult and this is another level, in terms of what you have to deal and what is expected. The players who have been with us for a long time know exactly what is expected. Whenever people have stepped across that line when they have been with us we have dealt with it appropriately, but we cannot act on things that happen when they are not with us."" Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Gareth Southgate said:""It is a very serious situation and we have treated it that way. I have spent the morning dealing with this and then helping the coaches take training in preparation for the game tomorrow. ""They have been naive and we have dealt with it appropriately. I recognise their age, but of course, the whole world is dealing with this pandemic and there is a responsibility on all ages that they do their part. We are not underestimating how important it is we keep the bubble the way we have."" Asked how this would effect both players' international careers, Southgate added:""All of those things are too early, until I'm totally aware of every situation. I'm a father of young adults and I know they can get things wrong. We are not excusing that in this instance and we have to asses everything else moving forward."" Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Gareth Southgate said:""Unfortunately this morning, it was brought to my attention that two of the boys have broken the Covid-19 guidelines, in terms of our secure bubble. So we had to decide very quickly that they couldn't have any interaction with the rest of the team and wouldn't be able to train.

Emma Barnett to present Radio 4's Woman's Hour,"This video can not be played The broadcaster thanked her 5 Live audience for making the show 'such a wonderful place' Broadcaster Emma Barnett will be the new presenter of Woman's Hour. The 5 Live and Newsnight presenter will step into the shoes of Jane Garvey and Dame Jenni Murray, who have both decided to step down from the show. Barnett is already associated with the Radio 4 programme, presenting its late-night spin-off and regularly chairing the Woman's Hour Power List. She first hosted Woman's Hour at the age of 26, making her the youngest presenter in the show's history. Woman's Hour, which offers a female perspective on the world, is one of the longest-running programmes on British radio, first launching in 1946 on the BBC Light Programme. The 45-minute show is broadcast every morning at 10:00 on BBC Radio 4. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Staff on the show were told of Barnett's appointment on Monday morning. Unlike the current arrangement, where Garvey and Dame Jenni share presenting duties, Barnett will be the main host from Monday to Thursday each week. An additional presenter will be appointed to host the Friday and Saturday editions. ""I can't wait to get to know the many listeners of Woman's Hour a lot, lot better,"" said the presenter. ""What adventures we are going to have together - all starting in the year that this BBC institution, the radio mothership, turns 75. ""I have a long love of Woman's Hour and live radio and know that this is a very special and rare opportunity."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The move will mean the end of Barnett's mid-morning show on 5 Live, which has seen presenter named best speech broadcaster at the 2020 Radio Academy Awards (ARIAs) and radio broadcaster of the year 2018 by the Broadcasting Press Guild. She will continue to present Newsnight on BBC Two. Garvey, who has hosted the show since 2007, announced she was leaving last week. ""It's been a real privilege to play a small part in the history of this very special radio programme,"" she said, adding how proud she was of its relationship with its listeners. ""On one unforgettable day, I interviewed David Cameron in the morning, and Mary J Blige in the afternoon. There's no other job like it,"" she said. ""But famous people are not the reason people engage with Woman's Hour. It's because the programme still talks about the subjects and challenges no one else goes near. I'm very proud of our relationship with the audience and the trust they place in us."" Garvey will now go on to host her own new Radio 4 series in the new year. Woman's Hour presenters Jenni Murray (left) and Jane Garvey in 2016 Earlier this summer, Garvey's colleague Dame Jenni Murray announced she was to leave the show after 33 years. Dame Jenni, who is the longest-serving presenter in the Radio 4 show's 74-year history, will present her final show on 1 October. Barnett started her career with the trade publication Media Week before joining the Daily Telegraph as its first digital media editor. She was later appointed women's editor - where she steered coverage away from fashion and celebrities towards more weighty issues, and launched the award-winning site Telegraph Wonder Women. She started broadcasting on the commercial radio station LBC in 2011, initially working on the late night ""graveyard shift"", and jumped ship to 5 Live in 2014. There, she established herself as a fearless and inquisitive interviewer. The Times dubbed her ""the BBC's new Rottweiler"", while Jeremy Paxman described her as his favourite political interviewer. ""Being interviewed on the radio by Barnett is like being interviewed by a basketful of cobras,"" observed The Telegraph's Charlotte Runcie last year. ""She is single-handedly rebuilding the BBC's reputation as the home of the heavyweight political interview."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn on Woman's Hour During the 2017 election campaign, Barnett made headlines while questioning Jeremy Corbyn, then-leader of the Labour Party, over the cost of his party's plan to offer free childcare to two-year-olds. While Corbyn struggled to remember the details of his plan, Barnett gave listeners a running commentary: ""You're logging into your iPadâ¦ you've had a phone call while you're in here and you don't know how much it's going to cost."" Afterwards, Barnett received a hostile response from some Corbyn supporters, who accused her of being ""biased"" and a ""Tory"". He later defended the presenter, saying: ""Under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone throw personal abuse at anyone else because they're doing the job they they've been employed to do."" Barnett also made broadcasting history by hosting the BBC's first joint live radio and TV phone-in with a Prime Minister, Theresa May. The broadcaster, who booked the interview herself, spent two days rehearsing the encounter, with her editor standing in as the Prime Minister. She told the Express she had prepared three separate versions of her questions, so she could switch her response depending on May's reactions. ""An interview is an intellectual game of chess,""she said,external. ""Especially one like that."" This video can not be played The Duchess of Cornwall says the âworst bitâ of lockdown has been not seeing her family Earlier this year, she hosted her 5 Live show from Clarence House where Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, guest edited the programme and discussed life under lockdown. Last year, Barnett published her first book, It's About Bloody Time, Period - a frank, funny and myth-busting exploration of menstruation. Motivated by her own experiences of endometriosis and IVF, the book aimed to break the taboos around discussing periods and fertility. ""Women's issues are everyone's issues,""she told students at the London School of Economics at the time,external. ""I really enjoy disrupting what is expected of me. Don't get yourself put in a box."" After news broke of her  new role at Women's Hour, fellow broadcasters and fans shared their congratulations online. Allow Twitter content?

"Breaking|Breaking newsRussia's Navalny out of coma after poisoningRussia's poisoned opposition figure Alexei Navalny is out of an induced coma and his condition has improved, says Berlin hospitalEuropeLockdown could be put in place in CaerphillyThe warning comes after a member of staff at a school tested positive for Covid-19.Wales","Alexei Navalny was flown to Berlin for treatment in August after falling ill on a plane Doctors treating Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny say he is out of an induced coma and his condition, since being poisoned, has improved. He is responding to verbal stimuli, they said. Mr Navalny, 44, was flown to Germany after falling ill on a flight in Siberia in August. His team allege he was poisoned on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who denies any involvement. German doctors say the Putin critic was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. On Monday, the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin said in a statement thatMr Navalny was being weaned off mechanical ventilation,external. ""He is responding to verbal stimuli. It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning,"" it said. It also said doctors were in close contact with Mr Navalny's wife. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, tweeted,external: ""News about Alexei. Today he was taken out of induced coma. Gradually he will be switched off from a ventilator. He responds to speech and to being addressed to."" Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who in recent years has become the most prominent opposition politician in Putin's Russia. Mr Navalny fell ill on 20 August on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea at Tomsk airport. ""Alexei started moaning and screaming. He was clearly in pain. He was lying on the floor in the part of the plane reserved for cabin crew,""a passenger seated near Mr Navalny on the plane told BBC Russian. The plane was diverted to Omsk, where the opposition politician was admitted to an emergency hospital. Russian officials initially refused to allow Mr Navalny to be transferred abroad for medical treatment but after three days he was flown by air ambulance to Berlin. Mr Navalny is being treated at the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin, Germany Last week, doctors in Germany said the results of toxicology tests carried out at a military laboratory gave ""unequivocal proof"" that Mr Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Doctors in Omsk insisted that no poisonous substances had been detected in Mr Navalny's body when he was under their care. On Monday, the Kremlin said it was ""absurd"" to blame Russia for Mr Navalny's poisoning. ""Attempts to somehow associate Russia with what happened are unacceptable to us, they are absurd,"" Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the allegation that Novichok was used was not backed up by evidence. A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. A UK investigation blamed the Russian state. On Monday, the British government summoned the Russian ambassador to the UK ""to register deep concern about the poisoning"". ""It's completely unacceptable that a banned chemical weapon has been used and Russia must hold a full, transparent investigation,""Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday.,external. In Germany there is growing pressure for Chancellor Angela Markel to take a tougher stance over the incident. Last week, she said Mr Navalny was the victim of attempted murder and that the world would look to Russia for answers. Analysis by Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin Alexei Navalny's condition has improved but the German-Russian relationship looks far less healthy. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas says that if Moscow fails to co-operate with investigations into the poisoning within the next few days, Berlin will start talking to European partners about sanctions. An even more explosive threat is that for the first time Angela Merkel's government is no longer ruling out halting building work on the nearly completed pipeline Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to bring Russian gas to Germany using a pipeline beneath the Baltic Sea. But stopping the project would be costly. Around 120 European companies are involved and the total cost is more than â¬9bn (Â£8bn; $10.6bn). Germany would have to pay damages. Chancellor Merkel may be under pressure. But German society is divided on how to deal with the Kremlin and German attitudes towards Russia are varied and complex. So tough anti-Moscow rhetoric is not a vote-winner. If action is needed, Mrs Merkel's preference will be targeted and co-ordinated action with the rest of the EU. A spokesman for the German government said on Monday that it was too early to make a decision about Nord Stream. He said that Russia had ""serious questions"" to answer but that a response could not be expected in ""three to four days"". The project must be completed despite current ""difficulties"", said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak according to Interfax news agency. TheEuropean Union has demanded a ""transparent"" investigation,externalby the Russian government. USPresident Donald Trump has refused to condemn Russiasaying the case was ""tragic"" but he has not seen proof of Mr Putin's involvement. When asked on Monday about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Mr Trump re-iterated US opposition to the gas project. There have been a number of previous attacks on high-profile critics or opponents of President Putin, including politicians, intelligence officers and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied involvement. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has led nationwide protests against the Russian authorities. He first made his mark in 2008 when he started blogging about alleged malpractice and corruption at some of Russia's big state-controlled corporations. Russia's vociferous Putin critic He has called Mr Putin's party a place of ""crooks and thieves"" that is ""sucking the blood out of Russia"", and has faced attacks in the past. However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in recent elections because of a conviction for embezzlement. He denies the crime, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism. Two hours that saved Navalny's life Russia's vociferous Putin critic What are Novichok nerve agents?

Lockdown could be put in place in CaerphillyThe warning comes after a member of staff at a school tested positive for Covid-19.Wales,"Caerphilly has 43.1 cases of coronavirus per 100,000 people A local lockdown could be put in place in Caerphilly county if ""necessary"", the leader of the council has warned. Philippa Marsden told BBC Radio Wales any decision would be made after advice was taken from Public Health Wales. She was speaking aftera class of 21 pupils was told to self-isolate for two weeks after a member of staff tested positive for Covid-19. There were 31 new cases in Caerphilly on Monday, with a total of 98 reported in the last seven days. Its seven-day figure for cases per 100,000 people now stands at 54.1, and total cases since reporting started stands at 905. One class at St Gwladys Primary School in Bargoed must stay at home, although the school remains open. A school in Cardiff has alsotold 30 pupils to self isolate. School staff in Bridgend, Cwmbran and Carmarthen test positive Class to self-isolate at Caerphilly school after positive test Covid-19 at Cardiff Ysgol Bro Edern leaves 30 pupils self-isolating ""Local authorities cannot act alone,"" Ms Marsden said. ""It's about us doing this together through Public Health Wales, the health board and, ultimately, Welsh Government."" Children at St Gwladys Primary School in Caerphilly county have been told to self-isolate Ms Marsden said she would ""absolutely"" consider closing bars and clubs if social distancing rules were not followed. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, had earlier told BBC Radio Wales ""a very close eye"" was being kept on Caerphilly. Following the publication of Monday's figures, Dr Shankar said: ""I would appeal to everyone in the Caerphilly area that if you have even the mildest of Covid-19 symptoms, a high temperature or fever, a new and persistent cough, or a loss or change in your sense of smell or taste, or even if you feel generally unwell with no explanation, to make use of the local testing unit at Caerphilly Leisure Centre. ""As children return to schools, I understand that parents will be concerned at reports of positive cases. ""I would urge you to follow advice from the school or local authority and only withdraw children from school when asked to do so. ""Social distancing measures that are in place are designed to prevent the spread of the disease beyond the 'bubbles' established in schools."" Caerphilly council said it ""fully"" appreciated the situation at St Gwladys Primary School ""will cause concern to parents and children at the school"". Caerphilly county has had more new cases in the past week - 98 - than anywhere else in Wales and more than the area has seen since the end of April. The number of cases on Friday - 31 - was the highest in the county for a single day since the pandemic began. The case rate for the past seven days - 54.1 cases per 100,000 people - is also one of the biggest increases in the UK, after Bolton and Rossendale in Lancashire and Hertsmere in south-east England. Where there have been local interventions or lockdowns so far - mostly in north-west England and the Midlands - the case rate has been usually been between 70 and 90 cases per 100,000. Birmingham was put on a ""watch list"" when it reached 31 cases per 100,000 but the issues were in particular neighbourhoods. More than 1,600 people have been tested in Caerphilly county in the past week Caerphilly is still outside the highest 10 case rates in the UK, which istopped by Bolton(116 per 100,000 at the most recent count) and includes Manchester and Tameside (both 50 cases per 100,000). Rhondda Cynon Taff has also seen a recent spike, although with fewer positive tests than Caerphilly. Young people breaking rules risk 'second wave' Most positive tests in Wales since end of June What do the stats tell us in Wales? Public health officials have also been concerned at the numbers of young people testing positive. Just under 14% of those tested in Wales are in their 20s. Nearly 28% of positive tests are people in their 20s and 30s. But this does not translate into hospital cases. Currently, only 5.5% of positive cases in Welsh hospitals are people in their 20s and 30s, according to Public Health Wales figures. Nearly two-thirds are aged over 70. A walk-in test centre opened outside Caerphilly Leisure Centre on Saturday. The school and council said the parents of all the affected children had been contacted and they were working with the contact tracing system to protect other pupils and the wider community. Caseshave also been confirmed at schoolsin Bridgend, Maesteg, Cwmbran and Carmarthen. Meanwhile, a cafe in Caerphilly has closed after one of its staff tested positive for Covid-19. Caerphilly Mountain Snack Bar has shut for 14 days, but it said all other members of staff have tested negative. Calvin Evans, who owns the Aviary bar on Cardiff Road, said he had decided to close temporarily, less than four weeks after it reopened. ""There's no point in putting the staff and customers... in jeopardy for the sake of another week's worth of business,"" he said. ""It is a hard decision, but it's just not worth it for a bit of profit. ""We've got young members of staff there, we've got staff with elderly family members, it's just not worth that risk.""

Five bars warned over social distancing measures,"This video can not be played Ian Cottrell said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing Five bars in Cardiff city centre have been ordered to improve the way they operate in order to comply with social distancing guidance. It follows ""concern"" raised by health officials about a video which showed crowds of clubbers appearing to ignore guidelines at Coyote Ugly bar. Cardiff council said Coyote Ugly, along with Peppermint, Mocka Lounge, Rum and Fizz, and Gin and Juice had 48 hours to make changes. They could otherwise face closure. ""It is the responsibility of businesses to ensure that social distancing is maintained and their premises can be used in a way that is safe for customers and staff and minimises the potential for Covid-19 to spread,"" said the council's cabinet member for environment, Michael Michael. ""Ensuring the city centre is safe to visit is a priority and scenes like those seen on St Mary Street at the weekend are simply unacceptable. ""Businesses should be in no doubt that we will take action against any premises that aren't operating in a safe manner. ""Officers will be returning to the businesses issued with improvement notices, and visiting others across the city, and will not hesitate to issue closure notices if needed."" Social distance plea to avoid new 'harsh lockdown' What are the latest social distancing rules? Minority of young people 'ruining it for majority' The footage,externalwas captured by Ian Cottrell on lower St Mary Street in Cardiff and was posted on social media. It shows crowds outside the Coyote Ugly bar at about 00:30 BST on Saturday, but the venue said it adhered to coronavirus rules and turned away large crowds. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said people needed to be responsible. ""I saw the videos and I was really concerned,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""It is disappointing that people are congregating in large numbers without having any regard to social distancing."" He added: ""It's more about people taking more individual and collective responsibilities. We all have to do our part."" The council said its officers visited Coyote Ugly over the weekend and the venue ""acted quickly to resolve a number of identified issues"". South Wales Police said officers spoke with staff at the venue on Friday evening, and the venue was also visited on Saturday ""to try and prevent similar issues this evening and in the future"". South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said the issue was for councils but police ""can intervene"" if people break the law. But he added: ""I don't think it's a policing issue. The alternative is to shut the night-time economy. ""If you have crowds behaving in an irresponsible way... they are not just an issue for the police, they are an issue of public health. The problem has to be solved collectively."" Coyote Ugly said it was ""very careful"" to comply with all the rules. Meanwhile, Carmarthenshire council is asking people to comply with rules after a cluster of cases which, it said, centred around a presentation evening held on Saturday August 29 at Drefach Cricket and Football Club, organised in ""breach of coronavirus regulations"". It said 12 people who are linked to the evening have tested positive for Covid-19 and other attendees will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. In astatement,external, the club said some senior players had tested positive and it ""immediately advised Public Health Wales and are liaising with them on a continuing basis"".

Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Manchester City have also had their say on the situation surrounding Phil Foden. ""It
is clear that Philâs actions were totally inappropriate,"" say the club. ""His
behaviour not only directly contravenes strict guidelines related to Covid-19,
but also falls well below the standard expected of a Manchester City player and
England international. ""The club supports the FA regarding this incident, and officials from the Club are
now in touch in relation to Philâs enforced early return to the UK. ""We
have no further comment to make on this matter."" Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Simon StoneBBC Sport Manchester United have responded to the news of Mason Greenwood's exclusion from the England squad. âManchester United are liaising
with the Football Association and are disappointed with the actions of Mason
Greenwood over this situation,"" said a Manchester United spokesperson. It is understood the club do not expect he will
have to quarantine as there is no travel restriction with Iceland. However, they will
make a decision on his eligibility to return to training in due course. Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood are the latest players to have been withdrawn from the England squad, afterdefender Harry Maguire stepped down in August. The Manchester United defender, 27, had been given a suspended prison sentence on the Greek island of Syros. He wasfound guiltyof aggravated assault, resisting arrest and repeated attempts of bribery. Southgate said withdrawing Maguire was ""in the best interests of all parties"". #bbcfootball Digby the Dog:When you think how much the England cricket team sacrificed to give fans cricket to watch this summer (Archer excludes) - and Foden and Greenwood couldnât stay in for one night. Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) That's all from the England boss for now. So we now know Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood will be returning to England after breaching quarantine rules in Iceland. However, Southgate is still working his way through the facts before he decides any further action against the pair, and he says ""nobody from outside our party has been into the areas of the hotel we are occupying"". And after all that, there is still a Nations League game to play against Denmark tomorrow. I have a feeling we might not yet have heard the end of this one... Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Gareth Southgate:""We have to treat every incident repeatedly. These are two boys I don't know particularly well at the moment so I cannot speak in great depth. I've got to try to speak with them later in the appropriate way. They have apologised but everything has happened so quickly and we have to get to the facts. ""This is the job [England manager] like no other. All management roles are difficult and this is another level, in terms of what you have to deal and what is expected.

Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Gareth Southgate said:""It is a very serious situation and we have treated it that way. I have spent the morning dealing with this and then helping the coaches take training in preparation for the game tomorrow. ""They have been naive and we have dealt with it appropriately. I recognise their age, but of course, the whole world is dealing with this pandemic and there is a responsibility on all ages that they do their part. We are not underestimating how important it is we keep the bubble the way we have."" Asked how this would effect both players' international careers, Southgate added:""All of those things are too early, until I'm totally aware of every situation. I'm a father of young adults and I know they can get things wrong. We are not excusing that in this instance and we have to asses everything else moving forward."" Denmark v England (Tues, 19:45 BST) Gareth Southgate said:""Unfortunately this morning, it was brought to my attention that two of the boys have broken the Covid-19 guidelines, in terms of our secure bubble. So we had to decide very quickly that they couldn't have any interaction with the rest of the team and wouldn't be able to train. Given the procedures we have to follow now they will have to travel back to England separately. ""Nothing has happened in the areas we occupy in the hotel. we are still getting to the depths of all the information because this was only brought to may attention a couple of hours before training, so I'm still getting to grips with the detail.

Ministers plan laws overriding part of Brexit deal,"Finishing talks with the EU without striking a deal would still be a ""good outcome"", the PM will say Ministers are planning new legislation that could override a key part of last year's EU withdrawal agreement. The move could change the nature of new Northern Ireland customs arrangements intended to prevent a return to checks at the border with the Irish Republic. Downing Street said it was a standby plan in case EU-UK trade talks fail. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson said that, if a trade deal is not reached by 15 October, both sides should ""move on"", which would still be a ""good outcome"". Why Brexit is still a big issue Analysis: Fears for Brexit deal as talks near deadline What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Although the UK formally left the EU in January, it has continued to follow rules set in Brussels during a transition period - which ends on 31 December - while discussions over a long-term trade agreement continue. Another round of talks - the eighth - begins on Tuesday, aimed at securing a deal to allow companies to trade without taxes or customs checks. But Mr Johnson is expected to tell EU leaders it must be agreed in time for the European Council meeting on 15 October if it is to be in force by 1 January. ""If we can't agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on,"" he will say. The UK has said it wantsa deal with the EU which resembles Canada's, which gets rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods traded. But Mr Johnson will say no deal means having a ""trading arrangement with the EU like Australia's"", using terms set by the World Trade Organisation. In practice, this would mean taxes on exports and customs checks. ""That would be a good outcome for the UK,"" the prime minister will say. During trade talks, the UK and EU have been at loggerheads over two issues in particular - the future of fisheries and state aid, the money given by governments to help companies. The EU says the UK is trying to give itself an unfair advantage by applying different rules on state aid, but the UK insists it should have control over this as a sovereign country. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, told French radio on Monday: ""The British would like the best of both worlds - export their products to the European market on their terms."" Meanwhile, the government will publish its Internal Market Bill - designed to protect trade arrangements between the four parts of the UK - on Wednesday. This could contradict the Northern Ireland Protocol, set up to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, which many fear could be detrimental to peace. The protocol says Northern Ireland will follow some EU customs rules - meaning customs declarations for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, as well as some new checks on goods going from Great Britain into Northern Ireland - after the transition period. The Financial Times,externalsaid the bill would ""eliminate"" the legal force of the Withdrawal Agreement, struck less than a year ago between the UK and EU, in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason described the proposed bill as an ""electrifying development in the Brexit process"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that she trusted the UK government ""to implement the Withdrawal Agreement, an obligation under international law and prerequisite for any future partnership"". She added that the Northern Ireland Protocol was ""essential to protect peace and stability on the island and integrity of the single market"". By John Campbell, Northern Ireland economics and business editor The Northern Ireland part of the Brexit deal, known as the protocol, was agreed in October last year. It is designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland - or even any new checks at the Irish border. It does this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. This will mean products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will be subject to new checks and controls - the so-called Irish Sea border. However the precise nature of these checks needs to be agreed by the EU and UK and this is being negotiated in parallel with the trade talks between the two. The government says it's still committed to the protocol but it could make its own decisions on how it is implemented if it cannot reach agreement with the EU. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Boris Johnson told us he had an oven-ready deal. And he fought a general election telling us he had an oven-ready deal. [This] now suggests that he was misleading people in that general election. ""And Parliament supported the Withdrawal Agreement earlier on this year. He has made promises and signed a treaty around these arrangements for Northern Ireland, and he now seems to be backing out of that."" Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neilltweeted,externalthat any threat of backtracking on the protocol would be a ""treacherous betrayal which would inflict irreversible harm on the all-Ireland economy and the Good Friday Agreement"". This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid,externalthe move would ""significantly increase"" the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, and the ""resulting damage to the economy will be entirely Tory-inflicted. What charlatans"". Government sources told the BBC the legislation was ""not intended to derail the talks"", and a spokeswoman said the UK would continue to approach talks with the EU in good faith. ""As a responsible government, we are considering fallback options in the event this is not achieved, to ensure the communities of Northern Ireland are protected,"" she said.

Students 'felt silenced' after sex assault claims,"Alyse McCamish held a pretend graduation after leaving the college early Two former students who alleged sexual assault and sexual misconduct by another student at a prestigious college say they felt ""silenced"". Alyse McCamish and Sydney Feder, both 23, have issued legal action amid claims the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama did not investigate properly. Ms McCamish claims it took six months for her allegation to be reported to the police. The college said there was an ""ongoing legal process"". It added that it ""would not be right to comment on specific detail"". The Royal Welsh College, of which the Prince of Wales is president, is well known for its famous alumni, such as Sir Anthony Hopkins, Ruth Jones and Rob Brydon. Ms McCamish is currently directing two films Ms McCamish, from Tennessee in the United States, moved to Wales when she was 19 after successfully auditioning for the college in Chicago, having been lured by the appeal of ""such a beautiful country"". But she alleges that during freshers' week she was sexually assaulted by a fellow student, an allegation which he denied. Ms McCamish, who is currently in the process of directing two films, says she eventually left the college early with a ""diminished degree"" because of her experience. ""It felt like they had such a lack of empathy for an arts school,"" she said. ""It made me lose a lot of faith in humanity. I lost a lot of faith in people who have power."" Sydney Feder moved to Cardiff from the United States to go to the college Ms Feder, from Connecticut in the United States, moved to Wales at 18 and said she felt unsafe from the beginning. ""From day one I had a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that this was not a safe space,"" she said. ""In acting classes, people would kiss you without consent or grope you without consent and they would be encouraged by staff and congratulated for making that bold decision."" During her third year, Ms Feder says she was assaulted while alone in the female changing room during a rehearsal of a final-year show. ""I made a report to the college and it felt like screaming into the abyss. They interviewed me about it once. That was it. I was never spoken to again after I had made the report,"" she said. Ms McCamish said she verbally complained to senior members of staff in June 2017 but the college did not notify the police of her complaint until January 2018. ""It took me a while to come forward. I was very determined for a while to not ever tell anybody in my head,"" she said. Sydney Feder and Alyse McCamish are unhappy with how the college dealt with their allegations ""I reported it and then'Me Too'happened.  So I went back to college thinking this is perfect timing, they're going to take it seriously. But my experience was so the opposite of how sexual assault was being handled at the time."" In an email chain in January 2018 seen by the BBC, in which staff members discuss Ms McCamish's allegation, one senior staff member asks ""it might pose the question why we didn't report it earlier?"" Ms McCamish was interviewed by the police in January 2018 but no further criminal action was taken. ""The police told me the allegation would be on his record and that was enough for me. I trusted the college would handle it,"" she added. South Wales Police has confirmed no investigation is ongoing. During an internal investigation by the college, Ms Feder and six other women came forward with allegations of misconduct against the same student. TikTok star 'glad' she shared sexual assault story Writing about my sexual assault was 'cathartic' John Watkins, of Bater Law, who represents the women, said the college failed to follow its own safeguarding policy. He said these complaints were deemed to have been of ""inappropriate touching"" and not sexual misconduct, despite the university's student conduct regulations stipulating that ""touching inappropriately without consent"" is considered sexual misconduct. He says the college decided to investigate Ms McCamish's case separately to the other women's allegations as it was considered to be ""more serious"". The legal documents initiating proceedings have been sent to the civil court. The student denied any allegation of sexual assault and said the incident alleged by Ms McCamish ""simply didn't happen"". The college found on the balance of probabilities the allegations of inappropriate touching were proven, but there was insufficient evidence with regards to Ms McCamish's allegation of sexual assault. He was suspended for two weeks and, in a letter to students, apologised to anyone who ""felt unsafe and uncomfortable around me"". Ms Feder said she was never told what happened after she made her allegation Ms Feder said she was never told of the decision relating to her allegation and she only found out about it when launching her legal action. ""When I found out I immediately cried. It was a few years too late,"" she said. ""They'd decided I wasn't worth having that vindication at the time."" Ms McCamish has also criticised the college's handling of the aftermath of the investigation including an occasion in which a letter from the accused student was read out to their year group. She said: ""I just couldn't believe it. I never had a voice. I never got a letter read out on my behalf. It was like they'd just totally silenced me."" She also said in the week following her reporting of the alleged incident, she attended an improvisation class with the student. She said the staff member to whom she had made the allegation allowed him to strip naked during an improvisation. The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama is based in Cardiff city centre In response to all the allegations, the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama said: ""The safety and well-being of our students and staff is our first priority and we have formal mechanisms in place to safeguard and support all members of the college community. ""We treat every report of any incident as serious, using best practice in applying our policies and procedures. We also keep our policies under constant review, seeking expert external advice and input. ""We are, and always will be, committed to listening openly to any member of our community who wants to report an incident to us - whether recent or historic - and encourage people to talk to us about any concerns. ""This allegation is the subject of a sensitive and ongoing legal process. Because we respect that legal process it would not be right to comment further on specific details. ""However we can confirm that there have been factual inaccuracies carried in reports to date. The board of directors is fully informed of the current situation and is keeping across any developments.""

'Concern' over crowd scenes captured at bar,"This video can not be played Ian Cottrell said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing Five bars in Cardiff city centre have been ordered to improve the way they operate in order to comply with social distancing guidance. It follows ""concern"" raised by health officials about a video which showed crowds of clubbers appearing to ignore guidelines at Coyote Ugly bar. Cardiff council said Coyote Ugly, along with Peppermint, Mocka Lounge, Rum and Fizz, and Gin and Juice had 48 hours to make changes. They could otherwise face closure. ""It is the responsibility of businesses to ensure that social distancing is maintained and their premises can be used in a way that is safe for customers and staff and minimises the potential for Covid-19 to spread,"" said the council's cabinet member for environment, Michael Michael. ""Ensuring the city centre is safe to visit is a priority and scenes like those seen on St Mary Street at the weekend are simply unacceptable. ""Businesses should be in no doubt that we will take action against any premises that aren't operating in a safe manner. ""Officers will be returning to the businesses issued with improvement notices, and visiting others across the city, and will not hesitate to issue closure notices if needed."" Social distance plea to avoid new 'harsh lockdown' What are the latest social distancing rules? Minority of young people 'ruining it for majority' The footage,externalwas captured by Ian Cottrell on lower St Mary Street in Cardiff and was posted on social media. It shows crowds outside the Coyote Ugly bar at about 00:30 BST on Saturday, but the venue said it adhered to coronavirus rules and turned away large crowds. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said people needed to be responsible. ""I saw the videos and I was really concerned,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""It is disappointing that people are congregating in large numbers without having any regard to social distancing."" He added: ""It's more about people taking more individual and collective responsibilities. We all have to do our part."" The council said its officers visited Coyote Ugly over the weekend and the venue ""acted quickly to resolve a number of identified issues"". South Wales Police said officers spoke with staff at the venue on Friday evening, and the venue was also visited on Saturday ""to try and prevent similar issues this evening and in the future"". South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said the issue was for councils but police ""can intervene"" if people break the law. But he added: ""I don't think it's a policing issue. The alternative is to shut the night-time economy. ""If you have crowds behaving in an irresponsible way... they are not just an issue for the police, they are an issue of public health. The problem has to be solved collectively."" Coyote Ugly said it was ""very careful"" to comply with all the rules. Meanwhile, Carmarthenshire council is asking people to comply with rules after a cluster of cases which, it said, centred around a presentation evening held on Saturday August 29 at Drefach Cricket and Football Club, organised in ""breach of coronavirus regulations"". It said 12 people who are linked to the evening have tested positive for Covid-19 and other attendees will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. In astatement,external, the club said some senior players had tested positive and it ""immediately advised Public Health Wales and are liaising with them on a continuing basis"".

Rail firms stress safety as more services resume,"Rail firms are reassuring travellers major efforts have been taken to ensure their safety as services increase. Trains in England, Wales and Scotland were up to 90% of normal levels by Monday as schools reopen and people are encouraged to return to work. Rail firms said anecdotal evidence suggested a slight increase in numbers but it was too soon for exact figures. West Midlands Trains' Francis Thomas said there were ""big changes"", such as sanitising gel and one-way systems. ""If you haven't been to the railway station in the last couple of months you might find there's a one-way system at your local station, there's hand gel available and we've invested in anti-fogging machines that can spread an anti-viral on trains,"" he told the BBC. ""And there's plenty of space. We reckon we can carry about 40% of normal loads before we start to breach social distancing."" One passenger told the BBC: ""I think you just have to get outâ¦ and then once you get out you kind of get rid of your fears."" Another reported there was plenty of space: ""I come in on the Chiltern Railways line into Marylebone and the trains were a lot, lot longer, and they've, barriered off certain seats. It wasn't too packed."" Jacqueline Starr, head of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said rail services were ""doing everything they can"" to reassure people travel was safe. The group said no service was reported as ""close to social distancing capacity"". Coronavirus: Rail passengers to be warned when trains are busy Coronavirus: Is social distancing on trains here to stay? Train operators across the country have designed the new timetable, taking into consideration potentially busy stations and parts of routes that will experience higher demand for travel by schoolchildren. Where possible, more frequent services will be put on or extra carriages added to create more room. Staff will also be on hand to explain the rules on wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing to older children. ""Some train times will change so we're asking people to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times if possible,"" said Ms Starr. Over the coming weeks, rail bosses have a delicate balance to strike. They want more passengers back on the network, but they don't want a flood of commuters crowding trains and stations. Up to now, passenger numbers have remained low - on average, about a third of what it was before the pandemic. The railways are not going back to where they were before the pandemic. Some services won't return. But in places, at certain times, more capacity will be created. During the pandemic, the government has been covering the huge cost of running the railways without passengers. So there is also a financial incentive for ministers that passengers return. Train companies are now working to manage passenger flowsby warning people if a particular service is busy. Some modern trains, like those running on Southeastern and on Govia Thameslink, can monitor the weight load in carriages, allowing them to estimate the number of people on board. Southeastern plans to share the data with passengers so they can avoid a specific train. The Rail Delivery Group said that reducing the timetable during the coronavirus lockdown and then gradually increasing services again in phases had led to improvements in punctuality. Passengers are advised to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times In particular, train operators and Network Rail had learned lessons about the effects of ""wear and tear"" on railway infrastructure, the effects ""knock-on delays"" caused to intensely-used routes, and the time trains take at each station. ""Before Covid one train was leaving a station at every second - we were congested. Obviously what this has allowed us to do is to look at the timetable and its resilience and to see where we can improve and increase punctuality and build and maintain that as we build back up the timetable,"" Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, told the BBC. Mr Nisbet added that the crisis had prompted another look at the way fares are structured: ""The need for reform has never been stronger, specifically when it comes to fares."" He said the regulations that governed fares needed changing and that talks were being held with government on this issue - including changes to make season tickets more flexible. At the end of August,the government launched an advertising campaignencouraging people to go back to the workplace. Business leaders have warned of damage being done to city centres as people stay away from offices. However, many employers have no plans to return workers to the office. The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place.

Matt Hancock warns of coronavirus second wave,"The UK could see a second spike in coronavirus cases if young people don't follow social distancing rules, the health secretary says. A third of all cases in England last week were people aged between 20 and 29. ""The numbers have been going up. And we've seen in other countries where this leads, and it is not a good place,"" Matt Hancock says. Students starting university this month is a ""concern"", he adds. Speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat, the health secretary pointed to France and Spain, ""where that second wave started largely amongst younger people, it then spreads"". ""And now we're seeing a sharp rise in the number of people in hospital and the number of people who are dying in those countries. ""That hasn't happened here yet. And if people follow the social distancing rules, then we can stop that from happening here."" On Sunday the governmentannounced 2,988 new cases- the highest figure since 22 May, while a further 2,948 were reported in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Monday. The seven-day rate of new cases of Covid-19 in the UK has risen above 20 cases per 100,000 people. In the seven days to 7 September the rate stood at 21.3 cases per 100,000, up from 13.9 in the previous week (the seven days to August 31). A rate of 20 cases per 100,000 or above, if reported in other countries, is the level at which the government considers imposing quarantine conditions on people travelling to the UK. Leeds has been added to the lockdown watchlist. Officials said there had been an increase in music events,house parties and illegal raves in the city. Meanwhile, up to 300 people who attendeda charity football match near Sunderlandhave been asked to self-isolate for two weeks after 28 people who attended the event tested positive. Anda school in Suffolkhas closed after five members of teaching staff tested positive. The health secretary stressed how serious coronavirus can be for young people, even though they are less likely to die or get seriously ill. ""Long Covid is really serious. And people can be in a bad way for months and months and months,"" he says. ""The second really important message is that younger people spread the disease, even if they don't have symptoms. ""Don't kill your gran by catching coronavirus and then passing it on. And you can pass it on before you've had any symptoms at all."" She got ill when the pandemic hit - and still is How do I get a coronavirus test? What are the local lockdown rules? The health secretary denied that rules meant to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the UK are unclear. ""The rules are really clear, which is indoors you should socialise with only one other household and outdoors with groups of six as a maximum (in England). ""The message is really clear. The question is, how much are you willing to risk the lives of yourself and others by breaking the social distancing rules?"" Some have complained that the government encouraging people to spend money in pubs and restaurants, via the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, and go back into the office, is contradictory to stopping the spread. But Hancock insists ""Covid-secure workplaces are safe"", as are pubs and restaurants as long as you ""follow social distancing when you're there"". My boss wants me in the office - what are my rights? Matt Hancocktold LBC,externalareas in the UK that saw a rise in coronavirus cases over the summer were some of the most deprived. But in recent days the rise is among ""more affluent younger people"". The health secretary also outlined a new system of testing for people returning from holiday. He claimed that doing a temperature check at the border - which doesn't happen in the UK but does in other countries - ""doesn't work"" because the virus can ""incubate for a period inside your body without a test being able to pick it up"". Testing people eight days after they have returned is ""one of the things we'd like to bring in as soon as it's practical to do it"", Hancock said. It's suggested this could reduce the 14-day quarantine period when returning from countries with a higher number of cases. Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? There is understandable concern about the rise in infections that has been seen. But it needs context - at the peak of the pandemic in spring around 100,000 new cases a day were being seen it is estimated. Some of the rise seen in recent weeks is down to more testing, but that won't be the only factor. It was always going to be the case that as people mix more (to go to work and school, not just socialising) and summer ends (respiratory viruses tend to do better in the colder months) cases would go up. The crucial question is by how much and to what extent will they spill over into older, more vulnerable age groups. If it can be contained to younger age groups, who are at such low risk of complications, it would in theory not be much of a problem. But achieving that is going to be difficult. The social distancing that is now becoming a routine part of our everyday lives and the test and trace teams in place will help. But sadly hospitalisations and deaths will soon start going up - they do every winter because of flu even though we have a vaccine and some immunity. Keeping that rise as low as possible - while allowing society to function with children going to school and people being able to work - is the tightrope we will all now need to walk.

Arena inquiry 'will leave no stone unturned'Hearings begin less than a mile away from where the bomb exploded on 22 May 2017.Manchester,"This video can not be played The names of the 22 victims were read out at the start of the inquiry Several people raised suspicions about the Manchester Arena suicide bomber in the minutes before he killed 22 people. Salman Abedi was reported to police and security ahead of the attack but one witness felt he was ""fobbed off"", a public inquiry has heard. The witness had approached Abedi and asked him what was in his backpack while another said he thought he saw the suicide bomber praying. Hundreds were injured in the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. Inquiry proceedings began with Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the hearing at Manchester Magistrates' Court, reading the names of the 22 people who died on 22 May 2017. ""What happened that night was the most devastating terrorist attack in the UK for many years,"" he said. ""The inquiry will leave no stone unturned."" Families, lawyers and chairman of the inquiry Sir John Saunders, a retired High Court judge, stood with heads bowed for a minute's silence before Mr Greaney's opening. Sir John then formally opened the inquiry, adding ""this is an exercise in establishing the truth"". This video can not be played Lisa Roussos: ''It should be about transparency'' ""If I conclude things went wrong then I shall say so, but we are not looking for scapegoats. We are searching for the truth,"" he said. ""The explosion killed 22 people, including children, the youngest was eight years old. ""Salman Abedi blew himself up in the explosion but he intended as many people as possible would die with him."" The most sensitive evidence is likely to be heard at closed hearings, with both press and public excluded because of the risk to national security. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? The public inquiry follows a trial in which a jury found Hashem Abedi guilty of helping his older sibling to plan the atrocity. He wasjailed for at least 55 yearson 20 August for the 22 murders. The inquiry will, among other things, look at the emergency response to the attack In his opening statement, Mr Greaney told the inquiry ""experts consider that on 22 May there were missed opportunities to identify Salman Abedi as a threat and take mitigating action"". While there is evidence that suspicions were raised by members of the public in the minutes before the attack, ""no steward or British Transport Police (BTP) officer appear to have identified him as suspicious"", the inquiry heard. Mr Greaney said experts concluded: ""If the presence of a potential suicide bomber had been reported, it is very likely that mitigating actions would've been taken that could have reduced the impact of the attack. ""This is because there was sufficient time between Abedi first being spotted by, and also reported to staff and his attack to effectively react."" Paul Greaney QC read the names of each of those murdered by suicide bomber Salman Abedi during the first day of the inquiry One member of the public, William Drysdale, spotted Salman Abedi and thought he was praying, less than an hour before he detonated his bomb. A second witness, Julie Merchant, approached BTP officer Jessica Bullough around 32 minutes before the deadly bombing to point out Abedi. Mr Greaney said Ms Merchant cannot recall the details of the conversation with the officer but that it was ""to do with praying and political correctness"". The officer cannot remember the conversation taking place, the hearing was told. She was the first police officer to enter the City Rooms, where the bomb was detonated, after the attack, showing considerable bravery, Mr Greaney added. CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up Two more witnesses, known only as A and B, also saw a man matching Salman Abedi's description acting suspiciously. Mr A challenged Abedi, asking him what he had in his backpack. The witness then spoke to a Mohammed Agha, an employee of Showsec which provided security to the Arena on behalf of the venue's owners SMG, at 22.14, some 17 minutes before the detonation but said he was ""fobbed off."" Mr Agha spoke to colleague Kyle Lawler about the matter, eight minutes before the bomb went off. But neither security control nor anyone else was informed about the suspicious activity, the hearing was told, although Mr Lawler said in a statement he tried to contact control but could not get through. He then spotted the man get up and start walking towards the arena entrance. His statement continued: ""I just froze and did not get anything out on the radio. I knew at that point it was too late."" The hearings will take place in a room specially converted from two courtrooms at Manchester Magistrates' Court Mr Greaney also said expert evidence would be heard about risk assessments at the Arena. ""There was no effective risk assessments that considered the threats from terrorism at Manchester Arena in early 2017, despite the severe threat level,"" he said. The possible role of Salman Abedi's family in radicalising the suicide bomber and his brother needs to be assessed, the inquiry also heard. Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing Mr Greaney told the inquiry: ""Ismail Abedi, the brother of the killers, has been required by the inquiry legal team to answer a series of questions relating to what might, in general terms, be described as the issue of radicalisation. ""To date, he has declined to answer these questions on the basis that he maintains that his answers may tend to incriminate him."" He said similar requests to the brothers' parents, Ramadan and Samia, who are believed to be in Libya, ""have not been responded to, at least not in any substantive way"".

Arena inquiry 'will leave no stone unturned',"This video can not be played The names of the 22 victims were read out at the start of the inquiry Several people raised suspicions about the Manchester Arena suicide bomber in the minutes before he killed 22 people. Salman Abedi was reported to police and security ahead of the attack but one witness felt he was ""fobbed off"", a public inquiry has heard. The witness had approached Abedi and asked him what was in his backpack while another said he thought he saw the suicide bomber praying. Hundreds were injured in the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. Inquiry proceedings began with Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the hearing at Manchester Magistrates' Court, reading the names of the 22 people who died on 22 May 2017. ""What happened that night was the most devastating terrorist attack in the UK for many years,"" he said. ""The inquiry will leave no stone unturned."" Families, lawyers and chairman of the inquiry Sir John Saunders, a retired High Court judge, stood with heads bowed for a minute's silence before Mr Greaney's opening. Sir John then formally opened the inquiry, adding ""this is an exercise in establishing the truth"". This video can not be played Lisa Roussos: ''It should be about transparency'' ""If I conclude things went wrong then I shall say so, but we are not looking for scapegoats. We are searching for the truth,"" he said. ""The explosion killed 22 people, including children, the youngest was eight years old. ""Salman Abedi blew himself up in the explosion but he intended as many people as possible would die with him."" The most sensitive evidence is likely to be heard at closed hearings, with both press and public excluded because of the risk to national security. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? The public inquiry follows a trial in which a jury found Hashem Abedi guilty of helping his older sibling to plan the atrocity. He wasjailed for at least 55 yearson 20 August for the 22 murders. The inquiry will, among other things, look at the emergency response to the attack In his opening statement, Mr Greaney told the inquiry ""experts consider that on 22 May there were missed opportunities to identify Salman Abedi as a threat and take mitigating action"". While there is evidence that suspicions were raised by members of the public in the minutes before the attack, ""no steward or British Transport Police (BTP) officer appear to have identified him as suspicious"", the inquiry heard. Mr Greaney said experts concluded: ""If the presence of a potential suicide bomber had been reported, it is very likely that mitigating actions would've been taken that could have reduced the impact of the attack. ""This is because there was sufficient time between Abedi first being spotted by, and also reported to staff and his attack to effectively react."" Paul Greaney QC read the names of each of those murdered by suicide bomber Salman Abedi during the first day of the inquiry One member of the public, William Drysdale, spotted Salman Abedi and thought he was praying, less than an hour before he detonated his bomb. A second witness, Julie Merchant, approached BTP officer Jessica Bullough around 32 minutes before the deadly bombing to point out Abedi. Mr Greaney said Ms Merchant cannot recall the details of the conversation with the officer but that it was ""to do with praying and political correctness"". The officer cannot remember the conversation taking place, the hearing was told. She was the first police officer to enter the City Rooms, where the bomb was detonated, after the attack, showing considerable bravery, Mr Greaney added. CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up Two more witnesses, known only as A and B, also saw a man matching Salman Abedi's description acting suspiciously. Mr A challenged Abedi, asking him what he had in his backpack. The witness then spoke to a Mohammed Agha, an employee of Showsec which provided security to the Arena on behalf of the venue's owners SMG, at 22.14, some 17 minutes before the detonation but said he was ""fobbed off."" Mr Agha spoke to colleague Kyle Lawler about the matter, eight minutes before the bomb went off. But neither security control nor anyone else was informed about the suspicious activity, the hearing was told, although Mr Lawler said in a statement he tried to contact control but could not get through. He then spotted the man get up and start walking towards the arena entrance. His statement continued: ""I just froze and did not get anything out on the radio. I knew at that point it was too late."" The hearings will take place in a room specially converted from two courtrooms at Manchester Magistrates' Court Mr Greaney also said expert evidence would be heard about risk assessments at the Arena. ""There was no effective risk assessments that considered the threats from terrorism at Manchester Arena in early 2017, despite the severe threat level,"" he said. The possible role of Salman Abedi's family in radicalising the suicide bomber and his brother needs to be assessed, the inquiry also heard. Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing Mr Greaney told the inquiry: ""Ismail Abedi, the brother of the killers, has been required by the inquiry legal team to answer a series of questions relating to what might, in general terms, be described as the issue of radicalisation. ""To date, he has declined to answer these questions on the basis that he maintains that his answers may tend to incriminate him."" He said similar requests to the brothers' parents, Ramadan and Samia, who are believed to be in Libya, ""have not been responded to, at least not in any substantive way"".

Australia hopes to roll out 85m vaccine doses,"The first doses of the vaccines, if successful, could be distributed from January Australia says it will secure almost 85 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine if two promising trials prove successful. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country had struck two deals that would allow free doses to be rolled out in 2021 if they were approved for use. Mr Morrison estimated the cost to be A$1.7bn (Â£0.9bn; $1.24bn). Australia's 25 million people could begin receiving doses from January but there were ""no guarantees"", he said. ""However the agreement puts Australia at the top of the queue, if our medical experts give the vaccines the green light,"" the prime minister said. One vaccine is from Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, while the other is a local one from the University of Queensland and CSL. Both would most likely require people to take two doses. UK signs deal for 60 million virus vaccine doses How close to developing a vaccine are we? Australia has recorded more than 26,000 coronavirus cases and 769 deaths, most in the past two months after an outbreak in Victoria. The state announced on Sunday it was extending its strict lockdownfor another two weeks, before gradually easing restrictions. Under the plan, people in Melbourne will not be able to visit other households for group gatherings until at least late November. Most of the vaccines would be manufactured in Australia at biotechnology company CSL, the government said. The nation has agreements for 33.8 million doses of the Oxford vaccine and 51 million doses of a UQ vaccine. Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response Early access to the Oxford vaccine - if it is found to work - could begin in January and February with 3.8 million imported doses secured for that period. The trial of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is at an advanced stage That vaccine is in phase three of clinical trials and is being tested on 30,000 people, making it one of the world's most advanced.Australia announced last month it had secured access to the vaccine. The UQ/CSL vaccine is in phase one of clinical trials, involving tests on a small control group. The Australian government has said that immunisation won't be compulsory but strongly encouraged. The nation is aiming for a 95% vaccination rate. Mr Morrison said Australia also remained committed to ensure vaccine access for its neighbours in the Pacific and South East Asia. Additional orders may be donated or sold at their original price to other nations or organisations, officials said. Countries around the world have been scrambling to arrange deals for potential vaccines, prompting concerns that poorer nations may miss out. Short cuts and 'dirty tricks' in the scramble for a vaccine In July, the World Health Organization said 165 countries had signed up to a fund which would see wealthier nations help poorer nations with access. About 140 potential vaccines globally are in early development, and dozens are being tested on people in clinical trials.

'Concern' over crowd scenes captured at barHealth officials say people need to take responsibility and follow Covid guidelines.,"This video can not be played Ian Cottrell said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing Five bars in Cardiff city centre have been ordered to improve the way they operate in order to comply with social distancing guidance. It follows ""concern"" raised by health officials about a video which showed crowds of clubbers appearing to ignore guidelines at Coyote Ugly bar. Cardiff council said Coyote Ugly, along with Peppermint, Mocka Lounge, Rum and Fizz, and Gin and Juice had 48 hours to make changes. They could otherwise face closure. ""It is the responsibility of businesses to ensure that social distancing is maintained and their premises can be used in a way that is safe for customers and staff and minimises the potential for Covid-19 to spread,"" said the council's cabinet member for environment, Michael Michael. ""Ensuring the city centre is safe to visit is a priority and scenes like those seen on St Mary Street at the weekend are simply unacceptable. ""Businesses should be in no doubt that we will take action against any premises that aren't operating in a safe manner. ""Officers will be returning to the businesses issued with improvement notices, and visiting others across the city, and will not hesitate to issue closure notices if needed."" Social distance plea to avoid new 'harsh lockdown' What are the latest social distancing rules? Minority of young people 'ruining it for majority' The footage,externalwas captured by Ian Cottrell on lower St Mary Street in Cardiff and was posted on social media. It shows crowds outside the Coyote Ugly bar at about 00:30 BST on Saturday, but the venue said it adhered to coronavirus rules and turned away large crowds. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said people needed to be responsible. ""I saw the videos and I was really concerned,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""It is disappointing that people are congregating in large numbers without having any regard to social distancing."" He added: ""It's more about people taking more individual and collective responsibilities. We all have to do our part."" The council said its officers visited Coyote Ugly over the weekend and the venue ""acted quickly to resolve a number of identified issues"". South Wales Police said officers spoke with staff at the venue on Friday evening, and the venue was also visited on Saturday ""to try and prevent similar issues this evening and in the future"". South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said the issue was for councils but police ""can intervene"" if people break the law. But he added: ""I don't think it's a policing issue. The alternative is to shut the night-time economy. ""If you have crowds behaving in an irresponsible way... they are not just an issue for the police, they are an issue of public health. The problem has to be solved collectively."" Coyote Ugly said it was ""very careful"" to comply with all the rules. Meanwhile, Carmarthenshire council is asking people to comply with rules after a cluster of cases which, it said, centred around a presentation evening held on Saturday August 29 at Drefach Cricket and Football Club, organised in ""breach of coronavirus regulations"". It said 12 people who are linked to the evening have tested positive for Covid-19 and other attendees will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.

"Islanders fear 'clearance' over house pricesCall for action amid claims first-time buyers in the Hebrides, Western Isles and Skye can no longer afford properties there.","Uist in the Western Isles has been suggested as the location for a property trial Community figures have warned that rising property prices in the Hebrides and Skye are preventing locals from buying a home. In an open letter they described the situation as akin to an ""economic clearance"" that was threatening the sustainability of the islands. They said young islanders could not compete with offers made by buyers from elsewhere in the UK. It follows claims parts of Scotland are seeing a post-lockdown property boom. The uptick in interest has been put down to previously office-based staff being able to work from home and perceived lower rates of Covid-19. Pandemic driving 'exceptional interest' in Scots homes Gaelic language in 'crisis' in isles heartlands Islands to receive Â£100m in government investment The letter's signatories - which includes crofters, development officers and Gaelic campaigners - said 40% of housing stock on both Tiree in the Inner Hebrides and West Harris in the Western Isles were holiday homes. They said the availability of affordable properties for young islanders had been a long-running problem, but was expected to worsen post-lockdown. They pointed to reports of people across the UK looking to relocate to the Highlands and Islands, and having the means to make higher offers than local buyers. The average purchase price for residential properties in the Western Isles have increased from Â£65,189 in 2004 to Â£123,048 last year, according to the Registers of Scotland. For Argyll and Bute - which includes the Inner Hebrides -  the prices over the same period have risen from Â£110,691 to Â£173,470. In the Highlands, which includes Skye, prices rose from Â£107,639 to Â£185,178. The Scottish average prices were Â£113,289 in 2004 and Â£181,339 last year. The Western Island and Argyll and Bute also saw the highest proportion of cash sales of all Scotland's local authority areas in 2019-20, where about 50% of all residential sales were cash sales. The letter said: ""Part-time residencies do not sustain our communities and we should therefore ensure that houses are bought with the intention of being a primary residency. ""Inaction will allow this economic clearance to be consolidated in history."" Christina Morrison and her husband moved back to the Western Isles from the mainland for a ""rare job interview"" and to raise a young family. But they faced an uphill struggle finding a place in Uist to call their own. ""We were about to start a family and we wanted our family to grow up here on the islands and have the nice upbringing we had,"" she said. ""When we first moved over we had a really difficult time. We stayed in a hotel at one point and family helped out with temporary accommodation."" The couple lost out twice in bids for homes and Christina said the buyers in both instances were planning to use the properties as holiday homes. She said: ""It was just pure luck we got the house we are in now."" The couple, who were just about to become parents, were told the owners of a house down the road from where they were staying had been seen packing up their household possessions. The house had not yet gone on the market, but the sellers were keen for a quick sale and agreed to sell it Christina her husband. The use of the term ""clearance"" echoes back to the Highland clearances when tenants were evicted from land in the 18th and 19th Centuries so landlords could increase their income. The letter suggests Uist in the Western Isles be used as a trial location where properties are advertised locally in the first instance prior to being listed on the national market. The letter said 40% of property on Tiree was used as a second home The letter said: ""A recent example of a house in Uist becoming available for rental shows the scope for positive action. ""The owner agreed that the house should first be advertised to young locals, and a number of applications were received. ""They seized this opportunity to invest in the community by offering the house to a returning young couple with three children."" The letter comes after concerns were raised that Gaelic speakers among the islands' communities could vanish within 10 years. Researchers said daily use of Gaelic was currently too low to sustain it as a community language in the future. The letter's signatories include PÃ druig Morrison, a Uist crofter, researcher and musician and architect and Gaelic campaigner Martin Baillie, from Skye. Uist businesswoman Emma Axelsson and crofter Fiona NicÃosaig have also signed it. A lack of affordable housing for islanders is recognised in the Scottish government'sNational Plan for Scotland's Islands,external, which was published last year. The plan's consultation process had ""highlighted that the availability of affordable, fit-for-purpose housing on Scottish islands presents a challenge for island communities"". The challenges include young people deciding to leave island communities and a lack of accessible and affordable housing being a ""barrier"" to attracting families to island communities. In the plan, the government made a commitment to support affordable housing projects. Gordon Macrae, of homeless people's charity Shelter Scotland, said the solution to providing housing for islanders and meeting demand from people living elsewhere in the UK wanting to move to rural areas was to ""build more homes"". He added: ""The problem for many parts of the Highlands, and the Borders as well, is that they have gone under-invested for so long."" Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said the Scottish government recognised good quality, affordable homes were ""essential to help attract and retain"" people in Scotland's remote rural and island communities. He said the government had committed record levels of investment as part of its efforts to deliver 50,000 affordable homes, with more than 4,800 homes delivered in rural and islands areas in the first four years of the current parliament and over Â£50m spent on affordable housing on islands in that time. Mr Stewart said: ""While promoting rural properties to local people in the first instance clearly has merits in supporting local people to access housing, it would need to operate on a voluntary basis as the way in which an owner chooses to market their property is a matter entirely for them. ""However, we remain committed to affordable local housing solutions that allow people to stay, live and work in their communities.""

The government hopes it'll help with its drive to encourage people to return to offices and other workplaces. BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge says rail bosses have a delicate balance to strike because they want more passengers back, but don't want a flood of commuters. Passengers are advised to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times The latest coronavirus figures- for Sunday - show the UK recorded the highest number of new cases on a single day since 22 May. The spike so far appears to be predominantly among young people - and in part due to greater testing - but the fear is that the incease subsequently spreads to the older and more vulnerable.See the situation in your areaand find outhow to get a testif you think you need one. More than 9,000 trials have been delayed since the UK went into lockdown andlawyers are warning this morningthat hundreds of thousands of people may have to wait until 2022 for justice.

Emma Barnett to present Radio 4's Woman's HourThe 5 Live presenter will fill the shoes of Jane Garvey and Jenni Murray.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played The broadcaster thanked her 5 Live audience for making the show 'such a wonderful place' Broadcaster Emma Barnett will be the new presenter of Woman's Hour. The 5 Live and Newsnight presenter will step into the shoes of Jane Garvey and Dame Jenni Murray, who have both decided to step down from the show. Barnett is already associated with the Radio 4 programme, presenting its late-night spin-off and regularly chairing the Woman's Hour Power List. She first hosted Woman's Hour at the age of 26, making her the youngest presenter in the show's history. Woman's Hour, which offers a female perspective on the world, is one of the longest-running programmes on British radio, first launching in 1946 on the BBC Light Programme. The 45-minute show is broadcast every morning at 10:00 on BBC Radio 4. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Staff on the show were told of Barnett's appointment on Monday morning. Unlike the current arrangement, where Garvey and Dame Jenni share presenting duties, Barnett will be the main host from Monday to Thursday each week. An additional presenter will be appointed to host the Friday and Saturday editions. ""I can't wait to get to know the many listeners of Woman's Hour a lot, lot better,"" said the presenter. ""What adventures we are going to have together - all starting in the year that this BBC institution, the radio mothership, turns 75. ""I have a long love of Woman's Hour and live radio and know that this is a very special and rare opportunity."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The move will mean the end of Barnett's mid-morning show on 5 Live, which has seen presenter named best speech broadcaster at the 2020 Radio Academy Awards (ARIAs) and radio broadcaster of the year 2018 by the Broadcasting Press Guild. She will continue to present Newsnight on BBC Two. Garvey, who has hosted the show since 2007, announced she was leaving last week. ""It's been a real privilege to play a small part in the history of this very special radio programme,"" she said, adding how proud she was of its relationship with its listeners. ""On one unforgettable day, I interviewed David Cameron in the morning, and Mary J Blige in the afternoon. There's no other job like it,"" she said. ""But famous people are not the reason people engage with Woman's Hour. It's because the programme still talks about the subjects and challenges no one else goes near. I'm very proud of our relationship with the audience and the trust they place in us."" Garvey will now go on to host her own new Radio 4 series in the new year. Woman's Hour presenters Jenni Murray (left) and Jane Garvey in 2016 Earlier this summer, Garvey's colleague Dame Jenni Murray announced she was to leave the show after 33 years. Dame Jenni, who is the longest-serving presenter in the Radio 4 show's 74-year history, will present her final show on 1 October. Barnett started her career with the trade publication Media Week before joining the Daily Telegraph as its first digital media editor. She was later appointed women's editor - where she steered coverage away from fashion and celebrities towards more weighty issues, and launched the award-winning site Telegraph Wonder Women. She started broadcasting on the commercial radio station LBC in 2011, initially working on the late night ""graveyard shift"", and jumped ship to 5 Live in 2014. There, she established herself as a fearless and inquisitive interviewer. The Times dubbed her ""the BBC's new Rottweiler"", while Jeremy Paxman described her as his favourite political interviewer. ""Being interviewed on the radio by Barnett is like being interviewed by a basketful of cobras,"" observed The Telegraph's Charlotte Runcie last year. ""She is single-handedly rebuilding the BBC's reputation as the home of the heavyweight political interview."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn on Woman's Hour During the 2017 election campaign, Barnett made headlines while questioning Jeremy Corbyn, then-leader of the Labour Party, over the cost of his party's plan to offer free childcare to two-year-olds. While Corbyn struggled to remember the details of his plan, Barnett gave listeners a running commentary: ""You're logging into your iPadâ¦ you've had a phone call while you're in here and you don't know how much it's going to cost."" Afterwards, Barnett received a hostile response from some Corbyn supporters, who accused her of being ""biased"" and a ""Tory"". He later defended the presenter, saying: ""Under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone throw personal abuse at anyone else because they're doing the job they they've been employed to do."" Barnett also made broadcasting history by hosting the BBC's first joint live radio and TV phone-in with a Prime Minister, Theresa May. The broadcaster, who booked the interview herself, spent two days rehearsing the encounter, with her editor standing in as the Prime Minister. She told the Express she had prepared three separate versions of her questions, so she could switch her response depending on May's reactions. ""An interview is an intellectual game of chess,""she said,external. ""Especially one like that."" This video can not be played The Duchess of Cornwall says the âworst bitâ of lockdown has been not seeing her family Earlier this year, she hosted her 5 Live show from Clarence House where Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, guest edited the programme and discussed life under lockdown. Last year, Barnett published her first book, It's About Bloody Time, Period - a frank, funny and myth-busting exploration of menstruation. Motivated by her own experiences of endometriosis and IVF, the book aimed to break the taboos around discussing periods and fertility. ""Women's issues are everyone's issues,""she told students at the London School of Economics at the time,external. ""I really enjoy disrupting what is expected of me. Don't get yourself put in a box."" After news broke of her  new role at Women's Hour, fellow broadcasters and fans shared their congratulations online. Allow Twitter content?

Train services increase as more schools reopen,"Rail firms are reassuring travellers major efforts have been taken to ensure their safety as services increase. Trains in England, Wales and Scotland were up to 90% of normal levels by Monday as schools reopen and people are encouraged to return to work. Rail firms said anecdotal evidence suggested a slight increase in numbers but it was too soon for exact figures. West Midlands Trains' Francis Thomas said there were ""big changes"", such as sanitising gel and one-way systems. ""If you haven't been to the railway station in the last couple of months you might find there's a one-way system at your local station, there's hand gel available and we've invested in anti-fogging machines that can spread an anti-viral on trains,"" he told the BBC. ""And there's plenty of space. We reckon we can carry about 40% of normal loads before we start to breach social distancing."" One passenger told the BBC: ""I think you just have to get outâ¦ and then once you get out you kind of get rid of your fears."" Another reported there was plenty of space: ""I come in on the Chiltern Railways line into Marylebone and the trains were a lot, lot longer, and they've, barriered off certain seats. It wasn't too packed."" Jacqueline Starr, head of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said rail services were ""doing everything they can"" to reassure people travel was safe. The group said no service was reported as ""close to social distancing capacity"". Coronavirus: Rail passengers to be warned when trains are busy Coronavirus: Is social distancing on trains here to stay? Train operators across the country have designed the new timetable, taking into consideration potentially busy stations and parts of routes that will experience higher demand for travel by schoolchildren. Where possible, more frequent services will be put on or extra carriages added to create more room. Staff will also be on hand to explain the rules on wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing to older children. ""Some train times will change so we're asking people to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times if possible,"" said Ms Starr. Over the coming weeks, rail bosses have a delicate balance to strike. They want more passengers back on the network, but they don't want a flood of commuters crowding trains and stations. Up to now, passenger numbers have remained low - on average, about a third of what it was before the pandemic. The railways are not going back to where they were before the pandemic. Some services won't return. But in places, at certain times, more capacity will be created. During the pandemic, the government has been covering the huge cost of running the railways without passengers. So there is also a financial incentive for ministers that passengers return. Train companies are now working to manage passenger flowsby warning people if a particular service is busy. Some modern trains, like those running on Southeastern and on Govia Thameslink, can monitor the weight load in carriages, allowing them to estimate the number of people on board. Southeastern plans to share the data with passengers so they can avoid a specific train. The Rail Delivery Group said that reducing the timetable during the coronavirus lockdown and then gradually increasing services again in phases had led to improvements in punctuality. Passengers are advised to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times In particular, train operators and Network Rail had learned lessons about the effects of ""wear and tear"" on railway infrastructure, the effects ""knock-on delays"" caused to intensely-used routes, and the time trains take at each station. ""Before Covid one train was leaving a station at every second - we were congested. Obviously what this has allowed us to do is to look at the timetable and its resilience and to see where we can improve and increase punctuality and build and maintain that as we build back up the timetable,"" Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, told the BBC. Mr Nisbet added that the crisis had prompted another look at the way fares are structured: ""The need for reform has never been stronger, specifically when it comes to fares."" He said the regulations that governed fares needed changing and that talks were being held with government on this issue - including changes to make season tickets more flexible. At the end of August,the government launched an advertising campaignencouraging people to go back to the workplace. Business leaders have warned of damage being done to city centres as people stay away from offices. However, many employers have no plans to return workers to the office. The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place.

Analysis: Fears as deadline looms,"There are fears that customs tariffs could lead to big queues in Dover EU diplomats in Brussels wake up this morning with a sore head. The government has thrown a number of political grenades across the Channel over the space of a few hours. First: a defiant-sounding interview with David Frost, the UK chief negotiator in the troubled trade talks with the EU. Next came a leak about government plans to introduce domestic legislation which would partially undermine the Brexit divorce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, signed last year with the EU. Also affecting the Irish Protocol, designed at the time by Brussels and the UK to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Finally, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that if no trade deal is agreed by mid-October, there will be no trade deal at all with the EU. And that - by the way - a no-deal scenario would actually be good for the UK, giving it full control over its ""laws, rules and fishing waters"". EU reaction? Not at all happy. Bang on cue, irritated European diplomatic sources described the Frost interview as sabre rattling and ""unsurprising muscle flexing"" ahead of the last tough rounds of trade negotiations with the EU. UK ministers plan laws overriding part of withdrawal deal What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Barnier: UK risks no deal unless it compromises UK 'sleepwalking into disaster' over border plans Why Brexit is still a big issue As regards the domestic legislation affecting the Irish Protocol (the precise details of which have not yet been revealed), Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney tweeted that would be ""a very unwise way for the government to proceed"". While a high level EU diplomat from a country traditionally close to the UK slammed the planned legislation as, not only a trust or credibility issue, but ""something that could lead to the unravelling of the already fraught EU-UK trade negotiations"". It was a self-defeating move by the Johnson government, he said. So self-defeating, in EU eyes, that I have now begun to hear musings amongst Brussels contacts that maybe they were not the government's main target audience after all. Because, say EU figures, if the Frost interview, the legislation leak and the prime minister's words were all designed as a negotiating tactic, to put pressure on the EU, then it was a terrible tactic, they insist, as it simply serves to ""raise European hackles"". This video can not be played UK vs EU: Johnson and Michel Barnier set out competing visions on trade Some in the EU think the government's intended audience was actually ardent Brexiters. More specifically: backbench Tory MPs, already annoyed with the government's handling of domestic issues, like the exam chaos this summer, and worried the prime minister may be about to agree a compromise deal with the EU. Could this mean, wonders the EU, that Boris Johnson is throwing what one Twitter commentator described as ""red meat"" to the backbench Brexiters - talking up the no-deal scenario and giving Brussels ultimatums - because he is actually preparing to ""get pragmatic"" and make concessions in trade talks? Or is the opposite true? Is the prime minister preparing the ground to declare that no deal can be reached and that the UK and EU will instead trade on World Trade Organization terms - with the accompanying tariffs to pay - come the new year? Access to fishing grounds has become a key issue in the trade talks Brussels diplomats say they are willing to make concessions, including on key issues like state aid and fishing but that the UK must do the same, including - and this is as much a bottom line for the EU as it is hard to swallow for the UK - signing up to safeguards for the EU's single market. The prime minister faces conflicting domestic pressures. Pushing him towards a compromise deal: cost of no deal for UK business, Scottish elections loom and no deal will likely boost the fortunes of the anti-Brexit SNP who are calling for another referendum on Scottish independence, manufacturing towns among new Conservative ""red wall"" seats would suffer from no-deal paperwork and disruption to supply chains. Pushing him away from such a deal: strong opposition from Brexiter Conservative MPs, concerns over ceding post-Brexit sovereignty and remaining tied to Brussels apron strings. The EU is not at all sure what Boris Johnson will decide. But it is convinced of one thing: deal or no deal, the decision ultimately lies in Downing Street, not here in Brussels. If there is a deal, it is highly unlikely to be struck by mid-October, as the prime minister wishes. The EU thinks November is a more realistic bet. It still believes a deal can be done and that Boris Johnson would prefer a deal over no deal. But time is tight, tempers are frayed and Covid-19 continues to distract leaders across Europe. At least one emergency Brexit summit is likely before the autumn is over. UK vs EU: What both sides want from a trade deal.

What is a level playing field?,"It's a term which was heard a lot during the post-Brexit trade negotiations. It's about fair competition, and it's much less easy to visualise or explain than fishing or the trade in cars. But it gets to the heart of what Brexit is all about. So how did the UK and the EU reach a deal on the level playing field, and how will it work in practice in the future? The level playing field is a trade-policy term for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country gaining a competitive advantage over those operating in other countries. These could be rules limiting the type of zero-hours contracts that can be offered to workers, for example, or restrictions on the amount of pollution certain industrial processes are allowed to produce. It's about fair and open competition and it's an important part of the EU single market in which member countries allow the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. The focus in theEU-UK trade deal, agreed in December 2020, is on regulations that cover environmental standards and labour law, and on state aid (or government subsidies for business). In the negotiations, the UK was determined to assert its sovereignty - which meant its independence from EU rules - while the EU was determined to protect its single market and control access to it. What's in the Brexit deal? Can I still go to Spain? And other questions Both sides can claim to have got what they wanted from the deal. It contains stricter level playing field conditions than in other recent trade agreements signed by the EU. So, the EU has created strong protections for the single market. But the UK has the right to break away from EU rules if it chooses to do so, and there is no role in enforcing the deal for the European Court of Justice. And that meets the UK demand for sovereignty. The two sides agreed to treat current shared regulations on environmental protection and workers' rights as a common baseline. The UK is free to change those standards in the future (as is the EU), but there is a potential price to pay. Built into the deal is the risk that if the UK moves too far from EU rules, in a way which is deemed unfair to EU businesses, its access to the European market could be limited. The same applies the other way round. Under this ""rebalancing mechanism"", tariffs (or taxes on goods crossing borders) could be imposed, and they wouldn't always have to be in the same policy area where the dispute occurs. Either the EU or the UK could also impose tariffs without the agreement of the other side, if they think that government subsidies are distorting trade. But, importantly, all those decisions would have to go to independent arbitration. An arbitration panel would involve representatives from both sides as well as independent experts or judges. It was agreed that the UK would not copy EU state aid rules directly, even though that had been the EU's initial demand in the trade negotiations. Instead it is setting up an independent state aid authority, and has now published legislation in the form ofa new Subsidy Control Billwhich will create a new subsidy system. The government says its new regime will be more nimble than the EU's, and will allow it to focus on its domestic priorities. But if the UK changes its rules too much, the EU will have the power to retaliate. The level playing field agreements cover billions of pounds worth of business now and in the future. The UK has certainly won the theoretical right to break away from EU rules, but it will have to make a careful calculation about whether such moves will be either necessary or worthwhile. It has a tariff-free trade deal with its largest economic partner for now, but there is no guarantee that it will stay that way. On the other hand, it's not always easy to prove that fair competition is being distorted - or the extent to which a change in regulations might be responsible for any distortion. So the role of the new arbitration system will be crucial, and could become controversial. The EU-UK agreement also set up a new Partnership Council, with more than twenty committees and working groups. It will look into various aspects of how the relationship develops in the future, and will seek to resolve disputes. Both sides also have the right to call for a formal review of the entire agreement if they think it isn't working well, and there will be an automatic review anyway after five years. That means a future UK government, which thinks market access is more important than the current government's notion of sovereignty, could choose to interpret the deal in a different way. So, as a political issue, it's not going to go away. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

'Strong response' in stabbings manhunt,"This video can not be played Police are looking for this man after an attacker killed one victim and wounded seven other people Police hunting a man suspected of killing one person and injuring seven others in stabbings across Birmingham city centre say they have had a ""strong response"" after releasing CCTV footage. The attacks in the early hours of Sundaysparked a massive manhunt. Images of the man officers want to find were published on Sunday evening. Detectives have been working through the night following leads from the public to identify and find the suspect, West Midlands Police tweeted. The attacks happened at four different locations across the city centre during a 90-minute spell. A 23-year-old man was killed in Irving Street at 01:50 BST on Sunday, while a man and a woman, aged 19 and 32, suffered critical stabbing injuries. Five other people, aged between 23 and 33, were injured and taken to hospital. Two have since been discharged. The public are urged to remain vigilant and not to approach the man pictured CCTV footage released on Sunday evening shows a man wearing a baseball cap, a dark hoodie with white drawstrings, dark-coloured trousers and shoes. He is seen standing and walking on a street corner. Three hours after the images were published, West Midlands Police tweeted: ""We've had a strong response following our appeal to trace the #BirminghamStabbings suspect. ""Our detectives are following up several new lines of enquiry. This man is wanted on suspicion of murder. ""We've got a team of detectives working through the night to identify and trace the  suspect."" It added that a special hotline has been set up for members of the public to pass on information. Earlier in the day, Ch Supt Steve Graham told reporters: ""At this stage we believe that the attacks were random and we have no indication of a motive."" He urged the public to remain vigilant, and call 999 if they spotted anything suspicious. West Midlands Police were first called to Constitution Hill where a man sustained a superficial injury just after 00:30 BST. Twenty minutes later they were called to Livery Street, near to Snow Hill railway station, where the 19-year-old man was critically injured and a woman was also hurt. An hour later at 01:50 BST, police were sent to Irving Street, where the 23-year-old died and another man suffered serious injuries. Ten minutes later, they were called to Hurst Street, in the city's Gay Village, where the 32-year-old woman was critically injured and two men suffered lesser injuries. CCTV issued in hunt for Birmingham attack suspect Manhunt as one killed and seven hurt in stabbings As it happened: Updates on Birmingham stabbings The stabbings do not appear to be terrorism related or gang related, police said. Mr Graham added: ""We do not underestimate the impact that these incidents have had on the city of Birmingham. ""We declared this a major incident at the earliest opportunity and we have drafted in scores of officers to help with the investigation and patrol the city to reassure residents and visitors that we are doing all we can to apprehend the person responsible."" A cordon remains in place at the scenes of the stabbings Multiple witnesses saw the attacks, including Nikita Denton who was out celebrating her 29th birthday and helped stop one of the women bleeding in the street. Restaurant owner Savvas Sfrantzis described seeing the ""cold"" attacker walk calmly away after stabbing a woman repeatedly. ""I looked at him, facing him, and I can see he had a blade, not very big, and he was stabbing her in the neck. ""He wasn't panicking and he wasn't reacting or anything. After he stabbed her between five and seven times... he walked off as if nothing has happened."" This video can not be played Nikita Denton told the BBC the victim she helped was alone and in a state of shock Officers have recovered a knife from a drain but Mr Graham said it was ""way too early"" to say if it was connected to the case. When asked how the knifeman was able go for more than two hours without being caught, he described the suspect's route through the city was ""relatively unusual"". He added: ""There was no suggestion people had seen him running out, area searches were being made at the time, unfortunately the subject wasn't caught."" The attacks happened as city centre revellers were enjoying a night out Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Perry Barr, reportedly said the dead man's life could ""potentially"" have been saved if the police response had been swifter. ""We've got to look at the fact [the suspect] had two hours to run around the city centre, which has a huge amount of CCTV cameras in place,"" Mr Mahmood told The Times. ""Where was the monitoring? Both the public and police were put at further risk. There is a person dead. How was this man able to go on a two-hour spate?"" The force's police and crime commissioner David Jamieson labelled the assaults ""disturbing"", with the violence unfolding as revellers had been enjoying the night. West Midlands Police said extra officers had ""flooded"" the city centre and forensic experts had examined four scenes. A heavy police presence remained throughout Sunday, with armed officers, patrols, riot vans and squad cars visible. Streets remained closed on Monday morning as investigations continued.

Typhoon Haishen batters South Korea,"Waves crash on the coast as Typhoon Haishen approaches the Japanese prefecture of Kagoshima Typhoon Haishen has touched down in South Korea after slamming through southern Japan. The storm made landfall in Ulsan, just north of Busan, South Korea's second-largest city. More than 300 flights from 10 airports were cancelled, with some train services suspended. The typhoon caused a loss of power across hundreds of thousands of homes in Japan, though initial assessments suggest it did less damage than feared. Thirty-two people were injured, including four who sustained cuts after the glass windows of an evacuation centre were blown in, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. Some eight million people in Japan had been asked to evacuate in the path of the storm. What are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons? The storm comes days after Maysak, one of the region's strongest typhoons in years, slammed into the Korean peninsula and Japan last week. High winds have already cut power to almost 5,000 households on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, including the resort island of Jeju, says a Reuters report. Hundreds of flights and train services were cancelled in Japan A typhoon alert has been issued for Jeju and other southern parts of South Korea like Gyeongsang province. But a KMA official told Yonhap News that it was likely the typhoon would weaken as it passed by. South Korea's Korea Forest Service had earlier raised the landslide alert to its highest level. Nearly 430,000 homes in the Kyushu region were without power,externalas of 03:00 local time Monday (18:00 GMT Sunday), Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. Haishen has led to the closure of factories, schools and businesses across western Japan. Hundreds of flights and train services were also cancelled.

Tokyo Olympics will happen 'with or without Covid',"The 2020 Games Olympics are scheduled to start on 23 July next year The postponed Tokyo Olympic Games will go ahead next year ""with or without Covid"", the vice-president of the International Olympic Committee says. John Coates confirmed to news agency AFP that the Olympics would start on 23 July next year, calling them the ""Games that conquered Covid"". They were originally scheduled to start in July 2020, but were postponed due to Covid-19 fears. The IOC had earlier said they would not delay the Games beyond 2021. ""The Games were going to be their theme, the Reconstruction Games after the devastation of the tsunami,"" Mr Coates told AFP, referring to 2011 catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. ""Now very much these will be the Games that conquered Covid, the light at the end of the tunnel."" In July, Tokyo 2020 chief executive Toshiro Muto said it was possible that the Games be held to a ""limited"" audience, but said they wanted to avoid the possibility of having no spectators at all. Tokyo 2020 may have 'limited spectators' Instead, he added that the Games could potentially ""simplify"" its opening and closing ceremonies, as well as reduce the number of staff and delegations from each country. Japan had spent years preparing for the Tokyo Games More than 11,000 athletes from around 200 countries were scheduled to take part in the 2020 Games. It is not clear how travel restrictions might impact their participation as Japan's borders are currently largely closed to foreign visitors. Mr Muto also said a vaccine was not a prerequisite for the Games, though health experts had cast doubt over whether the Games could be held without a vaccine. ""If a vaccine is ready, that will be a benefit, but we're not saying we can't hold the event without it - it's not a precondition,"" he said. In April, Games chief Yoshiro Mori said the Tokyo Games would have to be cancelled if there were not held in 2021. Bach 'would understand Tokyo cancellation' Explaining this decision, IOC President Thomas Bach said: ""You cannot forever employ 3,000 to 5,000 people in an organising committee. You cannot every year change the entire sports schedule worldwide of all the major federations."" Before the pandemic, the Games had only ever been cancelled because of war, but never postponed. Tokyo 2020 may have 'limited spectators' Olympics 'will not be postponed again' Bach 'would understand Tokyo cancellation' Question mark over 2021 Tokyo Olympics Tokyo Olympics postponement leaves UK firms in limbo 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Islanders fear 'clearance' over house prices,"Uist in the Western Isles has been suggested as the location for a property trial Community figures have warned that rising property prices in the Hebrides and Skye are preventing locals from buying a home. In an open letter they described the situation as akin to an ""economic clearance"" that was threatening the sustainability of the islands. They said young islanders could not compete with offers made by buyers from elsewhere in the UK. It follows claims parts of Scotland are seeing a post-lockdown property boom. The uptick in interest has been put down to previously office-based staff being able to work from home and perceived lower rates of Covid-19. Pandemic driving 'exceptional interest' in Scots homes Gaelic language in 'crisis' in isles heartlands Islands to receive Â£100m in government investment The letter's signatories - which includes crofters, development officers and Gaelic campaigners - said 40% of housing stock on both Tiree in the Inner Hebrides and West Harris in the Western Isles were holiday homes. They said the availability of affordable properties for young islanders had been a long-running problem, but was expected to worsen post-lockdown. They pointed to reports of people across the UK looking to relocate to the Highlands and Islands, and having the means to make higher offers than local buyers. The average purchase price for residential properties in the Western Isles have increased from Â£65,189 in 2004 to Â£123,048 last year, according to the Registers of Scotland. For Argyll and Bute - which includes the Inner Hebrides -  the prices over the same period have risen from Â£110,691 to Â£173,470. In the Highlands, which includes Skye, prices rose from Â£107,639 to Â£185,178. The Scottish average prices were Â£113,289 in 2004 and Â£181,339 last year. The Western Island and Argyll and Bute also saw the highest proportion of cash sales of all Scotland's local authority areas in 2019-20, where about 50% of all residential sales were cash sales. The letter said: ""Part-time residencies do not sustain our communities and we should therefore ensure that houses are bought with the intention of being a primary residency. ""Inaction will allow this economic clearance to be consolidated in history."" Christina Morrison and her husband moved back to the Western Isles from the mainland for a ""rare job interview"" and to raise a young family. But they faced an uphill struggle finding a place in Uist to call their own. ""We were about to start a family and we wanted our family to grow up here on the islands and have the nice upbringing we had,"" she said. ""When we first moved over we had a really difficult time. We stayed in a hotel at one point and family helped out with temporary accommodation."" The couple lost out twice in bids for homes and Christina said the buyers in both instances were planning to use the properties as holiday homes. She said: ""It was just pure luck we got the house we are in now."" The couple, who were just about to become parents, were told the owners of a house down the road from where they were staying had been seen packing up their household possessions. The house had not yet gone on the market, but the sellers were keen for a quick sale and agreed to sell it Christina her husband. The use of the term ""clearance"" echoes back to the Highland clearances when tenants were evicted from land in the 18th and 19th Centuries so landlords could increase their income. The letter suggests Uist in the Western Isles be used as a trial location where properties are advertised locally in the first instance prior to being listed on the national market. The letter said 40% of property on Tiree was used as a second home The letter said: ""A recent example of a house in Uist becoming available for rental shows the scope for positive action. ""The owner agreed that the house should first be advertised to young locals, and a number of applications were received. ""They seized this opportunity to invest in the community by offering the house to a returning young couple with three children."" The letter comes after concerns were raised that Gaelic speakers among the islands' communities could vanish within 10 years. Researchers said daily use of Gaelic was currently too low to sustain it as a community language in the future. The letter's signatories include PÃ druig Morrison, a Uist crofter, researcher and musician and architect and Gaelic campaigner Martin Baillie, from Skye. Uist businesswoman Emma Axelsson and crofter Fiona NicÃosaig have also signed it. A lack of affordable housing for islanders is recognised in the Scottish government'sNational Plan for Scotland's Islands,external, which was published last year. The plan's consultation process had ""highlighted that the availability of affordable, fit-for-purpose housing on Scottish islands presents a challenge for island communities"". The challenges include young people deciding to leave island communities and a lack of accessible and affordable housing being a ""barrier"" to attracting families to island communities. In the plan, the government made a commitment to support affordable housing projects. Gordon Macrae, of homeless people's charity Shelter Scotland, said the solution to providing housing for islanders and meeting demand from people living elsewhere in the UK wanting to move to rural areas was to ""build more homes"". He added: ""The problem for many parts of the Highlands, and the Borders as well, is that they have gone under-invested for so long."" Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said the Scottish government recognised good quality, affordable homes were ""essential to help attract and retain"" people in Scotland's remote rural and island communities. He said the government had committed record levels of investment as part of its efforts to deliver 50,000 affordable homes, with more than 4,800 homes delivered in rural and islands areas in the first four years of the current parliament and over Â£50m spent on affordable housing on islands in that time. Mr Stewart said: ""While promoting rural properties to local people in the first instance clearly has merits in supporting local people to access housing, it would need to operate on a voluntary basis as the way in which an owner chooses to market their property is a matter entirely for them. ""However, we remain committed to affordable local housing solutions that allow people to stay, live and work in their communities.""

"India climbs second to US as Covid cases surgeIndia, which has been adding record daily totals, now has the world's second-highest tally.","For the last few days India has added more than 75,000 daily infections daily India has recorded more than 90,000 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking its total above that of Brazil. The country now has the second-largest number of confirmed cases in the world, 4,204,613. It has reported 71,642 deaths, the third-highest in the world. The surge in reported infections has mostly come from five states. The rise comes as the government continues to lift restrictions to try to boost an economy that lost millions of jobs when the virus hit in March. For the last seven days India's caseload has galloped, adding more than 75,000 daily infections per day. More than 60% of the active cases are coming from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. Cases have also begun spiking in the capital, Delhi, as well, with more than 3,200 infections recorded on Sunday, the city's highest in more than two months. An upsurge of Covid-19 in many rural areas has also led to an uptick in numbers. The virus has struck a remote tribe in India's Andamans islands, with 10 members of the Greater Andamanese testing positive over the past month. The rise in cases is also partly a reflection of increased testing - the number of daily tests conducted across the country has risen to more than a million. Although India has a low death rate from the disease, nearly 1,000 deaths have been recorded every day from across the country for the last seven days. In early August India became the third country in the world to pass two million cases. India went into a stringent lockdown in March in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, whose numbers were only in the hundreds then. It began to ease out of it in phases in June to promote economic activity, even as cases continued to spike. The pandemic and the lockdown caused massive disruptions to economic activity during the quarter. India's economy shrank by 23.9% in the three months to the end of June, the worst slump since the country started releasing quarterly data in 1996. How many Covid-19 deaths is India missing?

Train services increase as more schools reopenTrain operators will reintroduce more services on a new timetable catering for schoolchildren.,"Rail firms are reassuring travellers major efforts have been taken to ensure their safety as services increase. Trains in England, Wales and Scotland were up to 90% of normal levels by Monday as schools reopen and people are encouraged to return to work. Rail firms said anecdotal evidence suggested a slight increase in numbers but it was too soon for exact figures. West Midlands Trains' Francis Thomas said there were ""big changes"", such as sanitising gel and one-way systems. ""If you haven't been to the railway station in the last couple of months you might find there's a one-way system at your local station, there's hand gel available and we've invested in anti-fogging machines that can spread an anti-viral on trains,"" he told the BBC. ""And there's plenty of space. We reckon we can carry about 40% of normal loads before we start to breach social distancing."" One passenger told the BBC: ""I think you just have to get outâ¦ and then once you get out you kind of get rid of your fears."" Another reported there was plenty of space: ""I come in on the Chiltern Railways line into Marylebone and the trains were a lot, lot longer, and they've, barriered off certain seats. It wasn't too packed."" Jacqueline Starr, head of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said rail services were ""doing everything they can"" to reassure people travel was safe. The group said no service was reported as ""close to social distancing capacity"". Coronavirus: Rail passengers to be warned when trains are busy Coronavirus: Is social distancing on trains here to stay? Train operators across the country have designed the new timetable, taking into consideration potentially busy stations and parts of routes that will experience higher demand for travel by schoolchildren. Where possible, more frequent services will be put on or extra carriages added to create more room. Staff will also be on hand to explain the rules on wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing to older children. ""Some train times will change so we're asking people to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times if possible,"" said Ms Starr. Over the coming weeks, rail bosses have a delicate balance to strike. They want more passengers back on the network, but they don't want a flood of commuters crowding trains and stations. Up to now, passenger numbers have remained low - on average, about a third of what it was before the pandemic. The railways are not going back to where they were before the pandemic. Some services won't return. But in places, at certain times, more capacity will be created. During the pandemic, the government has been covering the huge cost of running the railways without passengers. So there is also a financial incentive for ministers that passengers return. Train companies are now working to manage passenger flowsby warning people if a particular service is busy. Some modern trains, like those running on Southeastern and on Govia Thameslink, can monitor the weight load in carriages, allowing them to estimate the number of people on board. Southeastern plans to share the data with passengers so they can avoid a specific train. The Rail Delivery Group said that reducing the timetable during the coronavirus lockdown and then gradually increasing services again in phases had led to improvements in punctuality. Passengers are advised to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times In particular, train operators and Network Rail had learned lessons about the effects of ""wear and tear"" on railway infrastructure, the effects ""knock-on delays"" caused to intensely-used routes, and the time trains take at each station. ""Before Covid one train was leaving a station at every second - we were congested. Obviously what this has allowed us to do is to look at the timetable and its resilience and to see where we can improve and increase punctuality and build and maintain that as we build back up the timetable,"" Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, told the BBC. Mr Nisbet added that the crisis had prompted another look at the way fares are structured: ""The need for reform has never been stronger, specifically when it comes to fares."" He said the regulations that governed fares needed changing and that talks were being held with government on this issue - including changes to make season tickets more flexible. At the end of August,the government launched an advertising campaignencouraging people to go back to the workplace. Business leaders have warned of damage being done to city centres as people stay away from offices. However, many employers have no plans to return workers to the office. The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place.

Although India has a low death rate from the disease, nearly 1,000 deaths have been recorded every day from across the country for the last seven days. In early August India became the third country in the world to pass two million cases. India went into a stringent lockdown in March in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, whose numbers were only in the hundreds then. It began to ease out of it in phases in June to promote economic activity, even as cases continued to spike. The pandemic and the lockdown caused massive disruptions to economic activity during the quarter. India's economy shrank by 23.9% in the three months to the end of June, the worst slump since the country started releasing quarterly data in 1996. How many Covid-19 deaths is India missing?

Delhi metro reopens after Covid-19 shutdown,"Few commuters took the service on Monday morning The metro in the Indian capital, Delhi, has reopened more than five months after it was shut down to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It's India's largest rapid transport system - it carried 2.7 million passengers a day before the lockdown. Masks, social distancing and temperature checks are mandatory according to the new rules. The move comes as case numbers continue to climb in India, with daily tallies of more than 80,000. The country has so far reported more than 4.1 million cases, and 70,000 deaths. Despite the risks, India continues to reopen because the economy is still reeling from the effects of a prolonged lockdown. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At least 12 other metro services across the country are also reopening today. Access to stations was restricted Delhi has reported a recent uptick in cases and fatalities after the numbers dipped briefly. But the city has been steadily reopening, with bars set to open next week. The metro, however, is especially risky given the volume of passengers, and the fact that it covers large swathes of the sprawling capital. But officials have releaseddetailed rules,externalto curb the spread of the virus. A security guard sprays disinfectant on a commuter's bag at a Delhi station For one, the 389km (247 mile)-long metro will open in a phased manner over the week, eventually servicing all 285 stations. The yellow line, which connects 37 stations between north Delhi and the satellite city of Gurgaon, is the first to reopen. It's the oldest line and also the busiest, with a daily footfall of around 1.45 million. In the first phase starting Monday, trains will run for four hours in the morning, beginning 07:00 IST, and for four hours in the evening, ending at 20:00 IST. Service hours will be extended from Friday onwards. Passengers will be allowed to sit on alternate seats or stand, maintaining adequate social distancing, according to the rules. Some 45 stations have automatic thermal screening devices The trains will stop for an increased 10-20 seconds at stations to allow passengers sufficient time to board and alight without crowding around the doors. The coaches are expected to be warmer than usual as more fresh air will be pumped in from outside to ensure increased air circulation and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Only a limited number of station gates will open to avoid a rush of passengers - stations usually have four entry and exit gates. Security guards wearing face shields will enforce rules in the stations Some 800 people will be deployed at all stations to ""ensure the cleanliness and orderliness inside stations"", and to regulate entry and exit of passengers, Metro officials said. All passengers will be screened and have to sanitise their hands before entering the stations. Forty five stations have been provided with machines, which will screen commuters and sanitise their hands. Masks will be provided to passengers not wearing them. Metro authorities say the concourse, passages, platforms, stairs, escalators, hand rails and toilets will be disinfected every four hours. Trains will skip stations in areas with rising coronavirus cases Only passengers carrying smart cards that can be digitally recharged will be allowed to travel. Many passengers used plastic travelling tokens before the lockdown. Trains will skip stations in areas with a high number of coronavirus cases, and where commuters are violating social distancing norms, they added. ""If we find that resumption of operations is not resulting in social distancing, then, we might have no option but to review these arrangements,"" Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said recently.

Typhoon Haishen threatens South Korea,"Waves crash on the coast as Typhoon Haishen approaches the Japanese prefecture of Kagoshima Typhoon Haishen has touched down in South Korea after slamming through southern Japan. The storm made landfall in Ulsan, just north of Busan, South Korea's second-largest city. More than 300 flights from 10 airports were cancelled, with some train services suspended. The typhoon caused a loss of power across hundreds of thousands of homes in Japan, though initial assessments suggest it did less damage than feared. Thirty-two people were injured, including four who sustained cuts after the glass windows of an evacuation centre were blown in, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. Some eight million people in Japan had been asked to evacuate in the path of the storm. What are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons?

Thousands march against Budapest school 'takeover',"Thousands joined the human chain in Budapest on Sunday Thousands of people have formed a chain in the streets of the Hungarian capital Budapest in protest at what they say is a takeover of a top arts university by the country's nationalist government. Demonstrators fear a new board at the University of Theatre and Film Arts, led by an ally of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, will ruin its autonomy. Students have occupied the campus for the past week. Orban supporters say the arts are dominated by liberals and left-wingers. The university is the seventh institution to be transferred to the control of private foundations where the board of directors are selected by the government. The government denies claims that it is limiting freedom of expression, and says the privatisation of this and other universities will make them more competitive. Students challenge Orban ""takeover"" with red tape Journalists resign at Hungary's top news site The human chain on Sunday took in four other institutions and linked around 8,000 protesters from parliament to the university. Demonstrators demanded autonomy for the school and freedom for artistic endeavour and education. Marta Barbarics, who attended the rally, told Reuters news agency: ""For a university to be able to operate autonomously is the foundation of democracy."" She added: ""If a university can't teach in a way as its citizens deem appropriate then there are serious problems, and the leadership of a university doesn't quit for no reason."" The chain went from the university to parliament The University of Theatre and Film Arts has nurtured some of the great names of Hungarian cinema. Graduates of the university include the Oscar-winning director IstvÃ¡n SzabÃ³ - whose credits include Mephisto - and the actress Alexandra BorbÃ©ly. Students have occupied the university since last Sunday. The new head of the board, Attila Vidnyanszky, said on Tuesday they were open to dialogue. However he also said he wanted a ""different kind of thinking"" at the university, adding that existing classes would be kept with some emphasis placed on patriotism and Christianity. Fears for artistic and academic freedom in the country have escalated in recent years. In 2019, the Central European University in Budapestmoved most of its courses to Viennaafter a legal battle launched by Mr Orban. The university said it could no longer ""operate as a free institution"" in Budapest. In July, more than 70 journalists and staff at Hungary's top news site Index resigned.

Analysis: Deal fears as deadline looms,"There are fears that customs tariffs could lead to big queues in Dover EU diplomats in Brussels wake up this morning with a sore head. The government has thrown a number of political grenades across the Channel over the space of a few hours. First: a defiant-sounding interview with David Frost, the UK chief negotiator in the troubled trade talks with the EU. Next came a leak about government plans to introduce domestic legislation which would partially undermine the Brexit divorce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, signed last year with the EU. Also affecting the Irish Protocol, designed at the time by Brussels and the UK to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Finally, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that if no trade deal is agreed by mid-October, there will be no trade deal at all with the EU. And that - by the way - a no-deal scenario would actually be good for the UK, giving it full control over its ""laws, rules and fishing waters"". EU reaction? Not at all happy. Bang on cue, irritated European diplomatic sources described the Frost interview as sabre rattling and ""unsurprising muscle flexing"" ahead of the last tough rounds of trade negotiations with the EU. UK ministers plan laws overriding part of withdrawal deal What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Barnier: UK risks no deal unless it compromises UK 'sleepwalking into disaster' over border plans Why Brexit is still a big issue As regards the domestic legislation affecting the Irish Protocol (the precise details of which have not yet been revealed), Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney tweeted that would be ""a very unwise way for the government to proceed"". While a high level EU diplomat from a country traditionally close to the UK slammed the planned legislation as, not only a trust or credibility issue, but ""something that could lead to the unravelling of the already fraught EU-UK trade negotiations"". It was a self-defeating move by the Johnson government, he said. So self-defeating, in EU eyes, that I have now begun to hear musings amongst Brussels contacts that maybe they were not the government's main target audience after all. Because, say EU figures, if the Frost interview, the legislation leak and the prime minister's words were all designed as a negotiating tactic, to put pressure on the EU, then it was a terrible tactic, they insist, as it simply serves to ""raise European hackles"". This video can not be played UK vs EU: Johnson and Michel Barnier set out competing visions on trade Some in the EU think the government's intended audience was actually ardent Brexiters. More specifically: backbench Tory MPs, already annoyed with the government's handling of domestic issues, like the exam chaos this summer, and worried the prime minister may be about to agree a compromise deal with the EU. Could this mean, wonders the EU, that Boris Johnson is throwing what one Twitter commentator described as ""red meat"" to the backbench Brexiters - talking up the no-deal scenario and giving Brussels ultimatums - because he is actually preparing to ""get pragmatic"" and make concessions in trade talks? Or is the opposite true? Is the prime minister preparing the ground to declare that no deal can be reached and that the UK and EU will instead trade on World Trade Organization terms - with the accompanying tariffs to pay - come the new year? Access to fishing grounds has become a key issue in the trade talks Brussels diplomats say they are willing to make concessions, including on key issues like state aid and fishing but that the UK must do the same, including - and this is as much a bottom line for the EU as it is hard to swallow for the UK - signing up to safeguards for the EU's single market. The prime minister faces conflicting domestic pressures. Pushing him towards a compromise deal: cost of no deal for UK business, Scottish elections loom and no deal will likely boost the fortunes of the anti-Brexit SNP who are calling for another referendum on Scottish independence, manufacturing towns among new Conservative ""red wall"" seats would suffer from no-deal paperwork and disruption to supply chains. Pushing him away from such a deal: strong opposition from Brexiter Conservative MPs, concerns over ceding post-Brexit sovereignty and remaining tied to Brussels apron strings. The EU is not at all sure what Boris Johnson will decide. But it is convinced of one thing: deal or no deal, the decision ultimately lies in Downing Street, not here in Brussels. If there is a deal, it is highly unlikely to be struck by mid-October, as the prime minister wishes. The EU thinks November is a more realistic bet. It still believes a deal can be done and that Boris Johnson would prefer a deal over no deal. But time is tight, tempers are frayed and Covid-19 continues to distract leaders across Europe. At least one emergency Brexit summit is likely before the autumn is over. UK vs EU: What both sides want from a trade deal.

Why is fishing important in talks?,"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

'Strong response' in Birmingham stabbings manhunt,"This video can not be played Police are looking for this man after an attacker killed one victim and wounded seven other people Police hunting a man suspected of killing one person and injuring seven others in stabbings across Birmingham city centre say they have had a ""strong response"" after releasing CCTV footage. The attacks in the early hours of Sundaysparked a massive manhunt. Images of the man officers want to find were published on Sunday evening. Detectives have been working through the night following leads from the public to identify and find the suspect, West Midlands Police tweeted. The attacks happened at four different locations across the city centre during a 90-minute spell. A 23-year-old man was killed in Irving Street at 01:50 BST on Sunday, while a man and a woman, aged 19 and 32, suffered critical stabbing injuries. Five other people, aged between 23 and 33, were injured and taken to hospital. Two have since been discharged. The public are urged to remain vigilant and not to approach the man pictured CCTV footage released on Sunday evening shows a man wearing a baseball cap, a dark hoodie with white drawstrings, dark-coloured trousers and shoes. He is seen standing and walking on a street corner. Three hours after the images were published, West Midlands Police tweeted: ""We've had a strong response following our appeal to trace the #BirminghamStabbings suspect. ""Our detectives are following up several new lines of enquiry. This man is wanted on suspicion of murder. ""We've got a team of detectives working through the night to identify and trace the  suspect."" It added that a special hotline has been set up for members of the public to pass on information. Earlier in the day, Ch Supt Steve Graham told reporters: ""At this stage we believe that the attacks were random and we have no indication of a motive."" He urged the public to remain vigilant, and call 999 if they spotted anything suspicious. West Midlands Police were first called to Constitution Hill where a man sustained a superficial injury just after 00:30 BST. Twenty minutes later they were called to Livery Street, near to Snow Hill railway station, where the 19-year-old man was critically injured and a woman was also hurt. An hour later at 01:50 BST, police were sent to Irving Street, where the 23-year-old died and another man suffered serious injuries. Ten minutes later, they were called to Hurst Street, in the city's Gay Village, where the 32-year-old woman was critically injured and two men suffered lesser injuries.

Both the public and police were put at further risk. There is a person dead. How was this man able to go on a two-hour spate?"" The force's police and crime commissioner David Jamieson labelled the assaults ""disturbing"", with the violence unfolding as revellers had been enjoying the night. West Midlands Police said extra officers had ""flooded"" the city centre and forensic experts had examined four scenes. A heavy police presence remained throughout Sunday, with armed officers, patrols, riot vans and squad cars visible. Streets remained closed on Monday morning as investigations continued.

The attacks in the early hourssparked a massive police manhuntfor the suspect. A 23-year-old man was killed in Irving Street at 01:50 BST, West Midlands Police said. A man and a woman, aged 19 and 32, suffered critical injuries. Five other people, aged between 23 and 33, were also hurt. They were taken to hospital and so far two have been discharged.

UK must square up to Covid again,"It is crunch time for coronavirus in the UK. Children are returning to school and, with summer over, the return of colder weather and dark nights means more time will be spent indoors, giving the virus a better chance of spreading. So how strong a position are we in to fight the virus? There was a point at which the UK appeared to be among the worst-hit countries in the pandemic -a review by the Office for National Statistics found that by the middle of June, the UK had the highest level of excess deaths. But if you make international comparisons now, the UK is performing remarkably well. This is despite much being made of the rise in cases since early July. Daily case numbers have risen from just above 500, on average, to over 1,300 - although some of that is down to more testing being put in place. But the numbers also need to be seen in context. Because of the lack of testing available in the spring, it is unclear exactly how many cases there were when coronavirus was at its peak in the UK. There were days when confirmed cases hit 6,000. But that was just the tip of the iceberg. It has since been estimated there were perhaps as many as 100,000 infections a day at the end of March. Of course, the system is still not detecting all the cases even with the extra testing in place. The Office for National Statistics surveillance programme suggests the true level of infection may be about twice what is being recorded currently. But that's still a fraction of the cases seen in the spring. And while there is evidence of cases increasing, that has not translated into an increase in people being admitted to hospital. Deaths are also low - down to under 10 a day on average. There is no guarantee it will stay like this, of course. Many of the new cases are being seen in young adults who are now out more, either working or socialising. They are at very low risk of complications so this may not seem too concerning - after all, society has to function - but the fear remains that this could lead to the frail and vulnerable catching the virus. That said, those who fall into the more vulnerable groups will naturally be taking more precautions. But the problem, says Edinburgh University infectious diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, comes if the levels of infection rise substantially from the level being seen at the moment. ""Spillover into the high-risk population could become very hard to avoid.""  How do I get a coronavirus test? Can my child go to school with a cold? The international effort to find a vaccine is unprecedented. There are about 150 initiatives in development, including more than 20 that have begun human trials. One of the most promising is being developed by Oxford University - and early results suggest it can trigger an immune response. A deal has been signed to supply 100 million doses in the UK alone. But even with the rapid progress that is being made, a vaccine is very unlikely to be available until the middle of next year at the earliest. And there are, of course, no guarantees it will work or just how long the protection it offers us will last. Leading immunologist Prof Sir John Bell, of the University of Oxford, believes the likeliest scenario will be a vaccine like the one for flu that offers some protection for a limited period. A smallpox scenario whereby a jab can wipe out the diseaseis only considered to be a remote possibility. Real progress has been made in the past few months on how best to treat patients who fall seriously ill with coronavirus - for the overwhelming majority it only causes a mild illness. A cheap and widely available, low-dose steroid treatment - dexamethasone - has been found to reduce the risk of death in seriously ill patients (those who require intensive care) by a third and is now being routinely used on the front line. It was research carried out in the UK that helped to make this breakthrough, which came in June. Since then trials have found another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective. Other breakthroughs will no doubt come. Different treatments are being tested on patients around the world, including the use of blood plasma from people who have been infected and recovered from the virus. What is dexamethasone and how does it fight Covid-19? It is going to be a major challenge. The virus is stealthy. It can be passed on before symptoms develop and, significantly, some people never even know they are infectious. This is what makes it so difficult to contain. Infections are almost certainly going to rise. But the key question is by how much and among which groups. Crucial to the success will be the testing and tracing regime. Each UK nation runs its own contact tracing system, but they work on the same principles - the details of positive cases are passed on to contact tracers who then try to identify their close contacts and ask them to isolate. Huge strides have been made to set up an effective system. The UK is now carrying out more tests per head of population than Spain, France and Germany. But problems still remain. A backlog has developed in processing tests at the three mega labs, which means it is taking longer to give people results - the average turnaround time is now more than 24 hours. The problems have prompted testing to be prioritised in high infection areas,meaning in some areas people are struggling to book tests at local centres. And demand continues to grow all the time. Scotland saw a big rise in tests being requested for children after schools went back in August. Contact tracing is also still a work in progress. England's service, for example, is still not quite reaching the 80% of positive cases and close contacts it is aiming to - although it is not that far short. But for all the difficulties that remain, the pattern of infections, the infrastructure now in place and the improvement in treatment all do offer hope.

What are the sticking points in talks?,"The teams negotiating a deal on trade and other issues between the UK and the EU are still locked in talks, with time running short. There have been cautious reports of progress but also of serious, remaining differences - political leaders on both sides say they do not know if an agreement will emerge. They are certainly leaving it very late - the UK/EU transition period (during which rules and trade have stayed the same) ends on 31 December. So, what are the issues still to be resolved? Even though fishing makes up only a tiny part of the economy on both sides, it was central to the Leave campaign that won the Brexit referendum in the UK in 2016. It's also an important issue in several EU countries - such as France. The EU is pushing for maximum access for its boats to continue operating in UK waters, where they currently catch nearly Â£600m worth of fish every year. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK wants most of that business back and says it will prioritise its own boats after 1 January when it will become an independent coastal state, outside the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). So, the dispute is not just about access, but also about a bigger share of the fishing quota for the UK fleet - not just where you can fish, but what you can catch. And if the UK gains, which countries' fishing fleets will lose the most? These are really tricky issues to resolve. There's also been disagreement about the length of a potential transition period, before new measures come into full force. Any compromise lies somewhere between the EU asking for eight years and the UK offering three. Brexit trade deal: What do the UK and the EU want? Who really owns UK fishing quotas? If there is no agreement on access to fishing waters, the UK won't get full access to the EU market, without tariffs (or taxes), to sell its fish there. Last year, around three quarters of UK fish exports went to the EU. This is all about rules on fair competition for billions of pounds of business, now and in the future. The idea of level playing field measures, which appear in most free trade agreements, is to ensure businesses on one side don't have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other. Brexit: What is a level playing field? If you cut regulations it can be cheaper to produce things, making some companies more competitive than others, and the EU is worried that the UK could do that in the future. That's why the EU wants the UK to stick particularly closely to EU rules on things like workers' rights, the environmental regulations that companies have to follow and state aid (financial subsidies given by government to businesses). The UK, on the other hand, says the whole point of Brexit was to break free from following EU rules. The two sides appear to have agreed a common baseline of regulations on some issues, which neither of them would go below. But the EU has also been insisting on a system which would mean if one side raised standards the other could face penalties, if failing to follow suit resulted in unfair competition. That raises the question of defining precisely what constitutes unfair competition. The EU has also tried but failed to persuade the UK to mirror its rules on subsidies. The UK says it is determined to assert and defend its sovereignty. This is mainly about how the rules of the deal will be enforced in future and what happens if one side breaks them. The EU may have conceded that it will not have a unilateral right to impose penalties, but it wants a strong and independent arbitration system that has real teeth. It has been pushing for powers to retaliate against the UK breaking rules in one area, by hitting back in another - for example, imposing tariffs or taxes where it thinks they might hurt most. Such powers would of course cut both ways. There's also the question of who might adjudicate disputes and where precisely the European Court of Justice will fit in. These are all hugely sensitive issues which will set the tone for the future relationship for years to come and only a few people behind the scenes know all the details of where the negotiations have got to. It's still possible that a basic trade deal can be done in the short time that remains. But both sides are going to have to make concessions quickly. It's also worth remembering that the negotiations are not just about trade with the EU (which accounted for 43% of UK exports in 2019 and 51% of UK imports). There is the important issue, for example, of police and security co-operation as well. The UK had wanted to maintain the same access to shared databases that it has now but the EU says that isn't on offer to non-members. A deal would provide better access, though, than no deal at all. There has been important progress on Northern Ireland - the subject of months of separate negotiations on how to implementthe agreement already signed with the EUon keeping the land border as open as it is now. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 On 8 December, the two sides announced""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts at Northern Irish ports (for trade with Great Britain), the supply of food and medicines, and state aid. Some of the arrangements for Northern Ireland would be easier to implement if a trade deal was done, but either way trade between Northern Ireland and the EU will not face tariffs (or taxes) on goods crossing the border. Without a deal, trade between Great Britain and the EU would be subject to tariffs in both directions. Any deal would still need to be ratified by parliaments on both sides, but the time to scrutinise it properly has all but run out. That's a problem for such an important agreement between close neighbours. EU law does allow agreements of this kind to be applied provisionally by member states if necessary - but that's never been done before for a trade deal, and there would be opposition in the European parliament to doing that now. And if the trade talks fall apart, don't expect much meaningful agreement on anything else. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Must I give my contact details?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days.

You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate.

Brexit: What is a level playing field?,"It's a term which was heard a lot during the post-Brexit trade negotiations. It's about fair competition, and it's much less easy to visualise or explain than fishing or the trade in cars. But it gets to the heart of what Brexit is all about. So how did the UK and the EU reach a deal on the level playing field, and how will it work in practice in the future? The level playing field is a trade-policy term for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country gaining a competitive advantage over those operating in other countries. These could be rules limiting the type of zero-hours contracts that can be offered to workers, for example, or restrictions on the amount of pollution certain industrial processes are allowed to produce. It's about fair and open competition and it's an important part of the EU single market in which member countries allow the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. The focus in theEU-UK trade deal, agreed in December 2020, is on regulations that cover environmental standards and labour law, and on state aid (or government subsidies for business). In the negotiations, the UK was determined to assert its sovereignty - which meant its independence from EU rules - while the EU was determined to protect its single market and control access to it. What's in the Brexit deal? Can I still go to Spain? And other questions Both sides can claim to have got what they wanted from the deal. It contains stricter level playing field conditions than in other recent trade agreements signed by the EU. So, the EU has created strong protections for the single market. But the UK has the right to break away from EU rules if it chooses to do so, and there is no role in enforcing the deal for the European Court of Justice. And that meets the UK demand for sovereignty. The two sides agreed to treat current shared regulations on environmental protection and workers' rights as a common baseline. The UK is free to change those standards in the future (as is the EU), but there is a potential price to pay. Built into the deal is the risk that if the UK moves too far from EU rules, in a way which is deemed unfair to EU businesses, its access to the European market could be limited. The same applies the other way round. Under this ""rebalancing mechanism"", tariffs (or taxes on goods crossing borders) could be imposed, and they wouldn't always have to be in the same policy area where the dispute occurs. Either the EU or the UK could also impose tariffs without the agreement of the other side, if they think that government subsidies are distorting trade. But, importantly, all those decisions would have to go to independent arbitration. An arbitration panel would involve representatives from both sides as well as independent experts or judges. It was agreed that the UK would not copy EU state aid rules directly, even though that had been the EU's initial demand in the trade negotiations. Instead it is setting up an independent state aid authority, and has now published legislation in the form ofa new Subsidy Control Billwhich will create a new subsidy system. The government says its new regime will be more nimble than the EU's, and will allow it to focus on its domestic priorities. But if the UK changes its rules too much, the EU will have the power to retaliate. The level playing field agreements cover billions of pounds worth of business now and in the future. The UK has certainly won the theoretical right to break away from EU rules, but it will have to make a careful calculation about whether such moves will be either necessary or worthwhile. It has a tariff-free trade deal with its largest economic partner for now, but there is no guarantee that it will stay that way. On the other hand, it's not always easy to prove that fair competition is being distorted - or the extent to which a change in regulations might be responsible for any distortion. So the role of the new arbitration system will be crucial, and could become controversial. The EU-UK agreement also set up a new Partnership Council, with more than twenty committees and working groups. It will look into various aspects of how the relationship develops in the future, and will seek to resolve disputes. Both sides also have the right to call for a formal review of the entire agreement if they think it isn't working well, and there will be an automatic review anyway after five years. That means a future UK government, which thinks market access is more important than the current government's notion of sovereignty, could choose to interpret the deal in a different way. So, as a political issue, it's not going to go away. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Why is fishing important in Brexit talks?,"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

Japanese urged to stay alert as typhoon blows in,"Waves crash on the coast as Typhoon Haishen approaches the Japanese prefecture of Kagoshima Typhoon Haishen has touched down in South Korea after slamming through southern Japan. The storm made landfall in Ulsan, just north of Busan, South Korea's second-largest city. More than 300 flights from 10 airports were cancelled, with some train services suspended. The typhoon caused a loss of power across hundreds of thousands of homes in Japan, though initial assessments suggest it did less damage than feared. Thirty-two people were injured, including four who sustained cuts after the glass windows of an evacuation centre were blown in, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. Some eight million people in Japan had been asked to evacuate in the path of the storm. What are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons? The storm comes days after Maysak, one of the region's strongest typhoons in years, slammed into the Korean peninsula and Japan last week. High winds have already cut power to almost 5,000 households on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, including the resort island of Jeju, says a Reuters report. Hundreds of flights and train services were cancelled in Japan A typhoon alert has been issued for Jeju and other southern parts of South Korea like Gyeongsang province. But a KMA official told Yonhap News that it was likely the typhoon would weaken as it passed by. South Korea's Korea Forest Service had earlier raised the landslide alert to its highest level. Nearly 430,000 homes in the Kyushu region were without power,externalas of 03:00 local time Monday (18:00 GMT Sunday), Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. Haishen has led to the closure of factories, schools and businesses across western Japan. Hundreds of flights and train services were also cancelled. This video can not be played The Filipino seaman was found drifting in a life jacket The typhoon has also forced Japan's coast guard to suspend its search for missing sailors from a cargo ship that sank during Typhoon Maysak. The Gulf Livestock 1 was carrying 43 crew members and 6,000 cows when it went missing on Wednesday. Three crew members were rescued, though one later died.
