Mangled bicycles littered the scene of the attack, which occurred as much of the city was celebrating Halloween. One witness, identified as Eugene, told ABC Channel 7 that he saw the white pick-up truck driving fast down the cycle path alongside the West Side Highway, near Stuyvesant High School, at full speed and hitting a number of people. He also reported hearing about nine or 10 shots. Another witness, who gave his name as Frank, told local TV network NY1 that he had seen a man running around an intersection and heard five to six gunshots. ""I saw he had something in his hand, but I couldn't tell what it was. But they said that it was a gun... ""When the cops shot him, everybody started running away and it got a little bit crazy right there. So when I tried to look again, the guy was already down."" President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident, the White House said. In separate tweets, he said: ""In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!"" ""We must not allow ISIS [Islamic State] to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!"" This video can not be played Emergency services on the scene of the attack By Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York At the moment the New York authorities are saying that it was a lone wolf, that the attack wasn't part of a wider conspiracy or plot. But this is an active crime scene at the moment and they are still trying to piece together precisely what happened. The attack happened on Halloween, one of the most festive days in the New York calendar. The pavements were crowded with kids in costumes and there are still children trick-or-treating just yards away - it's a bizarre scene. But it shows how New York absorbs this kind of thing. We are just yards from Ground Zero, a site which reminds all New Yorkers of that awful day back in 2001. It didn't take police long to confirm that the city had once again been the target of terror.

Bake Off winner is named - officially,"Kate, Steven and Sophie did battle in the Bake Off final Warning: This story contains spoilers This year's Great British Bake Off winner has been revealed on Channel 4 - 11 hours after judge Prue Leith accidentally let it slip on Twitter. Sophie Faldo triumphed over Kate Lyon and Steven Carter-Bailey in the final after wowing the judges with her seven-layered, honey bee-themed entremet showstopper. However the outcome had been spoiled for some fans when Prue earlier mistakenly tweeted: ""Bravo Sophie"". She apologised and explained that she had been confused by the time difference because she was in Bhutan. Leith accidentally reveals Bake Off winner Channel 4's Bake Off risk has paid off Meet the Great British Bake Off finalists Sophie described her victory as ""pretty mega"" and ""beyond anything I'd thought or dreamed of"". The former Army officer said her time in the tent had been ""very surreal"", adding: ""I hadn't allowed myself to think that I could win it up to that moment in time when they said my name and then the enormity of it hit me."" After 10 weeks, the contest all came down to the showstoppers after the first two rounds of the final were pretty close. The entremet - a fiendish multi-layered creation using at least five elements - was ""the most unforgiving showstopper in Bake Off history"", we were told. Sophie's was titled ""ode to the honey bee"" and was described as ""amazing"" by Prue, who complimented her choice of flavours. ""Lemon and lavender has got to be THE new taste"", she declared. Before that, Sophie had been sandwiched between Steven and Kate when the signature and technical rounds were judged. In the signature, her 12 small loaves were passable enough - even if Paul reckoned her ciabatta looked more like naan bread. And in the technical, she came second with her ginger biscuits. The only thing that fell totally flat - literally - was the yoga pose she attempted on the kitchen floor. Kate impressed in the signature and showstopper but the fact she didn't have time to finish icing her biscuits in the technical might have cost her the title. However it did save her from having to cartwheel naked through the tent, as she promised Noel she would if she won. Her mini loaves were the most impressive in the first round, with her coconut kala chana tasting ""divine"", according to Paul, who said he might copy her filling. And her striking white chocolate, yuzu and lychee entremet showstopper was ""a little stroke of genius"", according to Prue. ""I'd eat that all day,"" Paul drooled. After looking like he might run away with the contest early in the series, Steven's final was as uneven as a badly-baked Battenberg. In the signature, his roasted garlic and fontina loaves tasted ""disappointing"", Prue said, and Paul said they looked awful. His spelt and rye bread was also underproved. Steven looked like he had turned things around with the ginger biscuits in the technical, which were iced and shaped more impressively than his rivals'. But his yin and yang showstopper, featuring 14 elements, proved too testing. He tried to stay calm, taking time out to do deep breathing and have his brow mopped by Sandi Toksvig. But it wasn't enough to get him back on track. The way the layers bled into each other ""upset"" Paul, who added: ""This all comes down to timing - as I've said before."" At the end of the final, viewers were given updates on what all 12 contestants had done since the show was filmed, and were told that Sophie and Steven were BBFFs (best baking friends forever).

Arrest warrant issued for Rose McGowan,"This video can not be played US actress Rose McGowan: 'It's time to rise' An arrest warrant has been issued in the US for the actress Rose McGowan for possession of a controlled substance. It follows an investigation into belongings left on a United Airlines flight from LA to Washington Dulles airport in January. The belongings reportedly belonged to McGowan and had traces of a controlled substance. Washington police obtained the warrant on 1 February, spokesman Rob Yingling said. The authorities say they have been trying to contact McGowan so she can appear in court in Virginia. McGowan, 44, is among the most prominent accusers of Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul facing multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment. Writing on Twitter on Monday, Ms McGowan hit out at the arrest warrant, asking ""Are they trying to silence me?"" How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Harvey Weinstein's accusers McGowan has accused Weinstein of raping her at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. She received a $100,000 (Â£76,000) settlement after the incident, according to a New York Times report. Through a spokesperson, Weinstein has denied any non-consensual sexual acts. According to the New York Times,external, someone approached Ms McGowan's lawyer in September to offer $1 million in exchange for her signature on a nondisclosure agreement regarding Weinstein's conduct. She told the Times she countered with a request for $6 million, but withdrew the counter-offer when the newspaper published allegations against Weinstein from several women. UK police said on Tuesday they were investigating sexual assault allegations against Weinstein from seven women between the 1980s and 2015. New York police are also investigating claims against the 65-year-old, including rape and sexual assault. Numerous allegations have been made against the movie mogul by women including actresses Angelina Jolie, Mira Sorvino and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Netflix halts House of Cards production,"Spacey plays the US president for much of the series Production of the sixth season of Netflix series House of Cards has been suspended following sexual assault allegations against actor Kevin Spacey. Spacey, who stars in the political drama, has been accused of making sexual advances to a 14-year-old boy. The show was already due to end after this season, but production is now suspended ""until further notice"". The Old Vic theatre in London, where Spacey worked for 11 years, said it was ""deeply dismayed"" by the allegations. The 200-year-old theatre has set up a confidential complaints process for anyone connected to the Old Vic to come forward. The Old Vic said in a statement: ""We aim to foster a safe and supportive environment without prejudice, harassment or bullying of any sort, at any level."" Special Emmy award for Spacey withdrawn The decision to end House of Cards was announced in a joint statement by Netflix and Media Rights Capital (MRC), a production company that makes the series. ""MRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on House of Cards season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew."" The announcement comes after Star Trek: Discovery actor Anthony Rapp on Sunday accused Spacey of inappropriately touching him when he was 14 years old. Spacey, who is also executive director of House of Cards, said he owed Rapp, now 46, a ""sincere apology"" for what he said would have been ""deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour"". Spacey also announced that he was now living ""as a gay man"", butthe Oscar-winning actor has been widely criticisedfor choosing this moment to come out. Why are people angry about Kevin Spacey coming out? On Monday, producers said the show would end after its sixth season, which they recently began filming at a studio near Baltimore. A Netflix representative said the decision to end the series in 2018 had been made months ago. According to Variety magazine, producers are considering a spin-off series. House of Cards, which is based on a BBC programme, was first broadcast in 2013. The first season garnered nine Emmy nominations, becoming the first online streaming series to win such mainstream accolades.

Activist 'warned' about pursuing rape claim,"This video can not be played In full: Bex Bailey's interview with Radio 4's PM A Labour activist has said she was raped at a party event and that a senior Labour official discouraged her from reporting the attack. Bex Bailey said she was told reporting the 2011 incident could ""damage"" her and that she was given no advice on what she should do next. She told the BBC she had waived her anonymity to urge changes to the way such cases are handled. Labour said it had launched an independent investigation. This will look at ""claims that a party employee acted improperly over these 2011 allegations"", the party said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Ms Bailey had shown ""incredible bravery"" in speaking out and said she had his ""full support and solidarity"". Laura Kuenssberg: Calls for change in culture The issue of sexual abuse within politics and the parties' response has come under the microscope after recent allegations about sexual harassment in Parliament. Labour has said ""robust procedures"" both ""inside as well as outside Parliament"" are needed and Jeremy Corbyn has written to members urging anyone with a complaint to come forward using ""confidential party procedures"". Ms Bailey, who is calling for an independent body free from political ""bias"", said there was now a recognition that ""it's a problem in every party at every level"". The 25-year-old is a former member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee. In an interview with PM on BBC Radio 4, she said she had been 19 when she was raped by someone senior to her within the Labour Party who was not an MP. She said she had ""tried to pretend it hadn't happened"" and did not report the attack to the police at the time. ""I was scared, I felt ashamed, I know that the Labour Party, like any family, loves a good gossip - and I didn't want people to know and I also was worried that I wouldn't be believed if I did,"" she said. Two years later, she did confide in a party official. ""It took me a while to summon up the courage to tell anyone in the party,"" she said. ""But when I did, I told a senior member of staff, who told me... or it was suggested to me that I not report it, I was told that if I did it might damage me - and that might be their genuine view, it might be that that was the case in which case that shows that we have a serious problem in politics with this issue anyway."" Ms Bailey said she was not given good advice and was ""not signposted to anyone else that could"", and there seemed to be no procedure to report the incident. ""I don't think I was even given a cup of tea at the time,"" she said. ""It was quite a horrible experience and this is why I've been fighting so hard for changes to the way that we do this."" She is calling for an independent agency, like a charity, so allegations are dealt with free from ""political bias"" and complainants do not feel they will be ""penalised"". This body should provide advice on taking the matter to the police or, anonymously, to the party, she said. Labour's process relies on people reporting an attack to someone within the party - who is ""inclined to be loyal to the Labour Party"", she said. ""It's important that we need to make sure that this results in actual change in our parties as well as in Parliament, rather than letting it all blow over,"" she said. Ms Bailey said she had seen ""a lot of brave women"" speak out in recent days and weeks, and had chosen to do so to secure the changes she has campaigned for. ""I just really hope that all the horrible things that we're seeing will at least result in some sort of change in our parties as well as in Parliament."" A Labour Party spokesman said: ""The Labour Party takes these allegations extremely seriously. It takes great courage for victims of rape to come forward - and all support must and will be made available to them. ""We would strongly recommend that the police investigate the allegations of criminal actions that Bex Bailey has made. ""Labour will also launch an independent investigation into claims that a party employee acted improperly over these 2011 allegations."" Mr Corbyn added: ""There will be no tolerance in the Labour Party for sexism, harassment or abuse. ""Whatever it takes, we are absolutely committed to rooting it out."" Ed Miliband, who was Labour leader in 2011, said he was ""shocked"" by Ms Bailey's ""horrific allegations"". He added: ""She is showing great bravery and courage in speaking out. Victims must be supported when they come forward. These allegations must be properly investigated by the police and the Labour Party."" Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a list, thought to have been compiled by staff and researchers at Westminster, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs and ministers. Among the claims are a number of serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour with junior members of staff, the use of prostitutes and affairs between MPs. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergdescribed the listas ""both a mixture of unsavoury allegations, reports of well-known relationships, and some claims that are furiously denied"".

One million homes face tumble dryer risk,"A million potentially deadly tumble dryers could still be being used in British homes, Whirlpool has admitted. The manufacturer told a government committee that it had repaired only about half of the unsafe appliances since the scandal broke in 2015. It also admitted to the committee that it actually continued making them for three years after being notified that the appliances were faulty in 2012. But Whirlpool said it had acted in consultation with Trading Standards. Background: Truth, fires and tumble dryers; are our home appliances safe? Hotpoint - Online checker,external Indesit - Online checker,external The tumble dryers, sold under the Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit brands, have been blamed for a number of UK fires, including one in a London tower block and a blaze in Wales where two men died. One tumble dryer led to a tower block fire that left families homeless MPs on the Business committee accused the firm of failing to act quickly when it knew that the appliances were faulty. They particularly criticised the firm for failing to recall the faulty machines, with committee chair Rachel Reeves asking: ""How many fires are needed for a proper recall of these tumble dryers? We have already seen a number of fires and deaths, yet in many of our homes we still have these appliances."" Others giving evidence echoed her concerns. Pete Moorey, head of campaigns at consumer group Which?, said Whirlpool had ""ducked their responsibilities to customers"". Ian Moverley, communications director of Whirlpool UK, said the company had ""worked proactively to identify the safety issue and worked closely with Trading Standards to determine what action would be taken"". He came under fire after being unable to answer some of the MPs' questions. Ms Reeve said: ""Why hasn't someone at a more senior level come in front of us to answer our reasonable questions and take responsibility for the actions of your firm?"" The scandal broke in 2015 after it became clear that Whirlpool manufactured some 5.4 million faulty machines over an 11-year period. Last month a fire that killed two men in Llanrwst, Conwy county, in October 2014 was linked to the faulty appliances. Assistant coroner David Lewis said ""on the balance of probabilities, the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the tumble dryer in the laundry room of the flat"". In August 2016 the dryers were blamed for a huge fire in a West London tower block, with more than 50 people forced to flee their homes. Despite that incident the company continued to state the machines were safe to use as long as someone was in the property. Which? threatened to bring judicial review proceedings against Trading Standards over the advice being given. Trading Standards instructed Whirlpool to issue new guidance earlier this year that the dryers should be unplugged and not be used until they had been repaired.

Reality Check: Is Clinton photo with Bin Laden a fake?,"The claim:Photographs show Osama Bin Laden was hosted in the White House. Reality Check verdict:An image that has been shared on social media in Russia is fake. There are no known photographs of Osama Bin Laden at the White House and no evidence such an extraordinary event ever occurred. Maria Zakharova, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, was on a chat show on Russian state television on Monday, talking about the US government and its lobbying activities.

New signing? Fan kicks off over football,"It's a sporting battle with a difference. On one side, 20,000 football fans, with a maths geek up front. On the other, officialdom, strong in defence. The tussle at its heart? Whether the football on British road signs should be an accurate depiction of the real thing. Currently, the image on the sign is made entirely of hexagons but a ball like that would be geometrically impossible to make. Instead, a real football has a mixture of hexagons and pentagons - and maths crusader Matt Parker has started a petition to get that changed. However, despite 20,000 people signing up to support him, the government has given them the red card. The pattern of white and dark hexagons is stipulated in UK law as the image for a football ground. But in a YouTube campaign video, Mr Parker explains why that wouldn't work, even if the hexagons were somewhat distorted. It's ""a bit of a national embarrassment"", he says, because of Britain's long tradition in sport and its ""very proud"" tradition in mathematics and science. The mathematician, from Godalming in Surrey, said: ""We really should fix this. ""If we do get it fixed, that's just going to bring geometry into the public mind. ""People who have never thought about the shapes that make up a football or street signs will suddenly be engaged in 3D geometry - that's going to be amazing."" The football ground sign is one of several brown tourist signs aimed to help drivers find attractions and facilities, such as zoos, museums and hotels. Mr Parker argues all the signs except the football one look realistic. Could you answer these primary school maths questions? The story of England's lost football grounds The road markings that left contractors' red faced The Department for Transport says the purpose of traffic signs is to get drivers to take in information quickly and the symbols are merely a ""general representation"" of the activity. This particular football ground symbol was first used in 1994 so drivers have become ""accustomed"" to it, the spokesman said. ""The purpose of a traffic sign is not to raise public appreciation and awareness of geometry which is better dealt with in other ways."" He added if the signs were corrected, it would only be visible close up and not from the distance at which drivers will see the sign. ""The higher level of attention needed to understand the geometry could distract a driver's view away from the road for longer than necessary which could therefore increase the risk of an incident."" Matt Parker wants to open people's eyes to 3D geometry Responding to the government's comments, Mr Parker told the BBC he felt like the DfT had not read the petition properly. He added he had specifically asked not to change current signs but to set a precedent for the new signs. ""I'm not sure what the DfT thinks a football looks like but they say both: the change would be too small to be noticed and that the correct geometry would be so distracting to drivers it would increase the risk of accidents. ""I'm not asking for angles and measurements on the sign, just for it to look more like a football."" Art director Will Howe says the signs are ""still recognisable and functional in their current state"". But, he adds it was a ""clear oversight"" in the beginning to construct it without the iconic black pentagon detail. And graphic designer Chris Watterston said a symbol should always be as realistic as possible. ""It still needs to be simple enough for the human brain to process the symbol in as minimal time as possible [because] not doing so would almost certainly cause confusion and frustration. ""You've got to bear in mind that road signs are only ever going to be viewed by a driver for just a few seconds each time, meaning that recognition is key."" Mr Parker says the next step is to get 100,000 signatures so the government will have to debate the issue in parliament. The e-petitions that get rejected Can we believe petition signature numbers?

Trump trashes 'low level' indicted aide,"US President Donald Trump has played down the importance of an ex-campaign aide indicted in the Russia inquiry. He said his onetime foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos was a ""low level volunteer"" and ""liar"". Mr Trump once called him an ""excellent guy"". Papadopoulos, 30, this month pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Kremlin-related contacts. Two other ex-aides have been charged as part of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. What do ex-aides charges mean for Trump? Russia posts 'reached 126m Facebook users' The other two, former campaign chiefPaul Manafortand Rick Gates, appeared in court on Monday to deny charges including money laundering. Papadopoulos says he was told the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton In Tuesday morning's tweets, Mr Trump attempted to deflect scrutiny on to the Democratic party, or his tax reform proposals. He tweeted: ""The Fake News is working overtime. As Paul Manaforts [sic] lawyer said, there was 'no collusion' and events mentioned took place long before he came to the campaign. However, the indictment alleges Mr Manafort and Mr Gates conspired financial crimes from 2006-17, which does include the period over the summer when Mr Manafort served as manager for the Trump campaign. ""Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!"" Mr Trump's tweets continued. Papadopoulos appears in a photo that Mr Trump tweeted of himself in March 2016 hosting a national security meeting with his foreign policy team. By Adam Robinson, BBC Monitoring The main reaction to the allegations of meddling in the US election on Russian state TV is to make fun of it. ""Of course! Vladimir Putin is in charge of everything!"" a Rossiya 1 TV presenter on one of the many stage-managed political talks that dominate Russian TV schedules says to audience laughter, as he looks at a CNN graphic linking Paul Manafort to President Vladimir Putin. The main argument is that there is no evidence that links Moscow to any of this, and that the whole thing is part of an anti-Russian campaign. The culprits are variously described as Democrats unable to reconcile themselves to Donald Trump's election victory, or unreconstructed Western Cold Warriors worried about a newly assertive Russia. ""Can you imagine how badly Russia has undermined American democracy?"" the presenter of another talk show over on Channel One asks viewers sarcastically. A hard-line pro-Kremlin nationalist on the show thunders that Russia is being punished for standing up to a ""neo-colonialist"" America. But another guest looks on the bright side, pointing out that the ""circus"" in Washington could help strengthen Russia's reputation as a bastion of relative stability and common sense. Who's who in Russia-Trump drama In court documents released on Monday, federal investigators said Russian nationals had contacted Mr Papadopoulos to gain influence with the Trump campaign. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? They offered ""dirt"" in the form of ""thousands of emails"" on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in April 2016, according to an indictment. That was two months before a trove of embarrassing emails related to Mrs Clinton's campaign were leaked after alleged Russian hacking of Democratic accounts. What is 'conspiracy against the United States'? Papadopoulos, who secretly pleaded guilty weeks ago to lying to the FBI about those contacts, has been co-operating with investigators for months. The White House said on Tuesday the Trump campaign provided Mr Mueller's team with the Papadopoulos emails. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Tuesday: ""What Papadopoulos did was lie and that's on him, not on the campaign."" She also told reporters the Mueller inquiry was ""an investigation that frankly most Americans don't care too much about"". Ms Sanders added: ""We have confidence that it's going to come to a close in short time."" However, there is no sign that a conclusion to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry is imminent. This video can not be played White House: ""Today's announcement has nothing to do with the president"" Aaron Zelinsky, a prosecutor on Mr Mueller's team, told Papadopoulos' plea hearing this month: ""There's a large-scale, ongoing investigation of which this case is a small part."" In Moscow, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova poured scorn on the US in the wake of the indictments. She referred to ""photographs"" of Osama Bin Laden meeting White House officials, an apparent reference to a faked photo of Hillary Clinton shaking hands with the late al-Qaeda chief. Reality Check: Is Clinton photo with Bin Laden a fake? Ms Zakharova also pointed out that the Manafort indictment contained an error. The charge sheet wrongly stated that Julia Tymoshenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister, had served as president.

"This is my country, too","This year has seen a spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes, and a new survey shows women are suffering the most - so what's it like to be a black British Muslim woman at the moment? Not great, says Muna Ahmed. A man mimed shooting Linda with a rifle as he crossed the road. A man spent an entire train journey staring aggressively at Sonya, his face inches from hers. These are the kind of incidents Muslim women face every day. One young woman told me she has stopped listening to music so she can hear if someone is following her. Another has considered taking off her headscarf because she doesn't feel safe. Many women worry about being attacked or singled out because of their faith. Most have experienced verbal abuse.  They worry about being out after dark, and drive with their windows closed. ""The thought of being attacked crosses my mind now more than ever,"" says Natasha, a Muslim convert from Sheffield. ""I've always felt safe here in England, but post-Brexit, post the [terror] attacks, it's getting worse and worse."" The charity Tell MAMA will publish its latest report this week It wasn't always like this. Growing up in Sheffield, I was just like every other kid I played with - I may have been a tad cheekier, but nobody treated me differently because of my race or faith. At the weekends I would see people pouring out of the church and the mosque at either end of our street. I don't remember any hostility and I certainly didn't see any conflict between the faiths.  It was just normal. Everybody on my road knew each other. My friends Gemma and Tracy lived at the top of my street and we would walk to school together every day. When we got home we would eat fish-fingers and go straight out to play. Weekends were the best because we would get up early to watch cartoons and mum would make us pancakes. I enjoyedallthe religious holidays because there were always treats involved. At Easter we would get chocolate eggs. During Ramadan we tried to fast so we could take part in the evening feast, but Mum knew that we would be starving by 4pm so she would leave a plate of food out, which my friends and I would sneak into the house and eat. I loved the Christmas holidays because I would go and visit my grandmother and she would spoil me rotten. And on Eid I would get whatever I wanted. Thinking about it now, I had the best of both worlds. But 9/11 changed everything. I went from being a carefree teenager who had never been asked about my religion to having people constantly ask me questions about Islam - questions that I didn't have the answers to. I asked my parents about al-Qaeda, and where Islam stood on terrorism. Every day I would come home with a different question, because the Islam that had become ""the enemy"" was not the religion I knew. Ever since then, my country has not been a positive place to be a Muslim woman - and it seems to be getting worse. This video can not be played Listen: Muna Ahmed on what she feels it's like to a Muslim woman in Britain today Woman's Hour are asking:where's the best place to be a woman in Britain? See the results of theWoman's Hour poll The other day I saw a big crowd of people listening to a man with a megaphone shouting: ""We need to get these Muslims out of our country, we need to stand united against Islam."" A lot of people seemed to be agreeing with him. A few days after that I posted a video on Facebook about how the tabloids portray Muslims and the first person to comment was one of my childhood friends, a girl I used to play with all the time. She reeled off a list of radical preachers - as if they represent Islam. The conversation went on for a while, while I tried to educate her about Islam. But she was having none of it. At one point she said: ""You're welcome in this country but your religion isn't."" It got worse - the final thing she said to me was: ""Muna, you have blood on your hands too."" I felt physically sick when I saw those words on my screen. But Muslim women often experience abuse on social media these days. Sonya is a 23-year-old British Asian Muslim. We sat and talked about our experiences, laughing at the silly assumptions people have about Islam - for example, that she'll have to have an arranged marriage. But it was less funny when she told me about the death threats she had received on social media. ""I was quite popular on Twitter, I used to put up information about Islam and things like that. But all of a sudden dozens of people started commenting and saying all sorts of horrible things, like: 'Go back to your country,' 'We're going to come and kill you,' 'We will hunt you down,' 'You are disgusting to look at.'"" I don't have any children but whenever I'm back home in Sheffield I always take my two nieces, 10-year-old Aaliyah and seven-year-old Amanie, out for ice cream. As we approached the restaurant last time we heard police sirens - they had been called to the scene because a white man was yelling obscene Islamophobic language at two Muslim waitresses. I grabbed my two nieces and told them we'd come back later. As we walked off, Amanie looked at me and said: ""Why is that man saying bad things about Muslims?"" How do you tell a seven-year-old that some people in this country will treat you unfairly because of your race and religion? The first time I wore a headscarf to work, a woman who works in our building said I like looked like a North African kidnapper, in front of my entire team. I laughed it off, but I felt isolated and different from everyone in the room at that moment. It's like people don't know how to react to us any more - why are people so anxious around Muslim women? We're not creatures from outer space, we're just women, and some of us choose to cover our hair. Why is it such a big deal? Saadiya is a young British Asian woman who works in the City. Like me, the only time she wears a headscarf is when she is going to the mosque - but on those occasions she gets weird looks - looks I know all too well. ""When our family moved to this country they faced a lot of that, and it was a real struggle for them,"" Saadiya tells me. That was 30, 40, 50 years ago - we've come a long way since then, and yet it feels as if we are now going 10 steps back. Even though I have a thick Yorkshire accent, I'm often made to feel like I don't belong. One minute I'm fighting off racists and then a second later I'm back in the ring defending my faith. It feels like I'm constantly justifying my own existence. We are at risk of terror attacks like everybody else, but we also have to deal with the backlash.  After major attacks we have to endure intimidating comments and fear personal attacks, all because of the actions of a terrorist. Being held accountable for the actions of extremists is a massive burden. Some days I want to scream at the top of my voice that I have nothing to do with terrorism but it doesn't matter how loud I scream, I will always be tarred with the same brush. All we want is to feel safe in our own country and to be accepted for who we are - because we are British and this is our home.

Anthony Zurcher: The biggest news wasn't about Manafort,"On Monday morning Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates were charged with 12 counts of money laundering, undisclosed foreign lobbying, lying to government investigators, and various and sundry other serious-sounding offences. It turned out that wasn't the biggest news of the day. Indictments had been telegraphed since news reports on Friday evening mentioned they were signed, sealed and soon-to-be-delivered. Manafort's name was at the top of most lists of possible targets. It was the follow-up revelation from Robert Mueller's independent counsel team, however, that caught most of Washington by surprise. George Papadopoulos - hardly a household name - had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators about his contacts with Russian nationals and connected individuals while he was serving as a foreign policy with the Trump campaign. Where the Manafort indictment was somewhat expected and covered business dealings prior to his time as head of the Trump campaign, the Papadopoulos news sits at the heart of Mr Mueller's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia. Here are three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle. And lest we give the Manafort case short shrift, here are three more reasons why it could end up being even more explosive. Per details of the indictment and plea agreement, Papadopoulos has revealed that he was in contact with individuals - a London professor, a female Russian national, a Russian foreign affairs ministry official - either directly or tangentially connected to the Russian government. He was passing along details of conversations he had to senior members of the Trump presidential campaign team including, reportedly, Manafort. At one point, a ""campaign supervisor"", responding to one of  Papadopoulos's emails, replied ""good work"". This video can not be played White House: ""Today's announcement has nothing to do with the president"" While not evidence of collusion, this is clear indication that the Russian government was seeking back channels to the Trump campaign - and were finding at least some success. The White House has diminished Papadopoulos's role within the campaign, noting he was an unpaid adviser and that his efforts to set up a senior-level meeting between the Trump team and Russian officials were rebuffed. Papadopoulos did have a sit-down conference on 31 March 2016, with Mr Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team. Candidate Trump also mentioned Papadopoulos, whom he called an ""excellent guy"", as an adviser in a21 March interview,externalwith the Washington Post. Papadopoulos may have been on the campaign periphery, but he was far from a total unknown. On April 26, 2016, Papadopoulos's professor contact told him he had just returned from Moscow and learned from ""high-level Russian government officials"" that they possessed ""dirt"" on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"". It's unclear from the indictment whether Papadopoulos passed this bit of information on to his campaign contacts, although it notes he ""continued to correspond"" with them. What is clear, however, is that there is now evidence that individuals with Russian government connections on two separate occasions tried to let the Trump campaign know that they had information they thought was damaging to the Democratic candidate. Papadopoulos was the first. The second was when the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, heard a similar line from his publicist-friend Rob Goldstone in June 2016. Trump Jr responded by writing ""if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer"". Later that month, Trump Jr, Manafort and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met a group of Russian nationals. In July, embarrassing emails that were hacked from the Democratic National Committee were published by Wikileaks. In October, the contents of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's personal email inbox were released. It makes for an interesting timeline. If there's anyone in Trump's campaign circle with something to hide, they should be concerned that Papadopoulos was arrested back on 27 July. He struck a plea agreement with the Mueller team on 5 October. That was nearly four weeks ago and, according to the court documents, Papadopoulos has been co-operating with government investigators ever since. In fact, Mr Mueller told the relevant court he did not want the arrest made public because it would ""significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive co-operator"". So who has Papadopoulos spoken to since his arrest? And what sorts of topics could he have discussed? According to Dan Dale of the Toronto Star,external, a former prosecutor told him the term ""proactive co-operator"" can indicate someone who is willing to wear a wire tap. HotAir Blog goes through,externalan extended what-if scenario that envisions how Papadopoulos could go about surreptitiously gathering incriminating details from members of Trump's campaign inner circle. He could ask for their ""advice"" on how to disrupt Mr Mueller's investigation after disclosing that he had been arrested. ""Suddenly those people woke up this morning and realised they'd had conversations with Papadopoulos recently about how to throw Mueller off the trail and only now do they realise he's been in cahoots with Mueller for three months,"" the theory goes. ""Hoo boy."" Hoo boy, indeed. Donald Trump gives a thumbs up as his campaign manager Paul Manafort and daughter Ivanka look on during Trump's walk through at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland Even if, as Mr Trump writes ina tweet,external, Manafort's alleged illegal activities occurred ""years ago"", before he took a senior position in the Trump campaign, it still reflects poorly on the then-candidate's personnel choices. It was clear at the time Manafort came on board with Mr Trump that he had some questionable dealings in his past - including work for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians, Philippine ex-leader Ferdinand Marcos and a group with ties to Pakistani intelligence. Like many politicos in Mr Trump's orbit, Manafort was thrust into the campaign spotlight with little background vetting because more established hands wanted nothing to do with the upstart candidate's presidential efforts. The decision to run with Manafort, who was backed by Trump confidante Roger Stone, has come back to haunt his presidency. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair What is 'conspiracy against the United States'? Part of the case against Manafort - that he was operating as an undisclosed agent for a foreign government - echoes similar allegations made against another Trump associate, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Flynn resigned his White House post after revelations that he had lied about discussing US sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016. It was later disclosed that Flynn was also working for the Turkish government - something he didn't disclose on his relevant government forms. If Manafort can face charges for his Ukrainian involvement, Flynn may be in jeopardy as well. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe Slate's Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Sternalso theorise,externalthat Mr Mueller's case against Manafort for financial misdeeds relating to foreign income could serve as a blueprint for a future case against Mr Trump's own business organisation, which also brings in a fair amount of revenue from foreign sources. ""This is an indictment that should terrify Trump in that it shadows and hints at his own unlawful conduct,"" they write. Mr Trump wasn't named in the Manafort indictment, but the message may have been sent nevertheless. Then there's the million-dollar question. If Manafort and Gates are each staring at double-digit prison terms if convicted, might they follow Papadopoulos's lead and seek to strike a deal with Mr Mueller in exchange for leniency? Papadopoulos, of course, is a figure from the edges of the Trump campaign. Manafort, for months, was at the heart of it. Mr Mueller and his veteran team of prosecutors know how to build a case against a large enterprise. Start with the easy targets, then offer a deal. Work your way up from the bottom. Reward those who co-operate early, and throw the book at the hold-outs. Turn the screws, and have your targets constantly looking over their shoulders. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? Manafort and Gates may have nothing to bargain with - the White House insists that there is nothing there. If they do, however, this rollercoaster ride is only just beginning.

Violence victims suffered 'tech abuse',"Beth Ashley and Euleen Hope both experienced technological abuse by former partners Women's charity Refuge is warning about the rise of ""tech abuse"" - the use of technology to spy on or harass a partner. Many victims of domestic violence report being either being harassed via online messages or having their activity monitored via their phones. However, many do not report it to the police, the charity said. Euleen Hope was a technophobe who escaped the control of her tech-savvy abusive ex-partner after 10 years. He set up her email and social media accounts for her, which meant he had full access to them. He also replaced her flip-phone with an iPhone which he then set up to be mirrored on to the pair's iPad so he could monitor her calls and messages, and activated the phone's location-tracker saying it would help her to get the bus. ""You wouldn't think he was doing anything bad, he showed you what he was doing,"" she said. ""I didn't realise it was going to be part of my entrapment."" When she noticed things such as the iPad ringing when her phone rang, her ex told her he was just testing a new app. Euleen Hope's ex-partner set up cameras in the couple's house He also installed cameras around the house under the guise of security. ""My twin sister came round one day to visit. Normally if my friends or family came over he would sit in the room with us,"" she recalled. ""This time he said he would leave us to catch up and said he would use his computer in the kitchen upstairs. ""I moved behind the camera and told my sister to keep talking, I went up the stairs and saw him listening to what he thought was our conversation."" Ms Hope's former partner was also physically and emotionally abusive and eventually served a prison sentence for assault and GBH. Refuge is teaming up with Google to train its staff to better support victims who contact it as part of a new programme. ""Domestic violence is the biggest issue which impacts on the police,"" said Dame Vera Baird, police and crime commissioner for Northumbria, speaking at the project launch. ""Every 30 seconds there is a domestic violence call. Two years ago, it was every minute. ""Northumbria's police force gets 32,000 calls a year and that's maybe a fifth or a quarter of what is actually going on."" Dame Vera said the Northumbria Police force receives 32,000 domestic violence calls per year A 2016 survey by Comic Relief found that four out of five women who experienced abuse said their partner monitored their activity. Twenty-year-old blogger Beth Ashley said a former boyfriend had no interest in tech until she tried to end their relationship because he was controlling and sexually abusive. ""When I got with him he didn't even have a phone,"" she said. ""I thought he was a massive technophobe until we broke up. Suddenly he started all these social media accounts and used them as a harassment tool."" Beth Ashley said her work as a blogger meant she could not delete her online presence to hide from her ex-boyfriend She says he also sent her a suicide note via Facebook Messenger along with graphic images of self-harm, which she later discovered he had found online. ""I went round the next day and he was just sitting there on his Xbox,"" she said. She says he would regularly turn up where she worked and she would end her shift to find 50 messages from him on her phone. Ms Ashley was very active on social media because of her work as a blogger and online writer. ""There were times when I wanted to delete the blog, the magazines,"" she said. ""I have these random moments of wanting to be invisible. Considering my job, that would be awful."" Ms Ashley says that she had to block old friends on social media in case one of them accidentally gave him information about her activities. After reporting him to the police, the online harassment stopped, she said. ""But the paranoia stayed for a long time,"" she added. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said the charity had seen a case where a man had hacked the CCTV at the pub where his wife worked so he could monitor her, and another who put a tracker on his partner's car, moved it and then accused her of losing it. ""She thought she was losing her mind,"" she said. ""Technological abuse is part of a broader pattern of domestic violence. ""This project was born out of our clients' experiences of technology-related abuse, and we will continue to make sure their needs and experiences shape our work in the years ahead.""

Channel 4's Bake Off risk has paid off,"The new line-up has wide appeal and good chemistry Many fans feared that The Great British Bake Off might spoil when it went to Channel 4. So the success of this series must taste particularly sweet. There were some funny moments at Jay Hunt and David Abraham's leaving party at Channel 4 a few weeks ago. The chief creative officer and chief executive had gathered journalists, colleagues, friends and programme makers for a boozy farewell. Three members of boy band Blue turned up and sang. A video of tributes and thank yous featuring famous people associated with Channel 4 was played, to ringing applause. Then the stars of Bake Off turned up. How the Bake Off final unfolded Meet the Great British Bake Off finalists Bake Off is ratings hit for Channel 4 Paul Hollywood wasn't there, but Prue Leith, Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding were. Leith said she'd never been paid so much to eat cake. Everything Toksvig said was funny. Then Fielding produced the most memorable line of the evening, when he addressed the crowd and said (I paraphrase slightly): ""Be honest, you thought we were gonna flop! Didn't you?!"" Everyone laughed, because everyone knew he was right. Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding have formed an unlikely double act The decision by Channel 4 to bid for Bake Off was widely interpreted in the industry as reckless, naive, hubristic - or some combination of all three. Dozens of industry people I spoke to used the same line - without the ""talent"" (Sue Perkins, Mel Giedroyc and Mary Berry all declined to move across), Channel 4 had basically just paid for a tent. This was the conventional thinking. Conventional thinking has a habit of being wrong. It also has a seductive appeal. It is absolutely true that Channel 4 was taking a huge punt in buying the show without three quarters of its stars. That is why the reward they are now getting must taste particularly good. The numbers are, to those in Horseferry Road, where Channel 4 is still headquartered, the stuff of dreams. TV viewing figures now come in at least two groups - mainly the overnights and consolidated. In overnights, the show is getting around six million viewers. In terms of consolidated reach - the number of people who see a particular episode over a seven-day period - this rises to 8.9 million. Stacey was eliminated in the semi-final True, this is down from the 13 million the show reached on BBC One. But bearing in mind that BBC One generally gets the biggest audiences in the land, Channel 4 will be chuffed. And especially because in the prized 16-34 demographic (those who apparently are running away from conventional TV), they are scoring 2.5 million viewers - or a whopping 54% of market share. Fielding, Toksvig, Leith and Hollywood are earning their meringues - and Channel 4 appears to agree as all four are back for next year's series. As digital giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Netflix move into television, conventional broadcasters like Channel 4 are having to fight much, much harder for eyeballs and advertising revenue. That means they rely ever more heavily on superstar shows such as Bake Off, which bring in the revenues to fund other expensive programming that - in Channel 4 and the BBC's case - meets a public service remit. The irony, of course, is that Jay Hunt and David Abraham are off to new ventures just as Bake Off brings in the cash. The latter is probably going to set up his own company, but remains tight-lipped. For Hunt, a former BBC and Channel 5 executive who missed out on the top job at Channel 4, and is now moving to Apple, this is in effect a parting gift to her colleagues. Though Abraham was her superior, it was Hunt who was most closely associated with the Bake Off transfer, and who made the ultimate decision on the new line-up. That line-up was carefully selected to combine an appeal to various demographics - Fielding brings a following from his Never Mind the Buzzcocks days; Toksvig is a Radio 4 giant; Leith has real pedigree in the world of food - with on-screen chemistry, which is undoubtedly there. Their current success may not last, but it is worth bearing in mind that most shows take time to build an audience in a new place, as critics of former Fox anchor Megyn Kelly's new show on NBC should remember. And it is in the nature of Bake Off, which is a competition, that as it builds towards a thrilling finale, its ratings could rise. So the best may be yet to come. I suspect that when she met Apple, Hunt will have pointed to the success of Bake Off as an indication of her eye for talent and preparedness to take creative risks that are later vindicated. The show was never going to achieve the same audience it did on BBC One. For now, it looks a canny investment. But when the show is put out to tender again in a couple of years, might Channel 4 find itself bidding against Apple?

Do NHS theatres have 'wasted time'?,"The BBC story about wasted time in operating theatres has generated a lively debate. We reported that analysis by the regulator NHS Improvement showed there could have been 280,000 more non-emergency operations, at 100 English hospital trusts, last year. There were said to be 140 minutes of unused time per operating list. So, is it simply a case of improving efficiency, or are there wider problems that need to be addressed across the NHS? Are the solutions to be found in the way operating theatres are managed or are theatre staff having to stand idle because of logjams elsewhere in the system? How operating theatres are wasting two hours a day  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search It is a highly topical debate because demands for more money for the NHS are growing ahead of the Budget. The Treasury, for its part, will want to be assured that the service is continuing to improve efficiency and make the best use of existing resources. The most obvious factor highlighted in response to our story was the acute shortage of beds in most hospitals. Medically fit patients are often unable to leave because of delays in arranging social care in the community. That leaves fewer beds for incoming patients needing planned surgery. All this can leave frustrated surgeons and their colleagues unable to operate. Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, put it thus: ""There's this constant backlog all the way through - so the new patient cannot get into hospital because the last patient is still in the intensive care unit  and as yet cannot get back to the ward because the ward patient cannot go home."" NHS Improvement's analysis allowed for 5% of time on an operating list to be lost because of last-minute cancellations. It also excluded any periods of unused time of less than 60 minutes as no procedure could be carried out in that time. So, in effect, it tried to take account of the likelihood that lists may be disrupted each day because of issues such as bed shortages. Some hospitals will argue these assumptions underestimate the problem. A consultant anaesthetist, Mark Alexander Price, made the point that operations, and the process before patients were taken to theatres, took longer than they used to - so it was harder to embark on them with finite time slots. Patients are older and and, thanks to medical advances, are being considered suitable for surgery that would not have happened 20 years ago. Obese patients need longer for the anaesthetic process and are more vulnerable to complications during surgery. On the other hand, one observer recalled the observations of the business leader Sir Gerry Robinson in his BBC TV series on the NHS a decade ago. Sir Gerry Robinson: 'NHS plot? I wish there was',external Sir Gerry Robinson: NHS 'not a business',external Sir Gerry told the Telegraph in January 2007: ""The biggest single surprise for me was seeing how under-utilised the operating theatres were. ""I thought they'd be packed - and that this was the reason there was a problem with waiting lists. But it really wasn't like that. ""The theatres simply weren't being managed in any way that I would recognise as being appropriate for an important and expensive resource."" The NHS in England has embarked on two major national efficiency programmes since then. As reported, Croydon University Hospital has reduced last-minute cancellations of operations by better handling of pre-surgery assessments. Lists are carefully managed to try to iron out late starts and early finishes. The number of cases dealt with each year has increased by 1,200. The new thinking was driven by surgeons and other clinical staff, including a matron. PA Consulting has worked with Hillingdon Hospital to increase theatre utilisation from 75% to 82%, which is an additional 20 hours per week operating capacity. The aim is to get to 90%. Some have accused the  BBC of running down the NHS by implying it could be more efficient and that resources could be better deployed. Highlighting Croydon's achievements, however, suggests that dedicated NHS staff  are driving improvements with the aim of improving the levels of care they can offer. Unused operating theatre time does nothing to help doctors and nurses achieve their goal of helping more patients.

"What makes a whisky cask worth Â£500,000?","Just how much would you pay for a cask of rare Scotch whisky? For some, it seems, the sky is the limit when it comes to liquid gold. Earlier this month, an anonymous buyer in Hong Kongpaid an auction-record Â£285,000,externalfor a sherry cask filled with a 30-year-old Macallan single malt. Its contents, if emptied, would work out at a neat Â£1,000 per 70cl bottle. Others have paid even more for a cask of the hard stuff, with one Scotch whisky brokerage reporting a sale in excess of Â£500,000. Some industry experts believe there are Â£1m casks out there waiting to be found. A 30-year-old Macallan single malt sherry cask was sold recently at auction for Â£285,000 So why are people willing to spend such eye-watering amounts of money on the spirit? The answer isn't straightforward. For some, casks are merely an investment. For others, such as connoisseurs and collectors, there's more emphasis on the experience - tasting a spirit that has been ageing in oak casks for decades. But rarity is also highly prized. That may sound strange when an estimated three billion litres of the spirit is busy maturing in storage - enough to fill 1,200 Olympic-sized swimming pools. But in reality much of it is relatively new - bearing in mind that it requires three years of maturation before a spirit can legally take on the name Scotch. Those operating at the top end of the market - the really rare stuff - say there is no shortage of interest from potential buyers. Analyst and broker Rare Whisky 101 (RW101) has noted increased demand for ""quality casks"" from connoisseurs, collectors and investors. The Dunfermline-based firm, co-founded in 2014 by Andy Simpson and David Robertson, says its past deals with brands such as Ardbeg, Laphroaig, Macallan and Springbank have achieved an average cask price of more than Â£130,000. RW101 was co-founded by Andy Simpson (left) and David Robertson Mr Simpson says buyers are drawn by ""rarity and uniqueness"". He explains: ""The vast majority of distillers will not part with aged stock as it's too important for them to maintain the brand. ""If they do allow cask sales, as with Diageo's Casks of Distinction programme, these are, again, exceptionally rare. ""It's also about the unique factor of cask ownership - no two casks are the same - so they're truly unique. ""We've tried many concurrently numbered casks, distilled on the same day, filled into (theoretically) identical casks and the samples are hugely different."" Source: Scotch Whisky Association But Mr Simpson also makes the point that while older casks can bring greater rewards - they also bring bigger risks. He explains: ""With older casks, there's a risk they drop to below 40% ABV (alcohol by volume), the legal minimum for spirit to be called Scotch. ""If that happens then the cask becomes worth a fraction of its former price. ""A couple of years ago we got excited by a 49-year-old sample coming through. On paper it should have been the oldest ever expression from the distillery of origin. ""When the sample arrived it was like Castrol GTX - thick, viscous, green gloop. And with an ABV of just 28%, it was worthless."" He adds: ""Casks do also evaporate, so the longer it's left, the fewer bottles will be yielded upon bottling. ""The first rule of buying Scotch as an investment is to make sure it's exemplary quality. ""One person's investment today could be - and frequently is - another's favourite drinks cupboard dram tomorrow."" Although rare casks are highly prized by collectors, connoisseurs and investors alike, the marketplace for people with less deep pockets also appears to be thriving. One whisky specialist has been tapping into the market by appealing to investors who don't feel the need to touch, smell or even taste the product. Whisky Invest Direct launched an online trading platform for Scotch two years ago. Describing itself as a ""stock exchange for whisky"", the company allows private investors to buy and sell Scotch whiskies early in their maturation process. The firm now has 4,500 whisky accounts with more than Â£12m invested in 3.5 million litres of spirit. Chief executive Rupert Patrick, a former director of whisky giant Diageo, says: ""Buying maturing stocks of whisky on our platform has allowed investors to enjoy net returns of over 7% per year since we launched two years ago. ""Two of the key benefits that we offer investors are that we give them access to an un-inflated tangible asset, and our market place is very liquid - a 24/7 trading exchange."" Strathearn Distillery founder Tony Reeman-Clark says customers ""want something that is unique"" Although the big whisky firms hold the lion's share of the 20 million or so casks currently stored around Scotland, smaller craft distilleries are now eyeing what they see as a gap in the market. They include Perth-based Strathearn Distillery, which prides itself as being ""probably Scotland's smallest distillery"" with a capacity of just 10,000 litres. Founder and owner Tony Reeman-Clark argues that small is beautiful when it comes to meeting customers' tastes. He says: ""We have found that people want a strong provenance, something that is unique, and there is no better way to do that than buy your own cask of whisky from a craft distillery. ""If you buy a hogshead cask, you will end up with 300 bottles and they are all the same. ""But because we are a small distillery, we generally offer casks with only 40 or 50 litres of whisky in them. ""We have had customers buying two or three of them at one go - casks with different finishes, such as sherry or brandy, so they can experience different tastes."" Mr Reeman-Clark says the firm has attracted customers from as far as Germany, Sweden and the Far East. He adds: ""People buy our casks for a wide range of reasons - for example, for their children, for investment purposes and even for weddings. ""We had a group of oil workers here recently who refilled their cask with peated spirit after finishing the first batch. ""They know they are welcome back anytime to taste the spirit so they have a good idea of what it will be like when they are ready to bottle it.""

Reality Check: When 126m isn't 126m on Facebook,"It sounds like a lot of people. As many as 126 million Americans may have seen content uploaded to Facebook by Russia-based operatives since 2015. That's nearly half of the 270 million Americans who are old enough to be allowed a Facebook profile. The figure comes from the social network itself, which along with Google and Twitter, is preparing for a Senate hearing where it will explain Russia's impact on the popular sites. But how many people have actually seen those posts? That very big number, 126 million, is the ""reach"" of some 80,000 posts published between June 2015 and August 2017. Facebook defines a post's ""reach"",externalas those people who may have come across the content (text story/video/image/ad) in their News Feed. A post counts as reaching someone when it's shown in their News Feed. So this figure takes no account of the number of people who may or may not have stopped to actually read the post. Figures are for the first 365 days after a post was created and include people viewing the post on desktop and mobile. The reach may be organic or paid. Organic reach is the total number of unique people who were shown your post through unpaid distribution. Paid reach is the total number of unique people who were shown your post as a result of ads. 126 million users were ""reached"" by the posts - but how many actually saw them? Crucially, therefore, when Facebook says that about 80,000 posts ""reached"" 126 million people in the US over two years, we don't know how many of those people actually stopped to read the content. As a result, we don't know how many of these thousands of posts had any impact at all on swaying US voters ahead of the 2016 election. Clearly, a mass targeting of posts can have a subliminal impact on people but it's hard to evaluate with any certainty based on the data we've seen so far. Facebook goes on to explain that the number of Americans who saw those posts directly is 29 million - a much smaller number. It is unclear what Facebook means by ""seen directly"". The first thing to say is that we don't know what relationship those 29 million users had to these Russian-sponsored posts. Does it mean the content was shared with them by a friend or relative? Does it mean they engaged with it, that is, reacted to it, commented on it, shared it? Secondly - we don't actually know whether each of those 29 million users represents an individual American. Some might be fake profiles. Some individuals set up multiple profiles (one for work, one for play). And of course, some may belong to children under the voting age - another way in which they would fail to influence an election. Some Facebook users were fooled by this fake story which wrongly claimed Denzel Washington backed Donald Trump for president Third - it's worth putting this in context. Facebook says those 80,000 posts were ""seen directly"" by 29 million people over a two-year period. In January 2017, there were estimated to be more than 214 million active monthly Facebook users in the US alone. An active monthly user is someone who has logged in over the last 30 days. Given how much stuff those 214 million active Facebook users post and see, those 80,000 posts are likely to be a drop in the ocean.

Calls for change in Westminster culture,"In the last few days there has been a frenzy in Westminster about a dodgy dossier, a list, all manner of claims about ministers' and MPs' bad behaviour. (For what it's worth, the list which we have seen contains both a mixture of unsavoury allegations, reports of well-known relationships, and some claims that are furiously denied.  There is just no way of knowing frankly, how much of it is true). But until now, there hasn't been anyone willing to come forward to speak candidly about their own experiences to illustrate the culture in some corners of politics that is the root of the problem. That might just have changed. Bex Bailey, a well-known and well-respected Labour activist, has had the courage to tell her story, to waive her anonymity as an alleged rape victim. What stands out from her claims is sadly not the suggestion that a teenage political activist was the target of an older senior party member. Activist 'warned' about pursuing rape claim But that when she tried to seek help and advice, she says she was told that it would be better for her to keep quiet, and not risk the damage of making such an allegation. She told the BBC, ""It took me a while to summon up the courage to tell anyone in the party. But when I did, I told a senior member of staff who told me - or it was suggested to me that I not report it. I was told that if I did it might damage me and that might be their genuine viewâ¦ in which case that shows that we have a serious problem in politics with this issue."" We have no way of independently verifying her story. But it identifies precisely the problem heard time and time again at Westminster. Young men and women, who care about their political parties and quite understandably also their own careers, often fear the consequences of making a complaint, or being seen as a troublemaker. Loyalty is a precious commodity in Westminster, but it has also for many been a trap, or a tool that's used against them. It is one of the powerful elements of culture here that has allowed some cases of harassment, bullying or sexual abuse to go unreported. That's also why it has been so hard to ascertain accurately how widespread the problem truly is. For Ms Bailey, who has pressed the Labour Party for years to improve its processes, to make it possible for people to report abuse independently, it is however now time to speak up. Acknowledging how hard it may have been for others she says: ""You're just as brave if you don't speak out. And I know that there are a lot of women who will be struggling with all of this that's going on at the moment. But for me it was the right thing to do."" The question that will be asked across Westminster tonight is whether others are brave enough to follow.

Leith accidentally reveals Bake Off winner,"Prue Leith joined the Bake Off line-up when the show moved to Channel 4 Great British Bake Off judge Prue Leith has accidentally revealed the show's winner, hours before the finale is due to air. She announced the name of a winner in a tweet, after saying how ""emotional"" judging the final had been. The tweet was hastily deleted, but not before many people had noticed and remarked upon the gaffe. Leith has expressed regret for her mistake, saying she was ""mortified"" by the error. Don't worry - there are no spoilers in this article. Meet the Great British Bake Off finalists Channel 4's Bake Off risk has paid off Kate, Steven and Sophie made it to this year's final In a follow-up tweet, the writer and broadcaster - who is currently in Bhutan - said she was ""so sorry to the fans of the show"". She earlier said she had been confused by the time difference between the Asian country and the UK, thinking the final had already aired. ""The time difference is massive,"" she told the Press Association. ""I thought that they got it six hours ago."" Bhutan is six hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. In her now-deleted tweet, Leith said she ""wanted [all three finalists] to win"" before saying ""bravo"" to one of them. A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: ""Prue has just tweeted an apology to fans. We have no further comment."" Leith's mistake has prompted a range of responses on social media, some expressing dismay and others poking fun. The climax to this year's series will be shown at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday on Channel 4. The end of the programme will see either Steven Carter-Bailey, Sophie Faldo or Kate Lyon crowned the winner. The series was the first to air on Channel 4 after the programme's high-profile switch from BBC One. Leith replaced veteran chef Mary Berry on the show after the latter opted to remain with the BBC. Leith judges the show alongside Paul Hollywood (second from left) The revamped line-up also saw Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig take over as co-hosts from Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. Judge Paul Hollywood was the only original member of the presenting team on the show, which has been a ratings success for its new host broadcaster. Leith is not the only TV personality to have revealed something she shouldn't have this month.

New York attacker kills at least six,"This video can not be played New York terror attack: How the events unfolded At least eight people have been killed and 11 seriously hurt in New York after the driver of a truck mowed down people on a cycle path in Lower Manhattan. A 29-year-old man who emerged from the white pick-up truck was shot by a police officer and arrested. Officials later said it was a terror attack. Media named him as Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant who came to the US in 2010. A note was found in the truck that referred to so-called Islamic State, a law enforcement source told CBS News. US media identified the suspect as Sayfullo Saipov seen in this 2016 photo The suspect - who had apparently settled in Florida - was taken to hospital. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was a ""cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians"". He added: ""We know that this action was intended to break our spirit. But we also know that New Yorkers are strong, New Yorkers are resilient and our spirit will never be moved by an act of violence and an act meant to intimidate us.""

Mangled bicycles littered the scene of the attack, which occurred as much of the city was celebrating Halloween. One witness, identified as Eugene, told ABC Channel 7 that he saw the white pick-up truck driving fast down the cycle path alongside the West Side Highway, near Stuyvesant High School, at full speed and hitting a number of people. He also reported hearing about nine or 10 shots. Another witness, who gave his name as Frank, told local TV network NY1 that he had seen a man running around an intersection and heard five to six gunshots. ""I saw he had something in his hand, but I couldn't tell what it was. But they said that it was a gun... ""When the cops shot him, everybody started running away and it got a little bit crazy right there. So when I tried to look again, the guy was already down."" President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident, the White House said. In separate tweets, he said: ""In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!"" ""We must not allow ISIS [Islamic State] to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!"" This video can not be played Emergency services on the scene of the attack By Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York At the moment the New York authorities are saying that it was a lone wolf, that the attack wasn't part of a wider conspiracy or plot. But this is an active crime scene at the moment and they are still trying to piece together precisely what happened. The attack happened on Halloween, one of the most festive days in the New York calendar. The pavements were crowded with kids in costumes and there are still children trick-or-treating just yards away - it's a bizarre scene. But it shows how New York absorbs this kind of thing. We are just yards from Ground Zero, a site which reminds all New Yorkers of that awful day back in 2001. It didn't take police long to confirm that the city had once again been the target of terror.

Vegas shooting survivors die in car crash,"Dennis and Lorraine Carver A husband and wife from California who survived this month's massacre at a concert in Las Vegas have died together near their home in a fiery car crash. Dennis and Lorraine Carver's vehicle careered off the road on 16 October and hit a brick wall, exploding into flames, said California Highway Patrol. The crash came less than two weeks after they ran from a hail of bullets in America's worst mass shooting. The couple were dancing at a concert when shots rang out on 1 October. Mr Carver jumped on top of his wife to shield her from the bullets, the couple's adult daughter said, as a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest music festival, killing 59 people and wounding nearly 500.

""The last two weeks of their lives were really just spent living in the moment,"" said Brooke Carver. ""After the shooting, they heard from all of the people they cared about most. They were so happy."" Three days after the shooting, Mr Carver bought roses for his wife to cheer her up. ""He just wanted to give my mom a reason to smile after the shooting,"" said Brooke Carver.

Towie star ex's acid text 'about shampoo',"Arthur Collins told the court he hid his special shampoo so his girlfriend did not find out about his two hair transplants The ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann has told a court texts he sent about ""acid"" referred to hair-thickening shampoo. Arthur Collins, 25, who is accused of an acid attack in a crowded nightclub, said he kept the shampoo in his car to hide his hair loss from his girlfriend. Wood Green Crown Court heard Mr Collins has undergone two hair transplants. He admits throwing a substance in the Mangle E8 nightclub in Dalston, east London, but denies knowing it was acid. More than a dozen people were injured in the early hours of 17 April after a row broke out between Mr Collins and another group of men. A week before the attack, Mr Collins sent a text to his sister saying: ""Tell mum to mind that little hand wash in my car acid"". He told jurors the message referred to the shampoo, which contained amino acid and coconut oil, and he was worried about his nieces finding and ""biting it"". Mr Collins is the father of The Only Way is Essex star Ferne McCann's unborn child Mr Collins said he kept it in his car to hide it from Ms McCann as ""she would have asked me why I was using a shampoo like that"". George Carter-Stephenson QC, defending Mr Collins, asked: ""How good are you at misleading her? Can she tell when you are lying to her?"" ""Yes she can,"" he replied. Jurors were also shown other products he had tried including Regain and Professional-C Serum. Mr Collins' sister Chinade Rowe told the court she was aware of her brother's hair loss and had helped massage his special shampoo, which she referred to as ""acid"", into his scalp. When asked by prosecutor Luke Ponte if she had come to court to lie for her brother, she replied: ""Absolutely not"". Mr Ponte asked: ""Why did you have to massage the shampoo into his head? Why was he unable to do that himself?"" ""Because I had better massage techniques and I could do it better for him,"" she said. ""If you try and massage your head yourself it's not the same as someone doing it for you."" Mr Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, denies five counts of grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, and nine counts of actual bodily harm (ABH) against 14 people. Co-accused Andre Phoenix, of Clyde Road, Tottenham, north London, denies four counts of GBH and two counts of ABH. The trial continues.

Sean Edgett, acting general counsel for Twitter, says on Russian disinformation in the 2016 election: ""We are troubled by reports that the power of Twitter was misused by a foreign actor for the purpose of influencing the US presidential election and undermining public faith in the democratic process. The abuse of our platform to attempt state sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us, and one that we are determined to meet..."" ""At the time of the 2016 election, we observed instances and acted on them of automated and malicious activity. As we learned more about the scope of the broader problem, we resolved to strengthen out systems."" In aggregate these ads and posts were ""a very small fraction of the overall content on Facebook, but any amount is too much"", says Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel. So Facebook is hiring more ad reviewers, doubling engineering security efforts, tightening ad content restrictions, increasing ad transparency, requiring more information from political ad buyers, and developing artificial intelligence to help locate ""banned content and bad actors"", Mr Stretch adds. Facebook's general counsel Mr Stretch continues: ""Our investigation, which continues to this day, we have found that foreign actors used fake accounts to place ads on Facebook and Instagram that reached millions of Americans over a two year period, and that those ads were used to promote pages, which in turn posted more content. People shared these posts, spreading them still further. Many of these ads and posts are inflammatory. Some are downright offensive, and much of it will be particularly painful to communities that engaged with this content believing it to authentic."" Some strong stuff also from Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook, on Russia's interference in the US presidential election: ""When it comes to the 2016 election, I want to be clear - we take what happened on Facebook very seriously. The foreign interference we saw is reprehensible. That foreign actors hiding behind fake accounts abused our platform and other internet services to try and sow divisions and dischord, and to try to undermine the election is directly contrary to our values and goes against everything Facebook stands for."" Strong stuff from the senators on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary who areinterviewing representatives,externalfrom tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google on Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections. Republican senator Lindsay Graham says: ""To those who wish to undermine the American way of life, they found portals into our society that are intermingled with everyday life, and the challenge of this hearing, this focus is, how do we keep the good, and deal with the bad?"" Democrat senator Sheldon Whitehouse says: ""Our adversaries have access to tools well beying traditional political advertising. They are using our own social networks, or friendships, our families, our biases and view points against us to ahcieve their political ends.""

Parachute husband 'worse off if wife dead',"Victoria Cilliers arrived at Winchester Crown Court on Wednesday morning An Army instructor accused of trying to murder his wife would have been worse off if she had died, a court has heard. Victoria Cilliers, 40, told jurors her husband Emile, 37, was ""financially incontinent"" and had issues with debt. But wills and a post-nuptial agreement would not benefit Mr Cilliers if his wife died, Winchester Crown Court heard. He denies attempting to murder Mrs Cilliers, who suffered a near-fatal fall when her parachute failed. She suffered multiple injuries when she plummeted 4,000ft at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire in 2015. Under cross-examination, ex-Army officer Mrs Cilliers said the couple had made the post-nuptial agreement in 2014. It set out their assets and how they would be divided if the pair was to divorce. Mrs Cilliers had previously told the court she knew her husband was in financial difficulty as he was ""bad with money"". She agreed with the defence's suggestion that her husband had not challenged the drafting of the agreement or sought to get his name on the mortgage deed. Mrs Cilliers also said she ""wrongly assumed"" that the couple's life insurance payout would go to her husband. She told the court: ""I cannot recall a conversation with my solicitor, I think because I thought it went to Emile I left the house to the children (in the will) knowing he would get the life insurance money."" Elizabeth Marsh QC, defending, said the couple's policy ""makes it plain"" payment would not necessarily have gone to a spouse. She asked: ""Does it come to this, putting the insurance money aside, Emile would have been better off with you alive than you dead, wouldn't he?"" Mrs Cilliers replied: ""Yes."" Ms Marsh also asked Mrs Ciliers about reported suicidal comments she had made after becoming suspicious of her husband's affair. When asked how she was feeling on the day of the jump, Mrs Cilliers said she was ""very emotional, upset. Not suicidal"". She then denied doing anything to tamper with her parachute herself. Recalling the fall, Mrs Cilliers remembered pulling the parachute cord and knowing ""immediately"" that something was not right. She began spinning rapidly, and remembered opening her eyes in the field before passing out and coming round in the air ambulance. The prosecution claims Emile Cilliers wanted to kill his wife and start a new life with his lover Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers, a sergeant with the Aldershot-based Royal Army Physical Training Corps, twisted the lines of his wife's main parachute and sabotaged a reserve chute the day before her jump. Former Army physiotherapist Mrs Cilliers broke her vertebrae, ribs and pelvis in the fall. Mr Cilliers also denies a second attempted murder charge and a third charge of tampering with a gas fitting at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on 30 March 2015. The trial continues.

Burglar guilty of Navy officer murder,"Ryan Gibbons (left) was convicted of murder and Raymond Davies was found guilty of manslaughter A burglar who twice ran over an ex-Royal Navy officer with his own car has been convicted of murder. Ryan Gibbons, 29, admitted breaking into Mike Samwell's home in Chorlton, Manchester on 23 April and stealing his Audi S3 sports car but denied deliberately driving over him. A jury at Manchester Crown Court took four hours to find Gibbons guilty of the 35-year-old's murder. Gibbons, of Steven Court, Chorlton, will be sentenced on Wednesday. Former submarine officer Mike Samwell died in hospital from his injuries on 23 April The court heard Mr Samwell, a nuclear engineer, and his wife Jessica woke to the sound of burglars breaking into their home on Cranbourne Road on 23 April. Mr Samwell ran downstairs to confront Gibbons as he was driving off, shouting ""Get out of the car"" but was run over. His wife followed him out of the house and found her husband on his back with tyre marks on his chest and ""blood coming out of his head"". The jury had been told Gibbons reversed over Mr Samwell and then drove back over him. Gibbons claimed he had not seen the former officer before he ran over him although he said he was aware ""something had gone under the wheels"". The stolen car was later found dumped He told the court he fled the scene and dumped the car before going home to smoke cannabis. He then went to the pub with his brother ""to act normal"". In a statement, Mr Samwell's family said they can now put the brutality of his death to one side and focus on his life. They said he was ""loved by everyone who met him"" and his outlook on life was ""always positive"". ""To us he was, and forever will be, our hero,"" they added. Raymond Davies, 21, of Castlefield Walk, Manchester, who collected Gibbons after he crashed and dumped the Audi was found guilty of manslaughter. Gibbons' girlfriend Stacey Hughes, 28, of Steven Court, Chorlton, was cleared of assisting an offender by giving a false name while the couple stayed in a hotel the night after the murder. Mike was one of those rare people who was loved by everyone who met him. He saw the potential in people and would go above and beyond to help them to realise it. His outlook on life was always positive, even in the face of hardship and adversity he would have a smile and an awful joke ready to lighten the situation. One of the most important and inspiring things about Mike was the passion and drive that he poured into absolutely everything he did and everyone he loved; he did so with what appeared to be boundless energy and enthusiasm. There isn't enough time and definitely not enough words to express how proud we are of Mike. We can't even begin to explain how much our Mike will be missed. To us he was, and forever will be, our hero.

Special Emmy award for Spacey withdrawn,"Kevin Spacey at the British Academy Britannia Awards earlier this year Kevin Spacey has been dropped as the recipient of a special Emmy award he was due to receive next month. The International TV Academy said in a statement that it was withdrawing the International Emmy Founders Award ""in light of recent events"". It comes after actorAnthony Rapp accused Spacey of making a sexual advance30 years ago. Responding to the allegations, Spacey said he was ""beyond horrified"" but did not remember the encounter. The International Emmy Founders Award, which was due to be presented to Spacey in a ceremony on 20 November, is a special award reserved for those ""whose creative accomplishments have contributed in some way to the quality of global television production"". Previous winners include film director Steven Spielberg, Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes and X Factor's Simon Cowell. Why are people angry about Kevin Spacey coming out? Kevin Spacey responds to sexual abuse claim Netflix has said it is ending House of Cards The International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which awards International Emmys, honours programmes that have had their initial broadcast outside of the US. It has a separate awards ceremony to the main Emmys, traditionally held each January. Netflix has also announced it will end its flagship TV seriesHouse of Cards, in which Kevin Spacey stars as ruthless politician Francis Underwood. Filming is currently under way on the sixth series of the political drama but Netflix confirmed it would be the last. According to a spokeswoman, the decision had been made months ago but in a statement Netflix said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the allegations made against Spacey. Variety magazine,externalis reporting that the streaming giant is instead exploring a House of Cards spin-off - with one possibility revolving around the character Doug Stamper, who plays Francis Underwood's chief of staff. Kevin Spacey was artistic director at the Old Vic from 2004 to 2015 Spacey has been criticisedfor his statement responding to allegations made by Rapp, who said Spacey attempted to seduce him after a party in 1986, when he was 14 years old. Rapp said Spacey had laid down on top of him, adding in an interview with BuzzFeed News: ""I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually."" Spacey said if he had behaved in the way Rapp describes then he owes him ""the sincerest apology"" and that he was ""sorry for the feelings [Rapp] describes having carried with him all these years"". He went on to publicly announce he was gay. Among the latest to criticise the actor's decision to come out are US film star Zachary Quinto and British film and theatre director Sean Mathias. Star Trek actor Zachary Quinto called Spacey's timing ""a calculated manipulation to deflect attention from the very serious accusation"" of assault. Allow Twitter content?

Theatre and film director Sean Mathias told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that coming out should be something to ""celebrate"". ""Kevin Spacey coming out is very untimely,"" he said. ""I don't think coming out when he's been accused of something else is the right thing to do. Because you're gay doesn't mean you want to sleep with children and in some people's minds this will be heightened."" The director of play No Man's Land went on to claim he too had been the victim of sexual harassment, saying he had been ""coerced"" into a sexual act by a ""powerful"" man in the industry in the early days of his career. The Old Vic has also responded to the allegation made against Spacey, who was the artistic director there from 2003 to 2015. A spokeswoman for the London theatre said: ""During Kevin Spacey's tenure as artistic director no complaints were made against him. No complaints have been made since he left."" In a later statement,external, its management said they were ""deeply dismayed"" by the allegations and that ""inappropriate behaviour by anyone working at The Old Vic [was] completely unacceptable."" Meanwhile Kim Richards, the chief executive and chairman of Allied Artists International - a major film and television production company - has defended Spacey. He tweeted his support of the Usual Suspects actor following the claims of harassment saying: ""If true, acting on impulse while inebriated speaks to over-indulgence, not predatory behaviour.

Sacked Catalan leader 'not seeking asylum',"This video can not be played Carles Puigdemont: Spain has a 'democratic deficit' Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont says he has not travelled to Belgium to seek asylum. He has appeared in public in Brussels with several colleagues after declaring independence from Spain last week. Spain's central government has taken direct control of Catalonia and sacked officials, following the region's banned independence referendum. Mr Puigdemont said he was not trying to escape justice but wanted to be able to speak freely. He was speaking at a press conference as Spain's constitutional court suspended the declaration of independence made by the Catalan leader on Friday. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? Mr Puigdemont also said he would accept the result of snap Catalonia elections on 21 December, which were called by Spain's central government after it invoked Article 155 of the constitution, temporarily suspending the region's autonomy. The move will see as many as 150 of the region's top officials replaced. ""I want a clear commitment from the state. Will the state respect the results that could give separatist forces a majority?"" Mr Puigdemont asked reporters. The Spanish government has previously said he was welcome to take part in the fresh polls. This video can not be played Catalonia's human towers are said to represent the spirit of its people - when they stick together they can achieve big things The ousted Catalan leader did not clarify how long he would stay in Belgium, but said he would return once he was given ""guarantees"" by the Spanish government. He said moves by the Spanish chief prosecutor to charge him and a number of other cabinet members with offences that carry up to 30 years in prison showed the extent of the central authorities' aggression. Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Earlier comments from a lawyer hired by Mr Puigdemont in Brussels had fuelled speculation that he was investigating asylum processes there. When asked on Flemish public radio whether he was seeking asylum, Paul Bekaert said: ""We're keeping all options open - nothing has been decided."" Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis has expressed scepticism about an asylum bid, saying Mr Puigdemont was yet to be charged and therefore still ""free to move around"". But he added: ""We believe that among EU member states, there is a level of reciprocal trust over the fact that we are states governed by the rule of law."" Five of Mr Puigdemont's sacked ministers have joined him in Belgium: Meritxell Serret, agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, health minister Dolors Bassa, labour minister Meritxell BorrÃ¡s, governance minister Joaquim Forn, interior minister Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said Mr Puigdemont would be ""treated like any other European citizen"" . ""Mr Puigdemont has the same rights and responsibilities as any European citizen - no more, no less,"" he said. ""Freedom of movement within the Schengen zone allows him to be in Belgium without any other formalities."" In a separate development on Tuesday, Spain's Guardia Civil - a paramilitary force charged with police duties - raided the offices of the Catalan police force. According to media reports, they searched eight offices for communications relating to the referendum on 1 October. The Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, has already been accused of failing to help Guardia Civil officers tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters during the run up to the banned vote. The crisis began when the Catalan government held an independence referendum, despite a Constitutional Court ruling declaring it illegal. The Catalan authorities said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Others boycotted the vote after the court ruling. Catalonia is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions with a high degree of autonomy. But many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances, too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco.

Real IRA boss guilty over royal bomb plot,"Prince Charles visited County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland in May 2015 A Real IRA leader has been convicted of playing a leading role in plotting a bomb attack during the state visit of Prince Charles to Ireland in May 2015. Seamus McGrane, 63, from Little Road, Dromiskin in County Louth, was found guilty of directing the activities of a terrorist organisation. He was also convicted of IRA membership at Dublin's Special Criminal Court. He was secretly recorded discussing explosives and a target of ""military significance"" in a Dublin pub. The 2015 state visit included the site where the IRA murdered Prince Charles' great-uncle in 1979 McGrane had met dissident republican Donal Ã Coisdealbha a number of times in the Coachman's Inn early in 2015 to plan a bomb attack during the state visit of Prince Charles, according to Irish broadcaster, RTÃ. However, gardaÃ­ (Irish police) installed listening devices in the building and McGrane was recorded discussing strategy and experiments with explosives, along with his involvement in training paramilitaries. The court heard he instructed Ã Coisdealbha to ""reactivate the science graduate"" to get advice on explosives. He also told him to contact ""motorbike man"" to collect the explosives, to clean out a cylinder and return a bike, instructing him not to dispose of the vehicle. The court heard McGrane also told Ã Coisdealbha the target was to have ""military significance"" and referred to someone ""coming on the 19th"" - the same day that Prince Charles arrived in Ireland. When gardaÃ­ searched McGrane's home and lands linked to him in Louth and Wexford, they found what the judge described as ""a veritable arsenal of weapons and explosives"". Ã Coisdealbha followed through on McGrane's directions and wassentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison last December. The Dubliner was arrested after gardaÃ­ discovered explosive devices, improvised rockets, detonators, timing units and Semtex, which were later put on display. Some of the weapons seized after Ã Coisdealbha's arrest were put on display by gardaÃ­ During his state visit two years ago,Prince Charles went to County Sligowhere his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten was killed in a Provisional IRA bombing in 1979. It was the first time the prince had visited the site of the murders in Mullaghmore Harbour. In a speech in Sligo, he said Lord Mountbatten represented ""the grandfather I never had"" and describe his death as a ""deep loss"".

The Balfour Declaration: My ancestor's hand in history,"One hundred years ago, only 67 words on a single sheet of paper lit a fire in the Holy Land, igniting the most intractable conflict of modern times. The Balfour Declaration,externalwas the first time the British government endorsed the establishment of ""a national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine. While many Israelis believe it was the foundation stone of modern Israel and the salvation of the Jews, many Palestinians regard it as a betrayal. I've always been drawn to the conflict which has continued ever since then, reporting on it from there for nearly 30 years. This time, however, I went on a personal journey, to discover the role played by an ancestor of mine: Leopold, or Leo, Amery. My mother, Olive Amery, told me stories when I was a child about this relative - a British politician involved in the drafting of the declaration. He added a sentence intended to safeguard the civil and religious rights of the majority population, the Palestinian Arabs. Leo Amery was one of the people who drafted the Balfour Declaration In Lustleigh, the Devon village where my grandparents lived, I visited the church where Leo is buried and saw the plaque to his memory, bearing the words of his friend Winston Churchill paying tribute to a great British statesman. Leo had a fascinating background: his mother was Jewish but converted and brought up her son as a Christian. He studied Islamic culture and went on to become an MP and then colonial secretary, overseeing Britain's rule during the mandate years in Palestine. Was Leo's vision that Jews and Arabs could live and prosper together in peace doomed to failure and was violence inevitable? These were the questions I wanted to answer when I came to Israel again this time. A total of 100,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in the first few years after the 1917 Balfour Declaration threw Britain's weight behind Zionism, the nationalist movement calling for the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in the historic land of Israel. During the late 1930s this provoked a backlash from the Arab population who felt threatened and the British reacted to the Arab Revolt by clamping down on Jewish immigration, just as Hitler's planned annihilation of European Jewry was about to come into devastating effect. The bombing of Jerusalem's King David Hotel in 1946 left 91 people dead And after World War Two, in retaliation, the Jewish underground movement attacked the British - in one of the most notorious cases, bombing the King David hotel in Jerusalem and killing British troops. In Israel I followed in Leo's footsteps in Jerusalem, recognising when I read his diaries that the ""success of violence"" on both sides that so shocked him when it broke out in the 1920s was something I had seen time and again myself: four wars in Gaza, bloody protests on the West Bank and suicide bombings in Israel. Leo was bitterly disappointed at the British cap on Jewish immigration and I visited Atlit, one of the British internment camps, with 80-year-old Rabbi Meir Lau. He spent two weeks here when he arrived in Palestine as an eight-year-old survivor of Buchenwald extermination camp. Many other refugees were turned back - to Europe. Rabbi Meir Lau visits the former British internment camp at Atlit ""It was against humanity after six years of horror,"" he said, shaking his head in sorrow as we walked along the rusty barbed wire fences. ""Where was the nation of the United Kingdom then? Lord Balfour would not have believed it."" As the violence continued through the 1940s and Britain sought to rid itself of its Palestine problem, Leo had to accept the inevitability of partition. But he was working on his own solution, as I discovered in an archive in Jerusalem. There I found his 1946 map - the Amery Scheme - to divide Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. In faded red and blue it was remarkably similar to the United Nations Partition Plan a year later which resulted in the end of British rule and the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. But Arab countries refused to sign up to the UN's plan and, in the violence on both sides that followed, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced to flee the new State of Israel. The 1946 Amery Scheme sought to divide Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state One of the most poignant moments for me was visiting the ruins of Lifta - a Palestinian village abandoned nearly 70 years ago - with some of the old residents. Many Palestinians from here became refugees and have never been allowed to return to live in Lifta. But every year they come back with their children and grandchildren to remember. Hamid Suhail was seven when he fled - now he leans on a stick as his son Nasir helps him down the overgrown rocky slopes. ""I hope the day will come when we will have the right to come back here and live in peace,"" says Nasir. Hamid's granddaughter, Sohar, is emotional as she says: ""It makes me angry and sad at the same time to come here - although it is important to remember the history of these houses."" Nasir Sohail and his daughter Sohar visit Lifta, the family's former village Leo's conviction that the energy of the Jewish migrants would soon transform the Middle East is borne out 100 years on by the skyscrapers and high-tech campuses of Tel Aviv, Israel's economic capital. But living standards here, better than many European countries, are a far cry from the condition in which the majority of Palestinians find themselves: their economy is in crisis. And they believe it stems from what they perceive as the unfair hand that Britain dealt them with the Balfour Declaration. The closest I have ever come to seeing Leo's vision for Palestine succeed was in the 1990s when I was the only journalist allowed behind the scenes to witness the Oslo peace process. The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who met secretly in Norway spoke movingly to me then of their determination to make peace. The optimism created by the historic handshake on the White House lawn between the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) was shattered when a Jewish extremist assassinated Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and the PLO's chairman Yasser Arafat failed to stop suicide bombings launched by the Islamist extremist group Hamas. I went back to see the men whose story I had told nearly 24 years ago. Yossi Beilin, the Israeli junior minister who initiated the Oslo talks, was still hopeful. ""The process we began in Oslo is irreversible,"" he told me. ""It created a legitimacy for Israel in the Arab worldâ¦ and will hopefully be conducive to a permanent agreement. although much, much later than our original idea."" Jane Corbin at Chaim Weizmann's desk But Ahmed Qurei, the chief Palestinian negotiator, known as Abu Ala, was pessimistic. ""Unfortunately it's been nearly 25 years and a waste of time,"" he said. ""Still the Israelis are controlling the Palestinian territory and people. It's the Israeli mentality of occupation."" My journey ended in the home of Chaim Weizmann, the first president of Israel, in Rehovot. I found Leo's name in the visitors' book - he had come here aged 76 on his last trip to Israel in 1950. I sat at Weizmann's desk and read the correspondence between the two friends and found that Leo all those years ago recognised that Jerusalem would be the thorniest issue when it came to making peace: both sides would not compromise in their determination to have it as their capital. And so it remains to this day as I have seen so often. Leo never thought violence was inevitable here. He believed it was the result of wrong political decisions and the bloody and unpredictable events of history - as I discovered myself after the Oslo peace agreement. Now there is a danger that extremism and intransigence on both sides will make peace impossible for decades still to come.

N Korea hits back over UK WannaCry claims,"WannaCry spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide attack North Korea has hit back at the UK government for accusing it of being behind a massive ransomware attack that badly affected the National Health Service (NHS). A UK government minister last week told the BBC he was ""as sure as possible"" North Korea was behind the attack. But a North Korean spokesman called the accusations ""groundless speculation"". More than a thirdof NHS trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware in May. At least 19,000 appointments were cancelled and computers in over 600 doctor's surgeries infected. WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date and also spread to more than 150 countries. Cyber-attack: Your questions answered WannaCry: What can you do to protect your business? Malware, patches and worms defined A spokesman for the North's Korea-Europe Association called the UK's accusation ""a wicked attempt"" to tighten international sanctions on the country. ""This is an act beyond the limit of our tolerance and it makes us question the real purpose behind the UK's move,"" he said in comments carried on the Korean Central News Agency on Monday. The South Korean government believes the North has a unit of 6,800 trained cyber-warfare specialists. Pyongyang's cyber military was thought to be behind an online attack onSony Picturesand a hack last year in which blueprints of a South Korean warship company were stolen.

Fixed-odds maximum bet 'could drop to Â£2',"This video can not be played 'I was completely caught up in gambling' The maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals could drop to as little as Â£2 under a government review. Currently, people can bet up to Â£100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games, but ministers are considering a new limit somewhere between Â£2 and Â£50. Theconsultation,externalaims to reduce the risk of people suffering large losses and to tighten up advertising rules. The Association of British Bookmakers said the onus was on the gambling industry to help cut problem gambling. According to a government consultation, cutting the stake to Â£2 would cost the industry over the next 10 years. But problem gamblers say it is time for action to be taken - including, but not only, lessening the amount they can lose in one hit. A good bet? The fixed-odds controversy 'I lost Â£5k in 48 hours on betting machines' Gambling vlogger Andrew Margett,externaltoldBBC Radio 5livehow the machines, also known as FOBTs, proved addictive: ""I was just in a trance, in a complete bubble, playing it.  Hitting the button, hitting the button, hitting the button."" This video can not be played Nick Eardley explains how FOBT machines work As part of the government review: The Gambling Commission - the industry's regulator - will consult on changes to protect online players. Broadcasters, advertisers, industry and support groups will draw up an advertising campaign to promote responsible gambling, with an annual budget of up to Â£7m. New advertising guidelines will be drafted to protect problem gamblers, children and young people. Access by under-18s to gambling content and channels on social media will be restricted. Gambling companies are being told to step up funding for research, education and treatment. If they don't, operators may face a levy. Culture minister Tracey Crouch said current laws on gaming machines - which critics have called the ""crack cocaine of gambling"" - were ""inappropriate"". ""It is vital that we strike the right balance between socially responsible growth and protecting the most vulnerable, including children, from gambling-related harm,"" she said. ""We have seen online gambling grow rapidly and we need to protect players in this space, while also making sure those experiencing harm relating to gambling receive the help they need,"" she said. But in an urgent question session in the Commons, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said the government was kicking the issue into ""the long grass"" and added that action, rather than a consultation, was needed. This video can not be played 'Bookies have won' over fixed-odds machines ""There's an old maxim that the bookies always win, and they've won again today,"" he said. 'I lost Â£150k on betting machines' Mr Watson, who is also Labour's deputy leader, claimed that 450,000 children are gambling on a weekly basis. Labour wants a new gambling bill to look at the explosion of digital and online products - to stop children gambling on phones and to protect vulnerable people. Carolyn Harris MP, who chairs an all-party parliamentary group on the issues involved, said there was overwhelming evidence people's lives were being destroyed by the machines. ""When you see the statistics that 31% per cent of people who use these machines are earning less than Â£10,000... Where do they get the money? Because they are not earning it,"" shetold the Victoria Derbyshire programme,external. The government began to look again at gambling in October 2016, when it made a ""call for evidence"" on the number and location of gaming machines and the measures in place to protect players. Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops from 1999, and offer computerised games including roulette and blackjack at the touch of a button. The government is consulting on 11 different types of gaming machine, with stakes ranging from 30p to Â£5. Each machine accepts bets up to a pre-set maximum and pays out according to fixed odds on the simulated outcomes of games. This video can not be played Inside the brain of a gambling addict Like every other industry, gambling has been radically transformed by technology. The advent of smartphones has made gambling much easier, more convenient, and constantly present than it was before. For centuries, gambling was for the most part an activity or habit that you had to move towards. Now, thanks to the internet, the gambling comes to you. It is dangerous to reduce the debate of FOBTs to one about economics: how much is raised in tax revenue; potential job losses; the impact on our high streets and so on. It is rather also a question of principle. In a free or liberal society, is it reasonable to let fully informed adults of sound mind make their own decisions about how to spend - and yes, waste - their money? Perhaps it is; but it becomes intolerable when this freedom harms others. It seems that public opinion has moved to the view that negative social consequences and harm have flowed from the gambling industry's tendency to cluster in areas of deprivation and high unemployment. Malcolm George, of the Association of British Bookmakers, said the government shared its wish to identify problem gamblers and get them help. But restricting terminals in betting shops would redirect problem gamblers to other avenues where there were fewer controls on the amount of gambling, he said. ""Just as alcohol policy in this country is not solely determined by alcoholics"" he added, there needs to be an environment for the ""vast majority who gamble responsibly"". The British Amusement Catering Trade Association's John White said the government needed to ""strike the right balance"", but stakes should be ""quite substantially"" reduced, he said. Asked about job loss fears, he said half of high street adult gaming centres had disappearing since FOBTs were introduced. Tax law changes in 2001 led to a vast increase in the number of terminals. By 2005, about 20,000 terminals were in use and more than 34,000 are now found across the UK, according to the Gambling Commission.

Nine dismembered bodies found in Japan flat,"Reporters gathered outside the suspect's home on Tuesday Japanese police have arrested a man after finding parts of nine bodies in his apartment in Zama, near Tokyo. Police found two severed heads in a cold-storage container outside the flat of the suspect, named as Takahiro Shiraishi, while investigating the disappearance of a woman. They also found the body parts of seven other people, also stored in cool boxes, in his apartment. The 27-year-old is being held on suspicion of disposing of the bodies. Police had found the body parts of eight females and one male, some in varying stages of decomposition, Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported. Mr Shiraishi told police he had killed the nine and hid their bodies, broadcaster NHK reported, citing the Metropolitan Police Department. ""I killed them and did some work on the bodies in order to hide the evidence,"" NHK quoted him as saying. Meanwhile, his next-door neighbour said he had started smelling strange odours from the flat after Mr Shiraishi moved in in August, NHK and Asahi Shimbun said. Police made the grisly discovery while looking for a 23-year-old woman, who had been missing since 21 October. Investigators found that Mr Shiraishi had been in contact with her, after she wrote online that she wanted to commit suicide. On Tuesday, reporters gathered outside the suspect's home, while neighbours expressed shock at the incident. ""It's a quiet residential area here, with a day care centre nearby. I can't believe the bodies were discovered in an area like this,"" a 41-year-old neighbour told Mainichi Shimbun.

'My relation was stabbed as a witch',"Emily Ward-Willis discovered accusations of witchcraft in her family It's Halloween and the shops are full of make-believe witches and ghosts. But Emily Ward-Willis has a more personal connection. Her research into her family history found an ancestor accused of being a real witch, 150 years ago this week in Stratford-upon-Avon. Such was the suspicion and whispering campaign around her great-great-great grandmother that her neighbours stabbed her. They thought that 57-year-old Jane Ward had been sending headless ghosts down chimneys and performing witchcraft that was harming their families. Her neighbour, John Davis, believed that the way to lift a witch's curse was to draw her blood - and backed up by some of his family, he stabbed her in the face. ""I don't think she was an actual witch,"" says Emily. ""My mental image of her is as an old woman who had lived a hard life. She might have been slightly eccentric."" The deep knife wound ""would have been horrifically painful for her"". Dr Jessica Nelson looks after the official state records of witch trials at the National Archives To modern eyes, this looks like the harassment of an isolated and vulnerable woman. Or the Victorian version of fake news. For months before the attack, Jane Ward had been shouted at and called a witch. The allegations escalated and she was accused of using evil powers to make ghosts appear, move furniture around and overturn the chair of a disabled child. ""She had a very tough life, she'd lost numerous children as babies and her eldest son was in trouble himself and her other son moved away, so she was on her own and then her husband dies,"" said Emily. ""She'd plunged further and further into poverty."" Emily was able to find out about her ancestor's story because her assailant was charged and given 18 months hard labour - with the court records available at the National Archives in Kew. Not all witches were women - about one in five accused of witchcraft was male But what might seem surprising about this witchcraft story is that it took place as late as the 1860s. Dr Jessica Nelson, a head of collections at the National Archives, says it's very hard to know what folklore beliefs about witchcraft persisted into the 19th Century, particularly among those who were not literate. In terms of the legal position, the witchcraft laws that had seen hundreds executed in the 16th and 17th Centuries had been overturned in the 1730s, with the presumption that witchcraft did not really exist. Instead the laws were against people claiming to have such supernatural powers. Arthur Miller's play The Crucible used witch-hunting as an image of political persecution This version of witchcraft legislation, against people pretending to be witches or being able to summon spirits, was used into the 1940s. But the attack on Jane Ward suggests that such old beliefs about the existence of witches ran deep. And there seems to have been a consistent pattern of isolated and impoverished women being the most likely to be accused. These were the archetypal scapegoats, accused of anything that went wrong. ""Witches could be accused of everything from huge natural disasters to someone's cat dying,"" said Dr Nelson. 10 myths about witches, from Dr Jessica Nelson at the National Archives Pointy hats.Not really. Those accused of witchcraft wore all kinds of hats or none. Broomsticks.Witches were claimed to be able to fly, but not always on broomsticks. They could also fly on their own or on horses. And they had other animals, including dogs, not just black cats. Always women?No. About 80% of accusations were against women. But men could be accused of witchcraft as well. Always old?Older, isolated people were more vulnerable to such claims, but young people were also accused. Were men called wizards?No. Male witches were just called witches as well. Were people accused of being witches always found guilty?No. Perhaps about three-quarters accused of witchcraft were acquitted. Ducking stools in village ponds.These were not used in testing for witchcraft. If they sank they were innocent but drowned anyway?This was not really a common practice. But people accused of being witches were ""swum"", which meant being tied up and put into water and if they floated it was evidence of being a witch. But they were pulled back on to land if they went under water. Burning at the stake?No, more likely to have been hanged. Lesser offences had jail sentences or being put in the pillory. Halloween and witches.Modern popular culture has created a ""bit of a myth"" about the link between Halloween and witchcraft, much more so than the historical record. ""They were certainly scapegoated within their communities for things like sickness, women having difficult pregnancies, livestock dying, crop failures, raising storms."" Dr Nelson has been researching waves of witch-hunting and accusations in Pendle in Lancashire in the 17th Century. The witch finder in one of the Pendle cases was a 10-year-old-boy, who began to identify witches among local people. Dr Nelson says the boy seems to have been encouraged by his father, who saw this as a way of making the family some money. Under scrutiny, and when the accused were taken away from the witch hysteria and brought to London, the allegations fell apart, with the boy admitting he had made up the claims. But even when people had been acquitted there remained a stigma. Women accused of witchcraft being beaten in front of James I in 1610 ""I'm sure it really did blight people's lives,"" says Dr Nelson. ""Often these accusations are coming out of very small communities, all the people involved know each other. ""In some cases you get accusations and counter-accusations made within families. You occasionally get, as in the first Pendle witch trials, children accusing their parents."" Centuries later the idea of a ""witch hunt"" still seems to have a grip on the imagination. It's still part of modern political language. ""There does remain this folk memory of people jumping on the bandwagon of accusations and it not really mattering whether those accusations were true or not,"" says Dr Nelson. ""If someone was accused of being a witch in the 17th Century, it didn't really matter whether they were or not, they had that taint. ""I suppose we still see that today sometimes. It doesn't really matter if some accusations are true or false, they can be very damaging."" But what happened to Jane Ward? ""She survived the attack and she continued to live at home with her daughter,"" says Emily. ""We have her in the 1871 census, but after that, her life is a bit of a mystery. ""After checking all the records, I'm pretty sure that at some point I'll come across her. ""But maybe she was a witch and she might still be aliveâ¦ so who knows?""

Bank prepares for Brexit job losses,"The Bank of England believes that up to 75,000 jobs could be lost in financial services following Britain's departure from the European Union. The BBC understands senior figures at the Bank are using the number as a ""reasonable scenario"", particularly if there is no specific UK-EU financial services deal. The number could change depending on the UK's post-Brexit trading deal. But the bank still expects substantial job losses. I am told the Bank believes that many jobs will move to the continent. The Bank of England has asked banks and other financial institutions, such as hedge funds, to provide it with contingency plans in the event of Britain trading with the EU under World Trade Organization rules - what some have described as a ""hard Brexit"". That would mean banks based in the UK losing special passporting rights to operate across the EU. Goldman chief hints at Frankfurt move Business bodies call for Brexit clarity The EU could also impose other ""locations specific"" regulations such as where trading in trillions of pounds worth of euro-denominated financial insurance products has to be based. That could mean trading jobs moving to Paris or Frankfurt. There have been a number of studies on the potential employment impact of Brexit. A poll of more than 100 finance firms by Reuters suggested the number of job losses would be just below 10,000 in the ""few years"" following Brexit. I understand the bank believes the 10,000 jobs figure is likely on ""day one"" of Brexit if there is no deal. The Brussels-based think tank, Bruegel, said that over time 30,000 jobs could move to the continent or be lost as London's financial sector shrinks. Bank of England And Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, has suggested that over 200,000 jobs could go. The bank believes that is too high, and its scenario over the next three-to-five years is much closer to the 2016 study by Oliver Wyman, a management consultancy which has often been quoted by banking lobby groups assessing the impact of Brexit. Their report suggested between 65,000 and 75,000 job losses. The study said that up to 40,000 jobs could be lost directly from financial services, with a further 30-40,000 going in associated activities such as legal work and professional services. The report also argued that there could be opportunities from Brexit, such as developing bespoke financial services for emerging market economies across the Middle East and Asia including China and India. Even if 75,000 jobs do go, London would still be by far the largest financial centre in Europe with over one million people employed in financial services in the capital and across the rest of Britain. And the UK would still enjoy a healthy trade surplus in financial services with the rest of the EU worth many tens of billions of pounds. Many also believe there will be a positive outcome to the EU negotiations as the City supports many governments and businesses on the continent in raising funds and executing global deals. Those companies and firms would want to keep a close relationship with the UK and its well-developed global markets capacity. Before the referendum, many banks suggested that they may move thousands of jobs. But since then announcements have been more modest. JP Morgan said it might have to move 4,000 jobs, but since the referendum has cut that number to around 1,000. The Swiss bank, UBS, said it may move as few as 250 jobs after initially planning to relocate as many as 1,000. And the chief executive of Barclays, Jess Staley, said that Brexit was no more complicated than setting up a holding company in America, which the bank was obliged to do in 2016. More recently Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has tweeted that he will be spending ""a lot more time"" in Frankfurt despite the American bank building a large new HQ in London.

Man finds snake wrapped around bird cage,"The parrot named Nikki was clinging on to one side of the cage A pet parrot in Singapore has been rescued from the jaws of death, after its owners discovered a huge python coiled around their bird's cage. The 1.5m long (5ft) snake was found on Monday in Melvin Yap's home. Mr Yap extricated the python with a stick, and passed it to an animal rescue group. He told the BBC that their pet bird, named Nikki, survived unharmed, but was ""petrified"". Large snakes are not uncommon in Singapore, which has abundant wildlife. Mr Yap said he was still sleeping early on Monday morning when he was woken up by frantic screams in the house. ""My domestic helper was in the process of cleaning the bird's cage. The snake was just right in front of her, and she didn't see it until my wife spotted it and screamed 'Snake!',"" he said. ""There was mayhem and panic."" Mr Yap rushed downstairs along with his 10-year-old daughter, who assisted him as he ""coaxed"" the snake into a large plastic bag with a stick. This video can not be played The giant python was put in a plastic bag They later put it into an unused fish tank ""so it wouldn't suffocate"", and called a local animal rescue group which took it away later that afternoon. His encounter, which was covered by local media outlets, drew astonished responses from Singaporeans, not least for the way in which he caught the reptile. ""STICK and PLASTIC BAG???? Salute ah!"" wrote one incredulous Facebook commenter. But Mr Yap said he ""just wanted to quickly contain the situation, and ensure my loved ones didn't get hurt"". ""After I caught it, I realised it was more scared of us than the other way round. It was in defensive mode, curling up and trying to protect itself."" He added that his family grew less fearful of the snake once they realised it was a python, which does not have a venomous bite. Baby pythons had been previously spotted in neighbouring homes, though they were often killed, said Mr Yap, whose home is near a forested area. Singapore, a densely-built island that still has thriving pockets of primary rainforest, has seen increasing human-wildlife encounters in recent years, involving wild boars, deer, snakes, and monkeys. Singapore's celebrity urban otter family Singapore's otters get upwardly mobile - BBC News There have also been reports of giant pythons, which are common in South East Asia, attacking people. In March this year an Indonesian man wasapparently swallowed by a python,while earlier this month another Indonesian was badly hurt after wrestling with a python -which was subsequently killed and eaten. But Mr Yap said he did not want to harm the snake which slithered into his home. ""We're stewards of the environment and the creatures who live in it. I'm just grateful and appreciative of the encounter,"" said the 46-year-old animal lover, though he admitted his wife ""still has some concerns about lurking snakes"". Meanwhile, Nikki appears to still be recovering from its near-death experience. ""Usually in the morning it loves to chirp, but this morning it was extremely quiet. No noise from the poor bird,"" said Mr Yap. ""I think we'll have to give it more sunflower seeds as a treat."" Reporting by the BBC's Tessa Wong.

Sacked Catalan leader not seeking asylum,"This video can not be played Carles Puigdemont: Spain has a 'democratic deficit' Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont says he has not travelled to Belgium to seek asylum. He has appeared in public in Brussels with several colleagues after declaring independence from Spain last week. Spain's central government has taken direct control of Catalonia and sacked officials, following the region's banned independence referendum. Mr Puigdemont said he was not trying to escape justice but wanted to be able to speak freely. He was speaking at a press conference as Spain's constitutional court suspended the declaration of independence made by the Catalan leader on Friday. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? Mr Puigdemont also said he would accept the result of snap Catalonia elections on 21 December, which were called by Spain's central government after it invoked Article 155 of the constitution, temporarily suspending the region's autonomy. The move will see as many as 150 of the region's top officials replaced. ""I want a clear commitment from the state. Will the state respect the results that could give separatist forces a majority?"" Mr Puigdemont asked reporters. The Spanish government has previously said he was welcome to take part in the fresh polls. This video can not be played Catalonia's human towers are said to represent the spirit of its people - when they stick together they can achieve big things The ousted Catalan leader did not clarify how long he would stay in Belgium, but said he would return once he was given ""guarantees"" by the Spanish government. He said moves by the Spanish chief prosecutor to charge him and a number of other cabinet members with offences that carry up to 30 years in prison showed the extent of the central authorities' aggression. Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Earlier comments from a lawyer hired by Mr Puigdemont in Brussels had fuelled speculation that he was investigating asylum processes there. When asked on Flemish public radio whether he was seeking asylum, Paul Bekaert said: ""We're keeping all options open - nothing has been decided."" Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis has expressed scepticism about an asylum bid, saying Mr Puigdemont was yet to be charged and therefore still ""free to move around"". But he added: ""We believe that among EU member states, there is a level of reciprocal trust over the fact that we are states governed by the rule of law."" Five of Mr Puigdemont's sacked ministers have joined him in Belgium: Meritxell Serret, agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, health minister Dolors Bassa, labour minister Meritxell BorrÃ¡s, governance minister Joaquim Forn, interior minister Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said Mr Puigdemont would be ""treated like any other European citizen"" . ""Mr Puigdemont has the same rights and responsibilities as any European citizen - no more, no less,"" he said. ""Freedom of movement within the Schengen zone allows him to be in Belgium without any other formalities."" In a separate development on Tuesday, Spain's Guardia Civil - a paramilitary force charged with police duties - raided the offices of the Catalan police force. According to media reports, they searched eight offices for communications relating to the referendum on 1 October. The Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, has already been accused of failing to help Guardia Civil officers tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters during the run up to the banned vote. The crisis began when the Catalan government held an independence referendum, despite a Constitutional Court ruling declaring it illegal. The Catalan authorities said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Others boycotted the vote after the court ruling. Catalonia is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions with a high degree of autonomy. But many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances, too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco.

"Reality Check: Lamb, lemons and Brexit","Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon. I haven't tried it, but therecipe,externaldoes exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen. It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union. All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of. It goes by the name of ""tariff rate quotas"". Now what on Earth does that mean? When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods. The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs. They are set by the EU for all member nations. Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels. Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of: overseas exporters domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition consumers That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota. It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ. TRQs are often used for farm products. The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK. All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU. In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff. There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes. What will Brexit mean for our bacon? Brexit: What would 'no deal' look like? Is a last-minute Brexit deal possible? Why a transition period may not buy more time for talks So how does Brexit come into this picture? The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs. The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers. Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members,in a letter,external, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows. That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries. But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility. As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU. After Brexit, that would not be possible. The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated. One option could be a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy. In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe. There is another option. In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether. Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade. This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers. In our recipe, lamb is a case in point. Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers. With lemons, that is not an issue. We are not citrus producers. There are British table grapes. It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too. There's another complication: cross-Channel trade. British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free. The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK. Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit. So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs? That's another thing to be negotiated.

The man who keeps monsters,"Those of a fragile disposition should not scroll down this page (spider alert!) This video can not be played Ronald Jenner: ""We want to give people a tension between fear and fascination"" What is the most terrifying creature in the darkest corner of your imagination? I tell you now, it may have to go some to beat this beast. It's a disgusting worm-like organism that grabs you with four metal-reinforced jaws. Once latched in place, these lances inject you with a paralysing venom that also liquefies your flesh, which the worm then proceeds to suck up. Nice. Ok, the critter may not be much longer than your little finger, but the close-up image certainly makes the stomach churn. The ""Gila monster"" has led to a blockbuster drug that is now used to manage diabetes The bloodworm is one of the many ""stars"" that will feature in an exhibition dedicated to venomous animals, set to open at London's Natural History Museum (NHM) next week. Photo of butchered rhino wins top award Whaling's 'uncomfortable' scientific legacy The rock that records how we all got here If you have an aversion to spiders, snakes, ants, wasps, scorpions, and even to the unassuming platypus (yes, it's also venomous) - then I suggest you don't go. But if you're fascinated by evolution and some of the remarkable biochemistry it's managed to cook up over the last half-a-billion years - you're unlikely to be disappointed. And the truth is, we can't escape what's all around us anyway. They say you're never more than six feet from a rat. Well, the same is equally true of venomous creatures or the products and services they provide to us. It's time to face and love the horror. The worm with a Halloween mask: Bloodworms are a favourite of neuroscientists ""If you eat fruit; well, they're pollinated by bees, which are venomous,"" says Dr Ronald Jenner, the NHM's venom evolution expert. ""Figs are pollinated by parasitoid wasps. If you eat squid or octopus - they're venomous. ""They use venoms in cosmetics - face-masks use a synthetic version of a snake peptide that relaxes the muscles. ""You may not know this but your diabetes medicine is most likely a synthetic version of a toxin. ""The red wine you drink has been clarified often with the swim bladders of venomous catfish. They don't put it on the label, but venom's tendrils are in your life. ""The cotton clothes you wear - the only reason we can grow the cotton in such large monocultures is because parasitoid wasps take out all the sap-sucking insects that would otherwise damage the crop. Without venom, we'd be scuppered."" Vampire bats' venom keeps the blood flowing in their victims It's hard not to be enthused by Ronald when he takes you on a tour of his favourite NHM monsters. Thankfully, they're all dead and a good many are behind glass, submerged in preserving liquid, which means you can get a very close look at their weaponry. Venom is a toxin - usually a kind of peptide or large protein - that is actively delivered through a wound via a specialised mechanism, involving teeth, fangs, claws, spurs or a stinger. Believe it or not, there's even a newt that does it with its ribs. It breaks them first, pokes them through glands in its skin and then injects its foe. Masters of the Halloween costume competition: Velvet ants are actually wasps Ronald works a lot with that ugly bloodworm - or the ""worm with a Halloween mask"", as he calls it. It delivers a neurotoxin that has found use in labs across the world to study nerve cell communication. ""When the bloodworm injects a crustacean prey, it causes a spastic paralysis. But what's remarkable is that this effect is reversible,"" he explains. ""Scientists have fractionated the venom to get just that bit that activates cell communication channels. They apply it to the cell culture, study the process of communication, and then wash the effect away with a buffer. It was only this year that we've seen the full molecular structure of this protein and it's huge and unlike anything else in nature."" An Egyptian cobra's paralysing venom can kill but some prey have now evolved resistance Some venoms will jellify the blood so the victim will suffer clots, leading to stroke and rapid death. Some venoms act as an anti-clotting agent. Vampire bats use this strategy so they can keep on sucking from a wound. As gory as all this is, it's easy to see the enormous pharmaceutical potential. The most famous example is probably the Brazilian pit viper whose venom is able to rapidly lower the blood pressure of its victims so they pass out and drop to the ground. The snake's venom showed scientists the way to some of the first angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to treat high-blood pressure in humans. Peacock spider: Nearly every arachnid is venomous Then there's the ""Gila monster"". Its painful bite incorporates a peptide that regulates glucose. AstraZeneca markets a drug based on this molecule called Exenatide, which is used to manage Type II diabetes. Its value runs to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Of course, everyone wants to know what is the most lethal member in Ronald's collection. ""I always get asked what is the worst of the worst"", he says. Comparing venoms is not straightforward because this form of chemical warfare can be highly specialised: what works on one type of prey may be much less effective on another. But the NHM expert clearly has a soft spot for the coastal taipan snake, which is found on the northern coast of Australia and in New Guinea. The komodo dragon uses venom to lower the blood pressure of its victim, inducing shock In toxinology, researchers use a measure called the ""median lethal dose"" to describe a venom's power. ""If the total yield of the strongest venom ever measured in a taipan was delivered in a full bite - that could kill 50% of 3.3 million mice. That's insane,"" says Ronald. Venom delivery as a means to take down prey or to defend against predation has evolved independently about 90 times in nature and now includes some 200,000 living species. That is testament to venom's usefulness. And almost every animal would have the genetic toolkit to evolve the capability. ""You could even make humans venomous,"" chuckles Ronald. ""It would involve selective breeding and might take two millions years - but you could definitely do it. Our saliva would be a good place to start.""

The domestic violence victims 'left begging for a home',"This video can not be played Kay fled a violent relationship at the end of last year Women fleeing domestic abuse have told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme they are being left homeless because councils are failing to provide them with suitable temporary accommodation. ""It was very difficult indeed, emotionally, because you're basically begging [for somewhere to stay], and every day not knowing where you're going to be sleeping,"" says Kay. ""You're trying to put on a happy face to be supportive of the children - telling them, 'It's going to be all right,' when deep inside you really don't think it's going to be. ""You don't know where you're going to be staying."" Kay left a violent relationship at the end of last year, and initially moved into a refuge on a short-term basis. When her stay came to an end, Bromley Council eventually agreed to house her as a single person. But when her two children came to live with her, she was told that housing would not be made available to them as a family, leading to three months of her and the children sofa-surfing with friends and family. A consultation into how to improve access to social housing for domestic abuse victims has been launched by the government The government has announceda consultation into how to improve access to social housing,externalfor domestic abuse victims in England. It says a number of measures are already in place to support victims - including a Â£40m fund to be spent across four years, in part to ""strengthen specialist accommodation-based services"". Housing lawyer Jane Pritchard says when it comes to finding temporary accommodation for victims, there is a ""really low bar"". ""The local authority simply needs 'reason to believe' that the person is homeless, that they're eligible for assistance under the Housing Act, and that they are in priority need of accommodation. ""Then there's a duty to provide suitable temporary accommodation immediately."" But she regularly comes across situations where a council has told a domestic violence victim ""it's not their responsibility and to go to another council"". Jane Pritchard says if councils turn victims away they may return to their abuser ""When someone is fleeing domestic abuse, we may only have one chance, one opportunity to assist in protecting them - to ensure that they're housed in suitable, safe accommodation,"" Ms Pritchard says. ""If that applicant goes to the council and is turned away at that time, we know that that person may never go back. ""They may go back to the perpetrator and the abuse, and may never ever have the opportunity again of being rehoused."" Sophia - not her real name - fled her home after being in an abusive relationship, travelling to London, where she hoped a council would offer her assistance. But, she says: ""They just dismissed me. They didn't seem to understand that I was homeless. I was actually homeless. ""I repeatedly visited the council, and there were times when I've been in a phone booth crying my eyes out [while calling them]. I was so vulnerable."" The council later offered her a place at a hostel - one housing 14 men. ""I was scared. I was just scared. I couldn't see myself living with 14 men, with shared facilities - toilet, bathroom, kitchen. It's not safe,"" she says. ""One of those men actually came to me and said, 'If you get a knock on your door at two in the morning, don't worry, it's only me.' In the end, she ""just ran away"", staying at a bed and breakfast at her own cost, and, at the thought of having to move back into the hostel, she tried to kill herself. Eventually, Sophia managed to find permanent accommodation - but she did so without the help of the local authority. After three months of sofa-surfing, Kay and her two children were found accommodation by Bromley Council. The local authority said in a statement: ""Whilst any delay around offering more permanent housing is clearly regrettable, it should be remembered that these is a long list for housing across London and it is important for everybody else on the list that due process is followed"". Kay remembers her son's reaction to waking up in his own bed for the first time in months. ""He said, 'Mum it was so comfortable,'"" she says. ""It's such a relief.""

UK inquiry into Weinstein widens,"UK police investigating Harvey Weinstein are now looking at sexual assault allegations from seven women. Officers are investigating separate incidents alleged to have taken place between the 1980s and 2015 both in London as well as outside of the UK. The Hollywood film producer has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex. No arrests have been made over any of the allegations at this stage, the Metropolitan Police said. Police are investigating the allegations under Operation Kaguyak. The earliest allegation is of an assault which it is claimed took place in the early 1980s outside of the UK.  Scotland Yard says it will pass the allegation on to the local police force in due course. The second woman claiming she was assaulted by Weinstein says the incident took place in west London in the late 1980s, with a third woman alleging she was sexually assaulted in Westminster in 1992. A fourth alleged victim claims she was assaulted in 1994, also in Westminster, with a fifth alleging an assault took place on her in the same London borough in the mid-1990s. Police are investigating two allegations of assault by a sixth woman in Westminster in 2010 and 2011, with a further assault alleged to have taken place on the same woman in Camden in 2015. A seventh woman says she was assaulted outside of the UK in 2012 and two further times in 2013 and 2014 in Westminster.  Police say they will pass on the 2012 allegation to the relevant force. Police have not given any more details about the complainants or alleged offences at this stage. Rose McGowan also claims she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein New York police are also investigating claims against the 65-year-old, including rape and sexual assault. Numerous allegations have been made against the movie mogul by women including actresses Angelina Jolie, Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow. Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories What it was like to work for Weinstein How the scandal unfolded Earlier this month, UKpolice confirmedthey were investigating claims from three women that they were attacked in Westminster, Camden and west London, before confirming the four new allegations. On Tuesday, the Producers Guild of America said Weinstein had beenbanned for lifeover reports of his ""decades of reprehensible conduct"". ActressRose McGowan says she was offered $1m(Â£760,000) from Harvey Weinstein in exchange for her silence. McGowan says she turned down the money the day before the New York Times ran an expose on the movie mogul earlier this month.

Fallon 'touched journalist's knee',"Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon was once rebuked by a journalist for putting his hand on her knee during dinner, his spokesman has confirmed. Radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer had recounted the ""mildly amusing"" incident without naming Sir Michael. After his identity was revealed in the Sun,,externalshe tweeted saying she had not been ""remotely upset or distressed"". A spokesman for Sir Michael said he had apologised when it happened in 2002. Ms Hartley-Brewer, a former political editor of the Sunday Express and regular political commentator, has criticised ""wild rumours and claims"" circulating at Westminster. She said she did not consider herself a victim after the incident which happened over dinner at the Conservative Party conference. After the minister kept putting his hand on her knee, she said: ""I calmly and politely explained to him that, if he did it again, I would 'punch him in the face'. ""He withdrew his hand and that was the end of the matter.""

A spokesman for Sir Michael said: ""He had apologised when the incident happened 15 years ago and both Julia and he now considered the matter closed."" It comes amid allegations about sexual harassment at Westminster. On Monday Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said recent allegations against MPs ""risked bringing all our offices into disrepute"". Commons SpeakerJohn Bercow said there must be ""zero tolerance""of sexual harassment in Parliament. Conservative MP Tim Loughton compared the allegations to the MPs' expenses scandal, which he said had been ""deeply damaging"" to the ""integrity"" of the House of Commons and each MP. He said it was ""essential"" for the response to the allegations to be ""swift, robust and wholly transparent"". What are the existing procedures? People who work for MPs are legally employed by them and are not covered by theestablished grievance procedure,externalfor other Parliamentary employees. Employment disputes have traditionally been handled in-house by the MPs concerned with, in some cases, the input of political parties. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which pays MPs and their staff,offers guidance on grievance procedures,externalto MPs when they draw up employment contracts but these are not binding. The guidance states anyone with a complaint against an MP should initially make it to their line manager, even though this could be the MP themselves. It goes on to set out the best practice procedures to be followed. MPs are bound by rules set out in a code of conduct drawn up in the mid-1990s. They are expected to act with ""probity and integrity"" and ""in accordance with the public trust"" placed in them. Parliament's standards commissioner has the power to investigate claims that MPs have undermined the ""reputation"" of Parliament - but the rules do not cover sexual matters. The government has promised urgent action to improve the handling of complaints about the way MPs' staff are treated. Ms Leadsom said the existing system for handling grievances was inadequate and promised a cross-party approach to establishing a contractually binding complaints procedure for all those working in Parliament, including MPs, peers, staff and interns. In a letter sent to Mr Bercow on Sunday, Prime Minister Theresa May said the current system for airing grievances was not fair on employees, many of whom were young and in their first job. Labour has written to its MPs setting out rules for dealing with allegations of sexual abuse and harassment, while the SNP said it had begun an investigation into two unconnected allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour. Over the weekend, a Cabinet Office investigation was ordered into whether Conservative MP and international trade minister Mark Garnier breached ministerial rules after he admitted asking his secretary to buy sex toys and calling her ""sugar tits"". And former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb was reported by the Sunday Telegraph to have admitted sending ""explicit"" messages to a 19-year-old woman after a job interview at Westminster in 2013.

Netflix to end House of Cards amid Spacey claim,"Netflix has pulled the plug on House of Cards, a day after its lead actor Kevin Spacey was accused of sexually harassing a teenage boy. The media streaming company said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the allegation, made by the actor Anthony Rapp. In an interview with Buzzfeed,,externalRapp alleged Spacey tried to seduce him when he was 14, after a party in 1986. Spacey said he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear the story but did not remember the encounter. Kevin Spacey said he owed Anthony Rapp a ""sincere apology"" for what he said would have been ""deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour"". Spacey also announced that he was now living ""as a gay man"" butthe Oscar winning actor has been widely criticisedfor choosing this moment to come out. Gay rights activists have said linking his sexuality to an apology over allegations of sexual harassment was harmful to the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) community. In House of Cards, Kevin Spacey plays the ruthless American politician Frank Underwood. The drama has been widely acclaimed and filming is currently on the sixth series. While Netflix has said it will be the last, several reports have suggested that the producers had decided to end the series well before the allegation emerged.

'Alzheimer's milkshake' fails in trial,"There is no good evidence that a nutrient drink being sold online in the UK to ""help"" people with early Alzheimer's actually slows the disease, say experts. Latest trial results in patients who took Souvenaid did not find it preserves memory and thinking. The authors say in Lancet Neurology that bigger studies are needed,externalto show if the product can work as hoped. And consumers should be aware that the Â£3.49 per bottle drink ""is not a cure"". Manufacturer Nutricia says its drink should only be taken under the direction of a doctor, specialist nurse or pharmacist. Souvenaid comes in strawberry or vanilla flavour and contains a combination of fatty acids, vitamins and other nutrients. Taken once daily, the idea is that the boost of nutrients it provides will help keep Alzheimer's at bay in people with the earliest signs of this type of dementia. But the latest phase two clinical trial results do not prove this. The study involved 311 patients with very early Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment. All of them were asked to take a daily drink, but only half were given Souvenaid - the other half received one with no added nutrients. After two years of participating, the patients were reassessed to see if there was any difference between the two groups in terms of dementia progression, measured by various memory and cognitive tests. The treatment did not appear to offer an advantage, although patients in the Souvenaid group did have slightly less brain shrinkage on scans, which the researchers say is promising because shrinkage in brain regions controlling memory is seen with worsening dementia. But experts remain cautious. Prof Tara Spires-Jones, a dementia expert at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Some of the other tests of brain structure and function were promising, but overall this study indicates that a specific change in nutrition is unlikely to make a large difference to people with Alzheimer's, even in the early stages. ""There is strong evidence that a healthy lifestyle including exercise and a healthy diet can help reduce risk for developing dementia, but once the brain damage starts, a dietary intervention is unlikely to stop the disease."" Another expert, Dr Elizabeth Coulthard from University of Bristol, said people should think carefully before buying something that is, as yet, unproven. Dr David Reynolds, from Alzheimer's Research UK, advised: ""If people are worried about their memory, or are considering buying and taking Souvenaid as a supplement to manage their diet, then it is important that they discuss this with their GP."" A spokeswoman from Nutricia said: ""We are pleased that this adds to the body of evidence for Souvenaid and we remain committed to ongoing and further clinical research.""

The man who keeps venomous monsters,"Those of a fragile disposition should not scroll down this page (spider alert!) This video can not be played Ronald Jenner: ""We want to give people a tension between fear and fascination"" What is the most terrifying creature in the darkest corner of your imagination? I tell you now, it may have to go some to beat this beast. It's a disgusting worm-like organism that grabs you with four metal-reinforced jaws. Once latched in place, these lances inject you with a paralysing venom that also liquefies your flesh, which the worm then proceeds to suck up. Nice. Ok, the critter may not be much longer than your little finger, but the close-up image certainly makes the stomach churn. The ""Gila monster"" has led to a blockbuster drug that is now used to manage diabetes The bloodworm is one of the many ""stars"" that will feature in an exhibition dedicated to venomous animals, set to open at London's Natural History Museum (NHM) next week. Photo of butchered rhino wins top award Whaling's 'uncomfortable' scientific legacy The rock that records how we all got here If you have an aversion to spiders, snakes, ants, wasps, scorpions, and even to the unassuming platypus (yes, it's also venomous) - then I suggest you don't go. But if you're fascinated by evolution and some of the remarkable biochemistry it's managed to cook up over the last half-a-billion years - you're unlikely to be disappointed. And the truth is, we can't escape what's all around us anyway. They say you're never more than six feet from a rat. Well, the same is equally true of venomous creatures or the products and services they provide to us. It's time to face and love the horror. The worm with a Halloween mask: Bloodworms are a favourite of neuroscientists ""If you eat fruit; well, they're pollinated by bees, which are venomous,"" says Dr Ronald Jenner, the NHM's venom evolution expert. ""Figs are pollinated by parasitoid wasps. If you eat squid or octopus - they're venomous. ""They use venoms in cosmetics - face-masks use a synthetic version of a snake peptide that relaxes the muscles. ""You may not know this but your diabetes medicine is most likely a synthetic version of a toxin. ""The red wine you drink has been clarified often with the swim bladders of venomous catfish. They don't put it on the label, but venom's tendrils are in your life. ""The cotton clothes you wear - the only reason we can grow the cotton in such large monocultures is because parasitoid wasps take out all the sap-sucking insects that would otherwise damage the crop. Without venom, we'd be scuppered."" Vampire bats' venom keeps the blood flowing in their victims It's hard not to be enthused by Ronald when he takes you on a tour of his favourite NHM monsters. Thankfully, they're all dead and a good many are behind glass, submerged in preserving liquid, which means you can get a very close look at their weaponry. Venom is a toxin - usually a kind of peptide or large protein - that is actively delivered through a wound via a specialised mechanism, involving teeth, fangs, claws, spurs or a stinger. Believe it or not, there's even a newt that does it with its ribs. It breaks them first, pokes them through glands in its skin and then injects its foe. Masters of the Halloween costume competition: Velvet ants are actually wasps Ronald works a lot with that ugly bloodworm - or the ""worm with a Halloween mask"", as he calls it. It delivers a neurotoxin that has found use in labs across the world to study nerve cell communication. ""When the bloodworm injects a crustacean prey, it causes a spastic paralysis. But what's remarkable is that this effect is reversible,"" he explains. ""Scientists have fractionated the venom to get just that bit that activates cell communication channels. They apply it to the cell culture, study the process of communication, and then wash the effect away with a buffer. It was only this year that we've seen the full molecular structure of this protein and it's huge and unlike anything else in nature."" An Egyptian cobra's paralysing venom can kill but some prey have now evolved resistance Some venoms will jellify the blood so the victim will suffer clots, leading to stroke and rapid death. Some venoms act as an anti-clotting agent. Vampire bats use this strategy so they can keep on sucking from a wound. As gory as all this is, it's easy to see the enormous pharmaceutical potential. The most famous example is probably the Brazilian pit viper whose venom is able to rapidly lower the blood pressure of its victims so they pass out and drop to the ground. The snake's venom showed scientists the way to some of the first angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to treat high-blood pressure in humans. Peacock spider: Nearly every arachnid is venomous Then there's the ""Gila monster"". Its painful bite incorporates a peptide that regulates glucose. AstraZeneca markets a drug based on this molecule called Exenatide, which is used to manage Type II diabetes. Its value runs to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Of course, everyone wants to know what is the most lethal member in Ronald's collection. ""I always get asked what is the worst of the worst"", he says. Comparing venoms is not straightforward because this form of chemical warfare can be highly specialised: what works on one type of prey may be much less effective on another. But the NHM expert clearly has a soft spot for the coastal taipan snake, which is found on the northern coast of Australia and in New Guinea. The komodo dragon uses venom to lower the blood pressure of its victim, inducing shock In toxinology, researchers use a measure called the ""median lethal dose"" to describe a venom's power. ""If the total yield of the strongest venom ever measured in a taipan was delivered in a full bite - that could kill 50% of 3.3 million mice. That's insane,"" says Ronald. Venom delivery as a means to take down prey or to defend against predation has evolved independently about 90 times in nature and now includes some 200,000 living species. That is testament to venom's usefulness. And almost every animal would have the genetic toolkit to evolve the capability. ""You could even make humans venomous,"" chuckles Ronald. ""It would involve selective breeding and might take two millions years - but you could definitely do it. Our saliva would be a good place to start.""

Sacked Catalan leader in Belgium,"Mr Puigdemont has left Catalonia but his portrait was still hanging in government buildings on Monday Sacked Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has gone to Belgium, a lawyer he has hired there says. The lawyer, Paul Bekaert, said he had not gone into hiding and did not confirm whether he would seek asylum. Spain's chief prosecutor has called for rebellion charges to be brought against him and other organisers of Catalonia's banned independence referendum. The Spanish central government took direct control of Catalonia on Monday, replacing sacked officials. It suspended the region's autonomy and called for fresh elections after Mr Puigdemont and his government declared independence last week. On Tuesday, Spain's Guardia Civil - a paramilitary force charged with police duties - raided the offices of the Catalan police force. According to media reports, they searched eight offices for communications relating to the referendum on 1 October. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? The Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, has already been accused of failing to help Guardia Civil officers tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters during the run up to the banned vote. Mr Bekaert said Mr Puigdemont was now in the Belgian capital, Brussels. ""He has full rights to be here, there is nothing against him at this moment,"" he told Flemish public radio. Asked whether the Catalan leader was planning to seek asylum in Belgium he added: ""We're keeping all options open - nothing has been decided."" This video can not be played Catalonia's human towers are said to represent the spirit of its people - when they stick together they can achieve big things Theo Francken, Belgium's immigration minister, said over the weekend that an asylum application was ""not unrealistic"" but Prime Minister Charles Michel later said it was ""absolutely not on the agenda"". Mr Francken, a member of the separatist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party, said last week that Catalan ministers could apply for political asylum in Belgium, adding that he had doubts over whether Mr Puigdemont and others would get a fair trial in Spain. Political commentators in Belgium have suggested that Mr Francken's earlier comments could be seen as an invitation to former Catalan members of parliament to seek asylum in the country. On Monday Spanish media reported that Mr Puigdemont had met Flemish politicians in Brussels. The TV stationLa Sexta reported (in Spanish) that he was there with five of his sacked government's ministers,external: Meritxell Serret, agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, health minister Dolors Bassa, labour minister Meritxell BorrÃ¡s, governance minister Joaquim Forn, interior minister Spain's Attorney General JosÃ© Manuel Maza called for rebellion, sedition and misuse of funds charges to be brought against Catalan leaders. If found guilty of rebellion, Mr Puigdemont could face a jail term of up to 30 years. Under the Spanish legal system, Mr Maza's requests will be considered by a judge. The working day on Monday passed off peacefully, despite some Catalan officials defying instructions from Madrid not to turn up. Any ministers who arrived at their offices were given hours to leave under threat of ""action"" by Catalonia's regional police force, Mossos. Madrid's temporary move to impose direct control by invoking Article 155 of the constitution - a first for Spain - will see as many as 150 of the region's top officials replaced. Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Mr Puigdemont and his vice-president Oriol Junqueras reject the central government's moves, arguing that they can only be removed from office by the citizens of Catalonia. Madrid has called for fresh regional elections on 21 December. A spokeswoman for Mr Puigdemont's PDeCAT party said it would field candidates ""with conviction"". The ex-president could run in new elections if he has not been jailed by then, according to Spain's Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence On Monday, Mr Dastis said he hoped the forthcoming elections would help to ""restore legal governance and rule of law in Catalonia"". Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum, organised by Mr Puigdemont's separatist government, was held on 1 October in defiance of a constitutional court ruling that had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. On Friday the regional parliament declared independence. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of Mr Puigdemont as Catalan leader. Mr Puigdemont has urged ""democratic opposition"" to direct rule from Madrid. This video can not be played Flags in Catalonia and what they mean Does Catalonia want to leave Spain?

Russia posts 'reached 126m Facebook users',"This video can not be played Facebook says hundreds of accounts backed by Russian trolls filled news feeds with inflammatory messages Facebook has said as many as 126 million American users may have seen content uploaded by Russia-based operatives over the past two years. The social networking site said about 80,000 posts were produced before and after the 2016 presidential election. Most of the posts focused on divisive social and political messages. Facebook released the figures ahead of a Senate hearing where it, together with Twitter and Google. will detail Russia's impact on the popular sites. Russia has repeatedly denied allegations that it attempted to influence the last US presidential election, in which Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton. In a separate development on Monday, an investigation by independent counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia produced its first charges against two former aides. It also emerged that a third former aide had pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI. President Trump has dismissed allegations of collusion with Moscow, and has repeatedly called on Mrs Clinton to be investigated. Reality Check: When 126m isn't 126m on Facebook Facebook uncovers 'Russian-funded' misinformation campaign Twitter's Russia briefings 'inadequate' Can US election hack be traced to Russia? LISTEN: Russian-backed Facebook post row in a minute Facebook says some 80,000 posts were published between June 2015 and August 2017 and were seen by about 29 million Americans directly, according to a draft of prepared remarks seen by US media ahead of Tuesday's Senate judiciary committee hearing. These posts, which Facebook says were created by a Kremlin-linked company, were amplified through likes, shares and comments and spread to tens of millions more people. Facebook also said it had deleted 170 Instagram accounts, which posted about 120,000 pieces of content. ""These actions run counter to Facebook's mission of building community and everything we stand for,"" wrote Facebook's general counsel Colin Stretch. ""And we are determined to do everything we can to address this new threat."" In a blog post from earlier this month,external, Facebook's Elliot Schrage said that many of the posts did not violate the company's content policies. They were removed, he said, because they were inauthentic - the Russians behind the posts did not identify themselves as such. A post counts as reaching someone when it's shown in Facebook News Feeds, so this figure takes no account of the number of people who may or may not have actually read it. We do not know therefore how many of those 126 million people actually consumed the 80,000 posts and consequently how many of these were influential in terms of affecting voters. Clearly, a mass targeting of posts can have a subliminal impact on people but it is hard to evaluate with any certainty based on the data we have seen so far. This Facebook page - which has been linked to Russia - was liked by more than 120,000 people before it was blocked For now, Facebook, Twitter and Google have opted not to make the suspected Russian-backed ads and accounts public. However, several purported examples have been been identified by others. One is a Facebook page called Heart of Texas. Many of its early posts were innocuous memes designed to appeal to patriotic locals. But once it hadattracted thousands of followers,external, it began claiming a victory for Hillary Clinton would attract ""refugees, mosques, and terrorist attacks"". Another case involved the appropriation of the name of a long-established Muslim group,which then posted false claims about Senator John McCain,externalfunding the Islamic State group. Other examples masqueraded as being from gun-rights campaigners, gay rights supporters, Black Lives Matter activistsand dog-lovers,external.

The man who keeps venemous monsters,"Those of a fragile disposition should not scroll down this page (spider alert!) This video can not be played Ronald Jenner: ""We want to give people a tension between fear and fascination"" What is the most terrifying creature in the darkest corner of your imagination? I tell you now, it may have to go some to beat this beast. It's a disgusting worm-like organism that grabs you with four metal-reinforced jaws. Once latched in place, these lances inject you with a paralysing venom that also liquefies your flesh, which the worm then proceeds to suck up. Nice. Ok, the critter may not be much longer than your little finger, but the close-up image certainly makes the stomach churn. The ""Gila monster"" has led to a blockbuster drug that is now used to manage diabetes The bloodworm is one of the many ""stars"" that will feature in an exhibition dedicated to venomous animals, set to open at London's Natural History Museum (NHM) next week. Photo of butchered rhino wins top award Whaling's 'uncomfortable' scientific legacy The rock that records how we all got here If you have an aversion to spiders, snakes, ants, wasps, scorpions, and even to the unassuming platypus (yes, it's also venomous) - then I suggest you don't go. But if you're fascinated by evolution and some of the remarkable biochemistry it's managed to cook up over the last half-a-billion years - you're unlikely to be disappointed. And the truth is, we can't escape what's all around us anyway. They say you're never more than six feet from a rat. Well, the same is equally true of venomous creatures or the products and services they provide to us. It's time to face and love the horror. The worm with a Halloween mask: Bloodworms are a favourite of neuroscientists ""If you eat fruit; well, they're pollinated by bees, which are venomous,"" says Dr Ronald Jenner, the NHM's venom evolution expert. ""Figs are pollinated by parasitoid wasps. If you eat squid or octopus - they're venomous. ""They use venoms in cosmetics - face-masks use a synthetic version of a snake peptide that relaxes the muscles. ""You may not know this but your diabetes medicine is most likely a synthetic version of a toxin. ""The red wine you drink has been clarified often with the swim bladders of venomous catfish. They don't put it on the label, but venom's tendrils are in your life. ""The cotton clothes you wear - the only reason we can grow the cotton in such large monocultures is because parasitoid wasps take out all the sap-sucking insects that would otherwise damage the crop. Without venom, we'd be scuppered."" Vampire bats' venom keeps the blood flowing in their victims It's hard not to be enthused by Ronald when he takes you on a tour of his favourite NHM monsters. Thankfully, they're all dead and a good many are behind glass, submerged in preserving liquid, which means you can get a very close look at their weaponry. Venom is a toxin - usually a kind of peptide or large protein - that is actively delivered through a wound via a specialised mechanism, involving teeth, fangs, claws, spurs or a stinger. Believe it or not, there's even a newt that does it with its ribs. It breaks them first, pokes them through glands in its skin and then injects its foe. Masters of the Halloween costume competition: Velvet ants are actually wasps Ronald works a lot with that ugly bloodworm - or the ""worm with a Halloween mask"", as he calls it. It delivers a neurotoxin that has found use in labs across the world to study nerve cell communication. ""When the bloodworm injects a crustacean prey, it causes a spastic paralysis. But what's remarkable is that this effect is reversible,"" he explains. ""Scientists have fractionated the venom to get just that bit that activates cell communication channels. They apply it to the cell culture, study the process of communication, and then wash the effect away with a buffer. It was only this year that we've seen the full molecular structure of this protein and it's huge and unlike anything else in nature."" An Egyptian cobra's paralysing venom can kill but some prey have now evolved resistance Some venoms will jellify the blood so the victim will suffer clots, leading to stroke and rapid death. Some venoms act as an anti-clotting agent. Vampire bats use this strategy so they can keep on sucking from a wound. As gory as all this is, it's easy to see the enormous pharmaceutical potential. The most famous example is probably the Brazilian pit viper whose venom is able to rapidly lower the blood pressure of its victims so they pass out and drop to the ground. The snake's venom showed scientists the way to some of the first angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to treat high-blood pressure in humans. Peacock spider: Nearly every arachnid is venomous Then there's the ""Gila monster"". Its painful bite incorporates a peptide that regulates glucose. AstraZeneca markets a drug based on this molecule called Exenatide, which is used to manage Type II diabetes. Its value runs to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Of course, everyone wants to know what is the most lethal member in Ronald's collection. ""I always get asked what is the worst of the worst"", he says. Comparing venoms is not straightforward because this form of chemical warfare can be highly specialised: what works on one type of prey may be much less effective on another. But the NHM expert clearly has a soft spot for the coastal taipan snake, which is found on the northern coast of Australia and in New Guinea. The komodo dragon uses venom to lower the blood pressure of its victim, inducing shock In toxinology, researchers use a measure called the ""median lethal dose"" to describe a venom's power. ""If the total yield of the strongest venom ever measured in a taipan was delivered in a full bite - that could kill 50% of 3.3 million mice. That's insane,"" says Ronald. Venom delivery as a means to take down prey or to defend against predation has evolved independently about 90 times in nature and now includes some 200,000 living species. That is testament to venom's usefulness. And almost every animal would have the genetic toolkit to evolve the capability. ""You could even make humans venomous,"" chuckles Ronald. ""It would involve selective breeding and might take two millions years - but you could definitely do it. Our saliva would be a good place to start.""
