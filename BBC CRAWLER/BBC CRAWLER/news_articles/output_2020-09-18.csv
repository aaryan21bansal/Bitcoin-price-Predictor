New Covid-19 rules for more parts of North and Midlands,"People will not be able to socialise with others in their homes or gardens Tighter restrictions will come into force in Lancashire, Merseyside, parts of the Midlands and West Yorkshire after significantÂ increases in Covid-19 cases, the government has said. The new rules ban separate households from meeting each other at home or in private gardens. Pubs and restaurants must also shut early in parts of Lancashire and Merseyside. The measures will come into force from Tuesday. On Friday, the UK recorded a further 4,322 confirmed cases of coronavirus - the first time the daily total of positive tests has exceeded 4,000 since 8 May. Another 27 deaths were also reported within 28 days of a positive test. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned the UK isnow seeing an ""inevitable"" second waveof infections. He said he did not ""want to go into bigger lockdown measures"" but tighter social distancing restrictions might be necessary. Nearly 4.7 million people will be affected by thenew rules. The measures to curb the spread of the virus have been introduced across parts of the North West, Midlands and West Yorkshire. This includes Lancashire (excluding Blackpool), Merseyside and the Cheshire boroughs of Warrington and Halton. New restrictions are also being put in place inWolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston in Leicestershire, and all parts ofBradford, Kirklees and Calderdale. Some areas of West Yorkshire had already been subject to restrictions implemented at the start of August but they were eased. They are now subject to these new rules. Which areas face new covid restrictions? National virus rules considered How do I get a test? The new Covid-19 measures will come into force from Tuesday Residents are not allowed to socialise in their homes or private gardens in: Lancashire (excluding Blackpool) Merseyside, Warrington and Halton Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale Pubs must shut between 22:00 and 05:00 and offer table service only in: Lancashire (excluding Blackpool), Merseyside, Warrington and Halton Residents are asked only to use public transport for ""essential purposes"" in: Lancashire (excluding Blackpool) Merseyside, Warrington and Halton Residents are asked to avoid attending amateur or semi-professional sports events as spectators: Lancashire (excluding Blackpool) Merseyside, Warrington and Halton Support bubbles will not be affected by the new rules. Analysis -By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit We have been used to seeing Blackburn with Darwen towards the top of the list of areas with high rates of new coronavirus infections for some time, along with other parts of east Lancashire. Now the rules affect the whole county apart from Blackpool. Based on the latest data published by the government on Friday for the week to 15 September, Blackpool, with 48 cases per 100,000 people, has fewer new infections than some parts of the county but is still above places like Lancaster and Ribble Valley, which are at 23 and 30 per 100,000. Infection rates in Lancashire are highest in Hyndburn (144 per 100,000) and Preston (139 per 100,000) Wolverhampton's appearance in the lockdown list comes after neighbouring Sandwell, itself a neighbour of Birmingham, saw households told to stop meeting. It recorded 48 cases per 100,000, down on the week before but up from just 12 per 100,000 in the last week of August. Calderdale's rate was 45 per 100,000 but the other areas of West Yorkshire affected - Bradford and Kirklees, recorded 97 and 69 per 100,000 respectively. Jessica Burns described the lockdown in Lancashire as ""laughable"". Jessica Burns, 30, from Lancaster, said the rules were ""confusing and unclear"". ""I haven't hugged my mum, dad, sisters or grandparents since March,"" she said. ""I work in Barrow-in-Furness which has a higher rate but that is not under and regulations either. ""The inconsistencies are what make people not take it as seriously as they should."" The mayor of Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, said these restrictions would be ""difficult for us all"" but ""we must do everything we can to curb rising infection rates and protect our families"". In Warrington, council leader Russ Bowden urged people not to have ""one more big night out"" before the new measures were introduced on Tuesday. While Lancashire County Council's director of public health Dr Sakthi Karunanithi said: ""don't go flocking to Blackpool thinking the rules don't apply"". In Pendle, officials have asked the government to relax Covid-19 restrictions after they ""kept a lid"" on rising numbers of cases. Council leader Mohammed Iqbal said he was ""disappointed to find local people are continuing to have to follow tighter measures here because more people are testing positive in other areas"". Kirklees Council leader Shabir Pandor said ""frequent changes"" in restrictions could impact effectiveness and also people's mental health. He said Kirklees' Outbreak Control Board had also written to the government to ask them to ""reconsider this decision"". The leader of Wolverhampton council Ian Brookfield welcomed the area's new restrictions, saying: ""We need to break this cycle."" Neighbouring Sandwell, Birmingham and Solihull have already hadsimilar restrictionsintroduced.

Bolton, which has the highest number of cases in the country, alsobrought in extra measureson 8 September, restricting restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs to takeaway only, and requiring all hospitality venues to close at 22:00. People in Oldham, Blackburn with Darwen and Pendle in Lancashireshould also not meet anyone from outside their household outdoors.,external The government said these tightened restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester and Lancashire would continue. Restrictions were alsobrought in overnightacross large parts of north-east England, affecting almost two million people. A request byLeeds City Council for a curfew on pubs and barswas rejected. The government introducedthe rule of sixacross England on Monday.

Amal Clooney quits UK envoy role over Brexit plan,"Amal Clooney has quit her role as the UK's envoy on press freedom ""in dismay"" at the government's willingness to break international law over Brexit. The human rights lawyer said it was ""lamentable"" for Boris Johnson to be contemplating overriding the Brexit agreement he signed last year. She could not tell others to honour legal obligations when the UK ""declares it does not intend to do so itself"". The PM says he does not want to use the powers in the Internal Market Bill. But he says the legislation is necessary to give the government the power to protect the UK and, particularly, Northern Ireland if trade talks fail and the EU acts ""unreasonably"". In her resignation letter, Mrs Clooney, who is married to Hollywood actor George Clooney, said she had accepted the job last year because of the UK's historic role in upholding the international legal order. NI told to start work on checkpoints at sea ports Brexit bill compromise 'not enough' - Lord Howard Why Brexit is still a big issue But she said the government's attempts to pass the Internal Market Bill, which passed its first hurdle in the Commons last week, made her position ""untenable"". She said she had decided to quit after speaking to foreign secretary Dominic Raab and getting ""no assurance that any change of position is imminent"". She added: ""It is lamentable for the UK to be speaking of its intention to violate an international treaty signed by the prime minister less than a year ago. ""It has become untenable for me, as Special Envoy, to urge other states to respect and enforce international obligations while the UK declares that it does not intend to do so itself."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says it was âthe right decision"" for the âfirst-class lawyerâ to stand down. Mrs Clooney was appointed by Jeremy Hunt, Mr Raab's predecessor, during the final months of Theresa May's government and continued in the role after Boris Johnson took over in No 10. She was the deputy chair of the high-level panel of legal experts which works with the UK and Canadian governments on their campaign to promote media freedom around the world. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who used to practice in the same barristers' chambers as Ms Clooney, said she had taken the right decision. ""I know Amal and she is a first class lawyer. I'm not surprised that she has quit because, like others, she's concluded that there is a conflict between a breach of international law - which the government seems intent on - and our reputation as a country in the world that abides by the rule of law,"" he said. Her resignation adds to a growing list of senior legal figures who have quit their roles in disquiet at the government's position. Lord Keen resigned as Advocate General for Scotlandon Wednesday, saying he found it ""increasingly difficult to reconcile"" his obligations as a lawyer with provisions in the legislation. The government's most senior legal adviser -Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the government legal department- had already resigned, as had the UK's envoy for the protection of religious freedoms, Tory MP Rehman Chishti. The EU has demanded the government removes sections of the Bill which would give the UK the power to override agreements on the movement of goods between Northern Ireland and Britain and subsidies for NI companies. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted the powers, if they were ever used, would break the UK's treaty obligations under international law in a ""specific and limited"" way. The prime minister has sought to quell a potential rebellion by Tory MPs next week by promising critics that the Commons will get a specific vote on the powers before the government can use them. But former Conservative leader Lord Howard has said the PM needs to go further, saying it was a matter of principle and he doubted whether the Lords would back the bill as it stands.

Two more areas 'under close watch' as cases rise,"This video can not be played Merthyr and Newport under 'close watchâ Two more areas have been put under ""close watch"" as coronavirus cases in Wales rise. Infection rates have risen from 20 per 100,000 people to 35 per 100,000 in the past week, First Minister Mark Drakeford said. He also said the ""developing situation"" in Newport and Merthyr Tydfil was being kept under ""close watch"". Currently, restrictions are in place for people living in Caerphilly county and Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT). Latest figures from Public Health Wales show RCT (83.7 cases per 100,000) has now overtaken Caerphilly (73.5) as having the highest case rate in the last week. Both Newport and Merthyr Tydfil were among areas of concern for health officials. In terms of the UK, Caerphilly has been estimated as being sixth hardest-hit area, when comparable data was analysed by the BBC for the last week. RCT was 13th, Newport was 35th and Merthyr Tydfil was 36th. Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, of Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, said there had also been ""a sharp increase of cases"" in Bridgend county borough. ""This is a real cause for concern and this developing situation is being monitored very closely,"" he added. Care home visits in the county - both indoors and outdoors -  are being put on hold temporarily in response to the growing spread of covid in the area, Bridgend council said. Virtual and online visits will be encouraged, and allowances will be made in circumstances where residents are nearing the end of their lives and with appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements in place. The R rate is also between 0.7 and 1.2, with Mr Drakeford saying government officials were ""confident it is above one"". That figure is critical as it means each infected person infects at least one other, meaning cases will rise rather than fall over time. However, asked about the prospect of a Wales-wide lockdown like the one being considered in England, Mr Drakeford said the picture was varied with cases ""going down and not up"" in some areas. Why are we looking at the 'R number' in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Where might the next Welsh Covid-19 lockdown be? Mr Drakeford also pledged more tests would be available next week that will be processed by the Welsh NHS. Some tests are currently processed by the Welsh NHS, and others by so-called ""lighthouse labs"" run on a UK-wide basis. But problems have been reported over the past week with difficulties in accessing tests and delays in getting results from lighthouse labs. Mr Drakeford said it ""simply did not make sense"" that the UK booking system had led to people from England being directed to a testing centre in Abercynon, which was intended for people living in locked-down Rhondda Cynon Taf. Caerphilly went into lockdown last week The first minister also revealed he had only had one brief conversation with Prime Minister Boris Johnson since May. ""This is simply unacceptable to anyone who believes that we ought to be facing the coronavirus crisis together,"" he said, calling for more regular meetings. Mr Drakeford said there was a ""vacancy at the heart of the United Kingdom"", adding: ""It needs urgently to be filled, so we can talk to each other, share information, pool ideas and demonstrate a determination that the whole of the country can face these challenges together at this most difficult time."" A UK government spokesman responded by saying: ""We have confronted this virus as one United Kingdom, working with the devolved administrations and local partners to get through the pandemic."" He said there had been hundreds of calls and meetings, adding: ""This will continue to be a key part of the planning and communication of the overall response."" Mr Drakeford also said claims health minister Vaughan Gething gave incorrect information linking Covid-19 cases to a trip to Doncaster races were ""a complete red herring"". Mr Gething mentioned the trip, made by a group of 15 people from Abercynon earlier this month, when he announced the lockdown in Rhondda Cynon Taf on Wednesday. During a televised press conference, he said examples of clusters of coronavirus cases in RCT including one associated ""with a club outing to the Doncaster races, which stopped off at a series of pubs on the way"". The racecourse has since confirmed the group did not attend any events there, and did not have tickets, although it has also emerged the group did visit the town of Doncaster. This video can not be played Donna Clifton's partner went on the trip and returned with Covid-19 Mr Drakeford said: ""Many, many people come to the rugby in Cardiff without having a ticket for the rugby or having any intention of going to the match. The fact that people didn't go to the races is really a complete red herring in this argument. ""What is undoubtedly the case is that a group of people went to Doncaster and many of them came back infected with coronavirus, and in the local contact tracing effort that has had to be taken into account in explaining and accounting for the rise in the numbers of coronavirus in the RCT area. ""Surely that is the issue, not whether people actually went to the races or not."" This video can not be played Wales lockdown: What did minister say about Doncaster? Strict new rules came into force on Thursday evening for RCT residents after a spike in Covid-19 cases there, making it the second local authority area in Wales to go under lockdownfollowing Caerphilly last week. Its 240,000 residents are not be able to enter or leave the county without a reasonable excuse. Pontypridd is one of the main towns in Rhondda Cynon Taf where restrictions have been brought in Health officials say hospital admissions will increase further if people ignore the latest restrictions. ""It's a very rapidly changing picture,"" said Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, director of public health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, which covers Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), Merthyr Tydfil and Bridgend. ""At this time last week, we really didn't have any significant cases in the hospital, but that's changed."" He said they were now dealing with a ""handful"" of cases. ""We always knew that once community transmission got sustained, we will begin to pick up cases in the hospital,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales' Breakfast programme. A mobile testing site set up in Abercynon witnessed long queues on Thursday ""So it's exactly what we expected. It's probably going to increase in the hospital now if we do not to take additional measures, but we are doing so at this point."" Health officials said the initial wave of infections appears to have been in younger people. ""But it's only a matter of time before it seeps into the older population, who are more likely to be vulnerable, who are more likely to become ill if they do get it, and therefore end up in hospital,"" added Dr Nnoaham. Public Health Wales warned on Thursday that ""there may be more deaths in the coming days"" with both RCT and Caerphilly county in local lockdowns. Figures released on Thursdayrevealed more than half of all Covid-19 hospital admissions in Wales were in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, which covers Caerphilly and Newport, and Cwm Taf Morgannwg. Mr Gething said there had been a ""rapid"" rise in cases in RCT, with 82.1 infections per 100,000 people over the past seven days. The latest equivalent figure across Wales was 21.4 per 100,000. Wednesday's rate of positive tests for the past week in RCT was 5.1% - the highest in Wales. Mr Gething previously warned a positive rate of 4% across Wales would trigger a national lockdown. The Wales average is 2.4%.

Puppy prices soar during lockdown,"Google searches for ""puppies for sale"" rose rapidly during lockdown The price of puppies has more than doubled during lockdown with dogs costing almost Â£1,900 on average. Popular breeds have seen even sharper price increases, and puppies are often selling for Â£3,000 or more, according to a leading online marketplace. Animal welfare charities have warned high prices could encourage ""puppy farming"", smuggling or dog theft. They are also concerned that it could lead to a dog welfare crisis as people return to work away from the home. Interest in getting a pet rose hugely after lockdown in late March, with high demand prompting many breeders to raise their prices. Figures from the Pets4Homes website, based on about 150,000 adverts, showed the average price being asked from March to September was Â£1,883. During the same period last year the average price was Â£888. Cocker spaniels saw the highest year-on-year inflation (184%) followed by Jack Russells (180%), cockapoos (168%) and border collies (163%). Cavapoos - a cavalier spaniel and poodle crossbreed - now cost about Â£2,800 on average while English or American bulldogs typically sell for about Â£2,700. More than 1,600 dogs on the website are currently priced in excess of Â£3,000. Joanna remembers the excitement of first holding Poppy in her arms six years ago - but prices have risen sharply Since leaving her parents' home a year ago Joanna Birrell has been desperately missing Poppy and Mila, the two Eurasier dogs she grew up with. Joanna is now living in Elderslie in Renfrewshire, where she works from home. As she is unlikely to return to the office any time soon, she thought now would be a good time to get a puppy. ""I've always wanted a dog since I moved out -  Mila, Poppy and me were like sisters,"" she said. ""I'm always in the house so it would be a chance to get out with the dog. I need a reason to get out."" Nine years ago when her parents bought Mila they paid about Â£500. Three years later Poppy cost them Â£1,000. When Joanna started looking for puppies the prices came as a shock. ""All the prices are Â£2,000 to Â£3,000 - or more,"" she said. One seller advertising online offered to sell her a puppy for Â£3,500 but Joanna soon became suspicious. ""She wasn't a registered breeder - it turned out to be a puppy farm,"" she said. ""She wouldn't let me travel down to see the dog. She wanted to send it to me by courier  - so alarm bells started ringing."" Joanna has now found a recommended breeder willing to reserve her a pup from a future litter. She has agreed to pay about Â£2,000. Lee Gibson, from Pets4Homes, said between April and June visits to the website peaked at 20 million a month - double last year's figure. He said: ""I think people had more time at home -  and with their children. They knew they could put the time and effort into training a dog. And secondly, there was a need for companionships. For many people lockdown has been a lonely time."" The website acts as an online marketplace, with the dog breeders themselves determining what prices to charge. ""During this period there wasn't a huge increase in the numbers of puppies available - so it's simply the economics of supply and demand,"" he said. Claire Calder, from the Dogs Trust rescue charity, said lockdown had created a ""perfect storm"" for puppy sales with many people thinking this is the ideal time to take on a pet - but she's worried about the future. ""We're expecting a dog welfare crisis further down the line  - an increase in abandonment as people go back to work,"" she said. ""The economic situation also means that some people may find they can't afford to look after a dog."" This puppy was one of six found, covered in oil, in the back of a van that arrived from Romania Another danger is that high prices will further encourage the illegal importation of puppies or heavily pregnant dogs from smuggling hotspots in eastern or central Europe. Even at the height of lockdown, she says it was ""business as usual"" for puppy smugglers - with dozens of rescued pups coming into the charity's  care. Puppy farming reports increase five-fold Six puppies found in the back of a van which arrived in Dover from Romaniahad to be shaved because they were covered in oil. Smuggled puppies are often in poor health or poorly socialised because of their early life experiences. Last month two spaniel puppieswere found dying by the roadside in Lockerbie,  Dumfries and Galloway.It's believed they had been brought into the country at the port of Cairnryan, then dumped by puppy traffickers when they became unwell during the journey. Many dogs advertised for sale are not what they seem - the Dogs Trust calls this ""dogfishing"" and offers this advice: Always see puppy and their mum together at their home and make sure to visit more than once, even if it is via video call due to coronavirus restrictions. Never pay a deposit up-front without seeing the puppy in person. Ask lots of questions and make sure you see all vital paperwork, such as a puppy contract - which gives lots of information about their parents, breed, health, diet, the puppy's experiences and more. If you have any doubts or feel pressured to buy, as hard as it may be, walk away and report the seller to Trading Standards. Mike Flynn, from the Scottish SPCA animal charity, foresees another problem as new dog owners return to work. ""Many of these puppies will have grown up with people at home all the time,"" he said. ""Then all of sudden that comes to an end and dogs become bored or anxious because they're used to people being there. ""Canine behaviourists are going to be in for a busy time."" The coronavirus restrictions disrupted the charity's rehoming services - but that is now back up and running and he's hoping would-be dog owners will consider taking on an adult dog. ""Every dog we rehome is vet-checked - you know you're going to get a healthy animal. There are always unwanted dogs in the system, often through no fault of their own, perhaps because their owner is unable to look after them anymore."" The latest data suggests interest in owning a dog is starting to plateau with website traffic returning to more normal levels. Whether puppy prices return to pre-lockdown levels remains to be seen.

Appeal judges quash 'pick-up artist' conviction,"Adnan Ahmed was convicted of five counts of threatening and abusive behaviour towards young women A so-called pickup artist who was jailed for targeting young women has had his conviction quashed on appeal. Adnan Ahmed -  who called himself Addy A-game - secretly filmed himself approaching women in Glasgow and South Lanarkshire. The 39-year-old was convicted last October of threatening and abusive behaviour towards five women. But three judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal have now ruled the verdict was a miscarriage of justice. Police Scotland launched an investigation after his actions were revealed by the BBC's The Social in 2019. The self-styled ""lifestyle coach"" would approach women in the street, often secretly filming the encounter and posting videos offering advice to other men. In the videos, he offered tips on how to overcome ""last-minute resistance"" to sex. Mr Ahmed also included audio apparently recorded during sex. Five young women, aged between 16 and 21, gave evidence at his trial - saying that they been intimidated by Mr Ahmed in Glasgow city centre and in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire. This video can not be played Adnan Ahmed, also known as Addy A-game, approaches women in the street After a jury found him guilty, Sheriff Lindsay Wood sentenced Mr Ahmed, of Maryhill, Glasgow, to two years in prison. He was also put on the sex offenders register for 10 years. But lawyers acting for Mr Ahmed told the Court of Criminal Appeal earlier this year that Sheriff Wood conducted an inappropriate ""cross examination"" of their client when he finished giving evidence. Defence advocate Claire Mitchell QC said the questions asked by Sheriff Wood to Mr Ahmed ""would have led the independent observer to reach the view that the sheriff had formed an adverse view of his credibility"". She added that Sheriff Wood's conduct resulted in her client being denied a fair and impartial trial. In awritten judgement,externalissued on Friday, the three judges agreed. Lord Turnbull wrote: ""The trial sheriff engaged in an exercise which could only be described as cross-examination. ""The informed and impartial observer would readily have concluded that the sheriff had formed an adverse view on the credibility of the appellant's evidence. ""The result was a miscarriage of justice and the appeal against conviction on each charge must be upheld on this ground."" Adnan Ahmed, appearing here in one of his online videos, claimed they were educational A BBC investigation into Mr Ahmed's activities revealed he was part of a global network of ""pick-up artists"" who practise what they call ""game"". YouTube has since removed hundreds of videos and deactivated two channels run by Addy A-Game and another group called Street Attraction. Mr Ahmed's legal team also told the appeal court that Sheriff Wood failed to properly explain the rules of corroboration to jurors in the case. Ms Mitchell also told the court that the sheriff was wrong to reject a defence motion to have some of the charges thrown out on the basis that there wasn't enough evidence to allow jurors to return guilty verdicts. In his report to the appeal court, Sheriff Wood said he believed there was enough evidence on these charges to be considered by the jurors. But the judges disagreed and said the evidence did not show that Mr Ahmed was guilty of threatening behaviour. Lord Turnbull wrote: ""It does not seem to us that a polite conversational request or compliment can be construed as threatening merely because it is uninvited or unwelcome."" The appeal judges also criticised Sheriff Wood for his actions when Mr Ahmed's lawyers attempted to object to the questions asked by the judge. Sheriff Wood told Mr Ahmed's representative to sit down. Lord Turnbull wrote: ""In the present case counsel was correct to object to the sheriff's questioning when she did. ""It is unacceptable for a judicial office holder to address a responsible practitioner by telling her to sit down. ""Such behaviour carries the risk of demeaning the standing of the judiciary in the eyes of both the legal profession and of the public.""

Jo Malone denounces former brand's Boyega decision,"Jo Malone said her former company's treatment of John Boyega was ""despicable"" Jo Malone has criticised the perfume brand bearing her name for their treatment of the actor John Boyega. Malone is no longer personally associated with the company, having sold it to Estee Lauder in 1999. The company, Jo Malone London, apologised after replacing the Star Wars actor in an aftershave advert for the Chinese market. ""I am so horrified and disgusted about what has been done to John,"" Malone told ITV's Lorraine on Friday. ""How dare somebody treat him [like that], and he finds out he is replaced on social media?

While the script for the aftershave commercial - which was originally conceived and directed by the British star - remained largely the same, it saw him replaced by another actor, Liu Haoran. This video can not be played Spot the difference: John Boyega advert and the Chinese version The original version, entitled London Gent, showed Boyega hanging out with friends and family in Peckham, where he grew up, but they were also removed for Chinese audiences.

The firm issued an apology to Boyega on Monday, saying: ""We deeply apologise for what, on our end, was a mistake in the local execution of the John Boyega campaign.""

Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei says he has tested positive for coronavirus. Speaking to a local radio station on Friday, Mr Giammattei, 64, said he had taken a test - his sixth - and the results had come back positive, the Republica newspaper reported. Mr Giammattei did not say if he was suffering any symptoms. It was later announced that the entire cabinet would be tested and would work from home. Guatemala has recorded more than 83,600 infections and just over 3,000 coronavirus-related deaths, according to a tally byJohns Hopkins University,external. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Prague Zoo has announced it is closing its popular ""Indonesian Jungle"" exhibit from Saturday as there is a risk of the orangutan and the macaque monkeys catching Covid-19 from visitors. In the exhibit, which this correspondent knows well, visitors first walk through a mock cave where bats fly overhead, before emerging into an Indonesian rainforest with various animals including an orangutan and several macaques. The exhibit housing the lemurs will also be closed. Zoo director Miroslav Bobek said that as primates, the animals were at risk of contracting Covid-19 from visitors, who are not separated from the animals by glass. The Czech Republic has so far recorded 45,228 coronavirus infections and 494 related deaths. Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check US President Donald Trump has said that Democratic-run states - known as blue states - are
to blame for America's high coronavirus death toll. âIf you take the blue states out,â Mr Trump said at a White House
briefing earlier this week, âweâre at a level that I donât think anybody in the
world would be at. Weâre really at a very low level.â He repeated a similar claim at a rally in Wisconsin on Thursday. âTake New York and some of these other Democrat-run states out of
it, youâll see numbers that are unbelievable.â The Democratic National Committee tweeted in response: âCovid isn't a red state or blue state issue.â Out of the five states that have the largest numbers of coronavirus
deaths two are Republican-run ""red states"" - Texas and Florida. It's true that in the early stage of the outbreak states run by the Democrats like New
York and New Jersey were the worst hit. But as the pandemic has progressed, Republican-led states have
contributed a greater proportion of fatalities. The Washington Post has calculated that so far,53% of deaths have occurred in blue states and 47% in red ones.,external Itâs also difficult to compare
states, because they've taken different approaches to locking down, and they have different
demographic breakdowns, including on age, race and social class.

On Friday, the UK recorded a further 4,322 confirmed cases of coronavirus and the government's scientific advisers say there is widespread growth of the epidemic across the country. The PM spoke to reporters at the Vaccine Manufacturing
and Innovation Centre construction site in Harwell, Oxfordshire The Quebec government will now have police patrol bars and restaurants to ensure coronavirus regulations are being followed. Police will be sent to 1,000 establishments across the province, concentrating on hotspots like the city of Montreal. Bars and restaurants reopened for indoor dining in the city of Montreal in late June, when cases were declining. But cases have been surging in Quebec and across the country this week. Quebec had 297 new cases on Friday, up from 251 Thursday, making the weekly average 312. On Friday, Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois leader Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet, who heads up Quebec's nationalist federal party, tested positive for Covid-19. In Ontario, the most populous province, there were 401 new cases on Friday, up from 293 the day before, its single biggest day-of spike since June.  Here's some more detail of what is understood to have been discussed in the meeting chaired by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and attended by health officials. The account of the meeting shared with the BBC says the governmentâsshielding policyis ""being actively reviewed"", and a decision could come soon on further measures to protect the vulnerable. Any further shielding decisions are expected to take a much more tailored approach than before. With the virus expected to be more severe over the winter, officials are looking at bringing in measures that could last until the spring. Government sources confirmed discussions have been had, but nothing has yet been signed off or agreed. A new âthree tierâ approach to coronavirus restrictions
has been discussed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and government
officials, the BBC understands. The system would involve three tiers - the first
of which is the level of measures in most places across England now, with
social distancing the primary key aspect. The second tier would involve what is currently imposed in the North East of England - curfews on hospitality venues and a ban on
meeting with other households. The final third tier would involve stricter
lockdown measures. Itâs thought it is likely âtier twoâ may be put in place across the UK - albeit framed in a region-by-region basis rather than as
a ânational curfew"". The system was discussed at a meeting chaired by the health secretary, and attended by Englandâs
Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty, his two deputy chief medical
officers, the head of the Test and Trace programme, Dido Harding, and local
public health officials. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent The Irish Cabinet has agreed to tighten restrictions in Dublin because of rising levels of Covid-19. From midnight tonight for the next three weeks, people are discouraged from leaving the city unless for essential reasons. They are again being asked to work from home where possible and only to make essential journeys on public transport.
Restaurants and pubs that serve food will for the next three weeks only be allowed to have guests outdoors or provide a take-away service. You can read more about the Dublin restrictionshere. Boris Johnson, asked if the government had eased lockdown too quickly, suggested discipline in adhering to social distancing restrictions had slipped. ""If you look at what's happened over the last few months, I think the British people have done a amazing job,"" he said. ""They got that peak under control, they
brought it right down, they brought the number of infections right down by
discipline and everybody adjusting our behaviours and the way we go about our
lives - hands, face, space. ""And I think probably, truth to tell,
what's happened here and what alas has happened in so many other countries is
that people find it difficult to keep this up."" He said it was ""very difficult to maintain that
kind of discipline for a long time"". And if the""rule of six""in England or the tighter restrictions in parts of the UK do not work in curbing the spread of the virus, ""then of course we are going to have to take further measures"", the prime minister said. ""But be in no doubt that we
will want to be explaining what we are doing, taking people with us as we go
and what I don't want to do is go into a second national lockdown of the kind
we had in March, April - I don't want to do that again."" Boris Johnson was speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford The UK prime minister continued: ""I don't want to go into bigger lockdown measures at all, we want to keep schools open and it is fantastic the schools have gone back in the way they have. ""What I can certainly say about parents and schools is we want to keep the schools open, that is going to happen ""We want to try and keep all parts of the economy open as far as we possibly can."" He said his government was ""looking at what we can do to intensify things that help bring the rate of infection down"". ""What I will say is, as we go forward, we will be explaining in great detail to people what the scientific background is, what the epidemiology is saying and really how we propose to do it,"" he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK is ""seeing the start of a second wave coming in"" of Covid-19 infections. Speaking in Oxfordshire, Mr Johnson said it had been ""inevitable"" the UK would see a rise in cases. ""I don't want to go into bigger lockdown measures at all,"" he said, but added: ""Clearly when you look at what is happening you've got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in."" The UK PM said a second lockdown is the ""last thing anybody wants"" but said the current measures would need to be kept ""under review"". His comments come after the government's scientific advisers said there is nowwidespread growth of the virus across the UK. Madrid's healthcare system has been under growing pressure The Spanish capital, Madrid, has announced a partial lockdown affecting hundreds of thousands of citizens as authorities try to bring a surge of coronavirus cases under control. From Monday, more than 855,000 people living in 26 areas of the city will only be allowed in or out of their zones for essential reasons such as work, school, or to care for dependants, city chief Isabel Diaz Ayuso told reporters. Eleven other municipalities in the Madrid region are also affected. Social gatherings will be limited to six people, down from 10, and public parks will remain closed. ""Reports indicate that most contagions are occurring in private settings, in personal relationships between families and friends,"" Ms Diaz Ayuso said. ""We are obliged to take these measures in these specific areas. If we did not do so, we run the risk of it being spread to the whole of Madrid. We have time to avoid it."" Madrid is the epicentre of the latest outbreak affecting Spain. Latest figures show 659 cases per 100,000 people in the Madrid region - more than double the national average of 260 infections. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter With the introduction of new local restrictions and reports
that the government is considering tighter rules in England, rumours are
understandably spreading online. Many of us are worried, frustrated and confused - about the
changes and about the future. That means itâs a fertile time for misinformation. Here are
some ways you can stop bad information going viral: 1)Interrogate the source- and pause before you share.
Where has the information come from? Is it really from a reliable source â or a
copied and pasted message from a âfriend of a friendâ? 2)Ask yourself how a post makes you feel. Misleading
information and conspiracy theories often play on worry, frustration and anger. 3)Think about bias. Many people share false claims because
they confirm their existing political opinions. Criticism of the governmentâs handling of the pandemic,
general confusion about whatâs next and opposition to restrictions are all
legitimate, debatable viewpoints. But false claims that the virus is a âhoaxâ
or overheated panicky posts are much less useful. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal has experienced a steady rise in new coronavirus cases Portugal is on course to reach 1,000 new coronavirus cases a day by
next week if current trends continue, its prime minister warned on Friday after
the first meeting of the government's Covid-19 crisis group in almost three
months. The national health authority, the DGS, reported 780 new 
cases, up from 770 on Thursday and the highest daily figure since
the 10 April peak of 1,516. ""In line with the general trend in Europe we are seeing strong growth in
new cases daily,"" Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa told journalists in Lisbon. ""If this trend is maintained,
next week we shall reach 1,000 new cases per day."" Mr Costa declined to
answer journalists' questions about what was discussed by the ministers and
secretaries of state who attended the crisis group's meeting. PM AntÃ³nio Costa (centre) chaired the crisis meeting on Friday No fresh measures were announced but the prime minister confirmed that next week the DGS is to unveil a plan for the autumn and winter that is expected to contain specific proposals, while calling on the public to act responsibly to help keep the virus in check. ""If we all observe the basic rules, we can control the pandemic,"" he said. He reiterated that Portugal cannot afford a second lockdown, adding: ""It would be unthinkable to have a Christmas as we had Easter."" Portugal has so far had 67,176 confirmed cases and 1,894 deaths associated with Covid-19, six of them reported on Friday. At least 13.5 million people arenow facing or living
under local coronavirus restrictionsin the UK. It follows Fridayâs announcement that parts of north-west England, the
Midlands and West Yorkshirewill have new
measures from Tuesday. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock says ""a national lockdown is the last line of defence"". Instead, the government is considering
England-wide restrictions to slow a surge in coronavirus cases. A short period of tighter restrictions -
lasting a few weeks - could be announced in the next week, BBC political editor
Laura Kuenssberg says. The possible measures being discussed -
described by the government as a ""circuit-break"" â include:  Read

The health ministry said that new daily cases had risen by 3,049 to 416,198 and the death toll was up by 144 to 23,952. Deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi said on TV that the system of dividing regions into white, orange/yellow and red
categories based on the number of cases and deaths ""doesn't make sense any more"", adding: ""We no longer have orange and yellow. The entire country is red."" ""If the current course continues the death toll will reach 45,000,"" he warned, without saying when that might happen. Earlier this week, Alireza Zali, who heads the national headquarters for coronavirus control, warned that the country was heading towards a ""third wave"" of the outbreak, and that the capital Tehran would be hit first. Iran saw one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the early stages of the pandemic and suffered a second peak at the start of June. Hundreds of Hasidic Jews who were stopped at the Belarusian border and prevented from entering Ukraine due to coronavirus measures have begun to leave the area. The group - which includes many Israelis, as well as a number of French and US citizens - were hoping to travel to the central Ukrainian town of Uman as part of an annual pilgrimage to the tomb of Rabbi Nahman, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic movement. Every year thousands make the journey to mark the Jewish new year, or Rosh Hashanah. But the group was left stranded for days after they were stopped by Ukranian border guards, who refused to allow them to enter because of the pandemic. Both the Ukrainian and Israeli governments had appealed to the pilgrims to avoid the journey. Ukraine has restricted entry to foreigners from 28 August to 28 September to curb the spread of coronavirus, while Israel has introduced a three-week national lockdown beginning today. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The government's scientific advisers are clear coronavirus is no longer a local problem contained to hotspots. Instead the rise in cases is now ""widespread"" across the UK. Cases may be doubling every week, but they were quadrupling every week before lockdown and cases are currently at much lower levels than at the peak. But the concern is where we are heading - it's a question of trajectory. If cases continue to double every week then the situation can rapidly get out of hand, that is why the government is contemplating a ""circuit break"" to control the spread. But this is not just a question of government action, there is a responsibility on all of us. Sage documents also sayonly one in five people are fully self-isolating at home,externalwhen they get symptoms. Â© 2025 BBC.

public health officials. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent The Irish Cabinet has agreed to tighten restrictions in Dublin because of rising levels of Covid-19. From midnight tonight for the next three weeks, people are discouraged from leaving the city unless for essential reasons. They are again being asked to work from home where possible and only to make essential journeys on public transport.
Restaurants and pubs that serve food will for the next three weeks only be allowed to have guests outdoors or provide a take-away service. You can read more about the Dublin restrictionshere. Boris Johnson, asked if the government had eased lockdown too quickly, suggested discipline in adhering to social distancing restrictions had slipped. ""If you look at what's happened over the last few months, I think the British people have done a amazing job,"" he said. ""They got that peak under control, they
brought it right down, they brought the number of infections right down by
discipline and everybody adjusting our behaviours and the way we go about our
lives - hands, face, space. ""And I think probably, truth to tell,
what's happened here and what alas has happened in so many other countries is
that people find it difficult to keep this up."" He said it was ""very difficult to maintain that
kind of discipline for a long time"". And if the""rule of six""in England or the tighter restrictions in parts of the UK do not work in curbing the spread of the virus, ""then of course we are going to have to take further measures"", the prime minister said. ""But be in no doubt that we
will want to be explaining what we are doing, taking people with us as we go
and what I don't want to do is go into a second national lockdown of the kind
we had in March, April - I don't want to do that again."" Boris Johnson was speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford The UK prime minister continued: ""I don't want to go into bigger lockdown measures at all, we want to keep schools open and it is fantastic the schools have gone back in the way they have. ""What I can certainly say about parents and schools is we want to keep the schools open, that is going to happen ""We want to try and keep all parts of the economy open as far as we possibly can."" He said his government was ""looking at what we can do to intensify things that help bring the rate of infection down"". ""What I will say is, as we go forward, we will be explaining in great detail to people what the scientific background is, what the epidemiology is saying and really how we propose to do it,"" he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK is ""seeing the start of a second wave coming in"" of Covid-19 infections. Speaking in Oxfordshire, Mr Johnson said it had been ""inevitable"" the UK would see a rise in cases. ""I don't want to go into bigger lockdown measures at all,"" he said, but added: ""Clearly when you look at what is happening you've got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in."" The UK PM said a second lockdown is the ""last thing anybody wants"" but said the current measures would need to be kept ""under review"". His comments come after the government's scientific advisers said there is nowwidespread growth of the virus across the UK. Madrid's healthcare system has been under growing pressure The Spanish capital, Madrid, has announced a partial lockdown affecting hundreds of thousands of citizens as authorities try to bring a surge of coronavirus cases under control. From Monday, more than 855,000 people living in 26 areas of the city will only be allowed in or out of their zones for essential reasons such as work, school, or to care for dependants, city chief Isabel Diaz Ayuso told reporters. Eleven other municipalities in the Madrid region are also affected. Social gatherings will be limited to six people, down from 10, and public parks will remain closed. ""Reports indicate that most contagions are occurring in private settings, in personal relationships between families and friends,"" Ms Diaz Ayuso said. ""We are obliged to take these measures in these specific areas. If we did not do so, we run the risk of it being spread to the whole of Madrid. We have time to avoid it."" Madrid is the epicentre of the latest outbreak affecting Spain. Latest figures show 659 cases per 100,000 people in the Madrid region - more than double the national average of 260 infections. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter With the introduction of new local restrictions and reports
that the government is considering tighter rules in England, rumours are
understandably spreading online. Many of us are worried, frustrated and confused - about the
changes and about the future. That means itâs a fertile time for misinformation. Here are
some ways you can stop bad information going viral: 1)Interrogate the source- and pause before you share.
Where has the information come from? Is it really from a reliable source â or a
copied and pasted message from a âfriend of a friendâ? 2)Ask yourself how a post makes you feel. Misleading
information and conspiracy theories often play on worry, frustration and anger. 3)Think about bias. Many people share false claims because
they confirm their existing political opinions. Criticism of the governmentâs handling of the pandemic,
general confusion about whatâs next and opposition to restrictions are all
legitimate, debatable viewpoints. But false claims that the virus is a âhoaxâ
or overheated panicky posts are much less useful. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal has experienced a steady rise in new coronavirus cases Portugal is on course to reach 1,000 new coronavirus cases a day by
next week if current trends continue, its prime minister warned on Friday after
the first meeting of the government's Covid-19 crisis group in almost three
months. The national health authority, the DGS, reported 780 new 
cases, up from 770 on Thursday and the highest daily figure since
the 10 April peak of 1,516. ""In line with the general trend in Europe we are seeing strong growth in
new cases daily,"" Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa told journalists in Lisbon. ""If this trend is maintained,
next week we shall reach 1,000 new cases per day."" Mr Costa declined to
answer journalists' questions about what was discussed by the ministers and
secretaries of state who attended the crisis group's meeting. PM AntÃ³nio Costa (centre) chaired the crisis meeting on Friday No fresh measures were announced but the prime minister confirmed that next week the DGS is to unveil a plan for the autumn and winter that is expected to contain specific proposals, while calling on the public to act responsibly to help keep the virus in check. ""If we all observe the basic rules, we can control the pandemic,"" he said. He reiterated that Portugal cannot afford a second lockdown, adding: ""It would be unthinkable to have a Christmas as we had Easter."" Portugal has so far had 67,176 confirmed cases and 1,894 deaths associated with Covid-19, six of them reported on Friday. At least 13.5 million people arenow facing or living
under local coronavirus restrictionsin the UK. It follows Fridayâs announcement that parts of north-west England, the
Midlands and West Yorkshirewill have new
measures from Tuesday. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock says ""a national lockdown is the last line of defence"". Instead, the government is considering
England-wide restrictions to slow a surge in coronavirus cases. A short period of tighter restrictions -
lasting a few weeks - could be announced in the next week, BBC political editor
Laura Kuenssberg says. The possible measures being discussed -
described by the government as a ""circuit-break"" â include:  Read

The health ministry said that new daily cases had risen by 3,049 to 416,198 and the death toll was up by 144 to 23,952. Deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi said on TV that the system of dividing regions into white, orange/yellow and red
categories based on the number of cases and deaths ""doesn't make sense any more"", adding: ""We no longer have orange and yellow. The entire country is red."" ""If the current course continues the death toll will reach 45,000,"" he warned, without saying when that might happen. Earlier this week, Alireza Zali, who heads the national headquarters for coronavirus control, warned that the country was heading towards a ""third wave"" of the outbreak, and that the capital Tehran would be hit first. Iran saw one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the early stages of the pandemic and suffered a second peak at the start of June. Hundreds of Hasidic Jews who were stopped at the Belarusian border and prevented from entering Ukraine due to coronavirus measures have begun to leave the area. The group - which includes many Israelis, as well as a number of French and US citizens - were hoping to travel to the central Ukrainian town of Uman as part of an annual pilgrimage to the tomb of Rabbi Nahman, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic movement. Every year thousands make the journey to mark the Jewish new year, or Rosh Hashanah. But the group was left stranded for days after they were stopped by Ukranian border guards, who refused to allow them to enter because of the pandemic. Both the Ukrainian and Israeli governments had appealed to the pilgrims to avoid the journey. Ukraine has restricted entry to foreigners from 28 August to 28 September to curb the spread of coronavirus, while Israel has introduced a three-week national lockdown beginning today. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The government's scientific advisers are clear coronavirus is no longer a local problem contained to hotspots. Instead the rise in cases is now ""widespread"" across the UK. Cases may be doubling every week, but they were quadrupling every week before lockdown and cases are currently at much lower levels than at the peak. But the concern is where we are heading - it's a question of trajectory. If cases continue to double every week then the situation can rapidly get out of hand, that is why the government is contemplating a ""circuit break"" to control the spread. But this is not just a question of government action, there is a responsibility on all of us. Sage documents also sayonly one in five people are fully self-isolating at home,externalwhen they get symptoms. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tighter virus rules across England consideredA few weeks of nationwide restrictions to slow a second coronavirus surge could be introduced.UK,"Pubs and restaurants could be shut for a few weeks as part of stricter measures across England to slow the surge of coronavirus cases. The government is considering a short period of tighter rules which could be announced in the next week, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. Schools and most workplaces would be kept open during those weeks. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC the government is ""prepared to do what it takes"" against Covid-19. It comes as the UK recorded a further 4,322 confirmed cases of coronavirus - the first time the daily total of positive tests has exceeded 4,000 since 8 May. Another 27 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. UK coronavirus cases up by 3,395 on Thursday Which areas are under lockdown? Described by the government as a ""circuit-break"", the measures being considered could involve re-introducing restrictions in public spaces for a period of a few weeks. Schools and workplaces would stay open. Ideas suggested by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) include closing some parts of the hospitality sector. No 10 is also considering limiting the opening hours of pubs and restaurants across the country, as has already happened in some areas. Mr Hancock said there had been an ""acceleration"" in cases in the last couple of weeks, with the number of people admitted to hospital doubling about every eight days. He stressed it was ""critical"" that people followed social distancing guidelines and local lockdown rules, where they applied, to ""avoid having to take serious further measures"". The Office for National Statistics' weekly infections survey for England and Wales, used by the government to base its decisions, estimates there wereabout 6,000 new cases a day in Englandin the week to 10 September. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidthe next few days will be ""critical"" to avoid another full-scale lockdownin Scotland. Ms Sturgeon, Welsh First Minister, Mark Drakeford, and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have all asked Boris Johnson for an emergency Cobra meeting to be called. At a meeting on Wednesday night, the UK government's chief scientific adviser and medical adviser said they were forecasting a significant number of deaths by the end of October if there were no further interventions. Basic maths shows us how quickly coronavirus cases can, theoretically, soar. Around 4,000 infections a day, doubling every eight days, would be 128,000 new daily cases by the end of October. That is not guaranteed to happen, and a change in our behaviour, the ""rule of six"" or restrictions like those in north-east England could improve the situation. The point of a national ""circuit-break"" would be to achieve a controlled drop in the levels of coronavirus without needing a full lockdown. This does two things, obviously it helps avoid having very high levels of the virus that could overwhelm hospitals. But it also gives us more options. Any contact tracing programme or system of local lockdowns is far easier to implement when levels of the virus are low. The higher the number of cases, the fewer targeted measures the government has to use. The problem is once the circuit-break is over, cases would begin to rise again and it may take multiple circuit breaks to get us through winter. Meanwhile, new rules have been announcedfor north-west England, the Midlands and West Yorkshire, to come into force from Tuesday, in an effort to control the spread of the virus. Similar restrictions have already come into force in north-east England,affecting almost two million people, banning them from meeting people from other households and requiring restaurants and pubs to shut at 22:00 BST. But it is understood the government turned down down a request from the local council in Leeds to bring in early closing for bars and pubs there. Other parts of the UK under local lockdown conditions include- including Birmingham, Greater Manchester, Caerphilly, and the Belfast council area. The four nations of the UK are in charge of their own lockdown restrictions, withScotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandimplementing slightly different rules to England. The health secretary said the government's current approach was ""targeted interventions"" and stressed ""a national lockdown was the last line of defence"". ""The strategy is to keep the virus down as much as is possible whilst protecting education and the economy,"" Mr Hancock added. ""And throw everything at the science which eventually is the way we're going to spring out of this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson is understood to be deeply reluctant to order another national lockdown, where everyone would be asked to stay at home and businesses to close. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our answers on the ""rule of six"" LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? Earlier this weekhe described the potential impactof this on the economy as ""disastrous"".  Chancellor Rishi Sunak is also understood to have warned ministers of the potential damage to the economy. The government is also concerned about the impact of more restrictions on daily life on those who need treatment for non-Covid related illnesses.

Tighter virus rules across England considered,"Pubs and restaurants could be shut for a few weeks as part of stricter measures across England to slow the surge of coronavirus cases. The government is considering a short period of tighter rules which could be announced in the next week, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. Schools and most workplaces would be kept open during those weeks. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC the government is ""prepared to do what it takes"" against Covid-19. It comes as the UK recorded a further 4,322 confirmed cases of coronavirus - the first time the daily total of positive tests has exceeded 4,000 since 8 May. Another 27 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. UK coronavirus cases up by 3,395 on Thursday Which areas are under lockdown? Described by the government as a ""circuit-break"", the measures being considered could involve re-introducing restrictions in public spaces for a period of a few weeks. Schools and workplaces would stay open. Ideas suggested by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) include closing some parts of the hospitality sector. No 10 is also considering limiting the opening hours of pubs and restaurants across the country, as has already happened in some areas. Mr Hancock said there had been an ""acceleration"" in cases in the last couple of weeks, with the number of people admitted to hospital doubling about every eight days. He stressed it was ""critical"" that people followed social distancing guidelines and local lockdown rules, where they applied, to ""avoid having to take serious further measures"". The Office for National Statistics' weekly infections survey for England and Wales, used by the government to base its decisions, estimates there wereabout 6,000 new cases a day in Englandin the week to 10 September. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidthe next few days will be ""critical"" to avoid another full-scale lockdownin Scotland. Ms Sturgeon, Welsh First Minister, Mark Drakeford, and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have all asked Boris Johnson for an emergency Cobra meeting to be called. At a meeting on Wednesday night, the UK government's chief scientific adviser and medical adviser said they were forecasting a significant number of deaths by the end of October if there were no further interventions. Basic maths shows us how quickly coronavirus cases can, theoretically, soar. Around 4,000 infections a day, doubling every eight days, would be 128,000 new daily cases by the end of October. That is not guaranteed to happen, and a change in our behaviour, the ""rule of six"" or restrictions like those in north-east England could improve the situation. The point of a national ""circuit-break"" would be to achieve a controlled drop in the levels of coronavirus without needing a full lockdown. This does two things, obviously it helps avoid having very high levels of the virus that could overwhelm hospitals. But it also gives us more options. Any contact tracing programme or system of local lockdowns is far easier to implement when levels of the virus are low. The higher the number of cases, the fewer targeted measures the government has to use. The problem is once the circuit-break is over, cases would begin to rise again and it may take multiple circuit breaks to get us through winter. Meanwhile, new rules have been announcedfor north-west England, the Midlands and West Yorkshire, to come into force from Tuesday, in an effort to control the spread of the virus. Similar restrictions have already come into force in north-east England,affecting almost two million people, banning them from meeting people from other households and requiring restaurants and pubs to shut at 22:00 BST. But it is understood the government turned down down a request from the local council in Leeds to bring in early closing for bars and pubs there. Other parts of the UK under local lockdown conditions include- including Birmingham, Greater Manchester, Caerphilly, and the Belfast council area. The four nations of the UK are in charge of their own lockdown restrictions, withScotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandimplementing slightly different rules to England. The health secretary said the government's current approach was ""targeted interventions"" and stressed ""a national lockdown was the last line of defence"". ""The strategy is to keep the virus down as much as is possible whilst protecting education and the economy,"" Mr Hancock added. ""And throw everything at the science which eventually is the way we're going to spring out of this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson is understood to be deeply reluctant to order another national lockdown, where everyone would be asked to stay at home and businesses to close. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our answers on the ""rule of six"" LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? Earlier this weekhe described the potential impactof this on the economy as ""disastrous"".  Chancellor Rishi Sunak is also understood to have warned ministers of the potential damage to the economy. The government is also concerned about the impact of more restrictions on daily life on those who need treatment for non-Covid related illnesses.

"Breaking|Breaking newsSecond wave of Covid-19 coming to UK, says PM","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You've got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six"" The UK is ""now seeing a second wave"" of Covid-19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, adding: ""It's been inevitable we'd see it in this country."" Mr Johnson said he did not ""want to go into bigger lockdown measures"" but that tighter social distancing rules might be necessary. It is understood a new three-tiered set of restrictions is being considered. The plan would aim to avoid a national lockdown but could stop household-to-household contact. The first tier would be the level of measures currently in place in most parts of England now - with social distancing the key aspect. The second tier would involvewhat is currently being imposed in north-east of England- curfews on hospitality venues and a ban on meetings between households. The final third tier would involve stricter lockdown measures. If this plan is put into action, ""Tier two"" restrictions are expected to be imposed on a region-by-region basis, but it is thought likely that they could eventually cover almost all of the UK. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""increasingly likely"" that the nine million people in the capital will need to follow areas such as the north-east of England andcome under additional measures,external. Can a 'circuit break' halt the second Covid wave? What are the rules for meeting friends and family? Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? UK coronavirus cases up by 4,322 on Friday An account of a meeting at which the three-tier measures were discussed has been shared with the BBC. It explained the government's shielding policy was also ""being actively reviewed"" and a decision could come soon on further measures to protect the vulnerable. Any further shielding decisions are expected to take a much more tailored approach than before. With the virus expected to be more severe over the winter, officials are looking at bringing in measures that could last until the spring. Earlier, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government wasconsidering a short period of tighter rules across England that could be announced in the next week, which could involve closing hospitality venues. It comes as the UK has recorded another 4,322 confirmed Covid-19 cases. Public Health England's medical director Yvonne Doyle warned of ""far worse things to come"" asthe UK recorded widespread growth of the virus across the country. ""Clearly when you look at what is happening, you've got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in,"" the prime minister said, referring to measures introduced on Monday. He added that ""the British people have done an amazing job - they've brought that peak down by discipline"" but that ""people find it difficult to keep this up, it's difficult to maintain that discipline for a long time"". LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Speaking in Oxfordshire, Mr Johnson said the government would keep ""everything under review"" but  a second national lockdown was ""the last thing anybody wants"". ""We want to keep schools open,"" he said. ""We want to keep the economy open as far as we possibly can, we want to keep businesses going."" Mr Johnson added: ""The only way we can do that is, obviously, if people follow the guidance."" The question is no longer where we are, but where we are heading. Yes, the number of people infected, in hospital with Covid or dying from the disease are all at far lower levels than at the peak. Scientists will quibble about the exact definition of a ""second wave"", but all data points to rising numbers of infections. The government's science advisers say the number is now doubling every week. If those trends continue then infections could go from the estimated 6,000-a-day to more than 100,000 by mid-October. It is that trajectory, which is not written in stone, the government is trying to change. There are questions for politicians, from whether it should do a ""circuit-break"" to improving Test and Trace. But, with evidence suggestingonly one in five people are following the self-isolation rules,externalwhen they get sick, there are also questions for all of us. The government has also been considering what it called a ""circuit-break"" approach, which could involve re-introducing restrictions in public spaces for a period of a few weeks to suppress the spread of the virus. Schools and workplaces would stay open. Ideas suggested by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) included closing some parts of the hospitality sector. Millions of Britons are now living under stricter coronavirus measures, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan saying the capital should not wait ""for this virus to again spiral out of control before taking action"". New measures to curb the spread of the virushave been introduced across parts of the North West, Midlands and West Yorkshire. This includes Lancashire (excluding Blackpool), Merseyside and the Cheshire boroughs of Warrington and Halton. Additional restrictions are also being put in place in Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston in Leicestershire, and all parts of Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale. Some areas of West Yorkshire had already been subject to restrictions implemented at the start of August but they were eased. They are now subject tothese new rules. In total, nearly 4.7 million people will be affected by the new restrictions, which ban separate households from meeting each other at home or in private gardens.

London's New Year's Eve fireworks cancelled,"This video can not be played Watch how London celebrated the start of 2020 London's New Year's Eve fireworks have been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, the mayor has revealed. About 100,000 people normally pack the streets around Victoria Embankment for the annual event. However, Sadiq Khan toldLBC,externalthat ""we simply can't afford to have numbers of people congregating"". He said they were instead ""working on something people can enjoy in the comfort and safety of their living rooms on TV"". About 100,000 people attend the event in central London every year More than 12,000 fireworks feature in the display, which is set to music and watched by about 12 million people on TV. For the past five years the event has been ticketed due to high demand. Explaining the need for something to replace the fireworks, Mr Khan said London ""really can't lose that slot... because New Year's Eve is a really good opportunity for the rest of the world to see how wonderful our city is"". He added that it was important to ""continue investing in our city"" to try to attract tourists ""particularly during a recession"". A replacement for the event will be announced ""in due course"", the mayor's office said The decision to cancel the event has been called ""a hammer blow to central London"", by one Conservative London Assembly member. Tony Devenish, the member for West Central, said it ""effectively warns visitors to stay away on New year's Eve, which will inevitably hurt local businesses"". A mayoral spokesperson told the BBC that City Hall was ""working up plans to ensure that we usher in the new year in London in a spectacular but safe way"", adding that an announcement would be made ""in due course"".

Van Morrison lockdown protest songs 'dangerous',"Sir Van claims scientists are ""making up crooked facts"" to justify measures that ""enslave"" the population Northern Ireland's health minister has describedthree new songs by Sir Van Morrison that protest against coronavirus lockdownsas ""dangerous"". In the lyrics, Sir Van claims scientists are ""making up crooked facts"" to justify measures that ""enslave"" the population. ""The new normal, is not normal,"" he sings. ""We were born to be free"". Health Minister Robin Swann said if Sir Van had scientific facts he should present them. By Olga Robinson, BBC Monitoring disinformation team Sir Van Morrison refers to a debunked Covid-19 conspiracy theory in one of his new anti-lockdown songs. The track As I Walked Out includes the lyrics: ""Well on the government website from the 21 March 2020 / It said COVID-19 was no longer high risk"". It's a reference to a UK government page that stated ""Covid-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) in the UK"". That much is true - but that doesn't mean that coronavirus is harmless. The HCID designation is given for very fatal diseases: for example Ebola, which kills more than 50% of infected people. Covid-19 was initially classified as HCID in January - when little was known about it. By March, more information and testing prompted authorities to revise the classification. It's now thought the Covid-19 fatality rate is closer to 1%. The danger, scientists say, is that it is also highly infectious, and there is no proven vaccine or treatment. The government message was widely shared on social media, largely by coronavirus denialists and opponents of restrictions, who have cited it as ""evidence"" that the lockdown was based on a ""hoax"". Mr Swann said: ""I don't know where he gets his facts. I know where the emotions are on this, but I will say that sort of messaging is dangerous. ""Our messaging is about saving lives. ""If Van wanted to sing a song about saving lives, then that would be more in keeping with where we are at the minute."" He added: ""If Van Morrison has counter-scientific facts that he's prepared to stand over, and have that debate with the chief scientific adviser, then I think that's how he should do it."" Health Minister Robin Swann said Sir Van should sing about saving lives Mr Swann has warned that Northern Ireland could again face tighter restrictions if new cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. Niall Murphy, a prominent solicitor who was critically ill with Covid-19, described the songs as ""offensive and dangerous"". ""I had a ventilator placed down my gullet while I was in an induced coma for 14 days, and the same time in recovery, and then in and out of intensive care and I would not want anybody to experience that,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""This very serious solemn public health message is being sullied by someone who should know better."" Van Morrison to release lockdown protest songs NI local restrictions: Your Questions Answered Coronavirus: Six months of heartbreak and loss Sean McGovern, a consultant in emergency medicine, said thatfigures showed that Covid-19 is the second most common cause of deathin Northern Ireland, behind only cancer. He added that it was ""wrong to use celebrity status to dilute the message and create problems"". Belfast city councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown, of the Alliance Party, said he has asked the council to consider revoking Sir Van's freedom of Belfast over the songs. However, DUP MP Sammy Wilson has defended Sir Van and said he was ""raising an important point"". ""It's a debate which has been going on for a long, long time, that we do ask the kind of questions that he has asked in these songs - how much of our freedom do we give to the government and how much should the government rely on us to use our common sense?"" Sir Van recorded the three songs recently in Belfast and England. No More Lockdown is the most strident of the three tracks. ""No more lockdown / No more government overreach,"" the musician sings in the chorus. ""No more fascist bullies / Disturbing our peace. ""No more taking of our freedom /  And our God given rights /  Pretending it's for our safety / When it's really to enslave."" Sir Van has previously caused controversy by denouncing what he called the ""pseudoscience"" around coronavirus. Launching a campaign to ""save live music"" on his website last month, the 75-year-old said socially-distanced gigs were not economically viable. ""I call on my fellow singers, musicians, writers, producers, promoters and others in the industry to fight with me on this. Come forward, stand up, fight the pseudoscience and speak up."" Sir Van said his new songs would be released at two-week intervals with the first, Born To Be Free, arriving on 25 September. In a statement announcing the songs, the musician said: ""I'm not telling people what to do or think, the government is doing a great job of that already. Sir Van said his new songs would be released at two-week intervals ""It's about freedom of choice, I believe people should have the right to think for themselves."" However, Mr Swann urged people to ""listen to the health advice coming from the professionals - the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser. ""They are the people who see the dangers. ""I know whose message I would rather listen to, that's the message of the professional, Dr Michael McBride and Professor Ian Young.""

UK DIY sales soar but clothing stores fall behind,"DIY items and homeware sales increased as lockdown meant we spent more time at home British retail sales have continued to increase for the fourth consecutive month, boosted by spending on household goods and DIY, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalretail sales volumes rose by 0.8% between July and August. Sales are now 4% higher than in March, when a pandemic was declared. ""Retail sales continued to grow, further surpassing their pre-pandemic level,"" the ONS said. ""Sales of household goods thrived as the demand for home improvement continued and, despite a dip this month, online sales remained high,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. Spending on household goods was particularly strong in August, with retailers reporting a 9.9% jump in sales of homeware products compared with the pre-pandemic levels seen in February. But August's increase was smaller than the post-lockdown rebound seen in July, when retail sales volumes grew 3.6%. Online sales also fell by 2.5% in August when compared with the previous month. But the strong growth in the number of customers shopping online during the pandemic has meant that sales were still 46.8% higher than in February. Although online retailers might have seen higher numbers of clicks in recent months, many High Street stores are still struggling to attract customers after lockdown measures were eased nationally. The volume of items sold in clothing shops, for example, still stood 15.9% below February's pre-pandemic levels in August. ""Clothing stores continued to struggle with sales still well below their February level. Overall, the switch to greater online sales means the High Street remains under pressure,"" Mr Athow added. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: ""The recovery remains a mixed bag, with high growth in online sales, while city centre shops suffered as a result of low footfall."" She added: ""With further lockdowns looming, the government must provide clarity on the impact it will have for shops. ""Retailers have invested hundreds of millions making stores safe and secure for customers during the pandemic; this includes perspex screens, social distancing measures and additional hygiene measures. As such, retail remains a safe space for consumers, even under local lockdowns."" John Lewis scraps bonus for first time since 1953 Primark post-lockdown sales head for Â£2bn Lego set to open 120 new stores despite pandemic While August saw some consumers returning to city centres to take advantage of the government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, industry figures have suggested those areas might struggle to reach pre-pandemic levels of footfall. Paint is in, stilettos are out. They may be our shopping bills, but they're being carefully scrutinised by the chancellor and the Bank of England. For retail sales make up about a quarter of our economy, an important guide to how well or not the recovery is going. And the level of spending is back above where it was prior to the pandemic. But it's not just about how much, but why and what we are spending on. Is it a case of can't or won't? A drop in sales of clothing might reflect fewer people wanting or being able to browse on the High Street and put off by the inability to try on before you buy. If they think we are sitting on funds we can spend, measures like VAT cuts can give us the nudge to get out there and move the economy along. But less spending on extra treats may also reflect lower incomes or nerves about job prospects. And that means we may need more support for saving and creating  jobs - there are growing hints that we may hear more on that in the Budget At this tricky time, a peek into the nation's shopping basket is more than just a nosy indulgence. Entrepreneur and ex-Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's really interesting as you see the confidence in the consumer in travelling outside their house. Our business outside the metropolitan areas... is remarkably stronger than it is within. ""It's the fact that people lose the confidence to go far outside their normal area of habitat,"" he said. ""It will never be the same again - I really can't see our stores ever reaching the levels in metropolitan areas that they did before, because I think the genie's out of the bottle."" M&S announced in August it will cut 7,000 jobs across stores and management Several High Street chains also announced job cuts in August as they battled to shore up their businesses during the pandemic. Sandwich chain Pret A Manger announced it would cut 3,000 jobs, or more than a third of its workforce, while department store chainsDebenhamsandM&Ssaid they would be cutting 2,500 and 7,000 jobs. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said that the run-up to Christmas would be crucial for retailers. ""Retailers will be hoping that the fragile recovery is not derailed by more widespread lockdowns, rising unemployment or dented consumer confidence,"" she said.

Simple Covid test gives results in 90 minutes,"A rapid test can accurately diagnose a coronavirus infection within 90 minutes without needing a specialist laboratory, say scientists. The study by Imperial College London showed the ""lab-on-a-chip"" gave comparable results to current tests. The device is already being used in eight NHS hospitals to quickly identify patients who are carrying the virus. However, experts warn that the kit will not be a solution to the beleaguered Test and Trace programme. The device, developed by the company DnaNudge, can be used by anyone capable of taking a swab of the nose or throat. The swab is placed inside a disposable blue cartridge which contains the chemicals needed for the test. This in turn is slotted into a shoebox-sized machine to perform the analysis. This video can not be played ""A device this small is effectively a laboratory"" - Prof Chris Toumazou, of DnaNudge, explains how the new test works The study, published in the Lancet Microbe, compared results when samples from 386 people were given both the DnaNudge and standard laboratory tests. ""The performance was comparable, which is very reassuring when you're trying to bring in a new technology,"" said Prof Graham Cooke, from Imperial College London. ""Many tests involve a trade-off between speed and accuracy, but this test manages to achieve both."" If the lab tests said the patient was free of the virus, so did the rapid test. If the lab tests said the patient had the virus, the rapid test agreed 94% of the time. The UK hasalready ordered 5,000 of the Nudgebox machines,externaland 5.8 million of the disposable cartridges. YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? However, there is a major drawback as each box can handle only one test at a time. So during a day, one box could perform around 16 tests. Prof Cooke said: ""They are useful in clinical settings when you are trying to make a rapid decision."" He described a patient last week who was rapidly identified as having Covid and started on the drugs dexamethasone and remdesivir. The tests could become even more useful for hospitals in the future as it is theoretically possible to test for coronavirus, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (a major reason young children are admitted to hospital) at the same time. However, the capacity issue means the test cannot solve the problems with NHS Test and Trace or help withOperation Moonshotand the plans for 10 million tests per day. Testing 60,000 people at a stadium ahead of a football match would require 60,000 boxes, but it may be useful at smaller venues. Prof Lawrence Young, who was not part of the research and from the University of Warwick, said the technology was ""innovative"". He added: ""The CovidNudge test could have an important role where near-patient, real-time decision-making is necessary, such as screening patients for admission to hospital or for surgery. ""[However,] this is not the answer to universal mass testing.

The new rules ban separate households from meeting each other at home or in private gardens. Pubs and restaurants must also shut early in parts of Lancashire and Merseyside. The measures will come into force from Tuesday. On Friday, the UK recorded a further 4,322 confirmed cases of coronavirus - the first time the daily total of positive tests has exceeded 4,000 since 8 May. Another 27 deaths were also reported within 28 days of a positive test. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned the UK isnow seeing an ""inevitable"" second waveof infections. He said he did not ""want to go into bigger lockdown measures"" but tighter social distancing restrictions might be necessary. Nearly 4.7 million people will be affected by thenew rules. The measures to curb the spread of the virus have been introduced across parts of the North West, Midlands and West Yorkshire. This includes Lancashire (excluding Blackpool), Merseyside and the Cheshire boroughs of Warrington and Halton. New restrictions are also being put in place inWolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston in Leicestershire, and all parts ofBradford, Kirklees and Calderdale.

Analysis -By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit We have been used to seeing Blackburn with Darwen towards the top of the list of areas with high rates of new coronavirus infections for some time, along with other parts of east Lancashire. Now the rules affect the whole county apart from Blackpool. Based on the latest data published by the government on Friday for the week to 15 September, Blackpool, with 48 cases per 100,000 people, has fewer new infections than some parts of the county but is still above places like Lancaster and Ribble Valley, which are at 23 and 30 per 100,000. Infection rates in Lancashire are highest in Hyndburn (144 per 100,000) and Preston (139 per 100,000) Wolverhampton's appearance in the lockdown list comes after neighbouring Sandwell, itself a neighbour of Birmingham, saw households told to stop meeting. It recorded 48 cases per 100,000, down on the week before but up from just 12 per 100,000 in the last week of August. Calderdale's rate was 45 per 100,000 but the other areas of West Yorkshire affected - Bradford and Kirklees, recorded 97 and 69 per 100,000 respectively. Jessica Burns described the lockdown in Lancashire as ""laughable"". Jessica Burns, 30, from Lancaster, said the rules were ""confusing and unclear"". ""I haven't hugged my mum, dad, sisters or grandparents since March,"" she said. ""I work in Barrow-in-Furness which has a higher rate but that is not under and regulations either. ""The inconsistencies are what make people not take it as seriously as they should."" The mayor of Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, said these restrictions would be ""difficult for us all"" but ""we must do everything we can to curb rising infection rates and protect our families"". In Warrington, council leader Russ Bowden urged people not to have ""one more big night out"" before the new measures were introduced on Tuesday. While Lancashire County Council's director of public health Dr Sakthi Karunanithi said: ""don't go flocking to Blackpool thinking the rules don't apply"". In Pendle, officials have asked the government to relax Covid-19 restrictions after they ""kept a lid"" on rising numbers of cases. Council leader Mohammed Iqbal said he was ""disappointed to find local people are continuing to have to follow tighter measures here because more people are testing positive in other areas"". Kirklees Council leader Shabir Pandor said ""frequent changes"" in restrictions could impact effectiveness and also people's mental health. He said Kirklees' Outbreak Control Board had also written to the government to ask them to ""reconsider this decision"". The leader of Wolverhampton council Ian Brookfield welcomed the area's new restrictions, saying: ""We need to break this cycle."" Neighbouring Sandwell, Birmingham and Solihull have already hadsimilar restrictionsintroduced.

New restrictions begin in NE England,"New restrictions aimed at halting the rise in coronavirus cases in north-east England have come into force, affecting almost two million people. The temporary measures, which started at midnight, are to tackle ""concerning rates of infection"" in the region. The rules affect Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, Northumberland, South Tyneside, North Tyneside and the County Durham council area. Pubs and restaurants must shut early and household-mixing has been limited. Responding to the rise in infections, Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said: ""The evidence we've found from local testing is that it's spreading in three main areas - in pubs, in people's homes and in grassroots sports."" Meanwhile,new rules banning separate households from meeting each other at home or in private gardenshave been introduced in Lancashire, Merseyside, parts of the Midlands and West Yorkshire. The measures, due to take effect from Tuesday, will also mean shorter opening hours for pubs and restaurants in parts of Lancashire and Merseyside. Northumberland, Newcastle, Sunderland, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead and County Durham council areas are affected The new measures for north-east England include: Meeting people outside your household or support bubble in private homes and gardens is banned (exemptions include attending a birth, visiting someone who is dying, work, education, registered childcare, emergencies or care issues, moving house and child contact arrangements) People are advised not to socialise outside their household in public venues Residents should only use public transport for essential purposes, such as going to school or work Pubs, restaurants, cafes must be table service only and all leisure venues must shut at 22:00 Holidays are permitted but only with members of your household or support bubble Travel outside the area is permitted but visiting another home or garden is not People are advised not to attend amateur or professional sporting events as a spectator Schools, colleges and universities remain open Care homes are closed to non-essential visitors except in end-of-life circumstances There are no local changes to funerals, weddings or religious ceremonies It had been hoped that grandparents helping with childcare would be excluded from the restrictions - but they are not. Mr Forbes tweeted that Newcastle City Council had ""specifically"" asked for this to be allowed. Northumbria Police said it would provide a ""proportionate response"" to reports the rules being broken, and would assess the situation to determine the most appropriate course of action. A spokesman said: ""We will look to engage with people in the first instance, explaining the restrictions and encouraging them to follow the regulations. ""However, where necessary, we will take enforcement action."" This video can not be played 'These decisions have a real impact': Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirms local lockdown in north-east England. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The data says that we must act now."" He said Sunderland currently had an infection rate of 103 cases per 100,000 people. In South Tyneside and Gateshead the latest published rates were 93.4 and 83.6 respectively. How are people reacting to new North East rules?  People waiting longer for virus test results Updates as they happened on Thursday Concern has been raised about increased waiting times for coronavirus test results for peopleusing community testing centres. In Sunderland,drivers queued outside a Covid test centre, only to later find out it was empty. Councils have requested additional funding to police the local lockdown Council leaders have also requested additional funding for policing, as well as extra testing facilities. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth echoed the need for more testing capacity to be available in areas where there were tightened restrictions. He said it was urgent the government ""fixes testing, fixes tracing"" or we face a ""very bleak winter indeed"". County Durham's director of public health Amanda Healy said: ""If we do want to be able to continue to go to work, to schools, to keep in contact with relatives but stop an increase in the cases we have seen, we are really urging people to adhere to the guidance coming out today."" Gateshead Council leader Martin Gannon said: ""Nobody welcomes these things but I would think the vast majority of people recognise these are extremely difficult times and we all need to act and pull together."" Small businesses broadly welcomed the lockdown but called for more support to adapt to the new measures. Simon Hanson, North East development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, said it was ""absolutely critical"" that small and micro businesses were given grant support quickly to help them adapt and provide cashflow. It is estimated than 10 million people in the UK currently face additional coronavirus restrictions, with local lockdowns covering parts of Scotland, south Wales, the north west and north east of England, Yorkshire and the Midlands.

The swab is placed inside a disposable blue cartridge which contains the chemicals needed for the test. This in turn is slotted into a shoebox-sized machine to perform the analysis. This video can not be played ""A device this small is effectively a laboratory"" - Prof Chris Toumazou, of DnaNudge, explains how the new test works The study, published in the Lancet Microbe, compared results when samples from 386 people were given both the DnaNudge and standard laboratory tests. ""The performance was comparable, which is very reassuring when you're trying to bring in a new technology,"" said Prof Graham Cooke, from Imperial College London. ""Many tests involve a trade-off between speed and accuracy, but this test manages to achieve both."" If the lab tests said the patient was free of the virus, so did the rapid test. If the lab tests said the patient had the virus, the rapid test agreed 94% of the time. The UK hasalready ordered 5,000 of the Nudgebox machines,externaland 5.8 million of the disposable cartridges. YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? However, there is a major drawback as each box can handle only one test at a time. So during a day, one box could perform around 16 tests. Prof Cooke said: ""They are useful in clinical settings when you are trying to make a rapid decision."" He described a patient last week who was rapidly identified as having Covid and started on the drugs dexamethasone and remdesivir. The tests could become even more useful for hospitals in the future as it is theoretically possible to test for coronavirus, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (a major reason young children are admitted to hospital) at the same time. However, the capacity issue means the test cannot solve the problems with NHS Test and Trace or help withOperation Moonshotand the plans for 10 million tests per day. Testing 60,000 people at a stadium ahead of a football match would require 60,000 boxes, but it may be useful at smaller venues. Prof Lawrence Young, who was not part of the research and from the University of Warwick, said the technology was ""innovative"". He added: ""The CovidNudge test could have an important role where near-patient, real-time decision-making is necessary, such as screening patients for admission to hospital or for surgery. ""[However,] this is not the answer to universal mass testing.

"UK DIY sales soar but clothing stores fall behindThe amount of retail sales continued to climb in August, but some sectors are still struggling.BusinessComments","DIY items and homeware sales increased as lockdown meant we spent more time at home British retail sales have continued to increase for the fourth consecutive month, boosted by spending on household goods and DIY, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalretail sales volumes rose by 0.8% between July and August. Sales are now 4% higher than in March, when a pandemic was declared. ""Retail sales continued to grow, further surpassing their pre-pandemic level,"" the ONS said. ""Sales of household goods thrived as the demand for home improvement continued and, despite a dip this month, online sales remained high,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. Spending on household goods was particularly strong in August, with retailers reporting a 9.9% jump in sales of homeware products compared with the pre-pandemic levels seen in February. But August's increase was smaller than the post-lockdown rebound seen in July, when retail sales volumes grew 3.6%. Online sales also fell by 2.5% in August when compared with the previous month. But the strong growth in the number of customers shopping online during the pandemic has meant that sales were still 46.8% higher than in February. Although online retailers might have seen higher numbers of clicks in recent months, many High Street stores are still struggling to attract customers after lockdown measures were eased nationally. The volume of items sold in clothing shops, for example, still stood 15.9% below February's pre-pandemic levels in August. ""Clothing stores continued to struggle with sales still well below their February level. Overall, the switch to greater online sales means the High Street remains under pressure,"" Mr Athow added. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: ""The recovery remains a mixed bag, with high growth in online sales, while city centre shops suffered as a result of low footfall."" She added: ""With further lockdowns looming, the government must provide clarity on the impact it will have for shops. ""Retailers have invested hundreds of millions making stores safe and secure for customers during the pandemic; this includes perspex screens, social distancing measures and additional hygiene measures. As such, retail remains a safe space for consumers, even under local lockdowns."" John Lewis scraps bonus for first time since 1953 Primark post-lockdown sales head for Â£2bn Lego set to open 120 new stores despite pandemic While August saw some consumers returning to city centres to take advantage of the government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, industry figures have suggested those areas might struggle to reach pre-pandemic levels of footfall. Paint is in, stilettos are out. They may be our shopping bills, but they're being carefully scrutinised by the chancellor and the Bank of England. For retail sales make up about a quarter of our economy, an important guide to how well or not the recovery is going. And the level of spending is back above where it was prior to the pandemic. But it's not just about how much, but why and what we are spending on. Is it a case of can't or won't? A drop in sales of clothing might reflect fewer people wanting or being able to browse on the High Street and put off by the inability to try on before you buy. If they think we are sitting on funds we can spend, measures like VAT cuts can give us the nudge to get out there and move the economy along. But less spending on extra treats may also reflect lower incomes or nerves about job prospects. And that means we may need more support for saving and creating  jobs - there are growing hints that we may hear more on that in the Budget At this tricky time, a peek into the nation's shopping basket is more than just a nosy indulgence. Entrepreneur and ex-Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's really interesting as you see the confidence in the consumer in travelling outside their house. Our business outside the metropolitan areas... is remarkably stronger than it is within. ""It's the fact that people lose the confidence to go far outside their normal area of habitat,"" he said. ""It will never be the same again - I really can't see our stores ever reaching the levels in metropolitan areas that they did before, because I think the genie's out of the bottle."" M&S announced in August it will cut 7,000 jobs across stores and management Several High Street chains also announced job cuts in August as they battled to shore up their businesses during the pandemic. Sandwich chain Pret A Manger announced it would cut 3,000 jobs, or more than a third of its workforce, while department store chainsDebenhamsandM&Ssaid they would be cutting 2,500 and 7,000 jobs. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said that the run-up to Christmas would be crucial for retailers. ""Retailers will be hoping that the fragile recovery is not derailed by more widespread lockdowns, rising unemployment or dented consumer confidence,"" she said.

Van Morrison lockdown protest songs 'dangerous'Health Minister Robin Swann says the Belfast-born artist should sing songs about saving lives.,"Sir Van claims scientists are ""making up crooked facts"" to justify measures that ""enslave"" the population Northern Ireland's health minister has describedthree new songs by Sir Van Morrison that protest against coronavirus lockdownsas ""dangerous"". In the lyrics, Sir Van claims scientists are ""making up crooked facts"" to justify measures that ""enslave"" the population. ""The new normal, is not normal,"" he sings. ""We were born to be free"". Health Minister Robin Swann said if Sir Van had scientific facts he should present them. By Olga Robinson, BBC Monitoring disinformation team Sir Van Morrison refers to a debunked Covid-19 conspiracy theory in one of his new anti-lockdown songs. The track As I Walked Out includes the lyrics: ""Well on the government website from the 21 March 2020 / It said COVID-19 was no longer high risk"". It's a reference to a UK government page that stated ""Covid-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) in the UK"". That much is true - but that doesn't mean that coronavirus is harmless. The HCID designation is given for very fatal diseases: for example Ebola, which kills more than 50% of infected people. Covid-19 was initially classified as HCID in January - when little was known about it. By March, more information and testing prompted authorities to revise the classification. It's now thought the Covid-19 fatality rate is closer to 1%. The danger, scientists say, is that it is also highly infectious, and there is no proven vaccine or treatment. The government message was widely shared on social media, largely by coronavirus denialists and opponents of restrictions, who have cited it as ""evidence"" that the lockdown was based on a ""hoax"". Mr Swann said: ""I don't know where he gets his facts. I know where the emotions are on this, but I will say that sort of messaging is dangerous. ""Our messaging is about saving lives. ""If Van wanted to sing a song about saving lives, then that would be more in keeping with where we are at the minute."" He added: ""If Van Morrison has counter-scientific facts that he's prepared to stand over, and have that debate with the chief scientific adviser, then I think that's how he should do it."" Health Minister Robin Swann said Sir Van should sing about saving lives Mr Swann has warned that Northern Ireland could again face tighter restrictions if new cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. Niall Murphy, a prominent solicitor who was critically ill with Covid-19, described the songs as ""offensive and dangerous"". ""I had a ventilator placed down my gullet while I was in an induced coma for 14 days, and the same time in recovery, and then in and out of intensive care and I would not want anybody to experience that,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""This very serious solemn public health message is being sullied by someone who should know better."" Van Morrison to release lockdown protest songs NI local restrictions: Your Questions Answered Coronavirus: Six months of heartbreak and loss Sean McGovern, a consultant in emergency medicine, said thatfigures showed that Covid-19 is the second most common cause of deathin Northern Ireland, behind only cancer. He added that it was ""wrong to use celebrity status to dilute the message and create problems"". Belfast city councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown, of the Alliance Party, said he has asked the council to consider revoking Sir Van's freedom of Belfast over the songs. However, DUP MP Sammy Wilson has defended Sir Van and said he was ""raising an important point"". ""It's a debate which has been going on for a long, long time, that we do ask the kind of questions that he has asked in these songs - how much of our freedom do we give to the government and how much should the government rely on us to use our common sense?"" Sir Van recorded the three songs recently in Belfast and England. No More Lockdown is the most strident of the three tracks. ""No more lockdown / No more government overreach,"" the musician sings in the chorus. ""No more fascist bullies / Disturbing our peace. ""No more taking of our freedom /  And our God given rights /  Pretending it's for our safety / When it's really to enslave."" Sir Van has previously caused controversy by denouncing what he called the ""pseudoscience"" around coronavirus. Launching a campaign to ""save live music"" on his website last month, the 75-year-old said socially-distanced gigs were not economically viable. ""I call on my fellow singers, musicians, writers, producers, promoters and others in the industry to fight with me on this. Come forward, stand up, fight the pseudoscience and speak up."" Sir Van said his new songs would be released at two-week intervals with the first, Born To Be Free, arriving on 25 September. In a statement announcing the songs, the musician said: ""I'm not telling people what to do or think, the government is doing a great job of that already. Sir Van said his new songs would be released at two-week intervals ""It's about freedom of choice, I believe people should have the right to think for themselves."" However, Mr Swann urged people to ""listen to the health advice coming from the professionals - the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser. ""They are the people who see the dangers. ""I know whose message I would rather listen to, that's the message of the professional, Dr Michael McBride and Professor Ian Young.""

No new 2p or Â£2 coins to be made for 10 yearsCoin mountains in storage mean The Royal Mint has no plans to produce any more for a decade.BusinessComments,"Anyone who likes to see a new production date on their coins is set for a disappointing decade. The Royal Mint has no plans to make new 2p or Â£2 coins for the next 10 years. A coin mountain lies in storage as demand has dropped, in contrast to banknotes. The issue was revealed in a wide-ranging report on the future of cash by the National Audit Office (NAO) warning it could become harder to access by those who rely on it. It warned that the authorities were not keeping up with the pace of change in digital payments - leaving those who needed cash at risk. Future of 1p and 2p coins secured 'for years to come' Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' Ten years ago, cash was used in six out of 10 transactions but by 2019 it was used in less than three in 10 purchases. The NAO said the coronavirus outbreak may have accelerated the trend. Despite the decline in cash use, a riddle remains over demand for coins and banknotes. The old, round Â£1 coin was withdrawn from circulation in 2017 Coin-making has been cut by The Royal Mint but stocks of every coin in circulation are exceeding its targets. For Â£2 coins, the hoard is 26 times over target. A spokeswoman for The Royal Mint said 2p and Â£2 coin production could return if needed. ""We constantly monitor the demand for coins from the banks and Post Offices, and seek permission to manufacture more from HM Treasury,"" she said. These coins have not been needed because lots of old coins were returned to circulation when the 12-sided Â£1 coin was launched in March 2017. Everyone had six months to return their old round pounds and emptied savings jam jars or money stores at work, sending the entire contents back to their banks. In contrast, demand for banknotes has been rising and there is little reliable information over the whereabouts of Â£50bn worth of notes in circulation. They are not used in transactions or held as savings, but may be overseas, tucked away in homes unreported or being used in the ""shadow economy"". The NAO said there were wider issues over access to cash, partly owing to the closure of 17% of cash machines in two years. Older and lower-income consumers tended to use cash more and were at risk if nobody took responsibility for stopping the slide in cash access. ""Cash use might be declining overall but it remains a vital part of millions of people's lives - particularly for some of the most vulnerable in society,"" said Meg Hiller, who chairs the influential Public Accounts Committee in the House of Commons. ""The government took its eye off the ballÂ and too many people already have to go out of their way to get their hands on cash. ""It and the regulators will have to hurry to catch up with fast-moving technology, or even more people could be left behind."" The government has committed, with legislation, to protect access to cash, and address the sustainability of the cash infrastructure as its use falls. Some businesses that transport or process cash could struggle, it said. The NAO said it could not currently see a clear link between the government's aim and which of the various public bodies involved in overseeing the cash network could actually make it happen. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: ""The approach is fragmented, and it is not clear that the action being taken will keep up with the pace of change. ""As society progresses towards the wide use of digital payments, the use of cash in transactions is dwindling. It may become harder for people to access cash when they need it and those without the means to pay digitally will struggle if cash is not accepted.""

The Royal Mint has no plans to make new 2p or Â£2 coins for the next 10 years. A coin mountain lies in storage as demand has dropped, in contrast to banknotes. The issue was revealed in a wide-ranging report on the future of cash by the National Audit Office (NAO) warning it could become harder to access by those who rely on it. It warned that the authorities were not keeping up with the pace of change in digital payments - leaving those who needed cash at risk. Future of 1p and 2p coins secured 'for years to come' Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' Ten years ago, cash was used in six out of 10 transactions but by 2019 it was used in less than three in 10 purchases. The NAO said the coronavirus outbreak may have accelerated the trend. Despite the decline in cash use, a riddle remains over demand for coins and banknotes. The old, round Â£1 coin was withdrawn from circulation in 2017 Coin-making has been cut by The Royal Mint but stocks of every coin in circulation are exceeding its targets. For Â£2 coins, the hoard is 26 times over target. A spokeswoman for The Royal Mint said 2p and Â£2 coin production could return if needed. ""We constantly monitor the demand for coins from the banks and Post Offices, and seek permission to manufacture more from HM Treasury,"" she said. These coins have not been needed because lots of old coins were returned to circulation when the 12-sided Â£1 coin was launched in March 2017. Everyone had six months to return their old round pounds and emptied savings jam jars or money stores at work, sending the entire contents back to their banks. In contrast, demand for banknotes has been rising and there is little reliable information over the whereabouts of Â£50bn worth of notes in circulation. They are not used in transactions or held as savings, but may be overseas, tucked away in homes unreported or being used in the ""shadow economy"". The NAO said there were wider issues over access to cash, partly owing to the closure of 17% of cash machines in two years. Older and lower-income consumers tended to use cash more and were at risk if nobody took responsibility for stopping the slide in cash access. ""Cash use might be declining overall but it remains a vital part of millions of people's lives - particularly for some of the most vulnerable in society,"" said Meg Hiller, who chairs the influential Public Accounts Committee in the House of Commons. ""The government took its eye off the ballÂ and too many people already have to go out of their way to get their hands on cash. ""It and the regulators will have to hurry to catch up with fast-moving technology, or even more people could be left behind."" The government has committed, with legislation, to protect access to cash, and address the sustainability of the cash infrastructure as its use falls. Some businesses that transport or process cash could struggle, it said. The NAO said it could not currently see a clear link between the government's aim and which of the various public bodies involved in overseeing the cash network could actually make it happen. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: ""The approach is fragmented, and it is not clear that the action being taken will keep up with the pace of change. ""As society progresses towards the wide use of digital payments, the use of cash in transactions is dwindling. It may become harder for people to access cash when they need it and those without the means to pay digitally will struggle if cash is not accepted.""

Van Morrison to release lockdown protest songs,"The singer is known for songs like Brown Eyed Girl and Gloria, and classic albums including Astral Weeks Sir Van Morrison has accused the government of ""taking our freedom"" in three new songs that protest against the coronavirus lockdown. In the lyrics, he claims scientists are ""making up crooked facts"" to justify measures that ""enslave"" the population. ""The new normal, is not normal,"" he sings. ""We were born to be free"". Speaking on Wednesday, the prime minister said the government was doing ""everything in our power"" to prevent another nationwide lockdown. ""I don't want a second national lockdown - I think it would be completely wrong for this country,"" Boris Johnson told MPs at the Commons Liaison Committee. ""So when I see people arguing against the rule of six or saying that the government is coming in too hard on individual liberties and so on - I totally understand that and I sympathise with that, but we must, must defeat this disease."" Recorded ""recently"" in Belfast and England, Sir Van's three new songs sit in a familiar vein of jazz and bluesy R&B. However, the lyrics recall the angry young man who fronted Northern Irish rock group Them in the 1960s. No More Lockdown is the most strident of the three tracks. ""No more lockdown / No more government overreach,"" the musician sings in the chorus. ""No more fascist bullies / Disturbing our peace. ""No more taking of our freedom /  And our God given rights /  Pretending it's for our safety / When it's really to enslave.""

"Rail nationalisations may be coming down the trackControl of certain struggling franchises could be handed back to the government, sources say.Business","Some UK railway franchises could be nationalised when emergency deals set up during the coronavirus pandemic expire on Sunday. Insiders said talks between the government and train firms on new deals were going ""right to the wire"". The government has pumped billions of pounds into the railways to cover the fall in ticket revenue from low passenger numbers during the pandemic. But sources said some contracts could be handed back to the government. Many private operators are expected to remain in place under similar emergency arrangements, but some may decide to opt out. The Department for Transport said discussions were ""ongoing"" and it wouldn't comment on commercially-sensitive negotiations. In the House of Commons on Thursday Labour's Jim McMahon said it was ""absolutely staggering"" that Transport Secretary Grant Shapps did not have an update on the situation at such a late stage. A deadline of this Sunday has been in place since March when the current emergency contracts were signed. Rail firms stress safety as more train services resume Mr Shapps said it was right that the negotiations with nine different companies were not done ""in public"". Securing new agreements, even ones which will probably only cover the short-term control and finances of the railways, is complicated by two main factors. The first is that no-one can say when passenger numbers on the railways will return to pre-pandemic levels. The second is the fact that certain train companies were losing money before the pandemic. In fact, at the beginning of the year ministers were poised to announce an overhaul of Britain's railways. Reliability on certain networks had been poor and some train companies were losing money. The government took control of the operator Northern in January. South Western Railway was heading in a similar direction. But when the pandemic hit, the contracts between the Department for Transport and private companies were suspended, not scrapped. It means some financial obligations from that period remain. That backdrop and the uncertainty about future passenger numbers, and therefore the commercial viability of the railways in the longer-term, means certain rail operators might be tempted to opt out. Even if all of the train operators sign-up to a series of new emergency contracts by Sunday, a longer-term deal still needs to be worked-out. The Department for Transport is said to favour a shift towards a ""concessionary model"" for the railways, which is already in operation on Merseyrail and the London Overground. It means private companies run services for a fixed fee and any loss or profit falls to the government in charge. This system, which shifts risk away from private firms, is said to be favoured by train companies operating large, complicated commuter networks. Operators in charge of intercity networks want to maintain some of the commercial flexibility that they had in the past, over things such as pricing. However solving the longer-term conundrum is made harder by the resurgence of the virus and the uncertainty that adds over passenger numbers. For now, government guidelines over social-distancing are supposed to limit passenger numbers on trains to around 40% to 50%.

the globe. We will be wrapping up our live page shortly. The coverage has been brought to you by: Kevin Ponniah, Paul Gribben, Victoria Bisset, Lauren Turner, Emma Harrison and David Walker. Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei says he has tested positive for coronavirus. Speaking to a local radio station on Friday, Mr Giammattei, 64, said he had taken a test - his sixth - and the results had come back positive, the Republica newspaper reported. Mr Giammattei did not say if he was suffering any symptoms. It was later announced that the entire cabinet would be tested and would work from home. Guatemala has recorded more than 83,600 infections and just over 3,000 coronavirus-related deaths, according to a tally byJohns Hopkins University,external. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Prague Zoo has announced it is closing its popular ""Indonesian Jungle"" exhibit from Saturday as there is a risk of the orangutan and the macaque monkeys catching Covid-19 from visitors. In the exhibit, which this correspondent knows well, visitors first walk through a mock cave where bats fly overhead, before emerging into an Indonesian rainforest with various animals including an orangutan and several macaques. The exhibit housing the lemurs will also be closed. Zoo director Miroslav Bobek said that as primates, the animals were at risk of contracting Covid-19 from visitors, who are not separated from the animals by glass. The Czech Republic has so far recorded 45,228 coronavirus infections and 494 related deaths. Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check US President Donald Trump has said that Democratic-run states - known as blue states - are
to blame for America's high coronavirus death toll. âIf you take the blue states out,â Mr Trump said at a White House
briefing earlier this week, âweâre at a level that I donât think anybody in the
world would be at. Weâre really at a very low level.â He repeated a similar claim at a rally in Wisconsin on Thursday. âTake New York and some of these other Democrat-run states out of
it, youâll see numbers that are unbelievable.â The Democratic National Committee tweeted in response: âCovid isn't a red state or blue state issue.â Out of the five states that have the largest numbers of coronavirus
deaths two are Republican-run ""red states"" - Texas and Florida. It's true that in the early stage of the outbreak states run by the Democrats like New
York and New Jersey were the worst hit. But as the pandemic has progressed, Republican-led states have
contributed a greater proportion of fatalities. The Washington Post has calculated that so far,53% of deaths have occurred in blue states and 47% in red ones.,external Itâs also difficult to compare
states, because they've taken different approaches to locking down, and they have different
demographic breakdowns, including on age, race and social class. This video can not be played Covid-19: Prime minister says UK 'seeing a second wave' UK prime minister Boris Johnson says he does not want further lockdown measures, but ""when you look at what is happening you've got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in"". On Friday, the UK recorded a further 4,322 confirmed cases of coronavirus and the government's scientific advisers say there is widespread growth of the epidemic across the country. The PM spoke to reporters at the Vaccine Manufacturing
and Innovation Centre construction site in Harwell, Oxfordshire The Quebec government will now have police patrol bars and restaurants to ensure coronavirus regulations are being followed. Police will be sent to 1,000 establishments across the province, concentrating on hotspots like the city of Montreal. Bars and restaurants reopened for indoor dining in the city of Montreal in late June, when cases were declining. But cases have been surging in Quebec and across the country this week. Quebec had 297 new cases on Friday, up from 251 Thursday, making the weekly average 312. On Friday, Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois leader Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet, who heads up Quebec's nationalist federal party, tested positive for Covid-19. In Ontario, the most populous province, there were 401 new cases on Friday, up from 293 the day before, its single biggest day-of spike since June.  Here's some more detail of what is understood to have been discussed in the meeting chaired by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and attended by health officials. The account of the meeting shared with the BBC says the governmentâsshielding policyis ""being actively reviewed"", and a decision could come soon on further measures to protect the vulnerable. Any further shielding decisions are expected to take a much more tailored approach than before. With the virus expected to be more severe over the winter, officials are looking at bringing in measures that could last until the spring. Government sources confirmed discussions have been had, but nothing has yet been signed off or agreed. A new âthree tierâ approach to coronavirus restrictions
has been discussed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and government
officials, the BBC understands. The system would involve three tiers - the first
of which is the level of measures in most places across England now, with
social distancing the primary key aspect. The second tier would involve what is currently imposed in the North East of England - curfews on hospitality venues and a ban on
meeting with other households. The final third tier would involve stricter
lockdown measures. Itâs thought it is likely âtier twoâ may be put in place across the UK - albeit framed in a region-by-region basis rather than as
a ânational curfew"". The system was discussed at a meeting chaired by the health secretary, and attended by Englandâs
Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty, his two deputy chief medical
officers, the head of the Test and Trace programme, Dido Harding, and local
public health officials. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent The Irish Cabinet has agreed to tighten restrictions in Dublin because of rising levels of Covid-19. From midnight tonight for the next three weeks, people are discouraged from leaving the city unless for essential reasons. They are again being asked to work from home where possible and only to make essential journeys on public transport.
Restaurants and pubs that serve food will for the next three weeks only be allowed to have guests outdoors or provide a take-away service. You can read more about the Dublin restrictionshere. Boris Johnson, asked if the government had eased lockdown too quickly, suggested discipline in adhering to social distancing restrictions had slipped. ""If you look at what's happened over the last few months, I think the British people have done a amazing job,"" he said. ""They got that peak under control, they
brought it right down, they brought the number of infections right down by
discipline and everybody adjusting our behaviours and the way we go about our
lives - hands, face, space. ""And I think probably, truth to tell,
what's happened here and what alas has happened in so many other countries is
that people find it difficult to keep this up."" He said it was ""very difficult to maintain that
kind of discipline for a long time"". And if the""rule of six""in England or the tighter restrictions in parts of the UK do not work in curbing the spread of the virus, ""then of course we are going to have to take further measures"", the prime minister said. ""But be in no doubt that we
will want to be explaining what we are doing, taking people with us as we go
and what I don't want to do is go into a second national lockdown of the kind
we had in March, April - I don't want to do that again."" Boris Johnson was speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford The UK prime minister continued: ""I don't want to go into bigger lockdown measures at all, we want to keep schools open and it is fantastic the schools have gone back in the way they have. ""What I can certainly say about parents and schools is we want to keep the schools open, that is going to happen ""We want to try and keep all parts of the economy open as far as we possibly can."" He said his government was ""looking at what we can do to intensify things that help bring the rate of infection down"". ""What I will say is, as we go forward, we will be explaining in great detail to people what the scientific background is, what the epidemiology is saying and really how we propose to do it,"" he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK is ""seeing the start of a second wave coming in"" of Covid-19 infections. Speaking in Oxfordshire, Mr Johnson said it had been ""inevitable"" the UK would see a rise in cases. ""I don't want to go into bigger lockdown measures at all,"" he said, but added: ""Clearly when you look at what is happening you've got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in."" The UK PM said a second lockdown is the ""last thing anybody wants"" but said the current measures would need to be kept ""under review"". His comments come after the government's scientific advisers said there is nowwidespread growth of the virus across the UK. Madrid's healthcare system has been under growing pressure The Spanish capital, Madrid, has announced a partial lockdown affecting hundreds of thousands of citizens as authorities try to bring a surge of coronavirus cases under control. From Monday, more than 855,000 people living in 26 areas of the city will only be allowed in or out of their zones for essential reasons such as work, school, or to care for dependants, city chief Isabel Diaz Ayuso told reporters. Eleven other municipalities in the Madrid region are also affected. Social gatherings will be limited to six people, down from 10, and public parks will remain closed. ""Reports indicate that most contagions are occurring in private settings, in personal relationships between families and friends,"" Ms Diaz Ayuso said. ""We are obliged to take these measures in these specific areas. If we did not do so, we run the risk of it being spread to the whole of Madrid. We have time to avoid it."" Madrid is the epicentre of the latest outbreak affecting Spain. Latest figures show 659 cases per 100,000 people in the Madrid region - more than double the national average of 260 infections. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter With the introduction of new local restrictions and reports
that the government is considering tighter rules in England, rumours are
understandably spreading online. Many of us are worried, frustrated and confused - about the
changes and about the future. That means itâs a fertile time for misinformation. Here are
some ways you can stop bad information going viral: 1)Interrogate the source- and pause before you share.
Where has the information come from? Is it really from a reliable source â or a
copied and pasted message from a âfriend of a friendâ? 2)Ask yourself how a post makes you feel. Misleading
information and conspiracy theories often play on worry, frustration and anger. 3)Think about bias. Many people share false claims because
they confirm their existing political opinions. Criticism of the governmentâs handling of the pandemic,
general confusion about whatâs next and opposition to restrictions are all
legitimate, debatable viewpoints. But false claims that the virus is a âhoaxâ
or overheated panicky posts are much less useful. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal has experienced a steady rise in new coronavirus cases Portugal is on course to reach 1,000 new coronavirus cases a day by
next week if current trends continue, its prime minister warned on Friday after
the first meeting of the government's Covid-19 crisis group in almost three
months. The national health authority, the DGS, reported 780 new 
cases, up from 770 on Thursday and the highest daily figure since
the 10 April peak of 1,516. ""In line with the general trend in Europe we are seeing strong growth in
new cases daily,"" Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa told journalists in Lisbon. ""If this trend is maintained,
next week we shall reach 1,000 new cases per day."" Mr Costa declined to
answer journalists' questions about what was discussed by the ministers and
secretaries of state who attended the crisis group's meeting. PM AntÃ³nio Costa (centre) chaired the crisis meeting on Friday No fresh measures were announced but the prime minister confirmed that next week the DGS is to unveil a plan for the autumn and winter that is expected to contain specific proposals, while calling on the public to act responsibly to help keep the virus in check. ""If we all observe the basic rules, we can control the pandemic,"" he said. He reiterated that Portugal cannot afford a second lockdown, adding: ""It would be unthinkable to have a Christmas as we had Easter."" Portugal has so far had 67,176 confirmed cases and 1,894 deaths associated with Covid-19, six of them reported on Friday. At least 13.5 million people arenow facing or living
under local coronavirus restrictionsin the UK. It follows Fridayâs announcement that parts of north-west England, the
Midlands and West Yorkshirewill have new
measures from Tuesday. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock says ""a national lockdown is the last line of defence"". Instead, the government is considering
England-wide restrictions to slow a surge in coronavirus cases. A short period of tighter restrictions -
lasting a few weeks - could be announced in the next week, BBC political editor
Laura Kuenssberg says. The possible measures being discussed -
described by the government as a ""circuit-break"" â include:  Read

The health ministry said that new daily cases had risen by 3,049 to 416,198 and the death toll was up by 144 to 23,952. Deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi said on TV that the system of dividing regions into white, orange/yellow and red
categories based on the number of cases and deaths ""doesn't make sense any more"", adding: ""We no longer have orange and yellow. The entire country is red."" ""If the current course continues the death toll will reach 45,000,"" he warned, without saying when that might happen. Earlier this week, Alireza Zali, who heads the national headquarters for coronavirus control, warned that the country was heading towards a ""third wave"" of the outbreak, and that the capital Tehran would be hit first. Iran saw one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the early stages of the pandemic and suffered a second peak at the start of June. Hundreds of Hasidic Jews who were stopped at the Belarusian border and prevented from entering Ukraine due to coronavirus measures have begun to leave the area. The group - which includes many Israelis, as well as a number of French and US citizens - were hoping to travel to the central Ukrainian town of Uman as part of an annual pilgrimage to the tomb of Rabbi Nahman, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic movement. Every year thousands make the journey to mark the Jewish new year, or Rosh Hashanah. But the group was left stranded for days after they were stopped by Ukranian border guards, who refused to allow them to enter because of the pandemic. Both the Ukrainian and Israeli governments had appealed to the pilgrims to avoid the journey. Ukraine has restricted entry to foreigners from 28 August to 28 September to curb the spread of coronavirus, while Israel has introduced a three-week national lockdown beginning today. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The government's scientific advisers are clear coronavirus is no longer a local problem contained to hotspots. Instead the rise in cases is now ""widespread"" across the UK. Cases may be doubling every week, but they were quadrupling every week before lockdown and cases are currently at much lower levels than at the peak. But the concern is where we are heading - it's a question of trajectory. If cases continue to double every week then the situation can rapidly get out of hand, that is why the government is contemplating a ""circuit break"" to control the spread. But this is not just a question of government action, there is a responsibility on all of us. Sage documents also sayonly one in five people are fully self-isolating at home,externalwhen they get symptoms. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Puppy prices soar during lockdownThe cost of a puppy has more than doubled, with dogs typically selling for nearly Â£1,900.Scotland","Google searches for ""puppies for sale"" rose rapidly during lockdown The price of puppies has more than doubled during lockdown with dogs costing almost Â£1,900 on average. Popular breeds have seen even sharper price increases, and puppies are often selling for Â£3,000 or more, according to a leading online marketplace. Animal welfare charities have warned high prices could encourage ""puppy farming"", smuggling or dog theft. They are also concerned that it could lead to a dog welfare crisis as people return to work away from the home. Interest in getting a pet rose hugely after lockdown in late March, with high demand prompting many breeders to raise their prices. Figures from the Pets4Homes website, based on about 150,000 adverts, showed the average price being asked from March to September was Â£1,883. During the same period last year the average price was Â£888. Cocker spaniels saw the highest year-on-year inflation (184%) followed by Jack Russells (180%), cockapoos (168%) and border collies (163%). Cavapoos - a cavalier spaniel and poodle crossbreed - now cost about Â£2,800 on average while English or American bulldogs typically sell for about Â£2,700. More than 1,600 dogs on the website are currently priced in excess of Â£3,000. Joanna remembers the excitement of first holding Poppy in her arms six years ago - but prices have risen sharply Since leaving her parents' home a year ago Joanna Birrell has been desperately missing Poppy and Mila, the two Eurasier dogs she grew up with. Joanna is now living in Elderslie in Renfrewshire, where she works from home. As she is unlikely to return to the office any time soon, she thought now would be a good time to get a puppy. ""I've always wanted a dog since I moved out -  Mila, Poppy and me were like sisters,"" she said. ""I'm always in the house so it would be a chance to get out with the dog. I need a reason to get out."" Nine years ago when her parents bought Mila they paid about Â£500. Three years later Poppy cost them Â£1,000. When Joanna started looking for puppies the prices came as a shock. ""All the prices are Â£2,000 to Â£3,000 - or more,"" she said. One seller advertising online offered to sell her a puppy for Â£3,500 but Joanna soon became suspicious. ""She wasn't a registered breeder - it turned out to be a puppy farm,"" she said. ""She wouldn't let me travel down to see the dog. She wanted to send it to me by courier  - so alarm bells started ringing."" Joanna has now found a recommended breeder willing to reserve her a pup from a future litter. She has agreed to pay about Â£2,000. Lee Gibson, from Pets4Homes, said between April and June visits to the website peaked at 20 million a month - double last year's figure. He said: ""I think people had more time at home -  and with their children. They knew they could put the time and effort into training a dog. And secondly, there was a need for companionships. For many people lockdown has been a lonely time."" The website acts as an online marketplace, with the dog breeders themselves determining what prices to charge. ""During this period there wasn't a huge increase in the numbers of puppies available - so it's simply the economics of supply and demand,"" he said. Claire Calder, from the Dogs Trust rescue charity, said lockdown had created a ""perfect storm"" for puppy sales with many people thinking this is the ideal time to take on a pet - but she's worried about the future. ""We're expecting a dog welfare crisis further down the line  - an increase in abandonment as people go back to work,"" she said. ""The economic situation also means that some people may find they can't afford to look after a dog."" This puppy was one of six found, covered in oil, in the back of a van that arrived from Romania Another danger is that high prices will further encourage the illegal importation of puppies or heavily pregnant dogs from smuggling hotspots in eastern or central Europe. Even at the height of lockdown, she says it was ""business as usual"" for puppy smugglers - with dozens of rescued pups coming into the charity's  care. Puppy farming reports increase five-fold Six puppies found in the back of a van which arrived in Dover from Romaniahad to be shaved because they were covered in oil. Smuggled puppies are often in poor health or poorly socialised because of their early life experiences. Last month two spaniel puppieswere found dying by the roadside in Lockerbie,  Dumfries and Galloway.It's believed they had been brought into the country at the port of Cairnryan, then dumped by puppy traffickers when they became unwell during the journey. Many dogs advertised for sale are not what they seem - the Dogs Trust calls this ""dogfishing"" and offers this advice: Always see puppy and their mum together at their home and make sure to visit more than once, even if it is via video call due to coronavirus restrictions. Never pay a deposit up-front without seeing the puppy in person. Ask lots of questions and make sure you see all vital paperwork, such as a puppy contract - which gives lots of information about their parents, breed, health, diet, the puppy's experiences and more. If you have any doubts or feel pressured to buy, as hard as it may be, walk away and report the seller to Trading Standards. Mike Flynn, from the Scottish SPCA animal charity, foresees another problem as new dog owners return to work. ""Many of these puppies will have grown up with people at home all the time,"" he said. ""Then all of sudden that comes to an end and dogs become bored or anxious because they're used to people being there. ""Canine behaviourists are going to be in for a busy time."" The coronavirus restrictions disrupted the charity's rehoming services - but that is now back up and running and he's hoping would-be dog owners will consider taking on an adult dog. ""Every dog we rehome is vet-checked - you know you're going to get a healthy animal. There are always unwanted dogs in the system, often through no fault of their own, perhaps because their owner is unable to look after them anymore."" The latest data suggests interest in owning a dog is starting to plateau with website traffic returning to more normal levels. Whether puppy prices return to pre-lockdown levels remains to be seen.

Concerns over lockdown teen 'sexting' blackmail,"This video can not be played Teenagers speak of their ""guilt and disgust"" after being blackmailed online ""He's threatened to share those pictures with my friends unless I send him more."" Mia, 13, was duped into sending sexual photographs to someone she met online, who she has now found out is an adult posing as someone else. Charities including the NSPCC and Meic - a helpline for younger people in Wales - are concerned more young people are sharing naked images of themselves. They both said staff have seen an increase since lockdown. ""Many young people want to send them because it has been normalised in terms of social media,"" said Sabiha Azad, who works on Meic's helpline for children and young people. Police warn Welsh pupils over 'sexting' Thousands of children sexting, police say ""Young people are at home alone and wanting intimacy and don't know how to explore it healthily, so they're being pressured into sending things,"" she said. ""You can even get girls sending pictures on to their friends first to check if they look OK, or boys sharing the photos they get sent with others to compare them."" The charities believe a significant increase in the time teenagers are spending online and a lack of face-to-face interaction has added to the pressure. Youngsters have been urged to speak to someone about any problems they encounter Ms Azad added: ""Speaking about the consequences is so important because this is the time that they can be exploited."" The charities said most cases were believed to involve 14 to 16-year-olds, with a lot of people cropping out their heads from photographs. However, Ms Azad said they often forget about other identifiable markers such as wallpaper, birth marks or piercings. Being pressured to send nudes is a sign of a controlling relationship and, despite campaigns to tackle this during lockdown, Ms Azad believes many risks to younger people - such as being blackmailed and threatened - have been overlooked. ""I think there's a danger of forgetting young people, especially during the pandemic,"" she added. ""I think that girls definitely see the repercussions of sending nudes more, they're much more likely to be referred to specialist services for support. One person developed an eating disorder following her image being shared because of the negative comments people made. ""It's a very intimate image being shared and it may be shared to your family members. It often goes through schools, so everyone in that year group will probably see it, if not more."" Smart phones and iPads have made it easier for people to share images Mia (not her real name) contacted ChildLine after she met her blackmailer on Instagram and developed an online relationship with him. ""He convinced me to send pictures of myself which were sexual,"" she said. ""Now he's threatened to share those pictures with my friends unless I send him more."" Mia said she was too scared to tell her mum in case she got into trouble. Another victim, Chloe (not her real name), 14, met ""a good-looking boy"" on a teenage dating app who made her feel special while she was having a tough time at home. When he started asking for nude photos, she said she ""agreed as a joke to talk dirty instead"". Youngsters are meeting people in chat rooms who are adults posing as children But when she became uncomfortable, she blocked him, only for him to get in touch on another app, threatening to publish her profile picture next to the dirty messages. ""I feel so guilty and disgusted for leading him on,"" she said. ""He made me feel special when no-one else did. ""I don't want anyone to find out, after all most of it was my fault. I don't know what to do and I feel so guilty."" It is illegal for under-18s to send or receive nudes, with NSPCC Cymru's Lucy O'Callaghan saying prevention was vital to tackle the issue. ""Once a young person has sent a sexual image, it's out of their control,"" she said. ""Whilst they're in a relationship, their boyfriend or girlfriend might promise not to send the image onwards, but sometimes when that relationship breaks down the other young person can share it and that might lead to it being shared again and again. ""Then that can lead to bullying from from other young people. Sometimes when young people send one image, they can experience blackmail to send further images. So they can find themselves in a sort of a kind of a catch-22 situation."" She urged young people to seek support from an adult.

Rail nationalisations may be coming down the track,"Some UK railway franchises could be nationalised when emergency deals set up during the coronavirus pandemic expire on Sunday. Insiders said talks between the government and train firms on new deals were going ""right to the wire"". The government has pumped billions of pounds into the railways to cover the fall in ticket revenue from low passenger numbers during the pandemic. But sources said some contracts could be handed back to the government. Many private operators are expected to remain in place under similar emergency arrangements, but some may decide to opt out. The Department for Transport said discussions were ""ongoing"" and it wouldn't comment on commercially-sensitive negotiations. In the House of Commons on Thursday Labour's Jim McMahon said it was ""absolutely staggering"" that Transport Secretary Grant Shapps did not have an update on the situation at such a late stage. A deadline of this Sunday has been in place since March when the current emergency contracts were signed. Rail firms stress safety as more train services resume Mr Shapps said it was right that the negotiations with nine different companies were not done ""in public"". Securing new agreements, even ones which will probably only cover the short-term control and finances of the railways, is complicated by two main factors. The first is that no-one can say when passenger numbers on the railways will return to pre-pandemic levels. The second is the fact that certain train companies were losing money before the pandemic. In fact, at the beginning of the year ministers were poised to announce an overhaul of Britain's railways. Reliability on certain networks had been poor and some train companies were losing money. The government took control of the operator Northern in January. South Western Railway was heading in a similar direction. But when the pandemic hit, the contracts between the Department for Transport and private companies were suspended, not scrapped. It means some financial obligations from that period remain. That backdrop and the uncertainty about future passenger numbers, and therefore the commercial viability of the railways in the longer-term, means certain rail operators might be tempted to opt out. Even if all of the train operators sign-up to a series of new emergency contracts by Sunday, a longer-term deal still needs to be worked-out. The Department for Transport is said to favour a shift towards a ""concessionary model"" for the railways, which is already in operation on Merseyrail and the London Overground. It means private companies run services for a fixed fee and any loss or profit falls to the government in charge. This system, which shifts risk away from private firms, is said to be favoured by train companies operating large, complicated commuter networks. Operators in charge of intercity networks want to maintain some of the commercial flexibility that they had in the past, over things such as pricing. However solving the longer-term conundrum is made harder by the resurgence of the virus and the uncertainty that adds over passenger numbers. For now, government guidelines over social-distancing are supposed to limit passenger numbers on trains to around 40% to 50%.

Which countries are on UK's quarantine lists?,"More than 50 countries had suspended routes to the UK because of the rapid spread of a new variant of Covid, but some of them have now lifted those restrictions. On 24 December, theUK banned travel from South Africaamid concerns over another new strain of the virus linked to that country. People who have transited through South Africa in the past 10 days will also be banned. However, UK and Irish nationals as well as the UK visa holders and permanent residents are exempt, but they will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. It had already been pretty difficult to travel abroad - because of quarantine rules either at your destination or when returning to the UK. Here are some of the requirements currently in place. EU countries held discussions on Tuesday and decided to lift the compete travel ban, allowing national citizens, foreign residents and key workers to travel from the UK to their home country, if they have a negative Covid test. But EU countries are free to set their own rules on border controls, so the exact rules vary from country to country. France:French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers are among those able to travel again - if they have had a recent negative test. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests  - which give results in about 30 minutes - will be accepted. Netherlands: Anyone arriving from the UK will need to have had a so-called PCR test to enter. These can take more than 24 hours to turn around, as they need to be processed in a lab. Belgium: Between 23 and 31 December, only those who are resident in Belgium, Belgian citizens and a limited number of strictly necessary journeys will be allowed from the UK. No prior test is necessary, but there will be strict controls on the Passenger Locator form and a quarantine of 7 days, followed by a compulsory PCR test. Spain: Flights from Britain have been stopped until further notice, except for those carrying Spanish citizens or people with Spanish residency. Travellers have to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Italy: Only Italian citizens will be allowed to return from the UK, along with those who urgently need to enter the country. They will have to have a PCR test before departing and spend two weeks in quarantine in Italy. Germany:Flights and passenger transport by rail, bus and ship is banned until 6 January. From 1 January 2021, transport operators can apply to the German authorities for an exemption to transport people who are resident in Germany. People arriving from the UK will need to either present a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours, or be tested when entering the country. Even with a negative test, travellers will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with the possibility for a test and release after five days Ireland:Passengers arriving by plane or ferry from England, Wales and Scotland are banned until 31 December, regardless of nationality. Essential workers are exempt China:Direct flights to and from the UK have been suspended indefinitely Canada:Passenger flights from the UK were stopped for 72 hours from midnight on Sunday (Monday 05:00 GMT), but on Christmas Eve the measure was extended indefinitely India:All flights from the UK are suspended until 31 December US:New York City has introduced quarantine rules for international travellers, who must stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. Arrivals from the UK will be checked on by sheriff's deputies This isnot a complete list of countries, as so many have taken measures. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office hasupdates on the latest advice for UK travellers,externalto other countries. Many restrictions in place to limit the spread of coronavirus mean travel options are limited. InEngland, people who live in a tier four ""stay at home"" area or a tier three ""very high alert"" area have been told to avoid travel, including overnight stays, unless it is necessary. InWales, people can only travel internationally for essential reasons. From December 28, Wales will go in to a lockdown, meaning people should only leave their area for essential reasons. InNorthern Ireland, people have been told to ""avoid all unnecessary travel"" from 26 December, when a six-week lockdown starts. InScotland, people living in higher risk level three or four areas should avoid unnecessary travel. Most people arriving in the UK from many destinations - including British nationals - must quarantine for 10 days. Exceptions are made for the Common Travel Area - the Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - or people coming from countries in travel corridors with the UK. It means there have been only a small number of destinations with no restrictions at either end. What are the Covid regulations where you live? There are hopes that the newcoronavirus vaccineswill make travel to more destinations possible in the coming months. People arriving in England can now cut their quarantine period by at least half if they pay for a private Covid test after five days and it comes back negative. But the government will only allow certain test providers to take part in the scheme, and they havestruggled under the weight of demand. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also suggested rapid testing - which can give a result in under an hour - could eventually""open the way"" for quarantine-free travel.

Can my child go to school with a cold?,"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class.

No new 2p or Â£2 coins to be made for 10 yearsCoin mountains in storage mean The Royal Mint has no plans to produce any more for a decade.Business,"Anyone who likes to see a new production date on their coins is set for a disappointing decade. The Royal Mint has no plans to make new 2p or Â£2 coins for the next 10 years. A coin mountain lies in storage as demand has dropped, in contrast to banknotes. The issue was revealed in a wide-ranging report on the future of cash by the National Audit Office (NAO) warning it could become harder to access by those who rely on it. It warned that the authorities were not keeping up with the pace of change in digital payments - leaving those who needed cash at risk. Future of 1p and 2p coins secured 'for years to come' Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' Ten years ago, cash was used in six out of 10 transactions but by 2019 it was used in less than three in 10 purchases. The NAO said the coronavirus outbreak may have accelerated the trend. Despite the decline in cash use, a riddle remains over demand for coins and banknotes. The old, round Â£1 coin was withdrawn from circulation in 2017 Coin-making has been cut by The Royal Mint but stocks of every coin in circulation are exceeding its targets. For Â£2 coins, the hoard is 26 times over target. A spokeswoman for The Royal Mint said 2p and Â£2 coin production could return if needed. ""We constantly monitor the demand for coins from the banks and Post Offices, and seek permission to manufacture more from HM Treasury,"" she said. These coins have not been needed because lots of old coins were returned to circulation when the 12-sided Â£1 coin was launched in March 2017. Everyone had six months to return their old round pounds and emptied savings jam jars or money stores at work, sending the entire contents back to their banks. In contrast, demand for banknotes has been rising and there is little reliable information over the whereabouts of Â£50bn worth of notes in circulation. They are not used in transactions or held as savings, but may be overseas, tucked away in homes unreported or being used in the ""shadow economy"". The NAO said there were wider issues over access to cash, partly owing to the closure of 17% of cash machines in two years. Older and lower-income consumers tended to use cash more and were at risk if nobody took responsibility for stopping the slide in cash access. ""Cash use might be declining overall but it remains a vital part of millions of people's lives - particularly for some of the most vulnerable in society,"" said Meg Hiller, who chairs the influential Public Accounts Committee in the House of Commons. ""The government took its eye off the ballÂ and too many people already have to go out of their way to get their hands on cash. ""It and the regulators will have to hurry to catch up with fast-moving technology, or even more people could be left behind."" The government has committed, with legislation, to protect access to cash, and address the sustainability of the cash infrastructure as its use falls. Some businesses that transport or process cash could struggle, it said. The NAO said it could not currently see a clear link between the government's aim and which of the various public bodies involved in overseeing the cash network could actually make it happen. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: ""The approach is fragmented, and it is not clear that the action being taken will keep up with the pace of change. ""As society progresses towards the wide use of digital payments, the use of cash in transactions is dwindling. It may become harder for people to access cash when they need it and those without the means to pay digitally will struggle if cash is not accepted.""
