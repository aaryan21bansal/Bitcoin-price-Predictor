Fewer charges brought despite rising crimePolice say budget cuts are making it more difficult to investigate. Find out how your force is doing.6m7 minutes agoUK,"The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police The number of criminal charges being brought in England and Wales has been falling - despite more crimes being recorded in the same period. BBC analysis of Home Office data for Panorama shows 527,000 charges were brought in 2016-17 - a fall of 65,000 on 2014-15. Meanwhile, the number of crimes recorded rose by nearly 750,000. Police say a squeeze on resources is making crime harder to investigate. The Home Office says it is working with police to find a solution.

Charges have fallen at the same rate as recorded crime in Northern Ireland. In Scotland where the criminal justice system is different, they record clear-ups, a broader category than charges  - these have fallen in line with recorded crime. West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable Dee Collins says things are stretched. ""My officers and staff, I think do a fantastic job with the resource that we have, but I realise that we are letting some people down,"" she said. ""Since 2010 we've had a 35% real-term cut and what that has meant in terms of officers and staff numbers is I have 1,400 fewer people."" Fewer charges means victims such as Richard Bolland are not getting justice. Last year he was attacked in the fish and chip shop he runs in Wyke, near Bradford. He was so severely beaten he passed out and says the attack left him looking ""like Frankenstein"". Then he was robbed. ""He took my wallets, the company money, the money to pay the suppliers, the till float, he took everything,"" Mr Bolland said. Richard Bolland was beaten about the head He says the initial response from the police was good, but he feels let down by CID. No-one was ever caught and he was told by the police that if he could come up with a lead to help them, then he should let them know. ""Other than that it was on the shelf. And since then I've not heard a single thing from them."" West Yorkshire Police say that despite receiving tip-offs about who attacked Mr Bolland they could not gather enough evidence to bring them in. They say they have reviewed the case and believe they responded in the right way. ""I think there is an emerging crisis and it's a crisis that's right at the heart of policing, the investigation of crime,"" says Peter Neyroud, a former chief constable. He describes the fall in charges as significant and depressing. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins says the government is looking at this problem ""very carefully"" to see whether there is a problem at force level or if there is something it can do nationally. ""We want to ensure that when a victim reports a crime to the police that it's investigated properly and thoroughly and that any charges that are appropriate are made,"" she said. The number of crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has risen by nearly 750,000 in the last three years. Some of this rise is because police are recording crime better. In early 2014 an investigation by the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee found that forces had been under-recording crime. As a result data audits are being carried out on each force by the Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. But some crimes are genuinely up. If you look at the more accurate Crime Survey for England and Wales, offences such as burglary, robbery and some violent crimes are rising. Either way the police have more cases to investigate than they did in 2014. Knife crime rises 22% Reality Check - Is crime up or down? The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police. There are about 20,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than there were in 2010. ""That's four and a half million policing days of investigation,"" said Mr Neyroud. He says there is also an increased demand for the police service to investigate more rapes, modern slavery, terrorism and organised crime. Forces are having to make tough choices, Dee Collins says ""That's shifting all the experienced resources into those areas and leaving a considerable drop in the expertise in dealing with the basic day-to-day crimes which are the ones that most of the public are concerned about."" He believes this is leading to police screening crimes for those they feel they can investigate successfully and those they can't. In West Yorkshire, Ms Collins admits they are having to make pragmatic decisions about which crimes to follow up. ""For example if it was an elderly victim and something that might feel fairly low-level we will probably still attend. If perhaps it had been myself ringing about a particular issue we might not. "" It has certainly shaken Mr Bolland's faith in the abilities of the police. ""The thin blue line, it's a dotted line now and the dots are getting further and further apart,"" he says. Richard Bolland back in his chip shop Tight resources and rising crime have brought back bad memories for Mr Neyroud from his time in the police. ""We spent more of our time apologising for what we weren't able to do than doing what we were able. ""The police service appears to me to be in that position again."" Data Analysis by Wesley Stephenson, Ransome Mpini, and William Dahlgreen.  Design and development by Sumi Senthinathan, Steven Connor, and Becky Rush. Methodology: 1. England and Wales We have looked at the outcomes data and recorded crime data for the three years between 2014-15 and 2016-17. 2016-17 is the latest full year for which we have data. Method for calculating change in recorded crime and charges: For charges we have used: 'Outcomes open data year ending March' for 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 taking the data for charges recorded in each particular year. For recorded crime we have used: 'Police recorded crime open data Police Force Area tables from year ending March 2013 onwards' We calculated percentage change using the data for the first and last years in our time period. In the crime categories chart we have removed any category with fewer than 50 charges in the base year of 2014-15. This is consistent with methodology used by the Office for National Statistics. Data,external 2. Northern Ireland For the PSNI we only have two years of data 2015-16 and 2016-17. PSNI use the same crime categories and recording methods as England and Wales. To calculate the PSNI percentage change we have used the data for the first and last years in our time period. Data,external 3. Scotland Police Scotland has different crime categories to England and Wales and it also uses the broader category of 'clear ups' rather than charges. The data we use for Scotland is as follows: Scotland (data coverage dates 2015-16 to 2016-17) Data,external 4. Chart 1: Recorded crime is up but charges are down. For the years between 2007-8 and 2016-17 we have used the same data as above plus: 'Police recorded crime open data Police Force Area tables from March 2008 to March 2012'.  To calculate change we have excluded fraud offences and then calculated the year- on-year change in total recorded crime and the year on year change in total charges for England and Wales.

"Anne Frank's 'dirty jokes' uncoveredTwo pages of the teen's diary, glued over with brown paper, have finally been revealed.26m26 minutes agoEurope","Anne Frank's diary, written in hiding from the Nazis, is widely read more than 70 years after her death Two new pages from Anne Frank's diary have been published, containing a handful of dirty jokes and her thoughts on sex. The young Jewish teen's diary, written in hiding from the Nazis,  became world-famous when published after her death and at the end of the war. The hidden pages had been covered with gummed brown paper - apparently to hide her risquÃ© writing from her family. New imaging techniques have finally allowed researchers to read them. The entries were written on 28 September 1942, not long after the 13-year-old Anne went into hiding. ""I'll use this spoiled page to write down 'dirty' jokes"", she wrote on a page with a handful of crossed-out phrases - and jotted down four dirty jokes she knew. She added a few dozen lines about sex education, imagining she has to give ""the talk"" to someone else, and mentioning prostitutes - who she wrote elsewhere that her father had told her about.

""Anne Frank writes about sexuality in a disarming way,"" said Ronald Leopold of the Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam. ""Like every adolescent she is curious about this subject."" The sentiment was echoed by Frank van Vree, director of the Niod institute, which helped decipher the pages from new photographs taken in 2016. ""Anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile,"" he said. ""The 'dirty' jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl."" The world's most-read diary as a graphic novel 'Anne Frank' costume sparks controversy The Holocaust: Who are the missing million? One of the jokes reads: ""Do you know why the German Wehrmacht girls are in the Netherlands? As mattresses for the soldiers."" The Anne Frank Museum said this was not the only time the teenage girl wrote about sex - mentioning other jokes she had heard the people in her hidden home tell, or the passages about her periods and sexuality. Writing about the decision to publish pages that Anne clearly wanted to keep hidden, the museum said that her diary - a Unesco-registered world heritage document - held significant academic interest. But it also said that the pages ""do not alter our image of Anne"". ""Over the decades Anne has grown to become the worldwide symbol of the Holocaust, and Anne the girl has increasingly faded into the background,"" it said in a statement. ""These - literally - uncovered texts bring the inquisitive and in many respects precocious teenager back into the foreground."" Anne Frank went into hiding in a secret annexe of her father's business on 5 July 1942 - about a month after she received a diary for her 13th birthday. She lived there with her family and their friends, the Van Pels, until their discovery two years later. How they were found after so long in successful hiding remains a mystery. Anne Frank died of disease in a Nazi death camp in 1945, the year the war ended. Her father, the only family member to survive, published her diary in 1947.

Markle sister hopes dad will go to wedding,"This video can not be played Samantha Markle told Good Morning Britain their father had suffered a heart attack More doubt has been cast on whether Meghan Markle's father will attend his daughter's wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday, as it is reported he is due to have heart surgery. Thomas Markle had told US website TMZ he would not go amid a row overpaparazzi photographs,external; then that he would; then that he could not, due to a planned heart procedure. Kensington Palace declined to comment. Ms Markle's estranged half-sister said he had faced an ""unbelievable stress"". Speaking to Australia's Sunrise morning TV programme from Orlando, Florida, Samantha Markle said she was not sure if Mr Markle would be travelling to Windsor. ""He sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery,"" she said. ""We're all hoping he pulls through this now."" Meanwhile, Kensington Palace has announcedPrincess Charlotte will be among the bridesmaidsand her brother Prince George will be a pageboy at the wedding this weekend. Royal wedding: All you need to know Who is Meghan Markle? Princess Charlotte to be bridesmaid Who else could walk Meghan Markle down the aisle? Mr Markle became embroiled in controversy at the weekend, following reports that he staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the wedding. The pictures showed Mr Markle - apparently unaware he was being photographed - in a series of wedding-related activities, including being measured for a wedding suit. On Monday, Mr Markle reportedlytold celebrity news website TMZ,externalthat he would not attend the wedding. TMZ later reported,externalthat Mr Markle had and wanted to attend - although he might not be able to because of health concerns. Andin a third report, the website,externalsaid that the health issues and planned surgery would prevent him from attending after all. Meghan's father, Thomas, lives in Mexico On Tuesday evening, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Ms Markle wanted her father to be there, but her major concern would be for his wellbeing. Kensington Palace has said events are ""a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle"". ""She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation,"" the palace said in a statement on Monday. By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent One minute there's a perfectly scripted wedding about to reach its traditional-yet-modern, royal-yet-diverse climax in the St George's chapel at Windsor.  The next minute there's twists and turns worthy of the finest soap opera. It is difficult to believe that things are quite where the various Palaces involved in this wedding thought they would be at this stage. It is of course conceivable that Thomas Markle could have heart surgery at today, somehow find the energy to make a transatlantic flight, meet the Queen, go to the wedding and walk his daughter down the aisle. But it seems a little unlikely. So who will walk Meghan down the aisle? Who will step under the standards of the Knights of the Garter, over the vault containing the remains of Henry VIII and Charles I and past 600 of years of Royal, English and British history? Will it be Meghan's mother Doria, or will she walk alone? Now, there's a thought. Read more from Jonny Mr Markle had been due to meet Prince Harry for the first time this week,as well as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, before walking his daughter down the aisle at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Samantha, who has not spoken to her famous sibling in three years - and will not be attending the wedding - told Good Morning Britain the photographs had been done with ""good intention"" and not for money. She previously admitted the pictures had been her idea, in order to portray a positive image. The father of the ex-Suits actress lives in Mexico and is a former lighting director who worked on programmes including the 1980s TV show Married with Children and General Hospital, for which he and his team won two Emmy awards. He and Ms Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, divorced when Ms Markle was six years old. TMZ - which launched in 2005 - stands for Thirty-Mile Zone, an old Hollywood expression that describes the area where the studios are based and where most celebrities happen to live. The US celebrity news site, which scooped the world's media on Thomas Markle's wedding plans, is no stranger to a-list exclusives (albeit not without controversy): Deaths- The showbiz site broke the news of Michael Jackson's death in June 2009 and was the first to report Prince had died in April 2016. But in 2008, TMZ was forced to remove an article wrongly reporting singer Miley Cyrus had died in a car accident and in 2013, it falsely reported rapper Lil Wayne was on his death bed Break-ups- In November 2006, TMZ revealed pop princess Britney Spears was to divorce her then husband Keven Federline and ten years later, broke the news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's split Babies- In September 2017, TMZ revealed reality star Kylie Jenner was pregnant and that Travis Scott was the father Mr Markle, who has two children - including Samantha - from his first marriage, filed for bankruptcy two years ago. Ms Markle has previously said: ""It's safe to say I have always been a daddy's girl - he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank-you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura."" Royal fans are already camped outside Windsor Castle in preparation for the big day The wedding will take place on 19 May at 12:00 BST at St George's Chapel in Windsor. With five days to go, Kensington Palace revealed that Ms Markle will spend her last night before getting married at a luxury Buckinghamshire hotel with her mother, Doria. Prince Harry will be staying 15 miles away at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park in Ascot, with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge.

"Pilot 'half sucked out of plane' survivesA Chinese passenger plane makes an emergency landing after its windscreen blows out at 32,000ft.10h10 hours agoChina","Workers inspect the Sichuan Airlines aircraft after its emergency landing A Chinese passenger jet was forced into an emergency landing after its windscreen blew out at 32,000ft (9,753m), sucking the co-pilot halfway out of the plane. Captain Liu Chuanjian said the Airbus A319 had been cruising mid-air when a deafening sound flooded the cockpit. ""There was no warning,"" he told the Chengdu Economic Daily. ""The windshield just cracked and made a loud bang. The next thing I knew, my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out."" Luckily, the co-pilot was wearing a seatbelt. He was dragged back into the chaos of the cockpit, where pressure and temperature had dropped and the equipment was failing. ""Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air,"" the captain said. ""I couldn't hear the radio. The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges."" Sichuan Airlines 3U8633 was en route from Chongqing in south-west China to Lhasa in Tibet when the mishap struck. Passengers were being served their breakfast when the plane plunged suddenly to 24,000ft. The oxygen masks dropped as the plane fell ""We didn't know what was going on and we panicked,"" one told the state-run China News Service. ""The oxygen masks dropped... We experienced a few seconds of free-fall before it stabilised again."" The extreme tests planes go through before takeoff Why do people grab their bags after a plane crash? 2017 safest year for air travel The Civil Aviation Administration of China said the co-pilot had a sprained wrist and facial cuts after his ordeal. Another cabin crew member suffered a slight injury to the waist as the plane dropped. The plane landed with all 119 passengers unharmed. Some 27 received medical check-ups at a hospital in Chengdu, where the plane made its emergency landing, according to the South China Morning Post. More than 50 took a later flight, arriving in Lhasa by the afternoon. Mr Liu has been widely praised on social media for bringing the plane down safely. On Tuesday, #ChinaHeroPilot was trending on the Chinese micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, with 160 million views and 17.8 million comments. The hashtag #SichuanAirlinesWindscreenGlassCracked drew 68 million views and 49,000 comments. While some called for the captain to be given an award, others demanded better safety measures. One using the name Lazy Pig Girl wrote: ""How could this sort of thing happen?! Please investigate the reason and punish the people responsible! Take this as an example - to make sure nothing irreversible ever happens!"" Airbus and France's BEA accident investigation agency are sending teams to China to investigate the incident.

Fierce exchanges over Gaza killings,"This video can not be played The BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen sent this report from Gaza There have been angry exchanges between Israeli and Palestinian envoys at the UN, as the diplomatic fallout over deadly violence in Gaza gathered pace. Some 58 Palestinians were killed when Israeli troops fired amid protests on Monday, with funerals held on Tuesday. The Palestinian envoy spoke of a ""crime against humanity"", while Israel accused Hamas, who are in control of Gaza, of taking their own people hostage. This week was the culmination of a six-week protest against Israel. 'Hear our message': Gaza border violence in pictures Life in the Gaza Strip Monday was the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel and also the day the US made the controversial move of its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The emergency meeting of the UN Security Council began with its president, Poland's Joanna Wronecka, calling a minute's silence for those killed in Gaza on Monday, along with ""others who have died as a result of a conflict that has endured for far too long"". After a number of nations expressed concern at the violence and some called for an inquiry, the Palestinian and Israeli envoys engaged in a fierce exchange. Riyad Mansour speaks at the UN amid a strong difference among speakers to the council Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour said: ""We condemn in the most emphatic terms the odious massacre committed by Israel in the Gaza Strip."" He called for a halt to Israel's military operations and a transparent international inquiry into what he said was a ""brutal Israeli attack on Palestinian people who expressed their resistance"". UK PM urges 'greater restraint' by Israel He said it was ""a war crime, a crime against humanity"". Mr Mansour criticised the UN for not pursuing inquiries in the past, saying: ""How many Palestinians have to die before you take action? Did they deserve to die? Did children deserve to be taken away from their parents?"" What is Hamas? What makes Jerusalem so holy? Danny Danon, the Israeli envoy to the UN, said the events at the border ""were not demonstrations, they were not protests, these were violent riots"". He said that Hamas had ""taken the people of Gaza hostage"". ""They incite people to violence, place as many civilians as possible in the line of fire to maximise civilian casualties, then they blame Israel and come to the UN to complain. It is a deadly game they play at the expense of innocent children."" He added: ""When they say day of rage they mean day of terrorism; right of return means the destruction of Israel; peaceful protest means incitement and violence."" Speaking at the UN, US ambassador Nikki Haley defended the level of Israel's use of force, saying: ""No country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has."" She said the US ""deplores the loss of human life"" but laid blame on Hamas, saying: ""Make no mistake, Hamas is pleased with the results from yesterday"" Germany, the UK, Ireland and Belgium all called for an independent inquiry. UK ambassador Karen Pierce said: ""The volume of live fire used in Gaza yesterday, and the consequent number of deaths is distressing and cannot be ignored by the council"" Ireland summoned the Israeli ambassador to express its shock Turkey told Israel's ambassador to temporarily leave. Israel did the same to the Turkish consul in Jerusalem French President Emmanuel Macron told Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone call that civilians had the right to protest peacefully Kuwait is preparing a draft document aimed it said at ""providing international protection for civilians"". This video can not be played Monday was Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years Funerals were held for the 58 Palestinians killed on Monday. About 2,700 were also injured, Palestinian officials said. Two further deaths were reported on Tuesday, but despite fears of renewed violence, calm mostly prevailed as the dead were buried. Monday and Tuesday's events came after a six-week protest called the ""Great March of Return"". Monday was the anniversary of the creation of Israel while Tuesday marks the day Palestinians call ""Nakba"", or ""catastrophe"", which commemorates the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the war which followed its foundation. Monday also marked the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem, a move that has incensed Palestinians. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state and see the US move as backing Israeli control over the whole of the city - which Israel regards as its indivisible capital. On Tuesday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas recalled his envoy to Washington, Saeb Erekat, in protest at the embassy move. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Palestinian Nakba explained in 100 and 300 words Who else is moving their embassy to Jerusalem? Analysis: The real reasons behind Trump's embassy move More than 100 protesters have been killed and thousands injured by Israeli fire during the six-week protest. By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East Editor, in Gaza City This video can not be played Jeremy Bowen explains why people have been protesting in Gaza At Shifa, Gaza's main hospital, men were queuing on Tuesday to give blood. They wanted to help the many wounded in Monday's violence. Inside the hospital, there were many with gunshot wounds. Across Gaza, families were burying their dead. By midday there were no reports of new demonstrations. There was shock in Gaza at the scale of the killing. The right of return to lands they lost is a highly emotional issue for Palestinians but people here questioned whether it was worth staging such a protest after the terrible death toll. In fact, this was an incident waiting to happen. Tension has been rising for weeks in Gaza. People here have been impoverished by a goods blockade imposed by Israel and by Egypt, which shuns Hamas because of its links with the Muslim Brotherhood. The only way of stopping more violence and death is to work seriously to settle the conflict. But that is not happening. Can settlement issue be solved?

N Korea abruptly cancels talks with South,"This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts North Korea has cancelled Wednesday's high-level talks with South Korea because of anger over its joint military exercises with the US. The North's official KCNA news agency said the exercises were a ""provocation"" and a rehearsal for an invasion. It also warned the US over the fate of the historic summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump that is scheduled for 12 June in Singapore. In March, Mr Trump stunned the world by accepting an invitation to meet Mr Kim. ""We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!"" the US leader later tweeted. The US state department said it was continuing to prepare for the Trump-Kim summit and that it was not aware of any changes in the North Korean position. The political gamble of the 21st Century How does North Korea's Kim Jong-un travel? North Korea crisis in 300 words In short, the scheduled talks with South Korea were a follow-up to a rare summit that was held on 27 April. They were agreed earlier this week and were set to take place at Panmunjom, a military compound in the demilitarised zone between the two countries that is often referred to as the ""truce town"". Representatives had planned to discuss further details of the agreements they had made at the historic summit. This covers things like ridding the peninsula of nuclear weapons and turning the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953 into a peace treaty. Other points the leaders agreed in a joint statement were: An end to ""hostile activities"" between the two nations Changing the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides the country into a ""peace zone"" by ceasing propaganda broadcasts An arms reduction in the region pending the easing of military tension To push for four-way talks involving the US and China This video can not be played Kim Jong-un issues his pledge for peace with South Korea Joint military drills between the US and South Korea have often angered the North. In the past, they have threatened an ""all-out offensive"" in response to the exercises and condemned them as pouring ""gasoline on fire"". The latest drills - known as Max Thunder - involve some 100 warplanes, including an unspecified number of B-52 bombers and F-15K jets. The North has described them as a ""provocation"" and preparation for a future invasion, which is something they have said before. But the US and South Korea have always insisted the drills are purely for defence purposes, and based out of a mutual defence agreement they signed in 1953. They also say the exercises are necessary to strengthen their readiness in case of an external attack. The US and South Korea insist their joint military drills are purely for defence purposes It depends who you ask. North Korea fired a warning shot at the US when it announced it was cancelling Wednesday's talks with the South. ""The United States will also have to undertake careful deliberations about the fate of the planned North Korea-US summit in light of this provocative military ruckus jointly conducted with the South Korean authorities,"" the KCNA report said. The BBC's South Korea correspondent Laura Bicker says the wording of the statement showedNorth Korea was casting doubt over talks, rather than saying they were about to be cancelled.,external Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? The Koreas - the basics explained But the US was quick to resist any suggestion that the summit was now in doubt. ""We will continue to plan the meeting,"" a state department spokeswoman told reporters soon after the news of the cancelled talks broke. She added that the US had received ""no notification"" of a change in the North's position.

Sixty-three Windrush migrants 'removed',"Mr Javid became home secretary last month Sixty three members of the Windrush generation could have been wrongfully removed or deported from the UK since 2002, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid told the Home Affairs Select Committee 32 were foreign offenders and 31 people removed by officials, rather than a court order. He said the figures were provisional. It was the first time specific numbers have been outlined since the scandal involving people who came to the UK from Commonwealth nations broke. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs committee, said there were many ""unanswered questions"". ""It is shocking to find that 63 people may have been wrongly removed or deported and troubling that they have not yet been contacted,"" she said. LIVE: Sajid Javid questioned over Windrush,external New home secretary in Windrush vow Who are the Windrush generation? The Windrush migrants arrived between the late 1940s and 1973, mainly from the Caribbean, but some have been threatened with deportation in recent years. Many came to the UK legally as children but have no formal documentation, which has also led to them being refused jobs or healthcare. Mr Javid said the 63 cases he outlined were identified from 8,000 records of removals from the UK of people aged over 45. He told the committee: ""I've asked officials to be absolutely certain and thorough and check over every record and make sure."" The home secretary said he did not have information on how many Windrush immigrants had been detained. He denied that there was a ""systemic"" problem in the Home Office, but said in the Windrush cases people had faced ""too large a burden"" in proving they had lived in the UK for many decades. In aletter to committee chair Yvette Cooper, Mr Javid said,externala helpline set up after the Windrush cases emerged had received more than 11,500 calls. More than 4,482 of these were identified as possible Windrush cases. So far 526 people have now received documents confirming their right to be in the UK. Prime MinisterTheresa May has announced a government reviewto understand how members of the Windrush generation ""came to be entangled in measures"" designed to tackle illegal immigration. Writing on Twitter,external, Labour MP David Lammy said Mrs May - a former home secretary - needed to come to Parliament to explain how the 63 people were removed, describing the revelation as ""truly a day of national shame"". Mr Javid became home secretary last month afterAmber Rudd resigned, saying she ""inadvertently misled"" MPs over targets for removing illegal immigrants. The scandal had heaped pressure on Ms Rudd, who faced criticism after telling the home affairs committee she did not know about Home Office removals targets. What is Windrush Day?

Facebook divulges scale of abuse on siteThe social network's data indicates there has been a recent spike in violent content.4h4 hours agoTechnology,"This video can not be played WATCH: Facebook reveals scale of abuse Facebook says it deleted or added warnings to about 29 million posts that broke its rules on hate speech, graphic violence, terrorism and sex, over the first three months of the year. It is thefirst time that the firm has published figures,externaldetailing the scale of efforts to enforce its rules. Facebook is developing artificial intelligence tools to support the work of its 15,000 human moderators. But the report suggest the software struggles to spot some types of abuse. For example, the algorithms only flagged 38% of identified hate speech posts over the period, meaning 62% were only addressed because users had reported them. By contrast, the firm said its tools spotted 99.5% of detected propaganda posted in support of Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other affiliated groups, leaving only 0.5% to the public. The figures also reveal that Facebook believes users were more likely to have experienced graphic violence and adult nudity via its service over the January-to-March quarter than the prior three months. But it said it had yet to develop a way to judge if this was also true of hate speech and terrorist propaganda. ""As we learn about the right way to do this, we will improve the methodology,"" commented Facebook's head of product management, Guy Rosen. Facebook broke down banned content into several categories: graphic violence adult nudity and sexual content spam hate speech fake accounts On the latter, the company estimates about 3% to 4% of all active users on Facebook are fake, and said it had taken 583 million fake accounts down between January and March. The figures indicate graphic violence spiked massively - up 183% between each of the two time periods in the report. It said that a mix of better detection technology and an escalation in the Syrian conflict might account for this. A total of 1.9 million pieces of extremist content were removed between January and March, a 73% rise on the previous quarter. That will make promising reading for governments, particularly in the US and UK, which have called on the company to stop the spread of material from groups such as Islamic State. 'Hate speech button' causes confusion Facebook expels alt-right figurehead Tech firms to remove extremist posts within hours ""They're taking the right steps to clearly define what is and what is not protected speech on their platform,"" said Brandie Nonnecke, from University of California, Berkeley's Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society. But, she added: ""Facebook has a huge job on its hands."" The complexity of that job emerges when considering hate speech, a category much more difficult to control via automation. The firm tackled 2.5 million examples in the most recent period, up 56% on the October-to-December months. Human moderators were involved in dealing with the bulk of these, but even they faced problems deciding what should stay and what should be deleted. ""There's nuance, there's context that technology just can't do yet,"" said Alex Schultz, the company's head of data analytics. ""So, in those cases we lean a lot still on our review team, which makes a final decision on what needs to come down."" To demonstrate this, Mr Schultz said words that would be considered slurs if used as part of a homophobic attack had different meaning when used by gay people themselves. So, deleting all posts using a certain term would be the wrong choice. Facebook said that 2.2 billion people used its service at least once a month as of March ""But how do you know I'm gay if you're reviewing my profile?"" he asked. ""For me, I put it at the top of the profile - I've come screaming out of the closet, I am very openly gay. ""But that isn't true of everyone, and we can't know that. This is a very difficult problem."" In an attempt to discover what it may have missed, the social network carried out random sampling. It took an unspecified number of posts that had been viewed on Facebook, and made a note of how often a piece of content was in violation of its policies. The results were troubling. According to the sample, as many as 27 posts in every 10,000 contained some form of graphic violence. Given the 1.5 billion daily users of the service, that could means tens of millions of violent posts go unchecked every day. The same technique estimated between seven to nine posts in every 10,000 contained adult nudity or sexual content. The amount of terrorism-related material was too small to sample in this way, Mr Schultz said. And on hate speech, he said, the company lacked any ""reliable data"" on total volume. ""We can't currently measure how prevalent hate speech violations were on Facebook, because when we're asking our representatives to go and look, 'Is this hate speech, is this not?', it is very difficult to score that. ""We're making mistakes and we're trying to get better at measuring it."" But Dottie Lux, an event organiser in San Francisco, who campaigns against Facebook's perceived failure to combat the targeting of minority groups, said difficulty was no excuse. Event producer Dottie Lux is unconvinced by Facebook's efforts ""I'm running out of sympathy for 'This is really hard,' because it's really not new,"" she said. ""They find time to release dating apps and they find time to attach to my bank account, but they don't find time to figure out who their users are."" Ms Lux, who described herself to me as a ""gay Jewish lady with a gay Jewish perspective"", said relying on user reports to police hate speech was fundamentally flawed because it could be abused to silence others. ""You just give people with malicious intent the ability to act maliciously,"" she said. Facebook remains coy about the make-up of its human moderation team. It said it did try to make sure US-based workers handled incidents where an understanding of American culture was beneficial - likewise for incidents in other countries. But Ms Lux feels the company needs to be more open. ""If you are hiring people who don't exist in certain social circles, different cultures, it's not going to be effective,"" she said. ""It's just going to perpetuate the same issue."" Facebook reveals scale of abuse.

Markle sister hopes dad will go to weddingMeghan Markle's half-sister wants her father to attend the royal wedding if he is well enough.2h2 hours agoUK,"This video can not be played Samantha Markle told Good Morning Britain their father had suffered a heart attack More doubt has been cast on whether Meghan Markle's father will attend his daughter's wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday, as it is reported he is due to have heart surgery. Thomas Markle had told US website TMZ he would not go amid a row overpaparazzi photographs,external; then that he would; then that he could not, due to a planned heart procedure. Kensington Palace declined to comment. Ms Markle's estranged half-sister said he had faced an ""unbelievable stress"". Speaking to Australia's Sunrise morning TV programme from Orlando, Florida, Samantha Markle said she was not sure if Mr Markle would be travelling to Windsor. ""He sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery,"" she said. ""We're all hoping he pulls through this now."" Meanwhile, Kensington Palace has announcedPrincess Charlotte will be among the bridesmaidsand her brother Prince George will be a pageboy at the wedding this weekend. Royal wedding: All you need to know Who is Meghan Markle? Princess Charlotte to be bridesmaid Who else could walk Meghan Markle down the aisle? Mr Markle became embroiled in controversy at the weekend, following reports that he staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the wedding. The pictures showed Mr Markle - apparently unaware he was being photographed - in a series of wedding-related activities, including being measured for a wedding suit. On Monday, Mr Markle reportedlytold celebrity news website TMZ,externalthat he would not attend the wedding. TMZ later reported,externalthat Mr Markle had and wanted to attend - although he might not be able to because of health concerns. Andin a third report, the website,externalsaid that the health issues and planned surgery would prevent him from attending after all. Meghan's father, Thomas, lives in Mexico On Tuesday evening, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Ms Markle wanted her father to be there, but her major concern would be for his wellbeing. Kensington Palace has said events are ""a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle"". ""She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation,"" the palace said in a statement on Monday. By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent One minute there's a perfectly scripted wedding about to reach its traditional-yet-modern, royal-yet-diverse climax in the St George's chapel at Windsor.  The next minute there's twists and turns worthy of the finest soap opera. It is difficult to believe that things are quite where the various Palaces involved in this wedding thought they would be at this stage. It is of course conceivable that Thomas Markle could have heart surgery at today, somehow find the energy to make a transatlantic flight, meet the Queen, go to the wedding and walk his daughter down the aisle. But it seems a little unlikely. So who will walk Meghan down the aisle? Who will step under the standards of the Knights of the Garter, over the vault containing the remains of Henry VIII and Charles I and past 600 of years of Royal, English and British history? Will it be Meghan's mother Doria, or will she walk alone? Now, there's a thought. Read more from Jonny Mr Markle had been due to meet Prince Harry for the first time this week,as well as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, before walking his daughter down the aisle at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Samantha, who has not spoken to her famous sibling in three years - and will not be attending the wedding - told Good Morning Britain the photographs had been done with ""good intention"" and not for money. She previously admitted the pictures had been her idea, in order to portray a positive image. The father of the ex-Suits actress lives in Mexico and is a former lighting director who worked on programmes including the 1980s TV show Married with Children and General Hospital, for which he and his team won two Emmy awards. He and Ms Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, divorced when Ms Markle was six years old. TMZ - which launched in 2005 - stands for Thirty-Mile Zone, an old Hollywood expression that describes the area where the studios are based and where most celebrities happen to live. The US celebrity news site, which scooped the world's media on Thomas Markle's wedding plans, is no stranger to a-list exclusives (albeit not without controversy): Deaths- The showbiz site broke the news of Michael Jackson's death in June 2009 and was the first to report Prince had died in April 2016. But in 2008, TMZ was forced to remove an article wrongly reporting singer Miley Cyrus had died in a car accident and in 2013, it falsely reported rapper Lil Wayne was on his death bed Break-ups- In November 2006, TMZ revealed pop princess Britney Spears was to divorce her then husband Keven Federline and ten years later, broke the news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's split Babies- In September 2017, TMZ revealed reality star Kylie Jenner was pregnant and that Travis Scott was the father Mr Markle, who has two children - including Samantha - from his first marriage, filed for bankruptcy two years ago. Ms Markle has previously said: ""It's safe to say I have always been a daddy's girl - he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank-you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura."" Royal fans are already camped outside Windsor Castle in preparation for the big day The wedding will take place on 19 May at 12:00 BST at St George's Chapel in Windsor. With five days to go, Kensington Palace revealed that Ms Markle will spend her last night before getting married at a luxury Buckinghamshire hotel with her mother, Doria. Prince Harry will be staying 15 miles away at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park in Ascot, with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge.

India flyover collapse kills at least 18,"A large crowd gathered at the scene in Varanasi At least 18 people have been killed and dozens trapped in the Indian city of Varanasi after a flyover collapsed, crushing vehicles beneath it. The flyover was still being built when portions of its cement structure fell on the road being used under it. Officials from the National Disaster Response Force said 18 bodies had been recovered so far. A rescue operation is continuing for those believed to still be trapped, but their number and condition is unknown. Photographs and video from the scene showed cars and a bus crushed beneath the weight of the concrete, many of which still held people inside. Local media reported that a handful of people had been successfully rescued, as seven cranes attempted to lift the concrete pillar. A large crowd also gathered at the scene. One eyewitness told reporters they were nearby when the collapse happened. ""At least four cars, an auto-rickshaw and a minibus were crushed under it,"" they said. Several vehicles were only partly crushed beneath the tonnes of concrete India's NDTV also reported that many of those trapped are believed to be construction workers who had been building the flyover. The cause of the collapse is not yet known, and an inquiry has been ordered, NDTV added. Major collapses of buildings and other infrastructure are not uncommon in India, where the enforcement of construction standards is weaker than many Western countries. In September,33 people died when a six-storey Mumbai building toppledand more than 20 people diedin 2016 when a flyover collapsed in Kolkata. Other collapses with smaller death tolls are frequent. Varanasi is the home constituency ofIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said he was ""extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to the collapse"",external.

Holyrood refuses consent for Brexit bill,"Brexit Secretary Mike Russell told MSPs that the UK government's proposal was ""unprecedented, unequal and unacceptable"" The Scottish Parliament has refused to give its consent to the UK's main piece of Brexit legislation. The Scottish and UK governments are at odds over the EU Withdrawal Bill and what it could mean for devolved powers. Labour, Green and Lib Dem MSPs united to back SNP members in rejecting the Westminster bill, saying it would restrict Holyrood's powers. The Scottish Conservatives voted against, and have blamed the SNP for the failure to find an agreement. MSPs voted by 93 to 30 that Holyrood ""does not consent to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill"". Westminster ultimately has the power to introduce the legislation without the consent of Holyrood - but it would be politically difficult, and has never been done before. How significant is this vote? What is the row all about anyway? Look back on the debate on Holyrood Live Speaking after the vote, Scotland's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, urged the UK government to respect the will of the Scottish Parliament and find an acceptable solution. He said: ""The Scottish Parliament has now said overwhelmingly that this attempt to undermine devolution is unacceptable. ""The UK government cannot ignore the reality of devolution or try to drown out what this parliament says. They cannot pretend that no motion has been passed."" Both the Scottish and UK governments insist that the door is still open to finding a deal, although both sides also admit they remain some distance apart. Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said that the UK government had already made ""radical"" changes to the bill which had resulted in the Labour government in Walesdropping its opposition to it. And he said it was ""profoundly regrettable"" that a deal had not been done between Scottish and UK ministers, saying that ""the only government that hasn't compromised is the Scottish government"". Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland ahead of the vote that she still hopes a deal can be reached with the UK government The Scottish government insists this is a highly significant moment, as it is the first time the Holyrood parliament has ever refused consent to a piece of Westminster legislation which is likely to be imposed anyway, without consent. It is certainly a constitutional first - but one that can be overcome by Westminster. The UK government has the authority to simply impose the Brexit legislation on Scotland, even if that is politically problematic. It would overturn 20 years of constitutional convention and precedent. This prime minister has ignored the will of the Scottish Parliament before. This time last year itvoted in favour of a second indyrefand the PMsaid no. There was no noticeable uprising of popular outrage then. And there is unlikely to be so now. Nicola Sturgeon rarely shies away from a fight with Westminster. It's generally good politics for her to say she is ""standing up for Scotland"" against ministers in London. She hopes it helps build the case for why Scotland would be better off as an independent country. Her problem is that this argument has not caught voters' attention. The right of the Scottish Parliament to have a definitive say over regulations governing the use of pesticides does not appear to cause great concern to Scots. Some may be outraged over the principle of legislation being imposed on Scotland after it has been specifically rejected by their MSPs. The practical consequences may not amount to much. Yet it is one more headache for Theresa May in the migraine-inducing process of trying to secure a Brexit deal. Read more from Sarah Months of talks between the two governments have failed to reach an agreement The UK government has published proposals that would see the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit. But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement. It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK. But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years. It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government. Read more here The consent vote at Holyrood is the latest step in the long-running powers row between the Scottish and UK governments During the debate, Mr Russell told MSPs that they needed to defend the progress which has been made in the 20 years of devolution in Scotland. He said: ""It is our job to ensure that it is not cast aside because of a Brexit which Scotland did not vote for and which can only be damaging to our country. ""Today the challenge of Brexit - or rather the challenge of the proposed power grab by the UK government under the guise of delivering Brexit - puts our devolved settlement at risk."" Mr Russell also told MSPs that the Withdrawal Bill would add an ""unprecedented, unequal and unacceptable new legislative constraint"", taking powers away from Holyrood for up to seven years. And he said that the consent vote ""will not be the end of this process"", as it applies only to the bill ""as it stands"". The UK government's Scottish secretary, David Mundell, said he was ""disappointed"" by the vote, but said the UK parliament remains sovereign and can proceed regardless. But he said he remained hopeful that an agreement could still be reached between the two governments. Mr Mundell said: ""It's something that was envisaged by the devolution settlement, that there might be circumstances where consent wouldn't be given. ""That circumstance would permit the Westminster government to proceed with legislation on that basis, and that's what we intend to do because the bill is already in the system. ""Obviously there'll be the opportunity for debate and discussion in parliament, but also I hope between the two governments. I still think we can resolve this issue, and that remains my objective."" A Scottish Labour amendment calling for ""cross-party talksin an attempt to broker an agreed way forward"" was accepted, and Mr Russell said he would invite UK ministers to ""hear the concerns of all parties"" and to discuss ""any new ideas"". The party's Brexit spokesman, Neil Findlay, blamed the Conservatives and their ""shambolic handling"" of Brexit for the failure to reach an agreement. Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie hailed the ""unity"" displayed by SNP, Labour, Green and Lib Dem members saying they would ""stand together in defence of the parliament"". Lib Dem Europe spokesman Tavish Scott said the negotiating governments had failed to learn from the ""ongoing farce"" of Brexit, arguing that leaving the EU was ""bad for the UK and bad for Scotland"".

Pilot 'half sucked out of plane' survives,"Workers inspect the Sichuan Airlines aircraft after its emergency landing A Chinese passenger jet was forced into an emergency landing after its windscreen blew out at 32,000ft (9,753m), sucking the co-pilot halfway out of the plane. Captain Liu Chuanjian said the Airbus A319 had been cruising mid-air when a deafening sound flooded the cockpit. ""There was no warning,"" he told the Chengdu Economic Daily. ""The windshield just cracked and made a loud bang. The next thing I knew, my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out."" Luckily, the co-pilot was wearing a seatbelt. He was dragged back into the chaos of the cockpit, where pressure and temperature had dropped and the equipment was failing. ""Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air,"" the captain said. ""I couldn't hear the radio. The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges."" Sichuan Airlines 3U8633 was en route from Chongqing in south-west China to Lhasa in Tibet when the mishap struck. Passengers were being served their breakfast when the plane plunged suddenly to 24,000ft. The oxygen masks dropped as the plane fell ""We didn't know what was going on and we panicked,"" one told the state-run China News Service. ""The oxygen masks dropped... We experienced a few seconds of free-fall before it stabilised again."" The extreme tests planes go through before takeoff Why do people grab their bags after a plane crash? 2017 safest year for air travel The Civil Aviation Administration of China said the co-pilot had a sprained wrist and facial cuts after his ordeal. Another cabin crew member suffered a slight injury to the waist as the plane dropped. The plane landed with all 119 passengers unharmed. Some 27 received medical check-ups at a hospital in Chengdu, where the plane made its emergency landing, according to the South China Morning Post. More than 50 took a later flight, arriving in Lhasa by the afternoon. Mr Liu has been widely praised on social media for bringing the plane down safely. On Tuesday, #ChinaHeroPilot was trending on the Chinese micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, with 160 million views and 17.8 million comments. The hashtag #SichuanAirlinesWindscreenGlassCracked drew 68 million views and 49,000 comments. While some called for the captain to be given an award, others demanded better safety measures. One using the name Lazy Pig Girl wrote: ""How could this sort of thing happen?! Please investigate the reason and punish the people responsible! Take this as an example - to make sure nothing irreversible ever happens!"" Airbus and France's BEA accident investigation agency are sending teams to China to investigate the incident. It comes two months after a woman died after being partially sucked out of the window of a US passenger plane, whose engine had exploded in mid-air. Windscreen cracks are a reasonably common occurrence and can be caused by lightning bolts or a ""bird strike"" - when birds hit the plane at lower altitude.

Nakba in 100 and 300 words,"Palestinians insist on the right to return to their former homes Palestinians have been protesting at Gaza's border with Israel in the lead up to the the most mournful day in their calendar. The date, which falls on 15 May each year, commemorates events which caused Palestinians to lose their homes and become refugees. They refer to it as al-Nakba, or the Catastrophe. Here it is briefly explained, in both 100 words and 300 words. On 14 May 1948, Israel declared independence, and in a war which began the next day, up to 750,000 Palestinians who had lived on that land fled or were expelled from their homes. Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return. The Palestinians' displacement has led to years of upheaval. There are around five million Palestinians currently recognised as refugees by the UN. Most live in Jordan, followed by the Gaza Strip, West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and East Jerusalem. Palestinian territories: Timeline of key events Returning to their former homes is a key Palestinian demand, but Israel says it would be overwhelmed. The Nakba stems from the Arab-Israeli war which began on 15 May, 1948 - the day after Israel declared independence when British control of the land, known as Mandate Palestine, was about to end. Most of the Arabs who lived in the area which became Israel fled or were expelled by Israeli forces in the 1948-49 war, and hundreds of thousands were freshly displaced  by Arab-Israeli fighting in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in June, 1967. Today some five million Palestinians are registered by the UN as refugees. Most live in Jordan, followed by the Gaza Strip, West Bank, Syria, Lebanon, and East Jerusalem. Almost a third live in refugee camps. Every year, Palestinians gather to participate in demonstrations to commemorate the Nakba, often displaying symbolic keys, emblematic of their lost homes. Al-Naqba is a highly charged occasion, and tensions with Israel on the day have erupted into violence down the years. What war meant to Israelis and Arabs Why are Israelis and Palestinians refusing to talk? Alternatives to a two-state solution The right of return is a key demand of Palestinians and their leaders.They base their claim on a United Nations General Assembly resolution,external, which was passed in 1948. The resolution says ""refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date"". Israel says it cannot allow five million refugees to return because this would overwhelm the country of 8.5 million and mean the end of its existence as a Jewish state. Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to tackle the issue of refugees in the end stages of negotiations - but even peace talks themselves remain a long way off. Why Jerusalem matters.

UK PM urges Israel restraint,"This video can not be played Labour tabled an urgent question about Gaza in the Commons Theresa May has urged an independent inquiry into violence on the border between Israel and Gaza which left a reported 58 Palestinians dead. The prime minister said the use of live rounds by Israeli forces was ""deeply troubling"" and urged greater restraint. While Palestinians had a legitimate right to protest, she said, she was concerned about extremist infiltration and the role Hamas had played. Earlier, Labour's Emily Thornberry condemned a ""horrific massacre"". Funerals are being held for the people killed when Israeli troops opened fire during Palestinian protests. At a press conference in No 10 following talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mrs May said the events were ""destructive"" to attempts for a lasting peace, and an inquiry into what happened was paramount. While Israel had a right to defend its borders, she said ""the use of live fire and the resultant loss of life is deeply troubling... It is in everyone's interest for peace to prevail in Israel and the Occupied Territories"". Gaza tense after deadliest day since 2014 Why Trump and Jerusalem was not about peace Gaza's deadly day in pictures During an urgent question in the House of Commons, several MPs asked about UK arms sales to Israel and criticised the United States' decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, a move opposed by the UK. As well as calling for restraint from Israel, the UK government said peaceful protests in Gaza were ""exploited by extremists"". Monday's protests were timed to mark the anniversary of Israel's creation in 1948 and the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who subsequently fled their homes or were displaced in the war that followed. Palestinian Nakba explained in 100 and 300 words Israel said some 40,000 Palestinians had taken part in ""violent riots"" at 13 locations near Israel's security fence along Gaza's eastern border. But Ms Thornberry said Monday's events were the result of ""an apparently calculated and deliberate policy to kill and maim unarmed protesters, who posed no threat to the forces on the Gaza border. ""Many of them, shot in the back. Many of them, shot hundreds of metres from the border, and many of them, children."" This video can not be played Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years Ms Thornberry told MPs action was needed ""to stop this vicious slaughter"". A Palestinian protester launches a stone from a catapult during Monday's protests In the Commons, Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said the violence should be used as ""an opportunity for a springboard to peace"". ""We have no side here, except with the victims,"" he said, calling for an investigation into why so much live ammunition was used. He also asked why Ms Thornberry had not mentioned ""any possible complicit involvement of Hamas"", Gaza's Islamist rulers, blamed by Israel for the violence. What is Hamas? ""There must be a political solution,"" he added. Veteran Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames urged the UK to have a ""less limp"" response. The SNP's Stephen Gethins said the US decision to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem was ""reckless and irresponsible"" and asked if ministers agreed it had ""stoked tensions"" there. In response, Mr Burt said the move ""was not supported by the UK"", was ""not conducive to peace in the region"" and its timing was ""extremely difficult"". He also said the US should have ""a greater sense of understanding of some of the underlying issues"" behind the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who is of Palestinian descent, said the two sides were not meeting as equals and urged recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK. Mr Burt said the question of recognition ""remains open"" but needed to happen ""at a time when it's most designed to serve the cause of peace"". Palestinians were demonstrating on Monday as they have been for seven weeks, as part of a protest orchestrated in part by Hamas and branded the ""Great March of Return"". Palestinians hurled stones and incendiary devices and approached the border fence. Israeli snipers fired live ammunition at protesters and used tear gas dispersed from drones. Monday's events as they happened What makes Jerusalem so holy? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to justify the military action. ""Every country has an obligation to defend its borders,"" he said. Protesters run for cover from tear gas dispersed from Israeli drones Hamas did not initiate the weekly protests that have been taking place for the past seven weeks but the group has since become the driving force. At the end of March,the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, said the demonstrations were aimed at removing the ""transient border"" with Israel.,external Hamas has called for Israel's destruction and is in a permanent state of conflict with the Jewish state. The violence in Gaza and the US embassy opening were not explicitly linked but both were timed to coincide with Israel's 70th anniversary on Monday. Commentators drew attention to the stark contrast between the images from Jerusalem - of a high-level US delegation, alongside Mr Netanyahu and his wife, celebrating the new US embassy opening - and the violent images emerging from Gaza. This video can not be played Donald Trump addresses the ceremony via videolink The relocation breaks with decades of US policy and has incensed Palestinians and other nations, who say it violates international law. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state, and see the US move as backing Israeli control over the whole of the city. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, called the new embassy ""a US settlement in East Jerusalem"". The Gaza Strip is a narrow piece of land along the Mediterranean coast between Israel and Egypt, about 40km (25 miles) long and 10km wide. It is home to about 1.8 million Palestinians, making it the third most densely populated place in the world. The shape of the strip was defined by ceasefire lines with Egypt at the end of the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war. Egypt administered Gaza for the next 19 years but Israel occupied it in the 1967 Arab-Israel war. It withdrew its forces and settlers in 2005 but the UN still considers the territory occupied because Israel retains control over the territory's air space, coastal waters and shared border. Politically, Gaza is controlled by Hamas, which Israel and other powers regard as a terrorist group. Since 2007, Israel and Egypt have enforced a sea and air blockade, controlling the flow of commercial goods and people in and out of the strip. They say it is for their own security. The Gaza Strip is impoverished and the UN has warned it is on the verge of total collapse. In 2014, a 50-day war between Israel and militants in Gaza killed 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers and six civilians died. Why Jerusalem matters.

Gaza begins to bury its dead,"This video can not be played Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years Funerals were held on Tuesday in Gaza for 58 Palestinians reported killed on Monday when Israeli troops opened fire during protests, in the deadliest day of violence there since a war in 2014. Another death was reported on Tuesday - a 51-year-old man - but calm mostly prevailed as the dead were buried. Israel has faced international condemnation over the deaths, from the UN, UK, France, Russia and others. Israel has defended its actions, and the US has voiced its support. Monday's violence came as the US inaugurated its first embassy in Jerusalem, a controversial step by the Trump administration that broke with decades of US policy and incensed Palestinians. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Many see the US move as backing Israeli control over the whole of the city, which Israel regards as its indivisible capital. 'Hear our message': Gaza border violence in pictures Life in the Gaza Strip Analysis: The real reasons behind Trump's embassy move Donald Trump's decision to relocate the embassy, announced in December, fuelled anger in Islamist-ruled Gaza, which is economically impoverished and under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Israel and Egypt say it is for their self-defence. For seven weeks, protesters have gathered on the Gaza side of the border with Israel, with scores of deaths over that period before the violence ratcheted this week. Among the dead on Monday were eight children under the age of 16, including a baby of eight months, Layila al-Ghandour, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. At least 2,700 were reported injured. No Israelis were reported killed or injured. Palestinian relatives mourn during the funeral of eight-month-old Layila al-Ghandour Many of the dead and wounded in Gaza were hit by sniper-fire, the health ministry said. Israeli troops opened fire as protesters pushed towards the border fence that separates the Gaza Strip from Israel. Israel said its soldiers fired only at ""targets of terrorist activity"". UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that Israel's use of force was ""not acceptable"". ""The mere fact of approaching a fence is not a lethal, life-threatening act, so that does not warrant being shot,"" he said. ""It seems that anyone is liable to be shot dead,"" he added, stressing that international law makes it clear that ""lethal force may only be used as a measure of last, not first, resort."" A Palestinian protester launches a stone from a catapult during Monday's protests The majority of the wounded were shot in their lower limbs, Mahmoud Daher, an official at the World Health Organisation (WHO), told the Associated Press. Israeli media has previously reported that troops at the border are instructed to first issue warning shots, then fire at protesters' legs. Funerals began on Tuesday for some of the 58 people killed, coinciding with the day Palestinians call the ""Nakba"", or ""catastrophe"", which commemorates more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948-49 war surrounding Israel's creation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country's military was acting in self-defence against Gaza's Islamist rulers, Hamas. ""Every country has an obligation to defend its borders,"" he said. Palestinian Nakba explained in 100 and 300 words What makes Jerusalem so holy? What is Hamas? The Israeli military said some 40,000 Palestinians had taken part in ""violent riots"" at 13 locations along Israel's security fence on Gaza's eastern border on Monday. It said ""at least 24 terrorists with documented terror background"" were among those killed. Demonstrations have been taking place at the border fence for the past seven weeks, as part of a protest branded the ""Great March of Return"". Palestinian protesters have hurled stones and incendiary devices and approached the border fence, which Israel has declared a no-go zone, on foot. Israel's return fire has killed more than 100 people in that period and injured thousands. By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East Editor, in Gaza City This video can not be played Jeremy Bowen explains why people have been protesting in Gaza At Shifa, Gaza's main hospital, men were queuing on Tuesday to give blood. They wanted to help the many wounded in Monday's violence. Inside the hospital, there were many with gunshot wounds. Across Gaza, families were burying their dead. By midday there were no reports of new demonstrations. There was shock in Gaza at the scale of the killing. The right of return to lands they lost is a highly emotional issue for Palestinians but people here questioned whether it was worth staging such a protest after the terrible death toll. In fact, this was an incident waiting to happen. Tension has been rising for weeks in Gaza. People here have been impoverished by a goods blockade imposed by Israel and by Egypt, which shuns Hamas because of its links with the Muslim Brotherhood. The only way of stopping more violence and death is to work seriously to settle the conflict. But that is not happening. Can settlement issue be solved?

The two German-born players, both of Turkish origin, gave Mr Erdogan signed shirts at an event in London on Sunday. GÃ¼ndogan wrote: ""For my honoured President, with great respect."" Mr Erdogan is campaigning for re-election. Ãzil plays for Arsenal and GÃ¼ndogan for Manchester City. Both players are preparing for next month's Fifa World Cup in Russia, in which Germany is among the favourites. Turkey did not qualify. Turkey's pugnacious president Erdogan's Turkey - the full story Three Turkish-origin stars posed with Mr Erdogan (L-R): Ilkay GÃ¼ndogan (Man City); Mesut Ãzil (Arsenal) and Cenk Tosun (Everton) Many German politicians have also criticised the footballers, questioning their loyalty to German democratic values. DFB president Reinhard Grindel said: ""Football and the DFB defend values which are not sufficiently respected by Mr Erdogan. ""That's why it's not good that our international players let themselves be manipulated for his electoral campaign. In doing that, our players have certainly not helped the DFB's work on integration."" DFB director Oliver Bierhoff said: ""Neither one of them was aware of the symbolic value of this photo, but it's clearly not right and we'll be talking to them about it"". In his youth, before entering politics in the 1990s, Mr Erdogan played football semi-professionally for an Istanbul team, Kasimpasa. Which players are going to the World Cup? Erdogan says German leaders are enemies Mr Erdogan, in power for the past 15 years, is seeking re-election in a snap poll on 24 June. His Islamist-rooted AK Party has cracked down hard on opponents, especially since the July 2016 coup attempt by military officers. Turkish police have arrested more than 50,000 people accused of links to US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen or to Kurdish separatists. They include opposition activists, journalists, teachers, lawyers and other public servants. Mr Erdogan has also purged the military, police and judiciary, putting many state officials on trial. He has created a powerful presidency since winning an April 2017 referendum on constitutional changes, enabling him to dominate parliament and control the judiciary. A prominent Turkish-origin MP in Germany, Sevim Dagdelen, tweeted: ""It's a crude foul to pose with the despot Erdogan in a luxury hotel in London and dignify him with the title 'my President', while in Turkey democrats are persecuted and critical journalists are detained."" She is deputy leader of the left-wing Die Linke group in the Bundestag. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After the criticism erupted, GÃ¼ndogan issued a statement defending himself, Ãzil and Cenk Tosun over their meeting with Mr Erdogan. They met on the sidelines of an event at a Turkish foundation that helps Turkish students, he explained. ""Are we supposed to be impolite to the president of our families' homeland?"" he asked. ""Whatever justified criticism there might be, we decided on a gesture of politeness, out of respect for the office of president and for our Turkish roots."" He said ""it was not our intention to make a political statement with this picture"". Turkish-origin Cem Ãzdemir, a prominent German Green MP and sharp critic of Mr Erdogan, attacked GÃ¼ndogan's ""my President"" message. ""The federal president of a German international footballer is called Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the chancellor is Angela Merkel and the parliament is called the German Bundestag,"" he said.

Facebook divulges scale of abuse on site,"This video can not be played WATCH: Facebook reveals scale of abuse Facebook says it deleted or added warnings to about 29 million posts that broke its rules on hate speech, graphic violence, terrorism and sex, over the first three months of the year. It is thefirst time that the firm has published figures,externaldetailing the scale of efforts to enforce its rules. Facebook is developing artificial intelligence tools to support the work of its 15,000 human moderators. But the report suggest the software struggles to spot some types of abuse. For example, the algorithms only flagged 38% of identified hate speech posts over the period, meaning 62% were only addressed because users had reported them. By contrast, the firm said its tools spotted 99.5% of detected propaganda posted in support of Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other affiliated groups, leaving only 0.5% to the public. The figures also reveal that Facebook believes users were more likely to have experienced graphic violence and adult nudity via its service over the January-to-March quarter than the prior three months. But it said it had yet to develop a way to judge if this was also true of hate speech and terrorist propaganda. ""As we learn about the right way to do this, we will improve the methodology,"" commented Facebook's head of product management, Guy Rosen. Facebook broke down banned content into several categories: graphic violence adult nudity and sexual content spam hate speech fake accounts On the latter, the company estimates about 3% to 4% of all active users on Facebook are fake, and said it had taken 583 million fake accounts down between January and March. The figures indicate graphic violence spiked massively - up 183% between each of the two time periods in the report. It said that a mix of better detection technology and an escalation in the Syrian conflict might account for this. A total of 1.9 million pieces of extremist content were removed between January and March, a 73% rise on the previous quarter. That will make promising reading for governments, particularly in the US and UK, which have called on the company to stop the spread of material from groups such as Islamic State. 'Hate speech button' causes confusion Facebook expels alt-right figurehead Tech firms to remove extremist posts within hours ""They're taking the right steps to clearly define what is and what is not protected speech on their platform,"" said Brandie Nonnecke, from University of California, Berkeley's Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society. But, she added: ""Facebook has a huge job on its hands."" The complexity of that job emerges when considering hate speech, a category much more difficult to control via automation. The firm tackled 2.5 million examples in the most recent period, up 56% on the October-to-December months. Human moderators were involved in dealing with the bulk of these, but even they faced problems deciding what should stay and what should be deleted. ""There's nuance, there's context that technology just can't do yet,"" said Alex Schultz, the company's head of data analytics. ""So, in those cases we lean a lot still on our review team, which makes a final decision on what needs to come down."" To demonstrate this, Mr Schultz said words that would be considered slurs if used as part of a homophobic attack had different meaning when used by gay people themselves. So, deleting all posts using a certain term would be the wrong choice. Facebook said that 2.2 billion people used its service at least once a month as of March ""But how do you know I'm gay if you're reviewing my profile?"" he asked. ""For me, I put it at the top of the profile - I've come screaming out of the closet, I am very openly gay. ""But that isn't true of everyone, and we can't know that. This is a very difficult problem."" In an attempt to discover what it may have missed, the social network carried out random sampling. It took an unspecified number of posts that had been viewed on Facebook, and made a note of how often a piece of content was in violation of its policies. The results were troubling. According to the sample, as many as 27 posts in every 10,000 contained some form of graphic violence. Given the 1.5 billion daily users of the service, that could means tens of millions of violent posts go unchecked every day. The same technique estimated between seven to nine posts in every 10,000 contained adult nudity or sexual content. The amount of terrorism-related material was too small to sample in this way, Mr Schultz said. And on hate speech, he said, the company lacked any ""reliable data"" on total volume. ""We can't currently measure how prevalent hate speech violations were on Facebook, because when we're asking our representatives to go and look, 'Is this hate speech, is this not?', it is very difficult to score that. ""We're making mistakes and we're trying to get better at measuring it."" But Dottie Lux, an event organiser in San Francisco, who campaigns against Facebook's perceived failure to combat the targeting of minority groups, said difficulty was no excuse. Event producer Dottie Lux is unconvinced by Facebook's efforts ""I'm running out of sympathy for 'This is really hard,' because it's really not new,"" she said. ""They find time to release dating apps and they find time to attach to my bank account, but they don't find time to figure out who their users are."" Ms Lux, who described herself to me as a ""gay Jewish lady with a gay Jewish perspective"", said relying on user reports to police hate speech was fundamentally flawed because it could be abused to silence others. ""You just give people with malicious intent the ability to act maliciously,"" she said. Facebook remains coy about the make-up of its human moderation team. It said it did try to make sure US-based workers handled incidents where an understanding of American culture was beneficial - likewise for incidents in other countries. But Ms Lux feels the company needs to be more open. ""If you are hiring people who don't exist in certain social circles, different cultures, it's not going to be effective,"" she said. ""It's just going to perpetuate the same issue."" Facebook reveals scale of abuse.

Second rugby player dies in Sri Lanka,"Thomas Baty (left) and Thomas Howard complained of breathing difficulties on Sunday A second British amateur rugby player has died after complaining of breathing difficulties on returning from a nightclub in Sri Lanka. Thomas Howard, 25, and Thomas Baty, 26, had been touring the country with Durham-based Clems Pirates RFC when they visited the club in Colombo. Mr Howard, from Durham, died after being admitted to hospital on Sunday. Mr Baty, also from Durham, who had been critically ill in the same hospital, has also now died. Durham City Rugby Football Club, which oversees the team, confirmed Mr Howard died after ""suffering breathing problems"". A club statement said: ""It is with great sadness that the Club can now confirm that Tom Baty has died following his admission to hospital on Sunday. ""We would like to extend our sincere condolences to the Baty family."" Mr Howard's post-mortem examination did not show any injury or illness and samples have been sent for further analysis, police said. Both players died in Colombo's Nawaloka Hospital Family members of both players are in Sri Lanka and are being assisted by UK consular staff. The team arrived in Sri Lanka on 9 May and began the tour with a game against Ceylonese Rugby and Football Club (CR & FC) in Colombo. According to police in Sri Lanka, some British players went to Colombo's Cleopatra nightclub after the match and returned to their hotel in the early hours of Sunday. The two players complained of breathing difficulties to the hotel management at about 10:00 on Sunday and were taken to Nawaloka Hospital. Police are examining CCTV from the nightclub in an effort to establish the players' movements. Tributes to the pair from other rugby clubs across the UK have been made on social media.

Year-long pay squeeze comes to an end,"Wages rose at an annual rate of 2.9% in the three months to March, faster than inflation for the first time in more than a year, official figures show. Over the same three-month period, the inflation rate was 2.7%. Inflation started to overtake wages in February last year, squeezing incomes. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalalso said unemployment fell by 46,000 to 1.42 million, with the jobless rate falling to 4.2% the lowest since 1975. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond said: ""Growth in real wages means that people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets; another turning point as we build a stronger, fairer economy. ""The unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years and with our National Living Wage we are making sure that the lowest-paid feel the benefit with an extra Â£2,000 a year."" However, the general secretary of the TUC, Frances O'Grady said: ""Working people are still not getting a fair deal. Millions of jobs do not pay a real living wage. And average weekly pay is still worth much less than a decade ago."" John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC said: ""The rise in wages will be helpful as it follows a long period when wages have been falling relative to inflation, but wages are still lower in real terms than they were before the financial crisis. and this won't turn round things overnight."" The number of people in work increased by 197,000 in the January-to-March period to 32.3 million. The ONS said that 75.6% of people aged from 16 to 64 years were now in work, the highest since records began in 1971. Alongside the strong employment figures, improved wage growth means there is certainly plenty of better news in the latest Office for National Statistics figures. But - a few words of caution. Weak incomes have been a problem for a decade. It will need a long period of wages rising above the rate of inflation for people to feel significantly better off. And, for the public sector, the 1% cap on wage rises is only just being released. Many millions of people still have incomes below where they were a decade ago. The financial crisis, poor economic performance and major changes in public sector financing have cast a very long shadow. Read Kamal's blog in full Senior ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: ""With employment up again in the three months to March, the rate has hit a new record, with unemployment remaining at its lowest rate since 1975. ""The growth in employment is still being driven by UK nationals, with a slight drop over the past year in the number of foreign workers. It's important to remember, though, that this isn't a measure of migration."" Mr Hawksworth said: ""All of this good news stands in marked contrast to the subdued GDP growth of just 0.1% estimated for the first quarter. ""Overall, the continued robustness of the labour market may strengthen the hand of those arguing for interest rates to rise sooner rather than later. ""But the majority of the [Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee] will probably want to wait for hard evidence of output bouncing back in the second quarter before they pull the trigger on interest rates."" Last week, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold at 0.5%,saying the UK economy had hit a ""temporary soft patch"". Separate data from the ONS said its initial estimates of productivity, a measure of output per hour, had fallen 0.5% in the three months to March, the largest fall since the last three months of 2015. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The relapse in productivity... is particularly disappointing as there needs to be sustained improvement to ease concerns over the UK's overall poor productivity record since the deep 2008-09 recession. ""Part of the UK's recent poor labour productivity performance has undoubtedly been that low wage growth has increased the attractiveness of employment for companies. ""It is also possible that some companies may have looked to take on labour rather than commit to investment, given the highly uncertain economic and political outlook.""

'Fat tax' row forces New Look price review,"The larger size (left), in the Curves range, costs Â£22.99, while the very similar pair in the standard range cost Â£19.99 Fashion chain New Look is reviewing its prices after an outcry that some larger-sized clothes were more expensive than those in smaller sizes. The High Street retailer said it was hoping to ""ensure pricing differences like these"" did not happen in future. It comes after a shopper saw trousers in its Curves range cost 15% more than a pair in the main collection. The issue has divided opinion over whether using more material should mean higher prices. Some have said it is reasonable to charge more for a garment that uses more fabric. Others see it as a ""fat tax"". Plus-size model Nyome Nicholas-Williams told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she felt the application of higher prices was discriminatory. ""Some people don't choose to be the size they are - or height. If you have to pay extra money [for clothes] subliminally it feels like you are being told you have to lose weight,"" she said. However, Anna Scholz, a plus-size fashion designer, told the programme there was a limit to the size range that could be produced for the same price as it can take twice the fabric to make the same shirt for a larger size as a small one. ""As a company we sell from size 16 to 28 - if I had smaller sizes as well I would have to price them differently."" This video can not be played Victoria with designer Anna Scholz and plus-size model Nyome Nicholas-Williams Maria Wassell, a retail supervisor from Kent, spotted the discrepancy at her local New Look branch in Ashford in Kent. She told the Sun newspaper: ""It's like I'm being discriminated against for being plus-size when I'm only slightly bigger than average. ""The average size for a British woman is now a size 16. Plus-size purchases are on the increase. If you look at the statistics, there's more money being spent on plus-size clothing now then there was even three years ago."" Ms Wassell said she used to work for a plus-size brand, and the argument that clothes for bigger sizes needed to be priced more highly was ""basically rubbish"". Emily Sutherland, features writer at fashion trade journal Drapers, also had little time for that explanation. ""Retailers may argue a larger size requires more fabric and is therefore more expensive to produce... or that there are subtle differences between straight and plus-size products that impact on price, but customers point out tall and maternity ranges, which also use more fabric, are rarely priced higher - and that smaller petite products are unlikely to be cheaper."" She said harmonising prices between the ranges was becoming increasingly common. New Look said in a statement: ""We are in the process of reviewing the pricing structure of our Plus Size collection in a way which works best for our customers and our business. ""We are proud of the ranges we offer to our Plus Size customers and value all customers, no matter what their body shape or size.""

Holyrood set to reject Brexit powers bill,"Brexit Secretary Mike Russell told MSPs that the UK government's proposal was ""unprecedented, unequal and unacceptable"" The Scottish Parliament has refused to give its consent to the UK's main piece of Brexit legislation. The Scottish and UK governments are at odds over the EU Withdrawal Bill and what it could mean for devolved powers. Labour, Green and Lib Dem MSPs united to back SNP members in rejecting the Westminster bill, saying it would restrict Holyrood's powers. The Scottish Conservatives voted against, and have blamed the SNP for the failure to find an agreement. MSPs voted by 93 to 30 that Holyrood ""does not consent to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill"". Westminster ultimately has the power to introduce the legislation without the consent of Holyrood - but it would be politically difficult, and has never been done before. How significant is this vote? What is the row all about anyway? Look back on the debate on Holyrood Live Speaking after the vote, Scotland's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, urged the UK government to respect the will of the Scottish Parliament and find an acceptable solution. He said: ""The Scottish Parliament has now said overwhelmingly that this attempt to undermine devolution is unacceptable. ""The UK government cannot ignore the reality of devolution or try to drown out what this parliament says. They cannot pretend that no motion has been passed."" Both the Scottish and UK governments insist that the door is still open to finding a deal, although both sides also admit they remain some distance apart. Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said that the UK government had already made ""radical"" changes to the bill which had resulted in the Labour government in Walesdropping its opposition to it. And he said it was ""profoundly regrettable"" that a deal had not been done between Scottish and UK ministers, saying that ""the only government that hasn't compromised is the Scottish government"". Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland ahead of the vote that she still hopes a deal can be reached with the UK government The Scottish government insists this is a highly significant moment, as it is the first time the Holyrood parliament has ever refused consent to a piece of Westminster legislation which is likely to be imposed anyway, without consent. It is certainly a constitutional first - but one that can be overcome by Westminster. The UK government has the authority to simply impose the Brexit legislation on Scotland, even if that is politically problematic. It would overturn 20 years of constitutional convention and precedent. This prime minister has ignored the will of the Scottish Parliament before. This time last year itvoted in favour of a second indyrefand the PMsaid no. There was no noticeable uprising of popular outrage then. And there is unlikely to be so now. Nicola Sturgeon rarely shies away from a fight with Westminster. It's generally good politics for her to say she is ""standing up for Scotland"" against ministers in London. She hopes it helps build the case for why Scotland would be better off as an independent country. Her problem is that this argument has not caught voters' attention. The right of the Scottish Parliament to have a definitive say over regulations governing the use of pesticides does not appear to cause great concern to Scots. Some may be outraged over the principle of legislation being imposed on Scotland after it has been specifically rejected by their MSPs. The practical consequences may not amount to much. Yet it is one more headache for Theresa May in the migraine-inducing process of trying to secure a Brexit deal. Read more from Sarah Months of talks between the two governments have failed to reach an agreement The UK government has published proposals that would see the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit. But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement. It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK. But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years. It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government. Read more here The consent vote at Holyrood is the latest step in the long-running powers row between the Scottish and UK governments During the debate, Mr Russell told MSPs that they needed to defend the progress which has been made in the 20 years of devolution in Scotland. He said: ""It is our job to ensure that it is not cast aside because of a Brexit which Scotland did not vote for and which can only be damaging to our country. ""Today the challenge of Brexit - or rather the challenge of the proposed power grab by the UK government under the guise of delivering Brexit - puts our devolved settlement at risk."" Mr Russell also told MSPs that the Withdrawal Bill would add an ""unprecedented, unequal and unacceptable new legislative constraint"", taking powers away from Holyrood for up to seven years. And he said that the consent vote ""will not be the end of this process"", as it applies only to the bill ""as it stands"". The UK government's Scottish secretary, David Mundell, said he was ""disappointed"" by the vote, but said the UK parliament remains sovereign and can proceed regardless. But he said he remained hopeful that an agreement could still be reached between the two governments. Mr Mundell said: ""It's something that was envisaged by the devolution settlement, that there might be circumstances where consent wouldn't be given. ""That circumstance would permit the Westminster government to proceed with legislation on that basis, and that's what we intend to do because the bill is already in the system. ""Obviously there'll be the opportunity for debate and discussion in parliament, but also I hope between the two governments. I still think we can resolve this issue, and that remains my objective."" A Scottish Labour amendment calling for ""cross-party talksin an attempt to broker an agreed way forward"" was accepted, and Mr Russell said he would invite UK ministers to ""hear the concerns of all parties"" and to discuss ""any new ideas"". The party's Brexit spokesman, Neil Findlay, blamed the Conservatives and their ""shambolic handling"" of Brexit for the failure to reach an agreement. Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie hailed the ""unity"" displayed by SNP, Labour, Green and Lib Dem members saying they would ""stand together in defence of the parliament"". Lib Dem Europe spokesman Tavish Scott said the negotiating governments had failed to learn from the ""ongoing farce"" of Brexit, arguing that leaving the EU was ""bad for the UK and bad for Scotland"".

Diet pills caused 'distressing death',"Eloise Parry died in 2015 at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital A ""vulnerable"" bulimic woman suffered the ""most distressing"" death after taking a toxic slimming aid she bought online, a court heard. Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury,died in April 2015after taking eight diet pills containing Dinitrophenol (DNP). Albert Huynh, 33, Bernard Rebelo, 30, and Mary Roberts, 32, all deny Miss Parry's manslaughter. Prosecutor Richard Barraclough QC told jurors taking the chemical is like ""playing Russian roulette"". Opening the case at Inner London Crown Court, he said ""you might survive, you might not"". Midlands Live: Cat wedged between houses rescued; Dumped horse ordered online doing well Miss Parry, a student at Glyndwr University, Wrexham, started taking the chemical in pill form in February 2015, and soon became addicted. It is alleged the group were operating from a flat in Harrow, north west London, and made the capsules which they sold online for considerable profits. Jurors were told how the defendants bought the chemicals in drums from China and two of the defendants had consumed DNP themselves so knew of its dangers. Miss Parry had been studying families and childhood studies The defendants ""cynically thwarted"" authorities such as the Food Standards Agency and Interpol that tried to close down their operations, the court heard. Describing DNP and its effects, Mr Barraclough said it was a ""highly toxic substance when ingested, inhaled or absorbed through the skin"". He added it causes weight loss by burning fat and carbohydrates, in turn causing energy to be converted into heat. ""The result is that that person's temperature and metabolic rate all dangerously increase,"" Mr Barraclough explained. In the weeks before her death Miss Parry, who had a history of self-harming, was admitted to hospital numerous times, suffering from the effects of taking the chemical. She sent desperate messages to her friends telling them she wanted to stop taking the pills but was ""psychologically addicted"" and knew that feeling her temperature rise meant her fat was burning, jurors heard. Having driven herself to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital after feeling unwell, she messaged a friend, saying: ""I screwed up big time. Binged/purged all night and took four pills at 4am. ""I took another four when I woke and I started vomiting soon after. I think I am going to die. ""No one is known to survive if they vomit after taking DNP. I am so scared."" Mr Huynh from Northolt, north-west London, Mr Rebelo and Ms Roberts, both from Gosport, deny two counts each of manslaughter, one count each of supplying an unsafe food, and Ms Roberts faces a single count of money laundering. The trial continues.

Kristen Stewart goes barefoot at Cannes,"This video can not be played Kristen Stewart ditched her heels on the red carpet at Cannes The issue of high heels at Cannes has been a spiky one in recent years. Now it seems Kristen Stewart, a member of this year's jury at the film festival, has flouted the ban on flat shoes - by instead going barefoot on the red carpet. The Twilight actress wore black Louboutin heels as she arrived at the BlacKkKlansman premiere. But before entering the screening of the Spike Lee film, she slipped off her shoes to walk up the stairs. She was apparently not sanctioned for taking off her heels. Last year, Stewart - who's been known to wear trainers with dresses on the red carpet -spoke about the event's fashion rules,external. ""There's definitely a distinct dress code, right?"" she told the Hollywood Reporter. ""People get very upset if you don't wear heels or whatever. ""I feel like you can't ask people that any more - it's a given. If you're not asking guys to wear heels and a dress, you cannot ask me either."" Kristen as she appeared with heels on ""Bye bye, heels"" The heels are going... ...And they're gone In 2015, it was reported that women had been turned away from red carpet premieres for wearing flat shoes. The ban caused stars to speak out against the guidelines, with British actress Emily Blunt saying the alleged ban was ""very disappointing"". Speaking at the time, she said: ""Everyone should wear flats, to be honest. We shouldn't be wearing high heels anyway. That's my point of view."" Stewart isn't the first person to take her shoes off on the red carpet since then, with Julia Roberts going barefoot at Cannes in 2016 at the premiere for Money Monster. BlacKkKlansman, which tells the story of an African-American infiltrating the KKK and stars John David Washington and Adam Driver, was given a standing ovation at the end of its premiere on Monday night.

Nine revealing facts about how long we live Life expectancy is the number of years on average a person is expected to live based on their age, gender and country. The Global Burden of Disease calculates life expectancy by using a country's mortality rates across age groups. Life expectancy may vary for people of different ages because it is calculated as the number of years a person is expected to live given they have already reached a certain age. For example, a girl born in 2016 in Mexico is expected to live to age 79, however the life expectancy of a 65-year-old woman in Mexico in  2016 is 84.  Her life expectancy is higher because she has already reached 65 and is therefore more likely to live another 20 years.

The values for life expectancy in the calculator are rounded to the nearest year after adding the age input to the remaining life expectancy for the relevant age group. In most cases age groups span five years, for example from ages 10 to 14. 'How much of your remaining life will be healthy' is calculated from the number of years a person can expect to live in good health, taking into account disability. This is displayed as a percentage of their remaining life expectancy.

"Willow Smith reveals she used to self-harmThe singer spoke to her mum and grandmother about the ""black hole"" she fell into as an adolescent after her single came out.7h7 hours agoNewsbeat","Willow Smith has revealed she ""lost her sanity"" and used to self-harm as a child. The 17-year-old said it happened after the exposure of her song Whip My Hair, which was released in 2010 - when she was nine years old. ""After all of that settled down and there was a lull, I was just listening to a lot of dark music and it was just so crazy,"" she added. ""I was just plunged into this black hole and I was cutting myself."" She told her mum, Jada Pinkett Smith, and grandmother, Adrienne Banfield-Norrison, on the web series Red Table Talk, that she stopped five years ago. If you need help with issues related to self-harm, you can go toBBC Advice. Willow says her brother Jaden and half-brother Trey didn't know she was self-harming Willow said it happened after the hype died down from Whip My Hair and she had just cancelled plans to finish her album. ""I was kind of just in this grey area of like 'Who am I? Do I have a purpose? Is there anything that I can do beyond this?'"" Her mum and grandmother appeared shocked when she told them. Explaining why she turned to self-harm, she said: ""I honestly felt like I was experiencing so much emotional pain but my physical circumstances weren't reflecting that."" Allow YouTube content?

Sharing of pupils' data put on hold,"The national pupil database compiles data from school censuses The government has halted researchers and others from accessing personal information about UK schoolchildren, it has emerged. The Department for Education said the step wasa temporary move,externalto modify the national pupil database's approval process. It told the BBC that the step was required to be compliant with a shake-up of EU data privacy rules. The law gives children and others new rights and comes into force on 25 May. ""The department takes the use of personal information and the implications of the General Data Protection Regulation very seriously,"" the DfE said in a statement. ""We've temporarily paused applications for data from the national pupil Database ahead of the implementation of the GDPR."" This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? The national pupil database is designed to help experts study the effect of different educational strategies over time. Access was ""paused"" on 1 May, and the DfE has said it expects to provide further information in June. Campaigners have raised concerns that many parents are unaware that data on millions of English schoolchildren can be shared with academics and businesses. Applicants can request different levels of access, with thehighest level including,externalindividual children's names, addresses, ethnicities and disabilities, among other factors. A recent survey by the data privacy campaign Defend Digital Mesuggested most parents,external(69%) did not know about the data-sharing. Currently, parents and children are not allowed access to their data. Gender, ethnicity, exam performance and reasons for absence can all be accessed by third parties under certain rules. Defend Digital Me is calling for a change in how the data is managed. Prof Ross Anderson - a leading cyber-security expert at the University of Cambridge - has also raised concerns, despite the fact that other researchers at the institution have made use of the data. ""The government is forcing schools to collect data that are then sold or given to firms that exploit it, with no meaningful consent,"" he blogged on Monday. ""There is not even the normal right to request subject access so you can check whether the information about you is right and have it corrected if it's wrong. ""Our elected representatives make a lot of noise about protecting children; time to call them on it."" English records in the national pupil database have been kept since 1998 and include more than 21 million named English schoolchildren. Freedom of Information (FoI) requests made by Defend Digital Me also found data on 1.2 million Scottish children had been collected since 2007, though in that case the pupils were not named. The information, collected by the DfE, is generally gathered via school censuses. Source:Defend Digital Me,external Records of who has accessed the data and why areavailable on the DfE's website,external. Requests from academic researchers make up the majority of data extract applications processed by the DfE. Many relate to projects studying education in the UK, for example. Academic researchers' use of personal datasets has faced scrutiny recently - notably after it was revealed that data gathered by a Cambridge University researcherhad been passed to Cambridge Analytica. There is no suggestion that Cambridge Analytica had accessed national pupil database records. Besides academic researchers, there are also requests from private companies, which use the data to aid education policy consulting services to local authorities. The Home Office has requested data on schoolchildren under its immigration control and Syrian resettlement programmes - though the latter request has yet to receive approval. The BBC's Newsnight programme also requested data, in March 2017, when it was producing a package on the English school system. It was given tier-two access, which includes pupils' ages and ethnicities but not names or home addresses. The DfE records that Newsnight later destroyed the data in accordance with rules around access. Defend Digital Me has said that the government does not currently allow parents or children the right to see records relating to them or to have them corrected if inaccurate. According to the group's survey of 1,004 English parents - carried out by Survation - 79% would choose to see the records if they were able to. ""Defend Digital Me is campaigning to have that changed, and wants the government to respect children's subject access rights... in the General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR],"" the report said. Jen Persson, the group's director, told the BBC: ""As a mother with three children in primary school four years ago, I didn't know there was a national pupil database at all or that my children's personal data were stored at named level, given away to commercial third parties."" She said that everything she had since discovered, thanks to research and FoI requests, was ""not widely known at all"". The research by Defend Digital Me ""raises serious questions"", said Ailidh Callander, a legal officer at civil liberties group Privacy International. ""It is important that data practices in the education sector are examined thoroughly - particularly given the sensitivity of children's data,"" she told the BBC. Defend Digital Me has also investigated the use of web monitoring software on computers used at school A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said that it had engaged with the DfE about its processing of pupil data in the past ""and continues to do so"". ""The GDPR requires that personal data is processed fairly, lawfully and transparently, as well as enhancing people's rights,"" she said. ""We understand that the DfE is reviewing its processing of pupil data as part of its GDPR preparations. And the ICO will continue to engage with the DfE on this.""

Willow Smith reveals she used to self-harm,"Willow Smith has revealed she ""lost her sanity"" and used to self-harm as a child. The 17-year-old said it happened after the exposure of her song Whip My Hair, which was released in 2010 - when she was nine years old. ""After all of that settled down and there was a lull, I was just listening to a lot of dark music and it was just so crazy,"" she added. ""I was just plunged into this black hole and I was cutting myself."" She told her mum, Jada Pinkett Smith, and grandmother, Adrienne Banfield-Norrison, on the web series Red Table Talk, that she stopped five years ago. If you need help with issues related to self-harm, you can go toBBC Advice. Willow says her brother Jaden and half-brother Trey didn't know she was self-harming Willow said it happened after the hype died down from Whip My Hair and she had just cancelled plans to finish her album. ""I was kind of just in this grey area of like 'Who am I? Do I have a purpose? Is there anything that I can do beyond this?'"" Her mum and grandmother appeared shocked when she told them. Explaining why she turned to self-harm, she said: ""I honestly felt like I was experiencing so much emotional pain but my physical circumstances weren't reflecting that."" Allow YouTube content?

German furore over Premiership footballer photos,"Mesut Ãzil (L) presented President Erdogan with his Arsenal shirt The German Football Federation (DFB) has criticised its internationals Mesut Ãzil and Ilkay GÃ¼ndogan for posing in photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The two German-born players, both of Turkish origin, gave Mr Erdogan signed shirts at an event in London on Sunday. GÃ¼ndogan wrote: ""For my honoured President, with great respect."" Mr Erdogan is campaigning for re-election. Ãzil plays for Arsenal and GÃ¼ndogan for Manchester City. Both players are preparing for next month's Fifa World Cup in Russia, in which Germany is among the favourites. Turkey did not qualify. Turkey's pugnacious president Erdogan's Turkey - the full story Three Turkish-origin stars posed with Mr Erdogan (L-R): Ilkay GÃ¼ndogan (Man City); Mesut Ãzil (Arsenal) and Cenk Tosun (Everton) Many German politicians have also criticised the footballers, questioning their loyalty to German democratic values. DFB president Reinhard Grindel said: ""Football and the DFB defend values which are not sufficiently respected by Mr Erdogan. ""That's why it's not good that our international players let themselves be manipulated for his electoral campaign. In doing that, our players have certainly not helped the DFB's work on integration."" DFB director Oliver Bierhoff said: ""Neither one of them was aware of the symbolic value of this photo, but it's clearly not right and we'll be talking to them about it"". In his youth, before entering politics in the 1990s, Mr Erdogan played football semi-professionally for an Istanbul team, Kasimpasa. Which players are going to the World Cup? Erdogan says German leaders are enemies Mr Erdogan, in power for the past 15 years, is seeking re-election in a snap poll on 24 June. His Islamist-rooted AK Party has cracked down hard on opponents, especially since the July 2016 coup attempt by military officers. Turkish police have arrested more than 50,000 people accused of links to US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen or to Kurdish separatists. They include opposition activists, journalists, teachers, lawyers and other public servants. Mr Erdogan has also purged the military, police and judiciary, putting many state officials on trial. He has created a powerful presidency since winning an April 2017 referendum on constitutional changes, enabling him to dominate parliament and control the judiciary. A prominent Turkish-origin MP in Germany, Sevim Dagdelen, tweeted: ""It's a crude foul to pose with the despot Erdogan in a luxury hotel in London and dignify him with the title 'my President', while in Turkey democrats are persecuted and critical journalists are detained."" She is deputy leader of the left-wing Die Linke group in the Bundestag. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After the criticism erupted, GÃ¼ndogan issued a statement defending himself, Ãzil and Cenk Tosun over their meeting with Mr Erdogan. They met on the sidelines of an event at a Turkish foundation that helps Turkish students, he explained. ""Are we supposed to be impolite to the president of our families' homeland?"" he asked. ""Whatever justified criticism there might be, we decided on a gesture of politeness, out of respect for the office of president and for our Turkish roots."" He said ""it was not our intention to make a political statement with this picture"". Turkish-origin Cem Ãzdemir, a prominent German Green MP and sharp critic of Mr Erdogan, attacked GÃ¼ndogan's ""my President"" message. ""The federal president of a German international footballer is called Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the chancellor is Angela Merkel and the parliament is called the German Bundestag,"" he said.

Racist hate mail sent with O2 Sim cards,"The leaflets were address to ""Mr Isis Terroriste"" and ""Mr Getout Ofengland"" O2 has apologised after two items of ""shocking"" racist hate mail were sent to a British-Iraqi family in London. Addressed to ""Mr Isis Terroriste"" and ""Mr Getout Ofengland"" at the exact family address in Wembley, north London, they contained free pay-as-you-go Sim cards ordered online in August 2017 by an unknown third party. The family, who presumed they were junk mail, only recently read the envelopes. The Muslim Council of Britain said the ""Islamophobia"" was deeply concerning. The family told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Programme: ""We were really saddened to come across these letters, especially having a younger child in the house who we don't want to grow up witnessing such hateful language. ""It's even sadder to think that such hate speech has become normalised despite living in such a uniquely multicultural and diverse city like London."" Family friend and lawyer Sura Jawad said the letters were hateful. ""It's horrible to think that there are people who have so much hatred in them that they set out to deliberately make others feel isolated and unwelcome or who take comments like these light-heartedly,"" she said. ""Either scenario shows that racism and Islamophobia are very much rife issues, particularly in a post-Brexit climate."" O2 said its Sim card postage and printing was managed by a third-party partner, Williams Lea Tag, and was automated. Human checks were in place but only once a query had been identified. And in this case no query had been raised before postage. The company said it would be working with this partner to review the entire process as a result of this issue - including where human checking was used. O2 added that it ""has a rigorous data-cleansing process in place to prevent any of our free products being sent to addresses with obscenities or offensive names, and so this is a rare occurrence"". ""If the family decide to report this case, we will work closely with the police as part of their investigation."" After speaking to a friend of the family affected, Miqdaad Versi, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: ""These Islamophobic bigots are finding more and more ways to spread their hatred. ""Whilst it is imperative that corporations upgrade safeguards to prevent such incidents recurring, there are broader concerns about the government not taking Islamophobia seriously.""

Meghan's father may not attend wedding,"Meghan with her father Thomas, who is a former television lighting director It is unclear whether Meghan Markle's father Thomas will walk her down the aisle on Saturday, after hetold celebrity news website TMZ,externalthat he would not attend his daughter's wedding to Prince Harry. Ms Markle's half-sister, Samantha, has since said she hopes her father will attend if he is well enough. Kensington Palace said it was ""a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle"". It follows reports in the Mail on Sunday,externalthat Mr Markle staged pictures. The widely circulated paparazzi photographs showed him being measured for a wedding suit and looking at newspaper stories about his daughter. He is reported to have said that he did not want to cause his daughter embarrassment by attending the wedding. Samantha, Ms Markle's half-sister from her father's first marriage, told Good Morning Britain the photographs had been done with ""good intention"" and that Mr Markle, 73, had suffered a heart attack due to stress. She said the media had ""raked him over the coals"" and ""distorted his image"". ""He had a moral right to set the record straight and defend himself,"" she added. Prince William joins DIY SOS Grenfell team Caged tiger at Florida school prom WATCH: The problem of China's huge bike graveyards The ex-Suits actress's father lives in Mexico and is a former lighting director who worked on programmes including the 80s TV show Married with Children and General Hospital, for which he and his team won two Emmy awards. He and Ms Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, divorced when Ms Markle was six years old. Mr Markle, who has two children - including Samantha - from his first marriage, filed for bankruptcy two years ago. Meghan Markle has previously said: ""It's safe to say I have always been a daddy's girl - he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank-you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura."" By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent People around Meghan Markle are saying she is having to contemplate her father not walking her down the aisle. The pressure has been absolutely relentless and she and Prince Harry have been concerned for some time about Thomas Markle's mental state. He seems to have been rather caught out by the astonishing pressure that fell upon him. Whether by design or accident he fell into this photo agency scam. We have another example of that unhappy flipside of royalty - which is the extraordinary pressure of the media's attention, part of it brought on by the fact the royal family require the attention of the press to maintain their relevance. Mr Markle had been due to meet Prince Harry for the first time this week,as well as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, before walking his daughter down the aisle at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said he understood Ms Markle, 36, was distressed and concerned for the wellbeing of her father, who has been described as a rather shy and reclusive figure. ""I understand it is still very much Meghan Markle's wish that her father should be there on Saturday to support her,"" he added. Royal wedding: What we know so far Who is Meghan Markle? Meghan's wedding eve hotel revealed The UK's rapidly changing mixed-race population A Kensington Palace spokesman said: ""This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. ""She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation."" The controversy surrounds pictures of Mr Markle, which were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers showing him in a series of wedding-related activities - apparently unaware he was being photographed. Samantha Markle said it was not done for money, and tweeted: ""The media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family."" Paparazzi photographer George Bamby said setting up photographs was ""easy"", telling the BBC's Today programme the only reason people do it is for money. This video can not be played ""It's like when Obama became president"": BBC News talks to black Britons about the 'Meghan effect' The wedding will take place on 19 May at 12:00 BST at St George's Chapel in Windsor.

Prince Harry will be staying 15 miles away at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park in Ascot, with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge.

Gap apologises for China map T-shirts,"US retailer Gap has apologised for selling T-shirts which it said showed an ""incorrect map"" of China. The design featured just the mainland and not territories that China also claims, such as Taiwan. A picture of the T-shirt was posted on Chinese social media network, Weibo, generating hundreds of complaints. The company said it respected China's ""sovereignty"" and would implement ""rigorous reviews"" to prevent a repeat of the incident. Gap is the latest in a string of foreign firms to face a backlash for not adhering to China's territorial claims. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The post on Weibo said the T-shirt, which was being sold in Canada, did not show Chinese-claimed territories including Taiwan, islands in the South China Sea and south Tibet. Beijing considers self-ruling Taiwan to be a breakaway province, while Tibet is governed as an autonomous region. China also claims a large part of territory in the South China Sea, which neighbouring Asian countries dispute. ""South Tibet"" is how China refers to what it claims is its territory in the Indian-administered region of Arunachal Pradesh. Why is the South China Sea contentious? In a statement Gap said it ""sincerely apologised for this unintentional error"". The clothing giant said the product had been pulled from the Chinese market and destroyed. It was not clear what would happen to those being sold outside the mainland. Several other companies including Marriottand Delta Airlines have issued similar apologies this year after information on their websites appeared to conflict with China's territorial claims. Last month, Beijing demanded a group of foreign airlines respect China's sovereignty claims and change the way they refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. The White House hit back, describing China's claims as ""Orwellian nonsense"" and sharply criticised Beijing for trying to impose its ""political correctness on American companies and their citizens"".

Police face recognition tools 'inaccurate',"Police must address concerns over the use of facial recognition systems or may face legal action, the UK's privacy watchdog says. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said the issue had become a ""priority"" for her office. An investigation by campaign group Big Brother Watch suggested the technology flagged up a ""staggering"" number of innocent people as suspects. But police have defended the technology and say safeguards are in place. Big Brother Watch submitted freedom of information requests to every police force in the UK. Two police forces acknowledged they were currently testing facial recognition cameras. The Metropolitan Police used facial recognition at London's Notting Hill carnival in 2016 and 2017 and at a Remembrance Sunday event. Its system incorrectly flagged 102 people as potential suspects and led to no arrests. In figures given to Big Brother Watch, South Wales Police said its technology had made 2,685 ""matches"" between May 2017 and March 2018 - but 2,451 were false alarms. Leicestershire Police tested facial recognition in 2015, but is no longer using it at events. Police facial recognition cameras have been trialled at events such as football matches, festivals and parades. High-definition cameras detect all the faces in a crowd and compare them with existing police photographs, such as mugshots from previous arrests. Any potential matches are flagged for a police officer to investigate further. South Wales Police has defended its use of facial recognition software and says the system has improved with time. ""When we first deployed and we were learning how to use it... some of the digital images we used weren't of sufficient quality,"" said Deputy Chief Constable Richard Lewis. ""Because of the poor quality, it was identifying people wrongly. They weren't able to get the detail from the picture."" It said a ""number of safeguards"" prevented any action being taken against innocent people. ""Firstly, the operator in the van is able to see that the person identified in the picture is clearly not the same person, and it's literally disregarded at that point,"" said Mr Lewis. ""On a much smaller number of occasions, officers went and spoke to the individual... realised it wasn't them, and offered them the opportunity to come and see the van. ""At no time was anybody arrested wrongly, nobody's liberty was taken away from them."" The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it was testing facial recognition to see whether it could ""assist police in identifying known offenders in large events, in order to protect the wider public"". This video can not be played In your face: China's all-seeing surveillance system ""Regarding 'false' positive matches - we do not consider these as false positive matches because additional checks and balances are in place to confirm identification following system alerts,"" it said in a statement. ""All alerts against the watch list are deleted after 30 days. Faces in the video stream that do not generate an alert are deleted immediately."" But Big Brother Watch said it was concerned that facial recognition cameras would affect ""individuals' right to a private life and freedom of expression"". It also raised concerns that photos of any ""false alarms"" were sometimes kept by police for weeks. ""Automated facial recognition technology is currently used by UK police forces without a clear legal basis, oversight or governmental strategy,"" the group said. Big Brother Watch wants police to stop using facial recognition technology. It has also called on the government to make sure that the police do not keep the photos of innocent people. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said police had to demonstrate that facial recognition was ""effective"" that no less intrusive methods were available. ""Should my concerns not be addressed I will consider what legal action is needed to ensure the right protections are in place for the public,"" said Ms Denham. The Home Office told the BBC it plans to publish its biometrics strategy in June, and it ""continues to support police to respond to changing criminal activity and new demands"". ""When trialling facial recognition technologies, forces must show regard to relevant policies, including the Surveillance Camera Code of Practices and the Information Commissioner's guide,"" it said in a statement.

New Look reviews prices amid 'fat tax' row,"The larger size (left), in the Curves range, costs Â£22.99, while the very similar pair in the standard range cost Â£19.99 Fashion chain New Look is reviewing its prices after an outcry that some larger-sized clothes were more expensive than those in smaller sizes. The High Street retailer said it was hoping to ""ensure pricing differences like these"" did not happen in future. It comes after a shopper saw trousers in its Curves range cost 15% more than a pair in the main collection. The issue has divided opinion over whether using more material should mean higher prices. Some have said it is reasonable to charge more for a garment that uses more fabric. Others see it as a ""fat tax"". Plus-size model Nyome Nicholas-Williams told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she felt the application of higher prices was discriminatory. ""Some people don't choose to be the size they are - or height. If you have to pay extra money [for clothes] subliminally it feels like you are being told you have to lose weight,"" she said. However, Anna Scholz, a plus-size fashion designer, told the programme there was a limit to the size range that could be produced for the same price as it can take twice the fabric to make the same shirt for a larger size as a small one. ""As a company we sell from size 16 to 28 - if I had smaller sizes as well I would have to price them differently."" This video can not be played Victoria with designer Anna Scholz and plus-size model Nyome Nicholas-Williams Maria Wassell, a retail supervisor from Kent, spotted the discrepancy at her local New Look branch in Ashford in Kent. She told the Sun newspaper: ""It's like I'm being discriminated against for being plus-size when I'm only slightly bigger than average. ""The average size for a British woman is now a size 16. Plus-size purchases are on the increase. If you look at the statistics, there's more money being spent on plus-size clothing now then there was even three years ago."" Ms Wassell said she used to work for a plus-size brand, and the argument that clothes for bigger sizes needed to be priced more highly was ""basically rubbish"". Emily Sutherland, features writer at fashion trade journal Drapers, also had little time for that explanation. ""Retailers may argue a larger size requires more fabric and is therefore more expensive to produce... or that there are subtle differences between straight and plus-size products that impact on price, but customers point out tall and maternity ranges, which also use more fabric, are rarely priced higher - and that smaller petite products are unlikely to be cheaper."" She said harmonising prices between the ranges was becoming increasingly common. New Look said in a statement: ""We are in the process of reviewing the pricing structure of our Plus Size collection in a way which works best for our customers and our business. ""We are proud of the ranges we offer to our Plus Size customers and value all customers, no matter what their body shape or size.""

'Spice epidemic in jails risk to nurses',"Spice is a laboratory-created cannabis substitute An epidemic of a laboratory-created cannabis substitute in UK prisons is putting nurses called in to treat inmates at risk, union leaders say. The Royal College of Nursing said it had members who had been left unwell after treating prisoners who had taken the illegal drug, known as ""spice"". One lost consciousness after inhaling the fumes and had to be taken to an accident and emergency unit. And in some places 50 inmates were being treated each week, the RCN said. It comes after a report last year by HM Inspectorate of Prisons raised concern over the widespread use of the drug. It said inmates were sometimes not diluting it with tobacco, leading to serious medical emergencies. This video can not be played Synthetic drugs, such as Spice, have overwhelmed prisons Nurses and healthcare assistants are often the first on the scene when inmates need emergency care. They are expected to enter cells before the smoke is clear. But the union says NHS staff should be allowed to assess the danger of the situation before rushing in and called on the prison service to do more to combat the problem. One nurse, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ""Recently we've had to give medical care to over 50 people in one week. ""Walking back after attending to a patient, I've sat in my car in the car park for 50 minutes after work so I feel confident enough to drive."" RCN general secretary Janet Davies said: ""Spice poses a serious threat to nurses, healthcare assistants and prison staff, whose safety and long-term health is being put at risk day in, day out. ""As dedicated health professionals, prison nursing staff are expected to offer high quality care, but they should not be expected to put their own wellbeing on the line to deliver it. ""I have heard some truly shocking stories of nursing staff passing out or being unable to drive after exposure to spice."" A Prison Service spokesman said: ""The best way to keep staff and inmates safe is to keep drugs out of our prisons. ""That is why we have trained more than 300 specialist drug dogs, introduced body scanners and intelligence-led searches and made it a criminal office to possess psychoactive substances in prison.""

Johnson 'must raise jailed Iran mum case',"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being used to pressure the British government, her husband says The husband of a jailed British-Iranian mother has urged Boris Johnson to raise his wife's case when he meets Iran's foreign minister later. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 39, is serving a five-year jail sentence in Iran after being convicted of spying. But Richard Ratcliffe says his wife is ""shaken and bewildered"" after learning she could face new charges. The UK's foreign secretary is due to meet his Iranian counterpart in Brussels for Iran nuclear deal talks. British-Iranian dual national Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Hampstead, north London, has been held in Iran since April 2016, when she was detained at an airport while travelling home with her daughter. She was accused by Iran of plotting against the government. She denies the charges against her and says she was in the country to introduce her daughter, Gabriella, to her parents. What is the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Theresa May raises jailed Britons' cases with Iran Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals According to her husband, prosecutors have said that the case against her has been reopened and a decision is expected next week. He said his wife was feeling ""pretty down and shaken"", and ""bewildered as to how she could have done anything while she is sitting in prison"". Her parents, meanwhile, were ""deeply traumatised"", he added. ""For all of us, this has gone on for so long. It's just such a rabbit hole,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. He added that it was proving ""very hard"" to keep hopes alive, having had them dashed twice before - at Christmas and Easter. At a court hearing, a judge told Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe that if the UK government did not pay a debt, she would not be released, Mr Ratcliffe said. The news of possible new charges against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe comes as Mr Johnson prepares to meet his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, in Brussels to discuss how to save the Iran nuclear dealafter the US withdrew last week. They will also meet the French and German foreign ministers and EU high representative Federica Mogherini. The foreign secretary - with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif - should ""commit to protecting British citizens"", Mr Ratcliffe said Mr Ratcliffe said his wife's case and the cases of other dual nationals detained in Iran should be ""top of [Mr Johnson's] priority list"" at the meeting. He said the UK has an obligation to its citizens to find a way to protect them so they can visit their families or do their work, and suggested the wider geo-political context was making a difference in his wife's case. ""Three more British citizens were taken in the last month,"" he claimed. ""It feels there is something very specific they want from the UK."" In all, there are nearly 30 dual nationals being held by the Iranian authorities - many of whom are accused of security offences. On Sunday,Prime Minister Theresa May urged Iran's presidentto make further progress over the release of British-Iranians ""on humanitarian grounds"". This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) In November last year,Mr Johnson apologised for telling a Commons committee hearingthat Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Iran - something her family and employer say is incorrect.

Willow Smith admits she used to self-harm,"Willow Smith has revealed she ""lost her sanity"" and used to self-harm as a child. The 17-year-old said it happened after the exposure of her song Whip My Hair, which was released in 2010 - when she was nine years old. ""After all of that settled down and there was a lull, I was just listening to a lot of dark music and it was just so crazy,"" she added. ""I was just plunged into this black hole and I was cutting myself."" She told her mum, Jada Pinkett Smith, and grandmother, Adrienne Banfield-Norrison, on the web series Red Table Talk, that she stopped five years ago. If you need help with issues related to self-harm, you can go toBBC Advice. Willow says her brother Jaden and half-brother Trey didn't know she was self-harming Willow said it happened after the hype died down from Whip My Hair and she had just cancelled plans to finish her album. ""I was kind of just in this grey area of like 'Who am I? Do I have a purpose? Is there anything that I can do beyond this?'"" Her mum and grandmother appeared shocked when she told them. Explaining why she turned to self-harm, she said: ""I honestly felt like I was experiencing so much emotional pain but my physical circumstances weren't reflecting that."" Allow YouTube content?

A&E nurse: 'I've been head-butted and taken hostage',"Shelley still works as a nurse, despite repeated attacks Shelley Pearce could tell immediately that the patient she had been asked to care for didn't like her. The woman had been admitted to hospital as part of a detox programme. ""She wanted to leave and when I said no, she smashed a piece of plastic and put the sharp piece to my neck. It was terrifying."" The patient marched Shelley to the lifts. It was only because she was able to press the alarm button in the lift that she was able to alert security. The situation was defused, but it could have been so different. ""There are some horrendous stories and assaults that staff have had to endure,"" says Shelley, who now works as an A&E nurse at a hospital in the south of England. This was not the only time she has experienced a physical assault. She says there have been particularly bad occasions, including being head-butted by a drug abuser, that made her question her future. ""I have thought about giving up nursing, but it is a job I love. I just don't think we should live in fear and under the threat of assault. ""It happens on a daily basis. Sometimes it is just aggression, but it is the sort of thing that would never be tolerated in a nightclub. ""The police would be called and the person would be ejected."" The situation has got so bad - more than 70,000 NHS staff are assaulted every year - that the nursing profession has even started to consider asking staff to wear body cameras, as police and fire crews do. The issue was debated at the Royal College of Nursing's annual conference in Belfast this week. It was proposed by Sarah Seeley, a nurse from Ipswich. She says some places have started trialling it and it has led to a reduction in assaults. ""We need a robust deterrent. Nurses have been stabbed, stalked and even had their eyes gouged. ""Wearing body cameras might make people feel safer and de-escalate situations. Of course, there is a cost, but it is worth considering."" Would that have helped Shelley? She's not convinced. ""I can't see it working and the risk is that it will destroy the patient relationship,"" she said. ""We just need proper support so we can raise the alarm and get help from security when we are concerned and good training in how to defuse these situations. ""We have mental health patients coming into hospital in crisis, we have drunk patients and those with head injuries - and some people are just not very nice. ""Nurses need protecting.""

Superman actress Kidder dies aged 69,"A Montana funeral home says the actress died at her home on Sunday Actress Margot Kidder, best known for her role as Lois Lane in Superman, has died aged 69. A funeral home in Livingston, Montana, where the actress lived, said Kidder died at her home on Sunday. She rose to fame starring alongside Christopher Reeve in the Superman films of the 1970s and 1980s. The Canadian-born actress acquired American citizenship in 2005, and became a political and women's rights activist alongside her acting. The cause of her death is not yet known. Kidder starred alongside Reeve in the 1978 film Superman and its sequels, as well as horror classics Black Christmas and The Amityville Horror. The actress was also an outspoken critic of the Gulf War, of fracking by energy companies, and was at times a vocal supporter of Democratic party candidates. After settling in the US state of Montana, she became a supporter of Montana Women For, a non-profit organisation which describes its goals as the ""participation and empowerment of women in our democracy through education and advocacy on critical issues"". As an activist, she was arrested in 2011 while taking part in a protest at the White House againstthe Keystone XL pipeline, which remains controversial today. Kidder also suffered from mental health problems, which resulted in her high-profile disappearance for several days in 1996. Kidder, seen here in 2009, continued to work alongside her activism In an interview with People magazine later that year,external, she referred to her disappearance as ""the most public freak-out in history"". While working on her memoirs, a computer virus destroyed all of her work, she told the magazine - something she concluded was deliberate, and involved her former husband and the CIA. She was eventually found safe, and would talk openly about her experience of manic episodes and of depression in the years ahead, raising awareness about bipolar disorder while advocating the use of alternative medicine as a treatment. On social media, film and superhero fans paid tribute to the actress. DC Comics, publisher of the Superman comic books, said Kidder was ""the Lois Lane so many of us grew up with"". Eric Goldman, editor at rival comic book maker Marvel, said Kidder ""made sure my generation knew just how awesome Lois Lane was"" - a sentiment echoed by famed comic book writer Mark Millar, who said she was ""my Lois Lane"". Teri Hatcher, who played Lois Lane in the 1990s TV show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, wrote that it had been ""a privilege"" to step into Kidder's role - while her co-starDean Cain also tweeted his condolences,external.

"'Spice epidemic in jails risk to nurses'One nurse lost consciousness after inhaling fumes while attending an ill prisoner, her union says.1ma minute agoHealth","Spice is a laboratory-created cannabis substitute An epidemic of a laboratory-created cannabis substitute in UK prisons is putting nurses called in to treat inmates at risk, union leaders say. The Royal College of Nursing said it had members who had been left unwell after treating prisoners who had taken the illegal drug, known as ""spice"". One lost consciousness after inhaling the fumes and had to be taken to an accident and emergency unit. And in some places 50 inmates were being treated each week, the RCN said. It comes after a report last year by HM Inspectorate of Prisons raised concern over the widespread use of the drug. It said inmates were sometimes not diluting it with tobacco, leading to serious medical emergencies. This video can not be played Synthetic drugs, such as Spice, have overwhelmed prisons Nurses and healthcare assistants are often the first on the scene when inmates need emergency care. They are expected to enter cells before the smoke is clear. But the union says NHS staff should be allowed to assess the danger of the situation before rushing in and called on the prison service to do more to combat the problem. One nurse, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ""Recently we've had to give medical care to over 50 people in one week. ""Walking back after attending to a patient, I've sat in my car in the car park for 50 minutes after work so I feel confident enough to drive."" RCN general secretary Janet Davies said: ""Spice poses a serious threat to nurses, healthcare assistants and prison staff, whose safety and long-term health is being put at risk day in, day out. ""As dedicated health professionals, prison nursing staff are expected to offer high quality care, but they should not be expected to put their own wellbeing on the line to deliver it. ""I have heard some truly shocking stories of nursing staff passing out or being unable to drive after exposure to spice."" A Prison Service spokesman said: ""The best way to keep staff and inmates safe is to keep drugs out of our prisons. ""That is why we have trained more than 300 specialist drug dogs, introduced body scanners and intelligence-led searches and made it a criminal office to possess psychoactive substances in prison.""

"Police face recognition tools 'inaccurate'Privacy group Big Brother Watch says failure rates for the technology are ""staggering"".1han hour agoTechnology","Police must address concerns over the use of facial recognition systems or may face legal action, the UK's privacy watchdog says. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said the issue had become a ""priority"" for her office. An investigation by campaign group Big Brother Watch suggested the technology flagged up a ""staggering"" number of innocent people as suspects. But police have defended the technology and say safeguards are in place. Big Brother Watch submitted freedom of information requests to every police force in the UK. Two police forces acknowledged they were currently testing facial recognition cameras. The Metropolitan Police used facial recognition at London's Notting Hill carnival in 2016 and 2017 and at a Remembrance Sunday event. Its system incorrectly flagged 102 people as potential suspects and led to no arrests. In figures given to Big Brother Watch, South Wales Police said its technology had made 2,685 ""matches"" between May 2017 and March 2018 - but 2,451 were false alarms. Leicestershire Police tested facial recognition in 2015, but is no longer using it at events. Police facial recognition cameras have been trialled at events such as football matches, festivals and parades. High-definition cameras detect all the faces in a crowd and compare them with existing police photographs, such as mugshots from previous arrests. Any potential matches are flagged for a police officer to investigate further. South Wales Police has defended its use of facial recognition software and says the system has improved with time. ""When we first deployed and we were learning how to use it... some of the digital images we used weren't of sufficient quality,"" said Deputy Chief Constable Richard Lewis. ""Because of the poor quality, it was identifying people wrongly. They weren't able to get the detail from the picture."" It said a ""number of safeguards"" prevented any action being taken against innocent people. ""Firstly, the operator in the van is able to see that the person identified in the picture is clearly not the same person, and it's literally disregarded at that point,"" said Mr Lewis. ""On a much smaller number of occasions, officers went and spoke to the individual... realised it wasn't them, and offered them the opportunity to come and see the van. ""At no time was anybody arrested wrongly, nobody's liberty was taken away from them."" The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it was testing facial recognition to see whether it could ""assist police in identifying known offenders in large events, in order to protect the wider public"". This video can not be played In your face: China's all-seeing surveillance system ""Regarding 'false' positive matches - we do not consider these as false positive matches because additional checks and balances are in place to confirm identification following system alerts,"" it said in a statement. ""All alerts against the watch list are deleted after 30 days. Faces in the video stream that do not generate an alert are deleted immediately."" But Big Brother Watch said it was concerned that facial recognition cameras would affect ""individuals' right to a private life and freedom of expression"". It also raised concerns that photos of any ""false alarms"" were sometimes kept by police for weeks. ""Automated facial recognition technology is currently used by UK police forces without a clear legal basis, oversight or governmental strategy,"" the group said. Big Brother Watch wants police to stop using facial recognition technology. It has also called on the government to make sure that the police do not keep the photos of innocent people. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said police had to demonstrate that facial recognition was ""effective"" that no less intrusive methods were available. ""Should my concerns not be addressed I will consider what legal action is needed to ensure the right protections are in place for the public,"" said Ms Denham. The Home Office told the BBC it plans to publish its biometrics strategy in June, and it ""continues to support police to respond to changing criminal activity and new demands"". ""When trialling facial recognition technologies, forces must show regard to relevant policies, including the Surveillance Camera Code of Practices and the Information Commissioner's guide,"" it said in a statement.

Shark bites fisherman off Cornish coastThe shark - thought to be up to 8ft long - bit the man as the crew tried to get it back in the water.6h6 hours agoCornwall,"This video can not be played The crew called coastguards for assistance after sterilising and dressing the man's wounds A fisherman is in hospital after being bitten several times by a shark about 120 miles (197km) off Land's End. The porbeagle shark had been hauled up in the nets of the Govenek of Ladram fishing boat early on Sunday. The shark - thought to be up to 8ft (2.4m) long - bit the leg of fisherman Max Berryman as the crew tried to get it back in the water. He was treated at the scene and winched by the coastguard to Truro's Royal Cornwall Hospital. Max Berryman was winched from the boat and taken to hospital More on this story and others from Cornwall Alex Greig from Falmouth Coastguard said the shark bites went down to the muscle. ""There were about four to five cuts altogether, one of which was extending about 10in (25cm) in length along the side of his knee,"" he said. The Govenek of Ladram fishes out of Newlyn harbour in west Cornwall Phil Mitchell, the boat's skipper, said: ""His leg was badly gashed - I just had to do the best job I could dressing it. ""We got him stable and spoke to the doctor who recommended him being airlifted because of any bacteria that could have been on the teeth."" Mr Mitchell said he thought the shark weighed up to 20 stone (127kg). He described the porbeagle as ""really big and powerful"" and said it was fortunate the shark had caught Mr Berryman with its top jaw but did not clamp its bottom jaw closed. Also known as a ""mackerel sharks"" or ""porgies"" Mainly eat mackerel, squid and herring Live in cooler waters and can warm their bodies up Have a distinctive white mark on their dorsal fin Endangered in many parts of the world Grow slowly and mature late Source: British Sea Fishing Although a member of the great white family of sharks, the porbeagle is not usually thought to be a threat to humans. Paramedic winchman Julian Williams was lowered to the vessel and praised the quick actions of the crew for treating the wounds. ""The crew had done a really good job of dressing the wounds before we arrived which meant that we were able to save time getting the casualty to hospital,"" he said.

"'I've been hit, head-butted and taken hostage'","Shelley still works as a nurse, despite repeated attacks Shelley Pearce could tell immediately that the patient she had been asked to care for didn't like her. The woman had been admitted to hospital as part of a detox programme. ""She wanted to leave and when I said no, she smashed a piece of plastic and put the sharp piece to my neck. It was terrifying."" The patient marched Shelley to the lifts. It was only because she was able to press the alarm button in the lift that she was able to alert security. The situation was defused, but it could have been so different. ""There are some horrendous stories and assaults that staff have had to endure,"" says Shelley, who now works as an A&E nurse at a hospital in the south of England. This was not the only time she has experienced a physical assault. She says there have been particularly bad occasions, including being head-butted by a drug abuser, that made her question her future. ""I have thought about giving up nursing, but it is a job I love. I just don't think we should live in fear and under the threat of assault. ""It happens on a daily basis. Sometimes it is just aggression, but it is the sort of thing that would never be tolerated in a nightclub. ""The police would be called and the person would be ejected."" The situation has got so bad - more than 70,000 NHS staff are assaulted every year - that the nursing profession has even started to consider asking staff to wear body cameras, as police and fire crews do. The issue was debated at the Royal College of Nursing's annual conference in Belfast this week. It was proposed by Sarah Seeley, a nurse from Ipswich. She says some places have started trialling it and it has led to a reduction in assaults. ""We need a robust deterrent. Nurses have been stabbed, stalked and even had their eyes gouged. ""Wearing body cameras might make people feel safer and de-escalate situations. Of course, there is a cost, but it is worth considering."" Would that have helped Shelley? She's not convinced. ""I can't see it working and the risk is that it will destroy the patient relationship,"" she said. ""We just need proper support so we can raise the alarm and get help from security when we are concerned and good training in how to defuse these situations. ""We have mental health patients coming into hospital in crisis, we have drunk patients and those with head injuries - and some people are just not very nice. ""Nurses need protecting.""
