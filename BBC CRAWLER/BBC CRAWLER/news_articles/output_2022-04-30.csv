Return to the office boosts demand for city flats,"Glasgow is one city where demand for flats is rising Demand for flats is reviving in UK cities, as property buyers return to more settled working patterns, new research shows. Interest in flats overtook searches for terraced houses since the start of this year, property portal Rightmove said. But the hunt for extra space, which dominated during the pandemic, remains a key factor for buyers and renters. ""Annexe"" is buyers' most popular search term, Rightmove said, with garages and gardens also high on the list. The property website analysed its data for the BBC to show how buyers and renters looking for properties were shifting their priorities. A picture has emerged of a renewed interest in urban and commuter areas, and a shift in the type of property being sought. In January last year, a terraced house was the most popular, it said, ahead of detached houses and flats. A year on, flats recorded the highest demand. ""In the initial stages of the pandemic, houses stole the show, as people looked for as much room as possible. As restrictions have eased, being closer to city amenities has become more of a priority,"" said Tim Bannister, Rightmove's property data expert. During lockdowns, data showed property hunters wanted countryside and coastal properties with gardens, and extra space indoors to work. In the last five years, house prices have risen fastest for detached houses in predominantly rural locations, according to research by the Nationwide Building Society. The average price rise for a rural property of 29% over that period, outstripped the 18% increase in urban areas. Average house prices in North Devon rose by 24% last year alone. The epicentre of Britain's house price boom Second homes and living costs force out young buyers But spacious, rural homes have been in short supply. As they became less affordable too, some of the focus has shifted back to commuter areas and city centres. That shift has accelerated since the start of this year as workers began to spend more time at their office desks rather than the kitchen table. Market commentators also suggest students and office-based first-time buyers are driving up demand in cities. Jack Hunter is one of those first-time buyers. The 26-year-old said he was ""ecstatic"" to have managed to buy a flat near the centre of Glasgow in recent weeks. ""Friends have been to 30 viewings and made eight offers and are still looking,"" said Mr Hunter, who works in IT and technology sales. ""I don't know if this will be my forever home, but I am glad to be on the ladder."" Mr Hunter said the location and access to a parking space were significant positives. Glasgow, like many UK cities, saw a race for space among buyers during Covid lockdowns. Although the impact was not as dramatic as in London, estate agents say there has been a rebound for city properties. Renters and buyers are spending as much as they can afford, says John O'Malley John O'Malley, from agency Pacitti Jones, said that demand for Glasgow's tenement flats had returned, with first-time buyers looking for something affordable and close to the city centre. Higher demand for flats to buy is mirrored in the rental market with higher demand for city centre properties to rent. The number of renters in rural areas enquiring about available properties in cities has jumped 52% compared to January last year, while the number of renters in cities enquiring about rural properties has dropped 10%, the Rightmove data shows. A lack of homes available to buy or rent has been the biggest problem across the market, according to experts. This has driven up prices, even as the higher cost of living bites. A survey of 3,000 people by the Nationwide indicated that 38% of those asked were either in the process of moving or considering a move - far outstripping the number of homes on the market. Only one in five of them was doing so to try to reduce their spending on housing. On Friday, the lender saidUK property prices had increased by 12.1% in the last year. Official forecasts suggest that, although the pace of growth is expected to slow owing to the pressure on household budgets, there is little prospect of a fall in house prices. The ambition of adding value to a home, as well as the long-term prospect for many people of working at home for some of the week, has influenced the priorities of potential buyers. Airbnb to let staff work from home indefinitely Analysis of search terms by users on the Rightmove website indicates that buyers at the start of their enquiries show the most interest in whether a property has an ""annexe"". The next most popular terms are ""acre"" to check space, and ""garage"" possibly for conversion. Renters have different requirements. Top of the list is ""pets"" to check they are permitted by landlords, followed by wanting to know if the place is ""furnished"". A garden is still in renters' and buyers' top five search terms so, despite the pull of the city lights, the Covid-inspired demand for green space is far from extinguished.

Football agent Raiola dies at 54,"Mino Raiola's clients included Sweden and AC Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic Mino Raiola, the agent who represented some of football's most high-profile players, has died at the age of 54. The Dutch-Italian's stable of players included Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland, Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba and AC Milan forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Raiola was also president of the Football Forum, which represented leading agents and their players. ""His presence will be forever missed,""the Raiola family said in a statement.,external It read: ""In infinite sorrow, we share the passing of the most caring and amazing football agent that ever was. ""Mino fought until the end with the same strength he put on negotiation tables to defend our players. As usual, Mino made us proud and never realised it. ""Mino touched so many lives through his work and wrote a new chapter in the history of modern football."" The statement added: ""Mino's mission of making football a better place for players will continue with the same passion. ""We thank everybody for the huge amount of support received during these difficult times and ask for respect to the privacy of family and friends in this moment of grief."" Norway striker Haaland, one of Raiola's most coveted clients, isclose to agreeing a move to Manchester City. Raiola, who also represented Italy internationals Mario Balotelli and Gianluigi Donnarumma and Netherlands centre-back Matthijs de Ligt, was a controversial and influential figure in world football. He had been involved run-ins with a series of managers, including former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola and Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, buttold BBC sports editor Dan Roanin 2021 that he had learned lessons from situations he had been involved in. There were claims that Raiola earned Â£41m from Pogba's then world-record Â£89m transfer from Juventus to Manchester United in 2016 and, while that intensified criticism of agents, Raiola insisted the perception of greed and excess was unfair. ""It's not nice always to hear this same preconception,"" Raiola said last year. ""But maybe the public can also think: 'If this man is so greedy and so bad, how are his players all happy and stay with him?' ""I would be lying if I said it didn't bother meâ¦ how can you judge if I was a good agent for Ibrahimovic? The only one who can judge that is Ibra himself. ""I don't have power and influenceâ¦ my job is to get the best deal done for my player. And no more than that. And doing that is to provide him with a whole range of services that people don't even know. ""My players don't call me a parasite, and that's who I work for. I only care what my players call me."" Raiola had also spoken of his opposition to Fifa - world football's governing body - bringing innew regulations for agents. This video can not be played 'My players don't call me a parasite, and I only care what my players call me' - Mino Raiola speaking to Dan Roan in February 2021 1. Paul Pogba - Juventus to Manchester United - Â£89m - 2016 This transfer, taking France midfielder Pogba back to Old Trafford, was a world record at the time. 2. Romelu Lukaku - Everton to Manchester United - Â£75m - 2017 Belgium striker Lukaku split with Raiola in April 2018 and is now represented Federico Pastorello, who conducted his subsequent transfers to Inter Milan and back to former club Chelsea. 3. Matthijs de Ligt - Ajax to Juventus - Â£67.5m - 2019 De Ligt led Ajax to the Champions League semi-finals in 2018-19, winning the Golden Boy award for the best under-21 player in Europe that season, before joining Juventus.

BBC Sport's Simon Stone I was once chatting about Mino Raiola with an executive at a club who was having a difficult time with the charismatic agent. ""He is a nightmare,"" the executive reflected. ""But if I ever needed someone to negotiate a pay rise for me, I would want him to do it."" That was the thing with Raiola. Never afraid of confrontation, completely unapologetic about the vast amounts of money he earned. To Raiola, the ends justified the means. If that meant playing hardball or delivering a few home truths, as he did to Manchester United on a number of occasions, so be it. His list of clients was legendary. Ibrahimovic, Pogba, Donnarumma, De Ligt, Haaland - and that is just a handful. Raiola, sadly, won't be there in the final stages but when, as everyone expects, Haaland joins Manchester City in the deal of this summer, the deal will have Raiola's fingerprints all over it. I last encountered him at Barnet of all places, at an agents' conference he attended with fellow big hitters Jorge Mendes and Jonathan Barnett. As they held court outside the stadium, it was impossible not to think about the size of the deals these men had been involved in.

Sri Lankans left desperate over medicine hikes,"An industry boss called the crisis ""unprecedented"" Sri Lanka has sharply increased prices of commonly used medication, the second such rise in six weeks, as it struggles to deal with an economic crisis. Antibiotics, certain painkillers and medication for heart conditions are among those hit by a 40% mark-up. Sri Lankans have had to take short courses of medicines or look overseas for supplies. The government says it has no other option than to increase the cost of pharmaceutical products. It follows measures to help slow the depletion of foreign exchange reserves amid a crippling financial crisis. Among the measures were restrictions or bans on the import of some essential goods, including foods and medicines. ""This is not something that government is doing willingly,"" Nalaka Godahewa, Sri Lanka's minister for mass media, told the BBC. He said the devaluation of the rupee and the fact that most medicine is imported by the private sector meant the government had no choice, otherwise there would be a serious shortage. Health professionals are worried that the scarcity of medicine is forcing people to buy less than the prescribed limit. ""The situation is bad. Sometimes antibiotics are prescribed for five days. Now my customers are saying give me the antibiotics only for two or three days. How will it work?"" Ruchira Hewawasam, who runs a pharmacy in Colombo, said. Why Sri Lankans want their rulers thrown out Sri Lanka requests urgent financial help from IMF No medicine for kids in a collapsing health system Some fear that even for those willing and able to pay higher prices, some medication is in short supply. Velupillai Wigneswaran who lives in the central Ratnapura district, has been trying to find prescription tablets for his sister, who suffers from a serious neurological disorder, for the past year. ""We tried several pharmacies but the medicines are not available. Doctors have advised us not to take different medicine. We are trying to get the tablets from India through our friends,"" he said. Health workers fear that medicine shortages are forcing people to buy less than they are prescribed Without the medicine, Mr Wigneswaran said his sister was suffering and he was not sure what will happen to her health. ""The crisis we are facing in the pharmaceutical sector is unprecedented. The sharp increase in medicine prices will take its toll,"" Azam Jaward, Vice President of Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry, told the BBC. Antibiotics for paediatrics, life-saving antibiotics, steroids are among the medicines difficult to obtain. This comes against the backdrop of explosive public anger at the rising prices of other essential items such as cooking gas, milk powder and fuel. Thousands of people have been protesting against the worsening shortages and calling for the government to resign. India has offered to supply medicines as part of a loan programme. But that process has been slowed down due to bureaucratic hurdles. The government has approached international agencies like the World Bank to help buy essential items like medicines. ""They have already told us something like $600 million will be coming forth and when that comes we should be able to bring some of these prices down,"" Mr Godahewa said.

Venus and Jupiter to almost touch in night skyThe dazzlingly bright planets appear extremely close together in the dark sky this weekend.,"Venus and Jupiter have been drawing closer together all week Look up in the sky at the right moment this weekend and you could see two of the solar system's brightest planets almost touching. Venus and Jupiter will be millions of miles apart, but from Earth they will appear close to colliding. This planetary conjunction happens annually but this year they will appear much closer than usual. The same spectacle won't occur again like this until 2039. Just the naked eye or binoculars should be enough to see it in a clear sky. After Saturday, the two planets will go their separate ways as they drift apart in the coming days. ""It's very exciting for astronomers and it's a really great opportunity for people to get out and have a look,"" explains space scientist and chief stargazer at the Society for Popular Astronomy Prof Lucie Green. A conjunction is when two planets appear close together or even touching in the Earth's night sky. In the days running up to Saturday, Venus and Jupiter have been gradually coming together in the sky. The two planets rise side-by-side over Rocca Calascio castle in Italy early on Saturday The actual orbit of the planets are about 430 million miles apart but their apparent alignment seen from Earth gives the illusion that they are touching. The peak time to see it was Saturday at around 05:00 BST. But it will still be visible on Sunday and in the coming days as the planets slowly move apart. Pre-dawn is best, looking east before the Sun rises. Social media user @DebraJ54 took this photo in Humboldt, Tennessee, on Saturday morning The planets will be low down in the sky, close to the horizon, and hills and buildings will block the view. If you can, find a high spot and look for two dazzlingly bright spots very close together. ""The planets will differ in their brightness. Venus is brighter than Jupiter so it will look dazzlingly bright when you see it. Jupiter will be slightly fainter, about one-sixth of the brightness of Venus,"" explains Prof Green. She suggests using an app to help navigate your way around the skies. And if you have telescope, you might be able to make out some structure in the atmosphere of Jupiter or some of its largest moons. The conjunction can be seen from both of Earth's hemispheres at different times of day and night. Those observing with a telescope may also be treated to a view of Mars and Saturn forming a line of four planets. Prof Green says she plans to be up and out of bed to watch it from the UK. ""But if I do miss it on Saturday morning, I'm not going to be too worried,"" she explains. ""In the coming days the two planets start to get further and further apart - So I will still be able to see them."" Did you capture images of the planets?

Negative Covid test needed to enter Beijing spaces,"Further restrictions will come into force on 5 May Beijing residents must prove they are Covid negative to enter public spaces in a major tightening of restrictions in the Chinese capital. It is not clear how long the new measures will last, but the announcement comes as the city begins a five-day public holiday. Proof of a negative Covid test will also be required to board public transport from 5 May. China is battling a resurgence in Covid cases. In contrast to many other countries, China is pursuing a zero-Covid strategy with the aim of eradicating the virus from the country completely. But the measures, such as strict lockdowns, have led to rare shows of public anger against the authorities. The elderly people struggling in Shanghai's quarantine centres Whole communities relocated in anti-Covid drive Beijing's new rules come days afterthe city launched mass testing for its millions of residents following a spike in cases. All dining in restaurants will also be halted between 1 and 4 May, with people being asked to cook at home. The city has reported 295 new cases since 22 April. Of these, 123 cases were found in the Chaoyang, Beijing's most populous district, which is now set for three rounds of mass testing. The streets of Beijing were quiet at the start of the five-day Labour Day break. One female resident, a finance worker, started to cry as she told Reuters how she felt. ""You look at a city that used to be crowded and now is empty. And you can't help but wonder how these people manage to survive,"" she said. Earlier this month residents rushed to stock up essential supplies and long queues were seen outside supermarkets and shops, despite government assurances there is sufficient food. There are fears the city couldface a similar situation to Shanghai, which has seen 25 million people shut in their homes for weeks and left some struggling to find food and other basics. Since the outbreak began in early March, more than 500,000 people in Shanghai have tested positive for the virus. But the city reached a milestone on Saturday, recording no new daily Covid cases outside of quarantine areas.

The woman battling a global clothing firm,"Amber Kotrri refuses to rename her business and insists there is no risk of confusion A small business owner locked in a trademark battle with a global High Street retailer has hit out at their ""very intimidating"" conduct. Amber Kotrri was contacted by lawyers for clothing firm Zara a year ago claiming her Darlington shop House of Zana was ""conceptually identical"". Zara previously said it was making efforts to ""resolve the matter amicably"" but Mrs Kotrri denies this. She said the Spanish company just gave her three months to shut down. Mrs Kotrri said: ""The only correspondence I've had from Zara was the lawyers asking me to close my business, they've never tried to speak to me amicably, it's so upsetting. ""What the letter did say was that because Zara had started as a small family business and because of the pandemic it had empathy towards other small businesses and would give me three months to close everything down."" She said she refused to sign the letter, which asked her to phase out the House of Zana brand name on her boutique, tags, business cards, social media and website. The row erupted after Mrs Kotrri tried to trademark the name House of Zana and the company's lawyers sent a notice of opposition arguing the County Durham business was ""conceptually identical"" for customers. Amber Kotrri said supplying evidence to Zara's legal team coincided with the birth of her daughter Mrs Kotrri said: ""In between that time I've been pregnant, had a baby and she's just turned three months old and I have two other children, and while I understand Zara do not know my personal circumstances they do know when they target small independent businesses that it's one person behind that and they cause them extra stress."" Mrs Kotrri, who employs nine members of staff, will represent herself at a tribunal next month which will decide whether she can keep the name. She said she remained ""determined"" not to back down, after receiving ""so much"" support from people contacting her. Mum-of-three Mrs Kotrri says dealing with lawyers has cost her time with her children North East retail consultant Graham Soulttweeted,external: ""If Zara is objecting to an independent business called House of Zana, where does it end? H&M trying to close down B&M because part of the name is the same?"" Another supporterwrote,external: ""Well done Amber, all the best in your fight. Don't let them bully you. You have a good little business and worked hard to succeed in these troubled times."" Mrs Kotrri said that since the letter from Zara's legal team, she had replied to 10 emails with information about her business, detailing invoices, stock, staffing and articles written about it. ""It has been months of back and forth providing evidence to lawyers and although it hasn't cost me anything but time, that's time I could've spent with my children,"" she said. ""I can fight this but big multi-billion businesses shouldn't be allowed to pick on small businesses when there's no similarity and we're not bothering them."" Tara Nguyen (left) from Tara Sartoria has also received a letter from Zara's lawyers asking it to give up its brand name Another company locked in the same dispute with Zara is Tara Sartoria, which sells a small range of hand-made silk products made by disadvantaged women in Indonesia and Vietnam. The business, which has one full-time office employee, donates 10% of its profits to help women start their own micro-businesses and attend university. Its Vietnamese owner Tara Nguyen contacted the BBC to say she had also been sent a legal letter from the fashion giant which she found ""grossly unjust"". Ms Nguyen said: ""Going against a massive corporation like Zara/Inditex is a terrifying position to be in.

We leave you with some of Sunday's main developments: Ukrainians have been honouring dead friends and relatives, as is traditional on the first Sunday after Orthodox Easter. Alla Krotkikh comforts her 10-year-old son Savelii, as they mourn his father Ihor Krotkikh, 47, who she says was a soldier killed by shelling Anatolii and Olena visit the grave of their son Oleksandr, a soldier, as part of the Easter tradition known as Hrobki or Provody Crosses and floral wreaths are seen in a cemetery in Irpin, outside Kyiv, which saw intense fighting earlier in the war Disabled athletes were among those in Lviv mourning soldier Dmytro Sydoruk, who also coached soldiers with disabilities for the Invictus Games Mourners visit Tairovske Cemetery in Odesa, where graves have been damaged and destroyed by a Russian missile strike And now back to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has said the upcoming anniversary of
Russia's liberation at the end of World War II will not affect Russia's actions in Ukraine. Last week, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace predicted that Vladimir Putin was ""rolling the pitch"" for a major announcement to mark the historic 9 May ""Victory Day"". ""Our soldiers won't base their actions on a specific date,"" Lavrov said when asked if the anniversary
would be a turning point in the war. ""We'll commemorate our victory in a solemn manner but the
timing and speed of what is happening in Ukraine will hinge on
the need to minimise risks for civilians and Russian solders,""
he added, speaking on Italian TV. Azovstal steel plant employee Valeria, right, hugs her sister Aleksandra Earlier we reported that Reuters had seen more than 50 civilians from the area near Azovstal in Mariupol arriving in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk Region. The news agency also said that UN staff were in the area. Images taken by Reuters show emotional reunions between civilians and their loved ones. Civilians have arrived in Bezimenne, which is in Russian-controlled territory Mariupol has come under intense bombardment from Russian artillery for weeks Azovstal steel plant worker Natalia arrives at a temporary accommodation centre Russia's foreign minister says the country has not blocked efforts to prevent nuclear war. ""Western media misrepresent Russian threats,"" Sergei Lavrov said,
speaking in Russian via an Italian interpreter on Italian TV. ""Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements
that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops."" Lavrov repeated Russia's claims that the country is motivated by guaranteeing security for pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east, and that it is fighting against Nazism in Ukraine. You can find out more about Russia's false claims about Nazism in Ukraine here. Denmark and Sweden have said a Russian spyplane has violated both countries' air space. Both are summoning Russian ambassadors over the incident. The Danish Defence Command told AFP the aircraft was a reconnaissance plane that was in Danish air space for ""a very brief moment"" and that Danish F-16 aircrafts ""immediately intervened"". It added that such incidents are rare. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the breach was ""totally unacceptable and particularly worrying in the current situation"". While Denmark is a member of Nato, Sweden is debating whether it should join the alliance. However, the Swedish defence minister told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper there was no proof that the incident was linked to these discussions. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of Kharkiv's Regional State Administration has warned people to remain
vigilant, despite the fact that Russian troops have âreduced the intensity of
shellingâ. Oleh Synyehubov shared images from the town of Dergachi, some
12km (seven miles) north west of Kharkiv, on Telegram. He said the photos showed the âconsequences of prolonged
shellingâ on the town. Synyehubov also warned Kharkiv residents in the northern and
eastern districts of the city to remain inside on Sunday due to shelling. A fire broke out at a Russian defence ministry site close to the Ukrainian border, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. One person sustained minor injuries, Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The governor of another Russian region near the Ukrainian border, Kursk, said part of a freight railway bridge had collapsed, with no casualties. ""It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue,"" said governor Roman Starovoyt on Telegram, without naming Ukrainian forces. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of attacks on its territory near to the border. Captain Palamar seen in a video statement from 24 April Despite the news that 100 civilians are on their way from Mariupol's war-battered Azovstal steel plant to Ukrainian-held territory, one of the commanders there says many injured remain. ""There are still wounded at the plant as well. They have not been evacuated yet, but we hope that they are going to be taken away from here. Their condition is serious, they need proper medical treatment, proper nutrition to recover,"" Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told the BBC. Food and water issues remained, he said, but those remaining are ""trying to stretch out what we have for as long as possible"". Aside from the hope for the remaining civilians to be evacuated, he said, ""we are willing to fight back and do not intend to surrender"". He said he hoped Ukrainian officials and the leaders of other countries would ""do everything possible to evacuate our garrison from Mariupol"". Natalia Usmanova, pictured, told Reuters: ""You just can't imagine"" life in Azovstal The first accounts of life in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Avozstal steelworks are starting to emerge. We reported earlier how Reuters news agency had spotted civilians stepping off the bus from Mariupol in the village of Bezimenne, in Russia-held parts of east Ukraine. One of them was 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova, who told the news agency what it was like when powerful bombs hit while she hid underground ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long,"" she added. ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I
lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just
terrible."" Laurence PeterBBC News Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"". Read morehere A Ukrainian soldier guarding the Chernobyl plant Ukraineâs state electricity operator Ukrenergo says it has
restored reliable power to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident. Ukrenergo says the
last 330 kV power line has been reconnected there. Earlier, it says,
another 330kV line came back on stream, north of Kyiv, which âmade it possible
to improve the reliability of power supply to the capitalâ. In a Facebook post, Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi
said the Russian military occupation of Chernobyl â which has now ended â had caused much
disruption at Chernobyl. âAfter the departure of the Russians, our
repairmen immediately after the sappers investigated dozens of kilometres of
lines, restored the resistance and other equipment,â he said. An exclusion zone covering about 2,600 sq km (1,000 sq miles) was imposed around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the catastrophic explosion there in 1986. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant The evacuation of civilians from Mariupolâs Azovstal steel
plant is a major, long-awaited development. About 1,000 of them have been
sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and
concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water
supplies. A convoy departed to Mariupol on Friday but only now has official confirmation come in, first from the UN and the Red Cross, then from
President Zelensky, a sign of how complex and delicate this operation is. Meanwhile, relatives of the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers
who are also trapped in the steel plant, surrounded by Russian troops, are
anxiously waiting for any operation that allows them to be able to flee in safety too. Here in Dnipro, I met the wife of an officer who is at the
plant. She said she and other women were willing to go to Mariupol to secure a
safe way out for their husbands. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv After a surprise visit to a Lviv coffee shop on Saturday, more
details have been revealed about Angelina Jolieâs trip here. The actress met with a number of displaced Ukrainians
including children who were injured in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station. At least 52 people were killed and dozens injured after rockets hit the station as people waited to board evacuation trains. Lviv's regional governor Maxim Kozytski confirmed Jolie's visit on Telegram, adding that ""she was very moved by the children's stories"". Jolie also met people at the cityâs train station, including volunteers who were helping evacuees. Lviv, in the west of Ukraine, has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of the country. As well as the fighters and civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol, there are also an estimated 100,000 residents in other parts of the city. They have been trying to survive without mains water, electricity or gas for weeks. Earlier we reported that Mariupol City Council had invited these residents to gather at a mall at 1600 local time (1300 GMT) as an evacuation could be possible on Sunday. But now the council has saidin a post on Telegram,externalthat this evacuation has been postponed for security reasons until 0800 local time (0500 GMT) tomorrow. Evacuees from Mariupol who wanted to go to Ukrainian-controlled regions have been handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Reuters news agency reports citing Russia's defence ministry. The ministry says 80 civilians had been moved from the vast Azovstal
plant after weeks under siege. The massive industrial area is the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 100 civilians have been evacuated from the besieged steel plant in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the group is on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of the military administration in Kharkiv has
confirmed to the BBC that four settlements havebeen re-captured from the Russians. Oleg Sinegubov said Ukrainian soldiers have regained full
control over Kutuzovka, Verkhyna Rohanka, Slobidske and Prelensne. âIn Kutuzovka, about one hundred people, most of them
elderly and children, lived in cold basements for two months without light, gas
and food supplies,â Sinegubov said. âToday our defenders were greeted with tearsâ. But while the situation has somewhat improved for people in
those regions, the shelling has continued, he said. Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east, was one of the places to come under early Russian assault. The Ukrainian president has tweeted that the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol has begun, with a group of about 100 people the first to leave. He said they're expected to arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Azovstal steelworks is the last pocket of refuge for Ukrainian soldiers and about 1,000 civilians in Mariupol, who are trapped in a vast network of underground shelters and tunnels with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. The sprawling industrial complex has seen heavy Russian artillery and aerial bombardment in recent days, according to the Institute for War Studies. These satellite photos taken on Friday give a sense of the size of the area and the scale of the damage. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of
the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in
this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear.
Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass
graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion,
imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity,
communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid
constant bombardment and shelling. From the cityâs pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated
100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the
situation was âvery difficultâ and that there were almost no food and water
supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000
people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network
inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify
information. âThe citizens who left the city say that hell exists and
itâs in Mariupol,â the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing
it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia
invaded and annexed in 2014. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
US accuses Russia of depravity and brutality,"Ukrainian women mourn their son and husband, who they say was killed by Russian soldiers along with his friend while driving to Bucha The US defence department has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting with ""depravity"" in his invasion of Ukraine. Spokesman John Kirby became visibly emotional as he asked how anyone ""moral"" could justify the atrocities committed by Russia. But Russia's ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov has rejected the accusation. He described Mr Kirby's comment as ""offensive and unacceptable"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday he was still open to peace talks with Mr Putin. But he said there was a high risk they could collapse amid Russian aggression. Speaking to Polish media, Mr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Putin because ""a single man decides everything"" in Russia. But the destruction left by Russian forces in occupied areas has made any discussions tenuous, he said. ""After Bucha and Mariupol people just want to kill them. When there is such attitude, it is hard to talk about anything."" This video can not be played WATCH: Pentagon secretary gets emotional during Ukraine briefing On Thursday,Ukraine announced a hunt for 10 Russian soldiersaccused of war crimes in Bucha - a suburb north of Kyiv where at least 400 civilians were killed. ""I don't think we fully appreciated the degree to which [Mr Putin] would visit that kind of violence and cruelty,"" Mr Kirby said on Friday. Collecting the dead in Bucha He dismissed Mr Putin's stated justifications for the invasion - that he is protecting Russians and Ukraine from Nazism - adding: ""It's hard to square that rhetoric by what he's actually doing inside Ukraine to innocent people, shot in the back of the head, hands tied behind their backs, pregnant women being killed, hospitals being bombed."" But Mr Antonov accused Kirby of ""resorting to street insults"". ""It has become a norm here that administration officials base their judgments on dirty lies of the Ukrainian authorities,"" the Russian ambassador added. The BBC's Joel Gunter in Kyiv said there is growing evidencethat Russia has forcibly deported large numbers of civilians across the border since it invaded the country in February. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Saturday that more than one million people have been evacuated from Ukraine to Russia since the war began in February. Mr Lavrov told China's state news agency Xinhua that it included some 120,000 foreigners, in addition to hundreds of thousands of people from the Russian-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk. Thousands of Mariupol civilians taken to Russia Ukrainian deportees accuse Russia of torture Ukraine's deputy prime minister told the BBC that Moscow has attempted to trade Ukrainian civilians for Russian military prisoners - a move forbidden by the Geneva Convention. Russia confirmed on Friday that its military had conducted an air strike in Ukraine's capital during a visit by the UN's secretary general.Journalist Vira Hyrch was killed in the attack- the first of its kind in Kyiv in nearly two weeks - after the residential building she lived in was hit by a missile. Russia's defence ministry said it had deployed ""high-precision, long-range air-based weapons"" to target a missile factory in Kyiv. Now more than two months into the war, US President Joe Biden has asked Congress for $33bn (Â£27bn) in military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine - a major ramp-up of American support for Ukraine. The bumper package has been held up by congressional infighting over US domestic priorities, but US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Friday she hoped to get it passed ""as soon as possible"". In Kyiv, Mr Zelensky called the bill's passage ""concrete proof"" that freedom can defend itself against oppression. ""I am sure now that the Lend-Lease will help Ukraine and the whole free world to beat the ideological successors of the Nazis, who started a war against us,"" he said in a late night address on Friday. And the UK also said it was deploying some 8,000 troops for exercises across eastern Europe in a show of the Western world's resolve against Russia's continued aggression.

Bolsonaro hits out at DiCaprio after election plea,"Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio has donated millions of dollars to conservation efforts Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has hit back at Leonardo DiCaprio after the Hollywood actor and environmentalist encouraged the country's youth to vote in the elections later this year. ""Brazil is home to the Amazon and other ecosystems critical to climate change,"" DiCaprio posted on Twitter on Thursday. ""What happens there matters to us all and youth voting is key in driving change for a healthy planet,"" he added. Mr Bolsonaro, who has cut environmental protections, responded with sarcasm. ""Thanks for your support, Leo! It's really important to have every Brazilian voting in the coming elections,""the far-right leader, who took office in 2019, tweeted,external. ""Our people will decide if they want to keep our sovereignty on the Amazon or to be ruled by crooks who serve foreign special interest."" Rainforest belongs to us, says Brazil's leader Brazil's leader accuses DiCaprio over Amazon fires Bolsonaro calls Amazon deforestation data 'lies' DiCaprio is a champion of greater protection for the Amazon rainforest, donating $5m (Â£4.1m) to conservation efforts in 2019. Mr Bolsonaro has faced widespread criticism for his government's environmental policies, and has been accused of allowing deforestation in the region to accelerate. Conservationists have blamed Mr Bolsonaro and his government for turning a blind eye to farmers and loggers clearing land in the Amazon, which is the world's largest rainforest. The country's leader has weakened environmental protections for the region and argued that the government should exploit the area to reduce poverty. According to government satellite data, the number of trees cut down in the Brazilian Amazon in January this yearfar exceeded deforestation for the same month last year. The area destroyed was five times larger than 2021 - the highest January total since records began in 2015. Environmentalists accuse President Bolsonaro of allowing deforestation to accelerate Brazil's vast rainforest absorbs huge amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, acting as what is known as a carbon sink. But the more trees cut down, the less the forest can soak up emissions. It is not the first time the two have clashed over the issue. In 2019, Mr Bolsonaro accused DiCaprio of ""giving money to set the Amazon on fire"". He gave no evidence but has a history of accusing NGOs critical of his policies of starting fires that ravaged the rainforest in 2019. Last year, DiCaprio joined dozens of celebritiesto urge US President Joe Bidento not sign any environmental deal with Brazil amid rising deforestation in the Amazon.

Venus and Jupiter to almost touch in night skyThe dazzlingly bright planets appear extremely close together in the dark sky this weekend.Science & Environment,"Venus and Jupiter have been drawing closer together all week Look up in the sky at the right moment this weekend and you could see two of the solar system's brightest planets almost touching. Venus and Jupiter will be millions of miles apart, but from Earth they will appear close to colliding. This planetary conjunction happens annually but this year they will appear much closer than usual. The same spectacle won't occur again like this until 2039. Just the naked eye or binoculars should be enough to see it in a clear sky. After Saturday, the two planets will go their separate ways as they drift apart in the coming days. ""It's very exciting for astronomers and it's a really great opportunity for people to get out and have a look,"" explains space scientist and chief stargazer at the Society for Popular Astronomy Prof Lucie Green. A conjunction is when two planets appear close together or even touching in the Earth's night sky. In the days running up to Saturday, Venus and Jupiter have been gradually coming together in the sky. The two planets rise side-by-side over Rocca Calascio castle in Italy early on Saturday The actual orbit of the planets are about 430 million miles apart but their apparent alignment seen from Earth gives the illusion that they are touching. The peak time to see it was Saturday at around 05:00 BST. But it will still be visible on Sunday and in the coming days as the planets slowly move apart. Pre-dawn is best, looking east before the Sun rises. Social media user @DebraJ54 took this photo in Humboldt, Tennessee, on Saturday morning The planets will be low down in the sky, close to the horizon, and hills and buildings will block the view. If you can, find a high spot and look for two dazzlingly bright spots very close together. ""The planets will differ in their brightness. Venus is brighter than Jupiter so it will look dazzlingly bright when you see it. Jupiter will be slightly fainter, about one-sixth of the brightness of Venus,"" explains Prof Green. She suggests using an app to help navigate your way around the skies. And if you have telescope, you might be able to make out some structure in the atmosphere of Jupiter or some of its largest moons. The conjunction can be seen from both of Earth's hemispheres at different times of day and night. Those observing with a telescope may also be treated to a view of Mars and Saturn forming a line of four planets. Prof Green says she plans to be up and out of bed to watch it from the UK. ""But if I do miss it on Saturday morning, I'm not going to be too worried,"" she explains. ""In the coming days the two planets start to get further and further apart - So I will still be able to see them."" Did you capture images of the planets?

MP says he may have opened porn by mistakeNeil Parish refuses to resign as an MP until the investigation into the allegations concludes.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Tory MP Neil Parish on porn allegations: 'Of course it's embarrassing' An MP under investigation for allegedly watching pornography in the House of Commons has claimed he may have opened it on his phone by mistake. An inquiry has been launched after Neil Parish referred himself for investigation. He has refused to resign as an MP or as head of the environment select committee until the inquiry concludes. Two female colleagues complained after claiming to have seen him looking at adult content while sitting near them. Mr Parish has been suspended from the Conservative parliamentary party, pending the outcome of the investigation by Parliament's standards commissioner Kathryn Stone. If she finds that he has violated the code of conduct for MPs, possible punishments range from apologising to the Commons to suspension or expulsion. Questioned by the BBC on Friday, Mr Parish said he would co-operate fully with the inquiry and would await the outcome before commenting. ""Of course it's embarrassing,"" he said. ""And it's embarrassing for my wife and family, and so that's my main concern at the moment. I have a very supportive wife and I thank her for that."" Asked if it was a mistake, he said: ""I will await the findings of the inquiry."" Pressed on whether he had opened something on his phone in error, Mr Parish said: ""I did, but let the inquiry look at that."" Mr Parish also said he would resign if ""found guilty"" by the inquiry, saying he understood the upset he might have caused and ""I apologise for that"". However,in a statement on his website,external, he said he would continue working as an MP and committee chair, despite calls from female colleagues for him resign or at least to stop attending Parliament while under investigation. Neil Parish investigated over claims he watched porn in Commons Tory MP accused of watching porn in Commons Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny? On Wednesday, it emerged that a female minister had reported a male colleague for viewing pornographic material while sitting beside her in the Commons chamber.

"US accuses Russia of depravity and brutalityPentagon spokesman John Kirby appeared emotional as he described Russia's ""cruelty"" in Ukraine.","Ukrainian women mourn their son and husband, who they say was killed by Russian soldiers along with his friend while driving to Bucha The US defence department has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting with ""depravity"" in his invasion of Ukraine. Spokesman John Kirby became visibly emotional as he asked how anyone ""moral"" could justify the atrocities committed by Russia. But Russia's ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov has rejected the accusation. He described Mr Kirby's comment as ""offensive and unacceptable"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday he was still open to peace talks with Mr Putin. But he said there was a high risk they could collapse amid Russian aggression. Speaking to Polish media, Mr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Putin because ""a single man decides everything"" in Russia. But the destruction left by Russian forces in occupied areas has made any discussions tenuous, he said. ""After Bucha and Mariupol people just want to kill them. When there is such attitude, it is hard to talk about anything."" This video can not be played WATCH: Pentagon secretary gets emotional during Ukraine briefing On Thursday,Ukraine announced a hunt for 10 Russian soldiersaccused of war crimes in Bucha - a suburb north of Kyiv where at least 400 civilians were killed. ""I don't think we fully appreciated the degree to which [Mr Putin] would visit that kind of violence and cruelty,"" Mr Kirby said on Friday. Collecting the dead in Bucha He dismissed Mr Putin's stated justifications for the invasion - that he is protecting Russians and Ukraine from Nazism - adding: ""It's hard to square that rhetoric by what he's actually doing inside Ukraine to innocent people, shot in the back of the head, hands tied behind their backs, pregnant women being killed, hospitals being bombed."" But Mr Antonov accused Kirby of ""resorting to street insults"". ""It has become a norm here that administration officials base their judgments on dirty lies of the Ukrainian authorities,"" the Russian ambassador added. The BBC's Joel Gunter in Kyiv said there is growing evidencethat Russia has forcibly deported large numbers of civilians across the border since it invaded the country in February. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Saturday that more than one million people have been evacuated from Ukraine to Russia since the war began in February. Mr Lavrov told China's state news agency Xinhua that it included some 120,000 foreigners, in addition to hundreds of thousands of people from the Russian-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk. Thousands of Mariupol civilians taken to Russia Ukrainian deportees accuse Russia of torture Ukraine's deputy prime minister told the BBC that Moscow has attempted to trade Ukrainian civilians for Russian military prisoners - a move forbidden by the Geneva Convention. Russia confirmed on Friday that its military had conducted an air strike in Ukraine's capital during a visit by the UN's secretary general.Journalist Vira Hyrch was killed in the attack- the first of its kind in Kyiv in nearly two weeks - after the residential building she lived in was hit by a missile. Russia's defence ministry said it had deployed ""high-precision, long-range air-based weapons"" to target a missile factory in Kyiv. Now more than two months into the war, US President Joe Biden has asked Congress for $33bn (Â£27bn) in military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine - a major ramp-up of American support for Ukraine. The bumper package has been held up by congressional infighting over US domestic priorities, but US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Friday she hoped to get it passed ""as soon as possible"". In Kyiv, Mr Zelensky called the bill's passage ""concrete proof"" that freedom can defend itself against oppression. ""I am sure now that the Lend-Lease will help Ukraine and the whole free world to beat the ideological successors of the Nazis, who started a war against us,"" he said in a late night address on Friday. And the UK also said it was deploying some 8,000 troops for exercises across eastern Europe in a show of the Western world's resolve against Russia's continued aggression.

MP says he may have opened porn by mistake,"This video can not be played Tory MP Neil Parish on porn allegations: 'Of course it's embarrassing' An MP under investigation for allegedly watching pornography in the House of Commons has claimed he may have opened it on his phone by mistake.

We leave you with some of Sunday's main developments: Ukrainians have been honouring dead friends and relatives, as is traditional on the first Sunday after Orthodox Easter. Alla Krotkikh comforts her 10-year-old son Savelii, as they mourn his father Ihor Krotkikh, 47, who she says was a soldier killed by shelling Anatolii and Olena visit the grave of their son Oleksandr, a soldier, as part of the Easter tradition known as Hrobki or Provody Crosses and floral wreaths are seen in a cemetery in Irpin, outside Kyiv, which saw intense fighting earlier in the war Disabled athletes were among those in Lviv mourning soldier Dmytro Sydoruk, who also coached soldiers with disabilities for the Invictus Games Mourners visit Tairovske Cemetery in Odesa, where graves have been damaged and destroyed by a Russian missile strike And now back to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has said the upcoming anniversary of
Russia's liberation at the end of World War II will not affect Russia's actions in Ukraine. Last week, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace predicted that Vladimir Putin was ""rolling the pitch"" for a major announcement to mark the historic 9 May ""Victory Day"". ""Our soldiers won't base their actions on a specific date,"" Lavrov said when asked if the anniversary
would be a turning point in the war. ""We'll commemorate our victory in a solemn manner but the
timing and speed of what is happening in Ukraine will hinge on
the need to minimise risks for civilians and Russian solders,""
he added, speaking on Italian TV. Azovstal steel plant employee Valeria, right, hugs her sister Aleksandra Earlier we reported that Reuters had seen more than 50 civilians from the area near Azovstal in Mariupol arriving in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk Region. The news agency also said that UN staff were in the area. Images taken by Reuters show emotional reunions between civilians and their loved ones. Civilians have arrived in Bezimenne, which is in Russian-controlled territory Mariupol has come under intense bombardment from Russian artillery for weeks Azovstal steel plant worker Natalia arrives at a temporary accommodation centre Russia's foreign minister says the country has not blocked efforts to prevent nuclear war. ""Western media misrepresent Russian threats,"" Sergei Lavrov said,
speaking in Russian via an Italian interpreter on Italian TV. ""Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements
that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops."" Lavrov repeated Russia's claims that the country is motivated by guaranteeing security for pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east, and that it is fighting against Nazism in Ukraine. You can find out more about Russia's false claims about Nazism in Ukraine here. Denmark and Sweden have said a Russian spyplane has violated both countries' air space. Both are summoning Russian ambassadors over the incident. The Danish Defence Command told AFP the aircraft was a reconnaissance plane that was in Danish air space for ""a very brief moment"" and that Danish F-16 aircrafts ""immediately intervened"". It added that such incidents are rare. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the breach was ""totally unacceptable and particularly worrying in the current situation"". While Denmark is a member of Nato, Sweden is debating whether it should join the alliance. However, the Swedish defence minister told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper there was no proof that the incident was linked to these discussions. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of Kharkiv's Regional State Administration has warned people to remain
vigilant, despite the fact that Russian troops have âreduced the intensity of
shellingâ. Oleh Synyehubov shared images from the town of Dergachi, some
12km (seven miles) north west of Kharkiv, on Telegram. He said the photos showed the âconsequences of prolonged
shellingâ on the town. Synyehubov also warned Kharkiv residents in the northern and
eastern districts of the city to remain inside on Sunday due to shelling. A fire broke out at a Russian defence ministry site close to the Ukrainian border, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. One person sustained minor injuries, Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The governor of another Russian region near the Ukrainian border, Kursk, said part of a freight railway bridge had collapsed, with no casualties. ""It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue,"" said governor Roman Starovoyt on Telegram, without naming Ukrainian forces. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of attacks on its territory near to the border. Captain Palamar seen in a video statement from 24 April Despite the news that 100 civilians are on their way from Mariupol's war-battered Azovstal steel plant to Ukrainian-held territory, one of the commanders there says many injured remain. ""There are still wounded at the plant as well. They have not been evacuated yet, but we hope that they are going to be taken away from here. Their condition is serious, they need proper medical treatment, proper nutrition to recover,"" Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told the BBC. Food and water issues remained, he said, but those remaining are ""trying to stretch out what we have for as long as possible"". Aside from the hope for the remaining civilians to be evacuated, he said, ""we are willing to fight back and do not intend to surrender"". He said he hoped Ukrainian officials and the leaders of other countries would ""do everything possible to evacuate our garrison from Mariupol"". Natalia Usmanova, pictured, told Reuters: ""You just can't imagine"" life in Azovstal The first accounts of life in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Avozstal steelworks are starting to emerge. We reported earlier how Reuters news agency had spotted civilians stepping off the bus from Mariupol in the village of Bezimenne, in Russia-held parts of east Ukraine. One of them was 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova, who told the news agency what it was like when powerful bombs hit while she hid underground ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long,"" she added. ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I
lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just
terrible."" Laurence PeterBBC News Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"". Read morehere A Ukrainian soldier guarding the Chernobyl plant Ukraineâs state electricity operator Ukrenergo says it has
restored reliable power to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident. Ukrenergo says the
last 330 kV power line has been reconnected there. Earlier, it says,
another 330kV line came back on stream, north of Kyiv, which âmade it possible
to improve the reliability of power supply to the capitalâ. In a Facebook post, Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi
said the Russian military occupation of Chernobyl â which has now ended â had caused much
disruption at Chernobyl. âAfter the departure of the Russians, our
repairmen immediately after the sappers investigated dozens of kilometres of
lines, restored the resistance and other equipment,â he said. An exclusion zone covering about 2,600 sq km (1,000 sq miles) was imposed around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the catastrophic explosion there in 1986. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant The evacuation of civilians from Mariupolâs Azovstal steel
plant is a major, long-awaited development. About 1,000 of them have been
sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and
concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water
supplies. A convoy departed to Mariupol on Friday but only now has official confirmation come in, first from the UN and the Red Cross, then from
President Zelensky, a sign of how complex and delicate this operation is. Meanwhile, relatives of the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers
who are also trapped in the steel plant, surrounded by Russian troops, are
anxiously waiting for any operation that allows them to be able to flee in safety too. Here in Dnipro, I met the wife of an officer who is at the
plant. She said she and other women were willing to go to Mariupol to secure a
safe way out for their husbands. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv After a surprise visit to a Lviv coffee shop on Saturday, more
details have been revealed about Angelina Jolieâs trip here. The actress met with a number of displaced Ukrainians
including children who were injured in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station. At least 52 people were killed and dozens injured after rockets hit the station as people waited to board evacuation trains. Lviv's regional governor Maxim Kozytski confirmed Jolie's visit on Telegram, adding that ""she was very moved by the children's stories"". Jolie also met people at the cityâs train station, including volunteers who were helping evacuees. Lviv, in the west of Ukraine, has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of the country. As well as the fighters and civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol, there are also an estimated 100,000 residents in other parts of the city. They have been trying to survive without mains water, electricity or gas for weeks. Earlier we reported that Mariupol City Council had invited these residents to gather at a mall at 1600 local time (1300 GMT) as an evacuation could be possible on Sunday. But now the council has saidin a post on Telegram,externalthat this evacuation has been postponed for security reasons until 0800 local time (0500 GMT) tomorrow. Evacuees from Mariupol who wanted to go to Ukrainian-controlled regions have been handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Reuters news agency reports citing Russia's defence ministry. The ministry says 80 civilians had been moved from the vast Azovstal
plant after weeks under siege. The massive industrial area is the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 100 civilians have been evacuated from the besieged steel plant in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the group is on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of the military administration in Kharkiv has
confirmed to the BBC that four settlements havebeen re-captured from the Russians. Oleg Sinegubov said Ukrainian soldiers have regained full
control over Kutuzovka, Verkhyna Rohanka, Slobidske and Prelensne. âIn Kutuzovka, about one hundred people, most of them
elderly and children, lived in cold basements for two months without light, gas
and food supplies,â Sinegubov said. âToday our defenders were greeted with tearsâ. But while the situation has somewhat improved for people in
those regions, the shelling has continued, he said. Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east, was one of the places to come under early Russian assault. The Ukrainian president has tweeted that the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol has begun, with a group of about 100 people the first to leave. He said they're expected to arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Azovstal steelworks is the last pocket of refuge for Ukrainian soldiers and about 1,000 civilians in Mariupol, who are trapped in a vast network of underground shelters and tunnels with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. The sprawling industrial complex has seen heavy Russian artillery and aerial bombardment in recent days, according to the Institute for War Studies. These satellite photos taken on Friday give a sense of the size of the area and the scale of the damage. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of
the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in
this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear.
Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass
graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion,
imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity,
communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid
constant bombardment and shelling. From the cityâs pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated
100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the
situation was âvery difficultâ and that there were almost no food and water
supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000
people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network
inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify
information. âThe citizens who left the city say that hell exists and
itâs in Mariupol,â the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing
it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia
invaded and annexed in 2014. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Pressed on whether he had opened something on his phone in error, Mr Parish said: ""I did, but let the inquiry look at that."" Mr Parish also said he would resign if ""found guilty"" by the inquiry, saying he understood the upset he might have caused and ""I apologise for that"". However,in a statement on his website,external, he said he would continue working as an MP and committee chair, despite calls from female colleagues for him resign or at least to stop attending Parliament while under investigation. Neil Parish investigated over claims he watched porn in Commons Tory MP accused of watching porn in Commons Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny? On Wednesday, it emerged that a female minister had reported a male colleague for viewing pornographic material while sitting beside her in the Commons chamber. The female minister said she had also seen the MP watching pornography during a hearing of a select committee, The Times reported. A second female Tory MP said she had tried but been unable to capture video proof of him doing so. The allegations were subsequently revealed to have been made about Mr Parish, who said he had referred himself for investigation. Mr Parish serves as the MP for Tiverton and Honiton in Devon and also chairs the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee - but the investigation does not prevent him from continuing in either role. In an interview with the Times,external, Mr Parish's wife, Sue Parish, said the allegation was ""very embarrassing"" and described her husband as ""quite a normal guy"" and ""a lovely person"". She added she did not see the attraction of pornography and understood why the women who had made the allegation were upset. Labour accused the government of having known about the incident for days and attempting to ""cover it up"". ""It shouldn't have taken days for him to be referred to the process,"" Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow education secretary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It was clear no action had been taken and that for some days Conservative whips knew exactly who he was."" The delay by the whips to suspend Mr Parish from the Tory party was also criticised by Caroline Nokes, Conservative MP and chair of the women and equalities committee. ""I fully expected to wake up on the Wednesday morning and find that a member of Parliament had had the whip suspended. ""And I felt that by leaving it until Friday before we knew that action had been taken by the whips, that felt like unnecessary dither and delay."" She said the culture in the whips office was ""still too blokey"" and it was one of the challenges for the party. The government's safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean denied that the Conservative Party was institutionally sexist, saying: ""I think there is clearly a problem in the House of Commons. And I think it extends to all parties actually."" On the time it took the whips, she said: ""There clearly needed to be some time to establish the veracity of what was said, the facts of the case. Where we've got to now is the right place we need to be, which is there is the investigation happening, the chief whip has taken the action he's taken."" The 65-year-old, an MP since 2010, was a Member of the European Parliament for South West England from 1999 to 2009 He left school at 16 to manage his family's farm and, in 2000, was an election monitor during Zimbabwe's parliamentary election He opposed Brexit in the 2016 referendum and voted against the introduction of same-sex marriage by David Cameron's government Mr Parish is married and has two children and two grandchildren Conservative party Chief Whip Chris Heaton-Harris has asked for the matter to be referred to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ""tell Neil Parish to resign immediately"", while environment committee member Kirsty Blackman of the SNP said Mr Parish should resign as chair of the committee Mr Parish was questioned by GB News earlier this week about allegations an MP had been caught watching porn. He told the broadcaster he expected the whips' office to ""do a thorough investigation"" which the party would ""wait and see"" the result of. ""I think from that then the decision will have to be made what action to be taken,"" Mr Parrish added. The claims against Mr Parish follow a series of allegations about other MPs' behaviour. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said on Friday that she hadonce been ""pinned up against a wall""by a male colleague and subject to misogyny and ""wandering hands"" on numerous occasions. Attorney General Suella Braverman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour there had to be adiscussion about ""moral standards"",complaining that a minority of men in politics ""behave like animals"". And a Welsh MP alleged that a member of Labour's shadow cabinethad made lewd remarksto her.
