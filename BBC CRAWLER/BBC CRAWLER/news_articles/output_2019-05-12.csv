Financial crisis 'scarred' younger workers,"When Carole Farish left school 11 years ago, she thought it would be quite easy to find a job in retail or hospitality. But like many of her peer group, she found it was not so straightforward. Carole belongs to a generation that, according to a new report, has been ""left scarred"" by joining the workforce just as the financial crisis hit. The Resolution Foundation says this ""crisis cohort"" has suffered from lower pay and worse job prospects for up to a decade since the downturn. Carole's early optimism over job seeking faded when it took her five months just to get an interview, only to find she was competing against candidates with business degrees. ""It was a bit disheartening,"" she says. ""It took a lot of perseverance to keep applying. I didn't expect it to be as tough."" Since then, she has worked in a leisure centre, in catering and looking after children. Although she has in the meantime been to university, she is now working as a carer. Millennials 'wrongly relying on inheritance' How did the financial crisis affect your finances? Can't save money? Is this the answer? The Resolution Foundation says those who entered the world of work between 2008 and 2011 bore the brunt of the sharp economic decline, when compared to young people entering work before or after the downturn. ""Low-skilled workers faced a higher risk of unemployment, while graduates were more likely to trade down the types of jobs they did, with their pay and prospects stunted as a result,"" said Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. ""These scarring effects have stayed with the crisis cohort for up to a decade, reducing their living standards at a time when they may be facing the additional financial strains of buying a home, or bringing up kids,"" he said. Policy makers should look at ways to mitigate the impact, he added. Although unemployment did not rise as sharply as in previous recessions, in 2012 it was still twice the rate for the population in general, the report says. Those who ""trade down"" to a low-paying occupation because they are struggling to find work rarely move into a higher-paying occupation, even after the economy has picked up, the report adds. The Department for Work and Pensions highlighted new jobcentre programmes which it said were examining ways to support people to change jobs and improve their pay and career progression. ""Employment is at a record high, with youth unemployment having halved since 2010. And we believe every worker should be in a job which reflects their skills and offers opportunities to progress,"" the DWP said. In 2018,analysis carried out for the BBCby the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) showed that people in their 30s were earning Â£2,100 a year less than people in the same age group in 2008.

European elections 'ultimate protest vote',"This video can not be played Education Secretary Damian Hinds: 'This is not about the leader of the party' The European Parliament elections will be seen as an opportunity for the ultimate protest vote, Education Secretary Damian Hinds has said. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the elections would be difficult for the Conservatives and that ""for some people this is the second referendum"". Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told the show there had been a breakdown in trust between people and politicians. Elections for 73 MEPs to the European Parliament will take place on 23 May. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward. The government is continuing to talk to the Labour party about progress in the Brexit process, and those cross-party talks are due to continue on Monday. Meanwhile, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer hastold the Guardian,externalthat he doubts a cross-party deal lacking a confirmatory referendum could pass Parliament. 2019 European elections: List of candidates A really simple guide to the European elections Pollwatch: Euro elections Mr Hinds said: ""I don't think anyone is in any doubt these are going to be difficult elections for us - that much has been clear from the very start. ""For some people this is the ultimate protest vote opportunity. Actually, ironically this is, in a sense, for some people, this is the second referendum,"" he added. Mr Hinds said he would have preferred the government ""didn't have to go into talks with Labour"" but asked: ""What's the alternative? ""I disagree with Labour on many things... but there is some commonality of interest here. ""This is about our democracy, about our system and to repay the trust that people put in us we need to get things done for our constituents."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour had put forward alternatives in its negotiations in the Brexit process. ""We're trying to negotiate that with the government, as I say it's not getting very far, but we are still engaging in those negotiations in good faith."" In a tense interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Farage said that if the Brexit Party was successful in the European Parliament elections, he would ask for the party's MEPs to become part of the government's EU negotiating team. This video can not be played MEP Nigel Farage says immigration ""isn't the burning issue of the time"" now ""We've got a two-party system that now serves nothing but itself,"" he said. ""There is a complete breakdown of trust between the people in this country and our politicians and frankly they revealed themselves to be grossly incompetent."" Ahead of European elections, two separate polls - by ComRes and Opinium - give Mr Farage's Brexit Party the biggest share of the vote with the Conservatives in fourth place behind Labour and the Lib Dems. The UK is now due to leave the EU on 31 October Voters will go to the polls on 23 May to elect 73 MEPs to the European Parliament, after the government conceded elections would have to go ahead The government is continuing cross party talks with Labour to find an agreed way forward MPs have rejected Theresa May's negotiated deal with the EU three times in Parliamentary votes The withdrawal agreement the PM reached with the EU has to be ratified by Parliament, and then turned into UK law in the form of a bill Former prime minister Tony Blair expressed frustration with Labour's position on Brexit saying it was ""clear they are not Remain in an unequivocal sense"". On Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday, the former Labour leader urged Labour supporters who can no longer vote for the party to endorse one which backs Remain. He said it was ""important the anti-Brexit side is larger and stronger than the Farage side"" in the European elections. ""I do come across people who cannot vote for Labour, in which case I say 'don't stay at home - vote for any of the other parties',"" he said.

Farage: May deceiving public over deal,"Andrew Marr quizzes Nigel Farage, leader of the newly-established Brexit Party Nigel Farage has accused Theresa May of ""wilfully deceiving"" people over her negotiated EU deal. The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr the PM's proposed Brexit deal was a ""new European treaty"". In a tense interview, Mr Farage said he would demand his party became part of the government negotiating team if it was successful in the forthcoming European elections. Elections to the European Parliament take place on 23 May. Asked why he did not advocate a no-deal Brexit at the time of the EU referendum in 2016, Mr Farage said: ""Because it was obvious that we could do a free trade deal. Allow Twitter content?

""The problem is the prime minister never asked for it, so we finished up in the mess that we're in,"" he said. ""She chose to go for this close and special partnership. Basically right from the start she was happy for us to be kept very close to the customs union. ""So where we are now, the only way the democratic will of the people can be delivered is to leave on a WTO (World Trade Organization) deal."" Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party European elections 'ultimate protest vote' The interview on the BBC programme also saw Mr Farage asked about past comments on NHS privatisation, climate change, gun control, immigration and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Responding angrily to the line of questioning, he said: ""This is absolutely ludicrous, I've never in my life seen a more ridiculous interview than this. ""You're in denial, the BBC is in denial, the Tory and Labour parties are in denial. ""I think you're all in for a bigger surprise on Thursday week [the EU elections] than you can even imagine.""

""For some people this is the ultimate protest vote opportunity. Actually, ironically this is, in a sense, for some people, this is the second referendum,"" he said. Mr Farage said he believed that if there was a second referendum, the campaign to leave the EU would win by a bigger margin. He said he was ""mentally preparing myself for one"", adding: ""I'm thinking we may well have it forced upon us."" Lib Dem deputy leader and People's Vote supporter Jo Swinson said Mr Farage had refused to ""own up to well-documented and abhorrent views on NHS privatisation, his admiration for Vladimir Putin and his denial of the facts about climate change"". She said: ""Despite his claims to the contrary, everyone remembers that he promised in 2016 that there would be an amazing cost-free Brexit deal available to Britain if we voted to leave the EU. ""To say today that he always advocated 'no deal' is a mark of just how shameless he is, and how little he cares for the jobs and livelihoods of the people of this country.""

The cost of change in the cash industryOne in every five cash machines in Northern Ireland now charges customers a fee to withdraw money.Northern Ireland,"Cash machines are becoming more expensive to operate due to fee changes and robberies Since the beginning of April, 145 free-to-use cash machines across Northern Ireland have become pay-to-use machines. It means that out of a total of 2,027 cash machines in the region, almost one in five (388) now charges customers a fee to withdraw money. It is part of a wider trend across the UK, as our changing shopping habits make getting hold of cold, hard cash ever more difficult. People living in rural parts of Northern Ireland are among the most disadvantaged when it comes to getting their hands on their own money. Free cash machines 'vanishing' Cash machine thefts: What is going on? Many had come to rely on cash machines after a series of bank closures - 152 branches have shut in Northern Ireland since 2010. But cash machine ram-raids and now withdrawal fees have left some communities as ""cashless societies"" long before they were ready. Kenny Bradley's firm runs nine shops in Northern Ireland It came as shock to Kenny Bradley when the free-to-use cash machine outside his shop in Garvagh, County Londonderry, suddenly began charging 95p for a transaction. There was an even nastier shock when customers vented their anger online, wrongly blaming his staff for imposing the fees. ""We had such a backlash on social media - it was quite aggressive,"" he says. ""And I can fully understand why - in Garvagh, the people in the village now have no access to free cash after 23:00."" Garvagh's Cash Zone machine is operated by Cardtronics The businessman has no control over the fees because the machine is operated by Cardtronics, the UK's largest independent cash machine provider. Mr Bradley says there has been a ""drastic"" fall in usage since charging began in February, estimating it has cost the shop 1,000 potential customer visits a week. During September 2018, when the machine was still fee-free, there were 6,269 transactions. By contrast, March saw 2,060 transactions - a drop of more than 4,000 over the month. Cardtronics apologised to Mr Bradley after the cash machine began to charge before ""free withdrawals"" signs had been removed Mr Bradley's firm runs nine shops across Northern Ireland, including two in Garvagh, and hosts several cash machines for different operators. He wants rid of the machines that are costing customers, but he is tied to a contract. So his firm has introduced alternative payment methods, including cashback, but that too brought problems. ""Our card provider charges us every time we do cashback, but to support our customers and provide that service we're now taking that financial hit."" Majella Murphy recently retired after 25 years working in rural community development Majella Murphy says people already struggling on small incomes will find it difficult to pay cash machine charges. ""My husband and I are on the state pension,"" she says. ""If I was going to be charged, we'd take it out in one lump sum."" But she is worried about theft and fears that pensioners and benefits recipients could be forced into carrying larger amounts of cash to avoid fees. ""We've already been robbed - the house was broken into four years ago, so we don't keep money at home."" Several shops have been badly damaged in cash machine robberies across Northern Ireland It is not only security that is concerning the retired community worker but also how vulnerable people will manage their money. ""If you're on, say, Â£80 and you take out the whole Â£80 at once, it could end up spent and then you have nothing left for the rest of the week."" Consumer group Which? recently warned thatfree-to-use cash machines were disappearing ""at an alarming rate"" across the UK, but in Northern Ireland it is not just free ones that are vanishing. Cash machines have been ripped out of walls in a spate of robberies. So far this year, 15 cash machines have been targeted in thefts or attempted thefts around Northern Ireland and some will not be replaced. Mrs Murphy recently retired on medical grounds and struggles with mobility. There is one cash machine within walking distance of her home in Forkhill, County Armagh, and another at a supermarket about half a mile outside the village, but they are only available when the shops are open. The supermarket's cash machine was moved inside the premises a number of years ago after an attempted ram-raid. In spite of not having round-the-clock access to money, Mrs Murphy thinks all cash machines should now be inside to protect local services. ""My fear would be that they will be stolen and the shopped wrecked and you end up with no shop and no ATM."" Cash machines are not as profitable as they used to be because shoppers are increasingly turning to cashless transactions like debit cards and contactless payments. Every time a customer uses a cash machine that does not belong to their own bank, their bank pays a fee to the cash machine provider. The fee is known as the interchange rate and is set by the UK's largest cash machine network, Link, which oversees the industry. Link said ""cash use is declining rapidly"" and its figures show a falling trend in cash machine transactions Until recently, each transaction cost the banks 25p but Link is gradually reducing the rate to 20p in an attempt to keep cash machines financially viable. ""We need to make sure we have a sustainable and geographically broad ATM network,"" says Link's spokesperson. ""That means fewer machines in busier areas, where often there are too many, and protecting those in remote areas, often where there are no alternatives."" But the rate cut angered cash machine providers who make their profits from the interchange fee. Cardtronics is one of a number of cash machine providers but it is the biggest in the UK. The firm said it had no choice but to introduce withdrawal charges because of the interchange rate cuts imposed by Link. ""Independent ATM operators such as ourselves often fill the gap left as a result of the banks closing branches and removing their own ATMs,"" it adds. ""But these cuts have made some of our ATMs unsustainable as a free service."" Free cash machines 'vanishing' What is going on with cash machine thefts?

""We're trying to negotiate that with the government, as I say it's not getting very far, but we are still engaging in those negotiations in good faith."" In a tense interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Farage said that if the Brexit Party was successful in the European Parliament elections, he would ask for the party's MEPs to become part of the government's EU negotiating team. This video can not be played MEP Nigel Farage says immigration ""isn't the burning issue of the time"" now ""We've got a two-party system that now serves nothing but itself,"" he said. ""There is a complete breakdown of trust between the people in this country and our politicians and frankly they revealed themselves to be grossly incompetent."" Ahead of European elections, two separate polls - by ComRes and Opinium - give Mr Farage's Brexit Party the biggest share of the vote with the Conservatives in fourth place behind Labour and the Lib Dems. The UK is now due to leave the EU on 31 October Voters will go to the polls on 23 May to elect 73 MEPs to the European Parliament, after the government conceded elections would have to go ahead The government is continuing cross party talks with Labour to find an agreed way forward MPs have rejected Theresa May's negotiated deal with the EU three times in Parliamentary votes The withdrawal agreement the PM reached with the EU has to be ratified by Parliament, and then turned into UK law in the form of a bill Former prime minister Tony Blair expressed frustration with Labour's position on Brexit saying it was ""clear they are not Remain in an unequivocal sense"". On Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday, the former Labour leader urged Labour supporters who can no longer vote for the party to endorse one which backs Remain. He said it was ""important the anti-Brexit side is larger and stronger than the Farage side"" in the European elections.

A really simple guide to the European elections,"Voters across the EU go to the polls on 23-26 May to elect more than 700 MEPs - members of the European Parliament. MEPsrepresent more than 500 million EU citizens from 28 countries. MEPs can represent a national political party or they can stand as independents. They each represent a region of their home country. The last European elections were held in 2014. The parliament is the onlydirectly-electedEU institution. The parliament is elected using a system of proportional representation. Seats are awarded to parties in direct proportion to their share of the vote. After the MEPs are elected, most joinbigger political groupsin the EU parliament. In the outgoing parliament - 751 seats in total - there were eight big political groups. The largest was the centre-right European Peopleâs Party (EPP), with 217 seats. Next came the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D), with 186 seats.The other groups were: European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), including the UK Conservatives, with 76, the liberals (ALDE - 68 seats), a left-wing group (GUE/NGL - 52), the Greens (52) and two nationalist, Eurosceptic groups (78 total) plus independents (21). The main job of the EU parliament is to pass laws, working with ministers from the member states, who are collectively known asthe Council. Together with the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union is the main decision-making body of the EU. The Council approves a law if there is a qualified majority: at least 55% of members (16 out of 28 states) and representing at least 65% of the EU population. MEPs also monitor the work of the European Commission, which drafts EU laws and enforces EU rules. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 â and was expected to leave by 29 March 2019 â but UK politicians have beenunable to agree an exit deal. If the UK does not hold European elections on 23 May it will have to leave on 1 June without a deal, the EU says. The UK has until 31 October to reach a deal â provided it holds European elections. The UK is legally obliged to take part in the elections, unless it approves aWithdrawal Agreementby 22 May, enabling it to leave the EU with a deal. The agreement was completed in November, but remains stuck, mainly because many MPs oppose the âbackstopâ for Northern Ireland. The âbackstopâ is the part of the agreement that sets out a way to keep free movement across the Northern Ireland border, but critics say it would undermine UK sovereignty. That looks unlikely, as MPs have already rejected it three times. In recent yearsanti-EU politicianshave been gaining ground and - though they are unlikely to gain a majority in the new parliament - more are expected to get elected as MEPs this time. These are eurosceptics who oppose closer EU integration. They argue that too much power has been handed to Brussels. The National Rally party in France, previously called the National Front,  the League in Italy and the new Brexit Party in the UK are Eurosceptic parties. Those opposed to the EU are often fromnationalist or populistparties. There is much overlap between nationalists and populists. Many are far-right activists, but there are also many left-wing populists. They are mostly anti-EU, and say institutions like the EU parliament are too remote from âthe peopleâ. Nationalists in particular oppose mass immigration, and often direct their anger at Muslim migrants. Populists see most liberal politicians as elitist, biased towards bankers, big corporations and EU bureaucrats. Pro-EU parties say the EU plays a crucial role in big issues such as the environment, renewable energy, workersâ rights, financial stability and combating terrorism. They say Europe needs to work together, faced with the economic clout of powers like the US and China. Immigration from non-EU countries surged in importance for voters across Europe from 2015 to 2016, during themigrant crisis. More than a million migrants arrived in Europe between 2015 and 2016 â many of them refugees from Syria and other conflict zones. A large majority sought asylum in Germany. Most travelled via Greece and the Balkans, but later barriers went up and the numbers dropped after the EU reached a deal with Turkey to stop migrant boats. There was a nationalist backlash, especially in Germany, Hungary, Austria and Poland. Many voters want more determined action to tackle climate change, an issue highlighted byGreta Thunbergand her Fridays for Future youth campaign. Swedish 16-year-old Greta Thunberg launched a worldwide protest movement when, in the summer of 2018, she skipped school to press for action on climate change. Thousands of school students followed her example, and many adults were inspired to protest too. Theeurozone debt crisisgripped Europe between 2010 and 2012, but anxiety about the euro has declined since then. The world financial crisis exposed massive over-borrowing by governments in southern Europe, especially Greece. Greece got an EU bailout totalling â¬289bn (Â£250bn), to keep it in the eurozone. The crisis hit confidence in the euro. Besides Brexit uncertainty in the UK, anxiety about immigration could influence voting in several countries, to the advantage of nationalist and populist parties. One of those countries is Italy where the government is a nationalist-populist coalition between Matteo Salvini's right-wing, anti-immigrationLeague and Five Star. These were the winning parties in Italyâs March 2018 election. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini of the League is their best-known politician â he refuses to accept migrant boats, saying people who arrive illegally must be deported. The League has forged an election alliance with the far-rightAlternative for Germany (AfD), the Finns Party and the Danish People's Party. AfD is against the euro and sees Islam as alien to German culture. It is the main opposition party in the German parliament. France is also one to watch. It is the first European election for President Emmanuel Macronâs liberalLa RÃ©publique en Marche (LREM). En Marche has been sharply criticised by gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protesters. They say President Macron has failed to address the concerns of less well-off French voters. Whilst gilets jaunes candidates may not win large-scale support themselves â as the movement is still new - their campaign could boost Marine Le Pen's National Rally party.

Brexit talks: Don't expect a love-in,"Labour's team including Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer have been negotiating with the government ""Constructive and detailed"" - that sounds quite positive - Number 10's description of the talks today. ""Robust"" - not quite so chirpy - Labour's use of political speak for what most of us might call a bit tricky. ""Disingenuous"" - oh dear - a different Labour source's description of ministers' claim that what they were putting on the table in the cross-party talks today was something genuinely new on the vexed question of customs arrangements after we leave the EU. As we reported this morning there didn't really seem to be much from the government that was concrete beyond what's already possible under the agreement that's been hammered out with Brussels. The divorce deal and indeed yes, you guessed it, the backstop, both have forms of temporary customs unions in them to make trade between the UK and the EU easier. Of course the precise language and mechanisms matter enormously. But was there some big shiny new offer today? The short answer is: no. And after hours of talks this afternoon, Labour sources suggest ministers in the end more or less admitted that in pointed discussions. May to meet senior Tory amid calls to resign Brexit: A really simple guide UK will take part in European elections As we've talked about here before, the cross-party talks process is real. Plenty of people in the Tory party hate it. Plenty of people in the Labour Party hate it. But inside both leaders' camps, there is a genuine desire, more intense since they both had a bad night at the polls on Thursday, to see if they can sketch out a joint escape route from the mess of Brexit. But the historically awful result for the prime minister does not seem to have shocked her into ditching her red lines - at least not yet. It's important to understand this process is always unlikely to end up with some kind of joint defining pact - sources involved joke about the preposterous idea of some kind of May-Corbyn Rose Garden love-in - fond or awful memories of that summer's day when the Cameron-Clegg bromance was born in public (take your pick which). The fact the talks have gone on for so long hint that there is serious merit in finding some kind of agreement on some kind of process. At the very least senior figures in the government hope that the talks might mean Labour would allow the Brexit legislation to move on to its next phase. In nerd terms, this is to allow the Withdrawal Bill to get through its so-called ""second reading"", knowing that at the next stage in Parliament where a committee of MPs would pore over every line, multiple layers of objections would be made, suggestions and changes put forward and then voted on, before finally, the bill would have its third reading, when MPs are able to give their final yes or no. It is hard right now though to make a call on whether that is viable. One former minister, experienced and not prone to make wild prediction, told me Number 10 was in ""la la land"" if they believed that could happen. About half an hour later, another former and experienced minister told me they believe, in fact, it will fly and perhaps by the end of this month. Whoever you ask, it is clear it is not straightforward. So when the two teams sit down again on Wednesday afternoon, whether it is ""constructive"" or ""robust"", there's still an awful lot to do.

The best top two in history,"Manchester City have sealed the Premier League title, needing a 14-game winning run to keep themselves above Liverpool - the best second-placed team in English top-flight history. It felt like an absolutely relentless battle between two great Premier League sides. But do the stats back that up? It has been a title race of unparalleled quality and the numbers bear that out. This is the form guide for the second half of the season: Man City: WWWWLWWWWWWWWWWWWWW Liverpool: WLWWDDWDWDWWWWWWWWW The top two have amassed 195 points - a top-flight record for the champions and runners-up. They actually passed the previous Premier League record in their 36th games of the season. They also recorded the most combined wins (62) for a top two. In both those instances, the previous record was last season, although City had provided a much greater share of the combined figures than second-placed Manchester United. City and Liverpool have also broken the record for the fewest combined defeats - five. The top two in 2004-05 (Chelsea and Arsenal) and 2008-09 (Manchester United and Liverpool) had six defeats between them. From the chief exec's Pep talk to Silva surprise - unseen moments that defined Man City's season The 11mm title? The tiny margins that decided an extraordinary battle 'Amid the pain, Klopp offers Liverpool hope' All season the title race has seemed too close to call, not least because the lead at the top has changed so many times. In fact, it has never changed hands so many times in a season. By the time the title was won, it had switched 32 times at the end of a day this season, although plenty of those came as a result of staggering City's and Liverpool's games. The previous record had been 2001-02, when the lead changed 28 times. Arsenal won the title that season, but both Manchester United and Liverpool had led in the final 10 games - and Newcastle and Leeds were both top over the festive period. Liverpool have spent 141 days top of the Premier League - 16 more than Manchester City. Chelsea spent nine days top - and Manchester United were top for one day, beating Leicester 2-1 in the first game of the season. The last time Liverpool spent more days on top in a season was 1990-91 (163 days), when they also finished second. They are far away from the Premier League record for a team spending the most time top without winning the league though - Newcastle United's 212 days in 1995-96 may never be surpassed. This video can not be played Brighton 1-4 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola 'so happy' with back-to-back titles City's points haul in itself was not record breaking - mostly because of their 100-point tally in 2017-18. But they have broken plenty of other records. Only five top-flight title-winning teams have ever won 30 games in a season, including football before the Premier League and 42-game seasons. City's record 32 wins last season put them on the list, and this season's vintage are on it again with the same figure. And they are the first team in English Football League history to win 30 games in three different seasons (2001-02 First Division, 2017-18 and 2018-19 Premier League). City have also scored more goals than any English top-flight team in a season. They have managed 163 in all competitions. They also had the previous record, 156 in 2013-14. In fact City have three of the top five scoring seasons, with 143 in 2017-18. So near, yet so far for Liverpool. The Reds have the highest points tally of any team to finish second in the English top flight. Their 97 beat the previous record of Leeds United in 1970-71 (91) - adjusted to three points for a win. The previous highest Premier League total which failed to secure the title came when Manchester United finished behind Manchester City on goal difference with 89 points in 2012. Liverpool's 97 points would have won them every single Premier League title apart from last season and this season. They are one of only 10 teams in the Premier League era to pick up 90 or more points. Unfortunately for them City this season are one of the others. Liverpool have won 18 English titles, but only once have they ever picked up more points than they did this season - 98 in 1978-79, adjusted to three points for a win. And that was from 42 games, making this Liverpool's best-ever points per game return. In fact, the Reds have the highest tally of a runner-up in any of Europe's top five leagues - eclipsing Real Madrid's 96 in 2009-10. The champions that season? Guardiola's Barcelona. For two such attacking sides, it is only right that players from both teams recorded historic goalscoring feats this season. City's Sergio Aguero, with 21 goals, became only the second player to score 20 or more Premier League goals in six different seasons. Alan Shearer managed it in seven - three for Blackburn and four times for Newcastle. Aguero also becomes the second man to score 20 Premier League goals in five consecutive seasons, level with Arsenal legend Thierry Henry. Liverpool pair Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane have also hit at least 20 league goals. That is only the fourth time two players in the same team have reached that landmark in a Premier League season. They shared this season's Golden Boot with Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on 22 goals.

"Farage: May deceiving public over dealTheresa May's proposed Brexit deal is a ""new European treaty"", the Brexit Party leader says.","Andrew Marr quizzes Nigel Farage, leader of the newly-established Brexit Party Nigel Farage has accused Theresa May of ""wilfully deceiving"" people over her negotiated EU deal. The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr the PM's proposed Brexit deal was a ""new European treaty"". In a tense interview, Mr Farage said he would demand his party became part of the government negotiating team if it was successful in the forthcoming European elections. Elections to the European Parliament take place on 23 May. Asked why he did not advocate a no-deal Brexit at the time of the EU referendum in 2016, Mr Farage said: ""Because it was obvious that we could do a free trade deal. Allow Twitter content?

Iran faces 'unprecedented' pressure - Rouhani,"There are regular protests against the US - and President Trump - in Iran Iran is facing ""unprecedented"" pressure from international sanctions, President Hassan Rouhani has said. Renewed US sanctions had led to worse economic conditions than during the country's 1980-88 war with neighbouring Iraq, Mr Rouhani said. His comments came amid rising tensions with the US, which last week deployed warships and warplanes to the Gulf. Mr Rouhani, who has come under domestic political pressure, called for political unity to face down sanctions. ""During the war we did not have a problem with our banks, oil sales or imports and exports, and there were only sanctions on arms purchases,"" Mr Rouhani told political activists in the capital, Tehran. ""The pressures by enemies is a war unprecedented in the history of our Islamic revolution ... but I do not despair and have great hope for the future and believe that we can move past these difficult conditions provided that we are united,"" he said. How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? The US-Iran escalation has put into question the future of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany. US President Donald Trump last year unilaterally abandoned the deal and re-imposed sanctions - and Iran has indicated it may also resume nuclear activities if the other partners go along with American sanctions. Whatpressures is Iran facing? President Rouhani has personally come under pressure from hardliners in Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal his administration negotiated. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. US sanctions - particularly those on the energy, shipping and financial sectors - have hit oil exports and caused foreign investment to dry up. The sanctions prevent US companies from trading with Iran directly and also with any foreign firms or countries that are dealing with Iran. President Rouhani has come under pressure in Iran after a 2015 nuclear accord began to fall apart Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Nuclear deal - all you need to know The International Monetary Fund has said it expects the Iranian economy to shrink by 6% in 2019. However, that projection preceded another move by the US to tighten sanctions: the end to exemptions enjoyed by China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey, all five of which have been buying Iranian oil. Last month,the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps(RG), designating it as a foreign terrorist group. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - through which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally passes. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a ""new deal"" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its ""malign behaviour"" across the Middle East. The US is sending a Patriot missile-defence system to the Middle East. Fact file: Patriot missile defence Battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal begins A US warship, USS Arlington, with amphibious vehicles and aircraft on board, is also joining the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf. US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar. The US said the moves were a response to a possible threat to US forces in the region by Iran, without specifying. Iran dismissed the claim as nonsense. A senior RG commander said that, if attacked, Iran could strike US forces. ""An aircraft carrier that has at least 40 to 50 planes on it and 6,000 forces gathered within it was a serious threat for us in the past but now... the threats have switched to opportunities,"" Adm Amir Ali Hajizadeh said, according to Iranian news agency Isna. ""If [the Americans] make a move we will hit them in the head,"" he said. The USS Arlington will join the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Gulf There are about 5,200 US troops currently deployed in neighbouring Iraq. Earlier this week Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the nuclear accord. It also threatened to step up uranium enrichment if it was not shielded from the sanctions' effects within 60 days. European powers said they remained committed to the Iran nuclear deal but that they ""reject any ultimatums"" from Tehran to prevent its collapse.

The interview coincides with the 20th anniversaryof the reconvening of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999,external. It was the parliament's first meeting in 292 years. Scottish parliament's electoral system: How it works,external He said said the first past the post element of the election should be scrapped and replaced, adding: ""You could have a PR system that could retain the constituencies, but possibly have two members but elected on a different basis what that would do in my view is give you a parliament that would never have an overall majority. ""That would be one box that I would gratefully tick. ""Secondly, it would mean that people would have to speak to each other."" He also said it was still to early to say whether the parliament had been a success. Mr McLeish, who led a Labour-Lib Dem executive in the parliament's first session, said that Holyrood has barely come of age. He added: ""It's in its infancy... In the stock of things, Westminster has been on that site in some form for nearly 1,000 years - we're just on the foothills of building a new Scotland, a new parliament, so in that sense I think there is a great opportunity to reflect seriously and then look forward.""

Itâs been an incredible title race and both teams have done it the proper way - playing entertaining and exciting football and scoring a lot of goals. Even with the pressure that both of them have been under for the past few weeks, they have not changed the way they played.

"Farage: May deceiving public over dealTheresa May's proposed Brexit deal is a ""new European treaty"", the Brexit Party leader says.UK Politics","Andrew Marr quizzes Nigel Farage, leader of the newly-established Brexit Party Nigel Farage has accused Theresa May of ""wilfully deceiving"" people over her negotiated EU deal. The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr the PM's proposed Brexit deal was a ""new European treaty"". In a tense interview, Mr Farage said he would demand his party became part of the government negotiating team if it was successful in the forthcoming European elections. Elections to the European Parliament take place on 23 May. Asked why he did not advocate a no-deal Brexit at the time of the EU referendum in 2016, Mr Farage said: ""Because it was obvious that we could do a free trade deal. Allow Twitter content?

""The problem is the prime minister never asked for it, so we finished up in the mess that we're in,"" he said. ""She chose to go for this close and special partnership. Basically right from the start she was happy for us to be kept very close to the customs union. ""So where we are now, the only way the democratic will of the people can be delivered is to leave on a WTO (World Trade Organization) deal."" Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party European elections 'ultimate protest vote' The interview on the BBC programme also saw Mr Farage asked about past comments on NHS privatisation, climate change, gun control, immigration and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Responding angrily to the line of questioning, he said: ""This is absolutely ludicrous, I've never in my life seen a more ridiculous interview than this. ""You're in denial, the BBC is in denial, the Tory and Labour parties are in denial. ""I think you're all in for a bigger surprise on Thursday week [the EU elections] than you can even imagine.""

Mr Farage's fellow guests on the Marr programme included Education Secretary Damian Hinds, who said the European Parliament elections would be seen by some people as a protest vote. ""For some people this is the ultimate protest vote opportunity. Actually, ironically this is, in a sense, for some people, this is the second referendum,"" he said. Mr Farage said he believed that if there was a second referendum, the campaign to leave the EU would win by a bigger margin. He said he was ""mentally preparing myself for one"", adding: ""I'm thinking we may well have it forced upon us."" Lib Dem deputy leader and People's Vote supporter Jo Swinson said Mr Farage had refused to ""own up to well-documented and abhorrent views on NHS privatisation, his admiration for Vladimir Putin and his denial of the facts about climate change"". She said: ""Despite his claims to the contrary, everyone remembers that he promised in 2016 that there would be an amazing cost-free Brexit deal available to Britain if we voted to leave the EU. ""To say today that he always advocated 'no deal' is a mark of just how shameless he is, and how little he cares for the jobs and livelihoods of the people of this country.""

Premier League final day: Man City & Liverpool fight for title,"Man City beat Brighton 4-1 - end season on 98 points City first team to win back-to-back Premier League titles since 2009 Mane scores twice for Liverpool, who end a point and place behind City Eight other games - Cardiff win 2-0 at Man Utd, eight goals at Palace Spurs and Everton share four goals, Newcastle and West Ham hit four Tom Rostance, Shamoon Hafez and Gary Rose The end of another captivating, compelling and at times cruel Premier League season. Manchester City are champions for the second season in a row. Liverpool are runners-up despite a gargantuan points haul of 97 points... You can read the Manchester City match reporthere. And the Liverpool onehere. The best reaction is below. See you all next season! Brighton 1-4 Manchester City Manchester City  Manchester City are champions Manchester City Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports:""We have to say congratulations to Liverpool and thank you so much, they pushed us to increase our standards. ""It's incredible, 98 points, to go back-to-back. We made the standard higher last season and Liverpool helped us. To win this title we had to win 14 (league games) in a row. We couldn't lose one point. ""It's the toughest title we have won in all my career, by far."" Liverpool 2-0 Wolves Liverpool Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport:""Congratulations to Manchester City. We tried everything to
make it as difficult as possible but not difficult enough. I couldnât be more proud of
the boys. ""Itâs incredible what they did all season and today was a strange
situation. We were really good until 1-0, what happened then was clear. You canât
tell the people to calm down. At that moment [when Liverpool fans celebrated Brighton's goal] it was a shock for everyone and
Wolves were there. We had to fight. In the end we scored two and kept a clean
sheet. Itâs nice but not how we wanted it. ""Itâs clear we had to work hard and City
too. Our target during the week was to get 97 points, we got that â thatâs special. We want
to write our own history and we did. Today feels not so good but we have
plenty of time to prepare for an important game in three weeks."" Liverpool 2-0 Wolves Liverpool Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold:""Iâm gutted, it is a tough one to take but City proved they
are one of the best teams in the world. We only lost one game and you expect to
win the league, but it is what it is and we go again next year."" Ian WrightMatch of the Day pundit Manchester City are one of the best teams we have ever seen in the Premier League, and Liverpool have run them close. Itâs been an incredible title race and both teams have done it the proper way - playing entertaining and exciting football and scoring a lot of goals. Even with the pressure that both of them have been under for the past few weeks, they have not changed the way they played. Both of them coped with that pressure extremely well, it is just City coped with it a tiny bit better. Ian joins Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker on the final Match of the Day of the season at 22:30 BST on BBC One and the BBC Sport website. Alan ShearerMatch of the Day pundit Well done Manchester City. Champions again, and what an incredible effort to retain their title. But well done to Liverpool too. What a great season they have had and, with the Champions League final to come, it is not over yet. Watch how the final day unfolded on Match of the Day at 22:30 BST on BBC One and the BBC Sport website. Man Utd 0-2 Cardiff Manchester United Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer:""Today was not the problem, you can have all the possession and chances you want but we concede easy goals and not score at the other. That is not where our challenge lies, we have a long and hard way to be where we want to be. ""Mason Greenwood was brilliant, he was our best player by a mile and that says a lot about the kid. He came into the team with a lack of confidence and you can see that has take a total. Not surprised by his performance, we know he is capable of that. ""It will take some time to close in on the top, we finished five or six points behind third, fourth, fifth and that has to be our aim. The top two teams have set a standard higher than before and we have to take up the next challenge. ""The work starts now, everyone has the summer off but we have to come back with a different  mentality and different attitude of being a Man United team. ""The ones who played, did well but it was not good enough."" Leicester 0-0 Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri speaking to Sky Sports: ""Eden [Hazard] was tired today so he was on the bench. We tried to win with him later on in the last 25 minutes. I think Eden has played here in Chelsea for seven seasons, trying in every match to do his best and now it's time to respect his decision, but I hope he will remain with us. ""The season is good. We were in trouble two or three months ago but third place is a very good result. Now we have to go to Baku for the Europa League final and we have the chance for our season to be wonderful."" On playing a friendly in the United States in midweek: ""It's a double feeling. I'm happy because we go there for a good reason. As a coach I am worried because we are tired and need to rest."" Brighton in the market for a striker? Brighton 1-4 Manchester City Brighton & Hove Albion Brighton manager Chris Hughton, speaking to Sky Sports:""All I wanted was for us to put in a performance but it's the margins and quality that make the difference for us. ""We needed to hold it at 1-0 for longer but it's difficult with the quality that they've got. I'm proud of the performance. ""Bruno is not just a great captain but it takes real dedication to the cause to get himself in shape at 38 years old. He's a fantastic person and that's why he's held in such high esteem by everyone at the club. ""The next step is to learn from the disappointment we had this season. We need to score more goals - that's the biggest and the hardest area."" Manchester City are champions Liverpool Liverpool became the first team
     in top-flight history to win as many as 30 games and 97 points in a season
     and not win the title. No side has ever previously
     lost just one game in a top-flight season and not won the title â the
     previous record was also held by Liverpool in the 2008-09 season (two
     defeats, finished 2nd). Liverpoolâs tally of 97 points
     would have been enough to win the Premier League in all but one of the
     previous 26 seasons of the competition (2017-18). Man
     Cityâs David Silva has provided 18 assists for Sergio Aguero in the Premier
     League â only three players have ever assisted another for more goals in
     the competition (Frank Lampard to Didier Drogba, Darren Anderton to Teddy
     Sheringham and Steve McManaman to Robbie Fowler). Manchester City are champions Manchester City Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling, speaking to Sky Sports:""I'm just delighted, this is exactly what I came to the club for, to win trophies and be in these moments. ""The manager here, his mentality is the best. It's always about winning. It's the way he sets us up. I'm happy to be here learning and winning. ""As a manager, he's got multiple players in each position challenging each other. No one is comfortable here but everyone is ready to take their chance - like Riyad today. He's not played much recently but I knew he was going to score today. ""It's been a lovely season after a difficult World Cup. Hopefully I can go one better next year."" Watford 1-4 West Ham West Ham United Michail Antonio speaking to Sky Sports: ""What an unbelievable goal from Mark Noble today. Heâs the slowest
man alive but he's shaped and found the bottom corner. ""We're really pleased for the fans as we wanted to finish on a high so we could take it into next season."" Burnley 1-3 Arsenal Arsenal Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang:""I share this trophy with two other guys I like, great players and African, we
are representing Africa, thatâs cool."" Aubameyang, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah all end the season with 22 Premier League goals This was the eighth time the
     Premier League title has been decided on the final day of the season, with
     Manchester City winning it on three of those occasions (2011-12, 2013-14
     and 2018-19). Tottenham 2-2 Everton Everton Everton manager Marco Silva speaking to BBC Match of the Day:""We started in a bad way, I didn't like the first 20 minutes but then we showed our quality. It was a good point but I felt we could do better. ""We reacted really good, finishing in a good spot in the first half and scored twice - unfortunately they scored a very good goal."" On closing the gap to the top-six:""To be a top-six club in this country now is really tough. Our fans deserve it but we must be realistic for our team. If they have a different budget we must work hard and do everything perfectly. We will try, our job is to work really hard every day and improve what we did the season before. ""I have no doubts we are a stronger team than at the start of the season."" Burnley 1-2 Arsenal Burnley Burnley boss Sean Dyche:""I was pleased with today's performance but the cutting edge was lacking. ""I have been proud of the players all season. The way they have taken on the second-half of the season. They were under duress around Christmas, the noise outside the camp was people saying we were finished, but the way they have seen through that concentrated and focused on the challenge in front has been magnificent. ""I knew it would be a tough season with the Europe league, coming
off the back of a good season. Itâs a restart each season and we grow again as a side,
we have done that in different ways this season."" Manchester City are champions Manchester City Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports:""We have to say congratulations to Liverpool and thank you so much, they pushed us to increase our standards. ""It's incredible, 98 points, to go back-to-back. We made the standard higher last season and Liverpool helped us. To win this title we had to win 14 (league games) in a row.

"Metro Bank cash injection talks 'advanced'The bank says plans to raise ÃÂ£350m are ""well advanced"" as it tries to quell rumours about its financial health.Business","Metro Bank chair Vernon Hill, pictured with dog Duffy, founded the bank in 2010 Metro Bank has said its plans to raise Â£350m to strengthen its finances are ""well advanced"" as it tries to quell questions over its financial health. The bank's shares have plummeted around 75% since January whenit announced it needed the moneyto boost its capital after an accounting error. Reports have suggested the bank was struggling to raise the cash. But Metro Bank said it was now in ""final discussions"" with shareholders and new investors over its plans. ""Feedback continues to be positive,"" it added. The bank - which has 67 branches in London and the South East - said it expected to raise the cash by the end of June. It said it would raise the money via a share placing, with additional shares created and offered to new and existing investors. Shares in Metro Bank tumble â again Financial sharks circling Metro Bank The American taking on British banks The bank revealed in January that it had underestimated the risk level of some of its commercial loans, meaning it didn't have the required shock-absorbing capital it needed to support a number of its business loans. The funds it raises via its new share placing are aimed at making up for the shortfall. The bank said the share sale had been underwritten by the banks arranging the sale. In a separate move, Metro Bank is also considering selling the commercial loans affected by the accounting error. Chief executive Craig Donaldsontold the Financial Times it was an option,external, but stressed the bank had not made a final decision. Metro Bank opened its first branch in London's Holborn in 2010 in the wake of the financial crisis It was the first High Street bank to open in the UK in more than 100 years It is one of so-called challenger banks to the big High Street names, and opens seven days a week Founder Vernon Hill shook up the US banking scene in 1973 when, aged 26, he founded Commerce Bank with one branch When he sold Commerce Bank in 2007 for $8.5bn, it had 440 branches Metro Bank has been under close supervision by regulator the Prudential Regulation Authority after the capital miscalculation. The issue has also weighed heavily on its performance, with itsrecent results for the first three months,externalof the year showing a sharp drop in pre-tax profit to Â£6.9m from Â£10m for the same period a year ago. Chief executive Craig Donaldson said ""adverse sentiment"" has also impacted deposit growth, but said that 2019 would be ""a year of transition"" for the bank. The bank was founded in 2010 by American Vernon Hill, becoming Britain's first new High Street bank for over 100 years. Its unusual focus, in a world where most banks are drastically cutting back on branches, has been on building physical branches,  which open earlier and longer than any of their rivals.

Drugs firms 'conspired to fix prices' in USTwenty pharmaceutical companies are accused of artificially inflating the cost of medicinal drugs.US & Canada,"A lawsuit alleges that more than 100 generic drugs were included in a price-fixing scheme More than 40 US states have filed a lawsuit accusing pharmaceutical firms of conspiring to artificially inflate the cost of common medicinal drugs. The lawsuit alleges that as many as 20 companies have been involved in fixing prices for over 100 drugs, including treatments for diabetes and cancer. One of the firms accused is Teva Pharmaceuticals, the world's largest producer of generic medicine. Teva, which has denied any wrongdoing, says it will defend its actions. The legal action, which follows a five-year investigation, accuses drugs companies of involvement in a scheme to boost prices - in some cases by more than 1,000% - and was filed on Friday by Connecticut Attorney General William Tong. ""We have hard evidence that shows the generic drug industry perpetrated a multi-billion dollar fraud on the American people,"" Mr Tong said. ""We have emails, text messages, telephone records and former company insiders that we believe will prove a multi-year conspiracy to fix prices and divide market share for huge numbers of generic drugs."" A representative of Teva in the US said that the Israeli company ""has not engaged in any conduct that would lead to civil or criminal liability"", Reuters news agency reports. The other 19 firms implicated in the lawsuit have yet to comment on the allegations. Fifteen individuals were also named as defendants accused of overseeing the price-fixing scheme on a day-to-day basis. The human cost of insulin in America The little-known safety net of US healthcare According to the lawsuit, the drugs companies allegedly conspired to manipulate prices on dozens of medicines between July 2013 and January 2015. It accuses Teva and others of ""embarking on one of the most egregious and damaging price-fixing conspiracies in the history of the United States"". Mr Tong said the investigation had exposed why the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs was so high in the US. America's healthcare system has been at the forefront of US politics for years. President Donald Trump has frequently promised to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market. States have argued that eliminating Obamacare would harm millions of Americans who would struggle to meet the costs of medical care.

     in top-flight history to win as many as 30 games and 97 points in a season
     and not win the title. No side has ever previously
     lost just one game in a top-flight season and not won the title â the
     previous record was also held by Liverpool in the 2008-09 season (two
     defeats, finished 2nd). Liverpoolâs tally of 97 points
     would have been enough to win the Premier League in all but one of the
     previous 26 seasons of the competition (2017-18). Man
     Cityâs David Silva has provided 18 assists for Sergio Aguero in the Premier
     League â only three players have ever assisted another for more goals in
     the competition (Frank Lampard to Didier Drogba, Darren Anderton to Teddy
     Sheringham and Steve McManaman to Robbie Fowler).

Ian WrightMatch of the Day pundit Manchester City are one of the best teams we have ever seen in the Premier League, and Liverpool have run them close. Itâs been an incredible title race and both teams have done it the proper way - playing entertaining and exciting football and scoring a lot of goals. Even with the pressure that both of them have been under for the past few weeks, they have not changed the way they played. Both of them coped with that pressure extremely well, it is just City coped with it a tiny bit better. Ian joins Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker on the final Match of the Day of the season at 22:30 BST on BBC One and the BBC Sport website. Alan ShearerMatch of the Day pundit Well done Manchester City.

That is not where our challenge lies, we have a long and hard way to be where we want to be. ""Mason Greenwood was brilliant, he was our best player by a mile and that says a lot about the kid. He came into the team with a lack of confidence and you can see that has take a total. Not surprised by his performance, we know he is capable of that. ""It will take some time to close in on the top, we finished five or six points behind third, fourth, fifth and that has to be our aim. The top two teams have set a standard higher than before and we have to take up the next challenge.

Pakistan hotel attack gunmen shot dead,"The Pearl Continental Hotel is popular among foreign visitors Three gunmen who stormed a five-star hotel in the restive Pakistani province of Balochistan, killing at least one guard, have been shot dead by security forces, officials say. The attack and subsequent siege, which targeted the Zaver Pearl-Continental Hotel in the strategic port city of Gwadar, lasted several hours. A hotel spokesman said there were no guests and few staff due to Ramadan. The separatist Balochistan Liberation Army said it carried out the attack. The group said that the hotel, the centrepiece of a multi-billion-dollar Chinese project, was selected in order to target Chinese and other investors. Militants in Balochistan oppose Chinese investment, saying it is of little benefit to local people. The gunmen stormed the hotel, usually popular with top government officials and foreign visitors, at around 16:50 local time (11:50 GMT), killing at least one security guard who tried to stop them at the entrance. Security forces entered the hotel and took part in a gun battle with the militants, before cornering them in a staircase leading to the top floor, officials said. Can Pakistan stamp out extremism? Pakistan country profile Due to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the hotel had no guests and a very limited number of staff, a Zaver Pearl-Continental spokesperson told the BBC. However, earlier reports suggested that hotel guests had been evacuated safely. This video can not be played Fishermen say they are no longer allowed to fish near the port The hotel sits on a hilltop overlooking the Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea, which is being developed by China as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a network of roads, railway and pipelines between the two countries. On Twitter,the Chinese embassy in Pakistan condemned the attack,,externalwhich comes just weeks after gunmen killed 14 people, including 11 military personnel, in the region. Gwadar is a city with a heavy military presence. It is viewed by both Chinese and Pakistani officials as the lynchpin of the CPEC, aiming to connect western China with the Arabian Sea. When I visited the port city in late 2017 with other international journalists, we travelled in convoys guarded by armed escorts, and stayed in the same hotel that was targeted. This attack will therefore be seen as a worrying breach of security, and it is not the first time Chinese interests have been targeted by this militant group. Last year the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) carried out an attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi. After that attack, both Pakistani and Chinese officials stressed that violence would not derail their close co-operation. But militant activity in Balochistan remains one of the major concerns about the viability of the CPEC project. Home to a long-running insurgency, Balochistan is Pakistan's poorest and least developed province. It shares a large, porous border with Afghanistan and Iran. Its economy is dominated by natural resources, particularly natural gas, and is being transformed by major Chinese infrastructure projects on the CPEC, part of the ambitious Belt and Road initiative. Several militant groups operate in the region, including the Pakistani Taliban, the BLA and the Sunni Muslim extremist group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.

Former FM wants fully proportional electionsHenry McLeish believes scrapping constituency seats would force parties to work together at Holyrood.Scotland politics,"Henry McLeish is calling for first past the post voting system used to elect most MSPs to be replaced A former first minister is calling for first past the post voting system used to elect most MSPs to be replaced with proportional representation (PR). Henry McLeish, who was first minister between 2000 and 2001, toldGood Morning Scotlandhe believes PR would force parties to work together. The interview coincides with the 20th anniversaryof the reconvening of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999,external. It was the parliament's first meeting in 292 years. Scottish parliament's electoral system: How it works,external He said said the first past the post element of the election should be scrapped and replaced, adding: ""You could have a PR system that could retain the constituencies, but possibly have two members but elected on a different basis what that would do in my view is give you a parliament that would never have an overall majority. ""That would be one box that I would gratefully tick. ""Secondly, it would mean that people would have to speak to each other."" He also said it was still to early to say whether the parliament had been a success. Mr McLeish, who led a Labour-Lib Dem executive in the parliament's first session, said that Holyrood has barely come of age. He added: ""It's in its infancy... In the stock of things, Westminster has been on that site in some form for nearly 1,000 years - we're just on the foothills of building a new Scotland, a new parliament, so in that sense I think there is a great opportunity to reflect seriously and then look forward.""
