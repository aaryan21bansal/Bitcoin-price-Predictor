More mental health help for new mothers unveiled,"Mental health ""hubs"" for new, expectant or bereaved mothers are to be set up around England. The 26 sites, due to be opened by next April, will offer physical health checks and psychological therapy in one building. NHS England said these centres would provide treatment for about 6,000 new parents in the first year. Five years ago, 40% of areas in England had no dedicated maternal mental health services. Things have improved since then with some specialist services available in each of the 44 local NHS areas in England. But in the NHS's Long Term Plan, published in 2019, the health service pledged to offer more ""evidence-based"" support, including to partners and families through these hubs or ""outreach clinics"". The NHS hopes to offer services to people with moderate-to-severe difficulties, whereas earlier investment focused on the most acutely unwell mothers. Are new mums getting the help they need? These clinics will ""integrate maternity, reproductive health and psychological therapy for women experiencing mental health difficulties directly arising from, or related to, the maternity experience,"" NHS England said. 'It's our job to keep mothers and babies safe' New mums ask hospitals for more pregnancy support One of the new sites, in Devon, opened in January this year. Lizzie, who experienced low mood and nightmares during her pregnancy having previously suffered a miscarriage, was referred to the service for some support. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and offered a therapy called Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), which is designed to help people cope with distressing memories. After the treatment and having had her baby girl Enfys, Lizzie said: ""I feel unbelievably better after this pregnancy and birth compared to how I felt after my experience with my first child, when there wasn't any support available to me; even with the added distress of having a miscarriage, the pressures of Covid-19 restrictions and not being able to see my family. ""I feel happier, more confident and much better in my mental health. I feel fully recovered."" In 2019-20, more than 30,000 women were seen by specialist perinatal mental health community services. NHS England has made a commitment to offer specialist care to at least 66,000 people with mental health difficulties related to pregnancy, birth or parenthood by 2023-24. Emily Slater, CEO of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, said: ""For the more than one in 10 expectant and new mothers experiencing mental health problems, and the increased numbers as a result of the pandemic, there needs to be a system of care available to support them. ""These new services will enable more women than ever to access vital perinatal mental health care."" Help will be available from before conception - for those with pre-existing mental health conditions who want to get pregnant - until the baby's second birthday, whereas currently these services are available for the first year of a child's life. NHS England said care would be provided for a ""wide range of mental health issues from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after giving birth to others with a severe fear of childbirth,"" for 1,001 days from conception. Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, said: ""Every woman has a unique experience with pregnancy and motherhood and some will need extra support to cope with mental health issues that can range from anxiety to severe depression. ""I would encourage any mum who needs this support to come forward safe in the knowledge that her mental health and wellbeing are of paramount importance and she should not feel ashamed of accessing the help she needs."" The clinics will also train maternity staff and midwives as well as providing psychological therapies to people during pregnancy and after giving birth. The first 10 sites will open around England ""within months"", in: Birmingham & Solihull Leicestershire Northamptonshire Shropshire Telford & Wrekin South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw Lancashire and South Cumbria Hampshire and Isle of Wight Kent and Medway Cornwall Devon The rest are expected to be up and running by April 2022, with plans for all 44 local NHS areas to have one of these hubs by April 2024.

Unions attack 'miserly' rise in statutory sick pay,"Unions have criticised a 50p-per-week increase in statutory sick pay (SSP) as ""miserly"". SSP increases from Â£95.85 to Â£96.35 on Tuesday, but unions including the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Unite say it is too little to live on. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""No-one should be plunged into hardship if they need to self-isolate."" A government spokesman said there was a ""comprehensive package"" in place to support those who need to self-isolate. It also said many employers pay more than the minimum level of statutory sick pay. According to the OECD,the UK has one of the lowest statutory sick pay rates of any developed country,external, as a proportion of the average worker's earnings. However, its coverage lasts longer than in most European nations. Ms O'Grady said ""low"" SSP payments could risk ""undermining"" public health efforts as lockdowns ease across the UK. ""Many working in pubs and shops are on low wages and face having to survive on just Â£96 a week if they get sick,"" she said. Self-isolation support 'not working' in England, unions say Who has to self-isolate and for how long? The TUC is calling for the level of SSP paid to be raised in line with the National Living Wage, which stands at Â£8.91-per-hour for workers aged 23 and over. It also warned that nearly two million workers do not earn enough to qualify for SSP - most of them women. Nor are the self-employed eligible to receive it, unlike in most other European countries. Len McCluskey, Unite general secretary, said: ""Time and again the government has been told that people will not isolate without a living income. ""Unless and until the government addresses the scandalously low level of sick pay provision in this country, any scheme to reopen the economy that rests on isolation but without income is half-baked and will fail."" A government spokesman said that there was a ""comprehensive package of financial support in place for workers who need to self-isolate to help stop the spread of coronavirus"". That includes a Â£500 payment for those on the lowest incomes who have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace. ""Many employers pay more than the minimum level of statutory sick pay and employers with up to 250 staff can be reimbursed the cost of up to a fortnight's statutory sick pay.""

Editor 'told to drop negative Netanyahu stories',"Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently denied any wrongdoing The first witness in Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial has said he was told to make negative stories about the Israeli PM ""disappear"". Former Walla CEO Ilan Yeshua alleged he was also ordered by the news website's owner, Shaul Elovitch, to post content that attacked Mr Netanyahu's rivals. Prosecutors said Mr Netanyahu made regulatory decisions worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Mr Elovitch in return for favourable coverage. Both men have denied any wrongdoing. The prime minister, who is being tried on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases, dismissed the hearing as a ""charade"" and accused the prosecution of a ""coup attempt"". What are the allegations against him? Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM It comes as Israel's president meets parliamentarians to ask whom they support to form the next government following last month's election. The vote failed to end the long period of political stalemate that has led to four elections in two years, leaving both Mr Netanyahu's right-wing bloc and the parties opposed to him short of a majority. President Reuven Rivlin will consult party leaders this week, then nominate who he thinks has the best chance of forming a new coalition government. He has been indicted in three cases, known as 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000: Case 1,000- Fraud and breach of trust: he is accused of receiving gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours Case 2,000- Fraud and breach of trust: Mr Netanyahu is accused of offering to help improve the circulation of Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot in exchange for positive coverage Case 4,000- Bribery, fraud and breach of trust: As PM and minister of communications at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Netanyahu is accused of promoting regulatory decisions favourable to Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder in Israeli telecom giant Bezeq, in exchange for positive coverage by Mr Elovitch's Walla news site Mr Netanyahu has denied all the charges against him, branding them a ""witch-hunt"" by his political opponents, and has vowed to clear his name. This video can not be played November 2019 - Benjamin Netanyahu rails against corruption charges Dozens of Netanyahu supporters and protesters demanding his removal from office gathered outside the Jerusalem District Court as the prime minister arrived for the start of the trial's evidentiary stage. Mr Netanyahu sat with his lawyers as lead prosecutor Liat Ben Ari delivered her opening statement, describing what she called a ""substantial and serious case involving government corruption"". She alleged the prime minister made ""improper use of the major government power placed in him to demand and obtain improper benefits from the owners of major Israeli media outlets to advance his personal interests"". ""The relationship between Netanyahu and the defendants became currency, something that could be traded,"" she told the three-judge panel. ""This currency could distort a public servant's judgment."" Protesters demanding Mr Netanyahu's resignation were outside the court on Monday Afterwards, Mr Netanyahu was allowed to leave the courtroom and Mr Yeshua took the stand. The former Walla CEO's testimony is seen as key to Case 4,000, the most serious against the prime minister because it involves the bribery charge. He told the court that in late 2012 he began to receive requests from Mr Elovitch ""to make negative articles about the prime minister and his wife disappear and post articles that benefit them"". There were also ""requests to post articles against various people who were against the prime minister"", he said, including Naftali Bennett, a former protÃ©gÃ© of Mr Netanyahu who served in his cabinet from 2013 to 2020. Mr Yeshua testified that there were times when he was instructed to take down a story immediately ""because this week [Mr Netanyahu] has to sign something for me"". ""How much can you lie?"" Mr Elovitch's wife, Iris, shouted as Mr Yeshua spoke. Supporters of the prime minister also held a raucous demonstration Mr and Mrs Elovitch have been charged with bribery and obstruction of justice in connection with Case 4,000. They have denied wrongdoing. Mr Netanyahu has insisted he received nothing from Mr Elovitch and that Walla's coverage of him was negative. He has said experts supported the regulatory decisions he made, which prosecutors allege were of substantial financial value to Mr Elovitch. Several hours after Monday's hearing ended, Mr Netanyahu denounced as ""hypocrisy"" the prosecution's claim that he abused his powers. ""The entire proceeding against me was an abuse of the destructive power the prosecution holds,"" he told a news conference. ""This is how you try to topple a strong prime minister from the right wing,"" he added. ""This is what a coup attempt looks like."" He is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise, and there is currently no legal barrier to him staying in office as prime minister. And even if convicted, Mr Netanyahu would not be required to step down until the appeals process is exhausted - something that could take years. A former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stepped down as his party's leader when he was under investigation for corruption in 2008 but technically remained in office until elections the following year - polls which brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power. Mr Olmert was eventually convicted of bribery, fraud, obstruction of justice and breach of trust in connection with several cases. He served 16 months of a 27-month prison sentence.

Taiwan train crash: 'Can you let me hug her again?',"Family members mourned their loved ones at the Taiwan crash site over the weekend From a father cradling the motionless body of his six-year-old daughter, to a woman who lost her entire family, Taiwanese media has been dominated by the heartbreaking stories of survivors of Friday's train crash. At least 50 people died and more than 200 were injured whenthe Taroko Express 408 carrying nearly 500 passengers crashed and derailedafter hitting a construction vehicle that had fallen onto the tracks. As funeral services and mourning ceremonies take place in the country, some survivors and rescuers have shared their experiences of the island's worst rail disaster in decades. Chung Hui-mei's family wasn't meant to be on the train on Friday. They had booked tickets for an earlier train that day - but had missed it. So they got standing tickets for the Taroko Express 408 - all the seats had been sold out already. The family of four had been eager to get to the town of Hualien to mark the Tomb Sweeping Festival - a traditional Chinese festival when people pay their respects to the dead. Ms Chung recalled that as the train neared their station, she heard the train conductor sound the horn. It meant he had ""known that there was a situation ahead... but he didn't slow down the train,"" she later told reporters. Seconds later - exactly 6.9 according to an investigation - the train slammed into a lorry that had slipped onto the tracks. Investigators said the train was only 250m (820ft) away from the lorry when it slid down, and that the driver - who died in the crash - would not have had time to react. Relatives of the victims mourned their loved ones in a ritual A day after the crash, relatives of victims grieved near the site where the train derailed In the immediate aftermath of the crash, Ms Chung crawled around the carriage, frantically searching for her husband and 22-year-old son under a pile of debris and suitcases. She found them - but neither was breathing. As she called out desperately for her daughter, she suddenly heard the 20-year-old girl respond weakly from under a tangled mass of metal parts: ""I'm here."" Ms Chung struggled to move the debris, but stopped when she heard another person speak up from underneath the rubble: ""Auntie, please can you stop doing that? It's hurting me."" Soon after, her daughter stopped responding and fell silent. On Friday, six-year-old kindergartener Yang Chi-chen boarded the Taroko Express 408 along with her father and nine-year-old sister. She never made it out. They were heading to the city of Taitung for a family holiday to celebrate a Children's Day holiday that weekend. The family had been sitting in the front carriage - one of three that sustained the worst damage in the crash. Mr Yang was the first of his family to be found, according to emotional accounts shared by rescuers. The 42-year-old had limped out of the carriage, and rescuer Damo Lee had been tasked with carrying him the rest of the way. Mr Lee recounted in a Facebook post that after he hoisted Mr Yang on his back, the man had weakly whispered into his ears repeatedly: ""I still have two girls on the train, please can you help get them out quickly?"" Mr Lee said he assured Mr Yang that his team would do their best, and put him somewhere safe to sit and rest. Just as the rescue worker turned back to the wreckage, he saw a colleague carrying the near-lifeless body of a young girl, whose ""limbs were limp, and who had no blood in her face"". It turned out to be Chi-chen. Mr Yang then called out: ""Can you let me hug her again?"" The rescue workers lowered the young girl's body into his arms. Mr Yang asked if he could hug his six-year-old daughter one last time Prayer events were held for victims of the train crash at a funeral parlour in Hualien The elder Yang daughter was also later found, and is now in intensive care after suffering brain trauma and a cracked skull. On Saturday, at a Taoist mourning ritual held at the accident site, Mr Yang was overcome with emotion as he spoke a little to reporters. ""We had just wanted to have a fun trip... I hope she can be my daughter again (in the next life),"" he said. Later, as family members of the victims performed the ritual and called for the souls of the dead to return home, Mr Yang was heard wailing Chi-chen's name. ""Come home to Papa!"" Li Jia-hsing and his wife had been looking forward to visiting their hometown of Taitung for a break. The couple worked in construction in northern Taiwan, and could only return home for visits during public holidays. They had been standing in the middle of the train at a spot that connected two carriages. When the train derailed, Mr Li immediately threw himself against his wife and pushed her to the side, in an apparent attempt to protect her from the impact. It worked, and she survived - but her husband did not. ""He saved me, but he couldn't save himself,"" the woman, identified by her surname Yang, later told reporters from the hospital where she was being treated for injuries. This video can not be played Watch: Rescue efforts after the train derailment Before they had set off on their journey, Mr Li had rung up his older sister, reminding her to pick them up at the station. On Saturday, at a funeral home in Hualien, Mr Li's sister told reporters that she did not think she would end up picking up his remains instead. Calling out to her brother in a mourning ritual, she said: ""Your sister has come to take you home."" Other stories that caught the attention of local media included a mysterious woman dubbed ""Olaf Girl"". The woman was among family members of victims who gathered at a Hualien funeral home over the weekend. She was seen quietly clutching an oversized stuffed toy - Olaf, the snowman from the Disney animated movie Frozen. She declined interviews, but media reports later said the toy had been a Valentine's Day gift from her fiancÃ©, Su Yu-ming, who had died in the crash. Mr Su's family members told reporters that the couple had been dating for around three years, and were due to get married next month. The woman was seen clutching an oversized Olaf Meanwhile an emotional tribute by a Red Cross volunteer surnamed Zeng to the victims - some of whom he pulled out of the wreckage - has also gone viral. ""To the curly-haired girl, listen to what Big Brother told you. Everything's okay now, you can close your eyes,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. ""I don't know your names,"" he continued, addressing other victims. ""But I hope you can peacefully leave now, we've rescued everyone from the site. ""Don't think too much, we'll take care of things. I pray you have a good journey.""

'Disappointed' travel chiefs seek clarity from PM,"This video can not be played The prime minister said international travel from 17 May was ""hopeful"" Leading travel industry figures have reacted with dismay to Boris Johnson's latest comments on the lockdown roadmap, saying they need more clarity. The prime minister said he was ""hopeful"" that foreign travel could begin again on 17 May. But he said more data was needed before a firm decision could be taken. The Business Travel Association said the announcement was ""beyond disappointing"" and called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"". Its chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had ""once again been kicked down the road"". ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,"" he added. In a Downing Street briefing on Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to await a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April. Mr Wratten called on the government to be ""confident in its roadmap"", adding: ""This is our last resort."" England's lockdown to ease as planned on 12 April What are the UK plans for Covid passports? Other travel industry bodies expressed similar discontent as they await further details of arisk-based ""traffic light"" system for foreign travel,due to be published later this week. Under the system, no isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from ""green"" countries - although pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: ""Whilst we support the establishment of a framework for restarting international travel and welcome the removal of self-isolation for arrivals from 'green countries', today's announcement does not provide the clarity we were seeking on the roadmap back towards normality. ""We await further details, but the measures indicated, including the potential for multiple tests for travellers even from 'green countries', will prevent meaningful travel even to low-risk destinations."" Mark Tanzer, chief executive of the Abta travel association, welcomed the traffic light system, but said: ""We need to see the details in the Global Travel Taskforce report before this can be assessed fully."" He added: ""It is vital that the government clarifies how the transition between green, amber and red levels will work, both to help travel businesses plan ahead and to provide reassurance for travellers. ""Destinations should not be suddenly closed off unless variants of concern dictate that this must happen."" The chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee, said she was ""disappointed"" that the prime minister ""continues to suggest significant barriers to international travel and may push back the date of restart beyond 17 May"". She said a ""risk-based, proportionate system"" could ""open up aviation without quarantine and with affordable, rapid testing"".

New curriculum 'must be delayed' in Covid's wake,"The new curriculum, due to be implemented in 2022, will be the biggest shake-up in 30 years of Wales' education system Rollout of a new school curriculum in Wales must be delayed so teachers can focus on helping pupils in the wake of the pandemic, a union has warned. Changes are set to be introduced in 2022 for all children currently in year three or below. However, the NASUWT said it must be pushed back to enable teachers to help pupils get back on track, otherwise the curriculum's success will be at risk. The Welsh government said curriculum reform remained a ""priority"". The changes represent the first complete reform of the curriculum in Wales in more than 30 years. Schools will be required to deliver areas of learning, although detailed plans for exactly what schools should be teaching has not yet been issued. Six areas of learning and experience 1Maths and numeracy 2Languages, literacy and communication 3Health and well-being 4Humanities 5Science and technology 6Expressive arts Changes mean schools will be required to teach lifesaving skills and first aid, while the teaching ofthe histories of Black and Asian and Minority Ethnic communities will be mandatory. However, ahead of its annual conference, teaching union the NASUWT said ministers' decision to ""forge ahead"" with its plans to introduce the curriculum in 2022 despite the Covid pandemic, will ""put its success at risk"". Some pupils returned to classrooms before the Easter break, but all children are set to return on 12 April, after months of home schooling. 'All pupils should get free school meals' Coronavirus, schools and children - what are the risks? Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said teachers now needed to have time to get pupils used to being back, before changes were made. ""These are landmark reforms which will have a profound and lasting impact on the futures of a generation of children and young people,"" he said. ""It is therefore absolutely vital that these changes are introduced in a way which commands the confidence of teachers, pupils and parents. ""The Welsh government must give teachers sufficient time, training and resources to ensure the introduction of the new curriculum runs smoothly."" The government said curriculum reform ""remained a key priority"" and ""must continue"". A national continuity plan has been published in response to Covid-19 that was ""closely aligned"" with the new curriculum, in order to support pupils' wellbeing, knowledge and skills, a spokesperson said. ""We are providing record levels of investment in staff professional learning to further support schools as they prepare for the introduction of the new curriculum in 2022,"" they said. Plaid Cymru said while the new curriculum had ""great potential"" it would not succeed without the right investment and resources. ""We need to listen to the very valid concerns raised by teachers, unions and school staff,"" the party's Sian Gwenllian said. While leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said: ""The new curriculum will play a key role in our path to recovery. ""There is significant momentum for change and we should collectively grip this to support learners as the curriculum starts to be implemented from 2022."" The Welsh Conservatives said they would postpone the introduction of the new curriculum until September 2023, if voted into government after the 6 May election. ""This would help teachers and pupils to catch up from a year of lost learning, before having to take on the enormous challenge of a implementing a new curriculum,"" they said. Lifesaving skills to be taught in all schools Black history to be mandatory in Welsh schools New plan for how children will be taught revealed Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

England's lockdown to ease as planned on 12 April,"This video can not be played PM: some lockdown restrictions to be eased from 12 April Pubs and restaurants serving outside can reopen as planned next Monday, along with non-essential shops, gyms and hairdressers, as England's lockdown is further eased, the PM has said. But Boris Johnson urged caution, saying: ""We can't be complacent."" Officials were examining the potential role of Covid status certificates, he told a Downing Street briefing. Pilot eventswill take place from mid-April to trial the system, with later events checking vaccinations. Speaking in Downing Street, the prime minister also said the government was ""hopeful"" international travel could resume in the next stage of lockdown easing on 17 May, but cautioned against the effects of the surge of coronavirus in other parts of the world. He said the government would set out ""well before 17 May what is reasonable"" and aim to give the aviation industry ""as much notice as possible"". What can I do from 12 April? What is the new traffic light system for holidays? What's happening with pools, haircuts and pubs? Hairdressers and homeware shops reopen in Scotland It comes as the government has publishedan update on a series of reviews,externalinto Covid certificates, the safe return of mass events, international travel and social distancing rules. In the document, the government says it cannot yet confirm international travel can resume on 17 May ""given the state of the pandemic abroad"", and advises people not to book summer holidays abroad ""until the picture is clearer"". It also confirms further details on a risk-based ""traffic light"" system for foreign travel will be published in a report later this week. On Covid status certification, the paper says this could have an important role to play both domestically and internationally and ""is likely to become a feature of our lives"" while the pandemic continues. A certification scheme could record whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity. The NHS is working on digital and non-digital ways for individuals to demonstrate their Covid status, according to the government paper, but there were no details on whether this might include using an app. More than 40 Conservative MPs havesigned a cross-party letteropposing the use of vaccine passports for access to jobs or services, with critics calling such a move ""discriminatory"". The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said vaccine passports had managed to ""achieve the remarkable political feat of uniting a former Labour leader and a former Conservative leader against them"", as he asked the prime minister if there would be a vote in Parliament on their introduction. Mr Johnson said the question of a Commons vote was ""taking too many fences at once"", and that the government needs to work out its proposal. He stressed that certification would not be introduced either for the 12 April lockdown easing or for the planned further changes from 17 May that would see pubs and restaurants serving customers indoors. But he said ""all countries"" were looking at vaccination status for international travel, adding: ""I do think that's going to be part of the way people deal with it and we need to think about that."" The government's review said that public transport and essential shops and services would never require Covid status certification, but it could play a role in allowing people to return to theatres, nightclubs, and events such as festivals or sports fixtures. It is also possible that requiring customers to prove their status could ""play a role in reducing social distancing requirements in other settings"" such as pubs and restaurants, the document states. The government said this would be considered in consultation with the industry, and that businesses should continue to plan to reopen in line with the latest guidance. Labour has backed the move to proceed as planned on 12 April, but shadow health minister Justin Madders told the BBC the party had concerns about how vaccine passports could affect ""liberties and freedoms"". Meanwhile, Tory former chief whip Mark Harper, leader of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptics, has called for Parliament to be given a vote on vaccine passports, warning they would lead to a ""two-tier Britain"". And the Confederation of British Industry said firms would need help to navigate ""ethical, legal and practical implementation challenges"" around status certificates. This video can not be played The prime minister said international from 17 May was ""hopeful"" The further easing of lockdown was expected given the data is perhaps as positive as it possibly could be. Hospital admissions and deaths have fallen sharply. Even infection rates - that some warned would start rising quickly with the reopening of schools - have continued to drop. With the vaccination programme going well, the UK is certainly in a strong position compared to most. What's more, the steps being taken from 12 April are not considered particularly high risk. It's the return of indoor mixing in May that is more of a worry - and then how to allow foreign travel and big events like live sport and music concerts. The prime minister was careful not to make any promises on these. Government modelling suggests a resurgence of hospital cases and deaths is still ""highly likely"" in the future. That's because the vaccine does not work for everyone and not all those in the at-risk groups have come forward for a jab. There's good reason to believe this resurgence will be limited - perhaps no worse than a bad flu season - but it's the possibility it could be much worse that is causing the concern. Speaking alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson said the decision to proceed with the rule changes was ""fully justified by the data"". He said the government could see nothing in the present data to make it deviate from its roadmap, with ""things still seem set fair"" for the next step along on 17 May. But he added: ""We can't be complacent, we can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries."" Hospitality venues can serve food and alcohol to customers sitting outdoors, with no curfew Spas can reopen, as can zoos, theme parks, drive-in cinemas and drive-in performances events Members of the same household can take a holiday in England in self-contained accommodation Public buildings such as libraries and community centres will also reopen Close-contact services such as beauty and nail salons can reopen Weddings attended by up to 15 people can take place The number of care home visitors will also increase to two per resident Mr Johnson encouraged people to use free NHS tests, as everyone in England is to be given access totwo rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday. Meanwhile, Prof Whitty warned ""this virus will be with us for the foreseeable future"", and Sir Patrick suggested the pandemic could result in long-term changes in behaviour. Separately, the government's scientific advisers have said the next phase of unlocking is ""highly unlikely"" to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. However, later steps such as indoor mixing are ""highly likely"" to lead to a resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths, SPI-M - a subgroup of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - has predicted.

Would a vaccine passport app work?,"There is speculation the NHS app could be amended to include a Covid vaccine certificate As the UK gets closer to easing its coronavirus lockdowns, attention is turning to how we might safely mix again and what role tech might play. And despiteprevious denialsthat a ""Covid passport"" app was being considered, it is now on the agenda. After all the hoo-ha and costs involved in creating the contact-tracing apps last year, you might think that a very brave decision. But earlier this weekThe Times reported,externalthat the facility would be built into the existing NHS app used to access health services in England. It is distinct from the NHS Covid-19 app used by England and Wales to warn people if they might have recently been infected, and fewer people have downloaded it. But according to Google's own figures, it has been installed on more than one million Android devices (Apple does not share stats for iOS), which represents a decent start. Officially, Downing Street says the matter is still under review and it does not want to pre-empt anything by speculating on the subject. But it's clear there would be several benefits. Firstly, the NHS app, which serves patients in England only, already links up to users' GP services to give smartphone owners access to their medical records. In fact, it can already provide a record of whether some people have been given one of the coronavirus jabs, if the GP surgeries involved have shared the information. (Confusingly, this sometimes appears under the Medicines tab rather than the Immunisations one if you've had an injection and want to check yourself). So health chiefs would not need to build new IT infrastructure to get at the information. There is a risk countries develop Covid passports that rely on local systems that do not intercommunicate Secondly, the app has already tackled many of the security issues involved. To set it up you must provide your NHS number, email address, phone number and then upload either an image of your passport or driving licence. The smartphone then takes a scan of your face to check it matches the characteristics on the image on your official identification. And then, as a supplement to the automated checks, a human review takes place before you are granted access. However, there are still issues to be addressed. People would need to get to the certificate without having to hunt around several menus - possibly via a button at the bottom of the screen. And then the information would have to be presented in a format that someone else could verify quickly and easily. Another health pass app points the way to how that might be done. Tested.me displays a scannable barcode over an image of the user's face to provide employers with a means of keeping track of the health status of their staff. Of course, if the NHS app adopts a similar scheme, it will require other software to be developed so that establishments can verify a person's barcode when they present it. Tested.me presents a QR barcode over a view of the user's face to provide a quick way for employers to verify and log their health status And there are further hurdles to overcome to prevent people who have yet to be vaccinated from simply passing off a screenshot of someone else's code, with their own face edited in, to access a venue. That presupposes that it would be acceptable for businesses and other organisations to deny people access to a venue or their workplace if they have not been vaccinated. And one must bear in mind that while vaccines reduce the risk of someone getting seriously ill from at least some of the Covid-19 variants, it is still unknown how much impact they will have on people becoming infected and passing the virus on. So the point of having such an app might only be to demonstrate that you would be unlikely to get seriously ill by entering an area, rather than proving you do not pose a threat to others. A further consideration is that these ""passports"" would probably not be used for travel abroad. The World Health Organization is exploringwhat specifications an international scheme,externalwould require to work across borders and support different countries' immunisation programmes. It already oversees an International Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate. And the requirements of such a scheme might be different from those used by the NHS app. The face-scanning tech used by the NHS app is supplied by iProov One last issue is whether the government would allow third-party apps to tap into its system to offer specialised vaccine certificates of their own. These would be customised for use in certain workplaces or leisure activities, where the details could be stored alongside ticketing or other relevant non-health-related data. Identity-check technology provider iProov, whose face-scanning software is already integrated into the NHS app, is among those keen to do this. Its chief executive, Andrew Bud, pointed out that the NHS already had a mechanism to allow private apps to tap into GP records subject to strict security requirements. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? But whether ministers would want to complicate matters by allowing there to be multiple ways to present a vaccine passport is another matter. In any case, speaking to sources within NHSX - the division likely to be responsible for any digital certificate involving the NHS app in England - one thing becomes apparent: discussions about what would be involved are at a very early stage. And that means it will be many months before the idea of presenting an app to door staff to prove you have been jabbed has any chance of becoming a reality.

LiveLivePM praises 'patience' as England restrictions ease4 minutes ago,"UK PM Boris Johnson confirms non-essential retail can reopen and restaurants allowed to serve outdoors from 12 April Gyms and spas, as well as zoos and theme parks, can also reopen on the same date Johnson says the public's patience is ""paying off"", but warns against complacency in the face of rising cases in mainland Europe The PM says the UK is ""hopeful"" international travel can resume from 17 May, but there are difficulties around ""importing"" virus variants Hairdressers, homeware shops and garden centres are reopening in Scotland as Covid restrictions on the economy have eased India has recorded its highest number yet of coronavirus infections in a single day, with 103,558 confirmed cases Portugal is entering its second phase of rolling back restrictions, with museums, cafe terraces and some schools reopening Edited by Rob Corp and James Clarke That's it from us today. We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from around the world. Today's live page was edited by Rob Corp and James Clarke and written by Becky Morton, Richard Morris, George Bowden, George Wright and Mal Siret. It's been a busy bank holiday Monday for coronavirus news in the UK but we're bringing our live coverage to a close now - so here's a summary of the main stories today: India reported more than 100,000 cases in a day We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day in a few minutes. Here are some of the day's major developments from around the world: The prime minister touched on plans for the resumption of international travel during his briefing earlier, saying he was ""hopeful"" it could restart from 17 May. But Boris Johnson said the country didn't want to see the virus reimported from abroad and it was important to be ""mindful"" of the surge taking place in other parts of the world. This video can not be played As Covid-19 swept the world, so did misinformation about how to treat it. But sometimes misinformation can develop even around ideas that have some truth to them - and that can be the most difficult kind to tackle. Early or low quality research can be shared out of context online and the confusion this creates can be exploited by people promoting conspiracy theories. Our health reporter Rachel Schraer has looked into what is known - and what is not -about the use of Vitamin D in treating Covid. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent There were two documents published this afternoon, alongside the news conference hosted by the Prime Minister. The first providesan update,externalon the four reviews that have been under way in government since what ministers call their ""roadmap"" for England's unlocking was published in February. On what we'll get used to calling ""covid status certification"" there'll be no need to prove anything to go for a pint in England next Monday, nor to do so in the next stage of unlocking currently planned for 17 May. But there may be from 21 June: ""Covid status certification could potentially play a role in settings such as
theatres, nightclubs, and mass events such as festivals,"" the document says. It adds: ""It is possible that Covid status certification could also play a role in reducing social
distancing requirements in other settings which people tend to visit more frequently,
for example in hospitality settings."" The second came from the SAGE scientists who advise the government. They said the
reopening of shops, pub gardens and hairdressers from next week is ""highly
unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". But
later steps of the Prime Minister's ""roadmap"" out of lockdown,
including indoor mixing, are ""highly likely"" to lead to a resurgence
in hospitalisations and deaths, SPI-M - a subgroup of the government's
Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - predict. There is a lot of uncertainty, they say, and it is likely any resurgence would be
smaller than the peak in January. There was a plausible, though
pessimistic, scenario, however, in which opening up society could lead to
another peak the size of this winter's.  The prime minister has confirmed the next stage of lifting the lockdown can go ahead in England from 12 April. Changes from that date include: You can read more about the plans for easing lockdown across the UK over the coming monthshere. The Saudi government has said only people immunised against coronavirus will be allowed to perform the year-round umrah pilgrimage from the start of Ramadan, the holy fasting month for Muslims. Three categories of people will be considered ""immunised"" - those who have received two doses of the vaccine, those administered a single dose at least 14 days prior, and people who have recovered from the infection - according to a statement. Only those who fit into those three categories will be able to perform umrah, as well as to attend prayers in the Grand Mosque in the holy city of Mecca. Saudi Arabia has reported more than 393,000 infections and 6,700 deaths from the virus. The government says it has administered more than five million vaccines, in a country with a population of over 34 million. Senior Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, has again criticised the government's potential use of vaccine passports. He says Parliament must be given approval on whether or not domestic vaccine passports should be introduced. ""Trying to introduce these domestic vaccine passports by the back door by linking them to removing social distancing rules just won't be acceptable either,"" he states. He warns Covid passports ""will lead to a two-tier Britain and these issues need debating thoroughly and carefully before we allow them to affect the lives of our constituents."" Thailand's capital Bangkok will
close 196 entertainment venues for two weeks as the city battles a surge in coronavirus cases. The venues will be closed from tomorrow to 19 April. They all lie in three districts where some venues have been linked
to a new cluster of more than 100 people who tested positive for
Covid-19 in recent days, says Aswin Kwanmuang, governor of
the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. ""We will close entertainment venues in the three districts,
while other venues where cases are found will be individually
closed,"" Aswin said, according to the Reuters news agency. Thailand has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, with 29,321
cases and 95 deaths. This video can not be played PM: 'From Monday 12 April we will move to step two of road map' Speaking a couple of hours ago, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that from next week, two visitors will be allowed to go to care home residents, as well as hairdressers opening, pubs for outdoor drinks, shops, gyms, zoos and holiday campsites. He says further relaxation is dependent on avoiding complacency, as sickness continues to affect other countries. The travel industry has broadly welcomed plans for a risk-basedtraffic light systemwhen international travel restarts from England - but it called for more details on how this would work. Destinations will be designated either green, amber or red, with greater restrictions on travel, such as quarantine, for red and amber countries. Pre-departure and post-arrival testing will still be required for lower-risk green destinations. Heathrow
Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye says it is ""disappointing"" the opportunity has been missed to ""provide more certainty"" and calls for a ""clearer timetable"" for the return of international travel. The Airport Operators Association says ""potentially costly and onerous testing requirements"" for ""green"" destinations will limit travel options for many people. Abta, which represents travel agents and tour operators, says a priority for the industry is ""a more stable system which avoids the situation of last summer where travel to many destinations was quickly turned on and off"". Chief executive Mark Tanzer calls for clarification on how the transition between green, amber and red levels will work. But Clive Wratten, CEO of the
Business Travel Association, voices his concern more bluntly. âTodayâs
announcement from the Prime Minister is beyond disappointing,"" he says. ""We are leading
the way in vaccination and science. This is a cause of huge celebration, but,
if we are to re-start our economy, we need to have a clear pathway to
international travel and trade. This has once again been kicked down the road. ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by todayâs lack of
movement."" A passenger arrives at Malpensa Airport in Milan Italy is extending special measures that allow citizens of EU countries to quarantine for a shorter period of five days to include UK travellers. The measure, which reduces the quarantine time from 14 days, will include the UK by Wednesday this week and will last until at least 30 April. Austria and Israel are also included in Italy's list of so-called ""safe countries"", largely as a result of successful vaccination campaigns. A negative test result will be required within 72 hours before entering Italy, and again before any departure. Italy entered a strict three-day lockdown on Saturday to try to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases over Easter. Following the holiday weekend many different regions will remain in either ""orange zone"" or ""red zone"" - the highest tier - restrictions until the end of the month. Red zone restrictions normally mean all non-essential travel is banned. Labour MP and shadow health minister Justin Madders tells the BBC News Channel he thinks the announcement today is ""positive that it appears to be working so far"" and he's ""very happy that things appear to be on track"". But he adds there are some things the UK ""could be doing an awful lot better"". He says Labour ""have got concerns"" about vaccine passports, as they could have a ""major impact on everyone"" and individual liberties and freedoms. There are ""very significant questions"" about whether these are ""the right and fair thing to do"". There are ""lots of unanswered questions"" about the passports, he adds. Madders says he was ""a little bit worried"" the prime minister did not fully rule out vaccine passports for pubs and shops from 17 May. On travel, he says overseas travel is ""very difficult"" and the situation continues to change ""on a daily basis"" but he says the industry needs some assurance for the summer. He says testing is important to show people when they are ill, but he says Covid support payments, to help those to self-isolate who are on low incomes, are only available to one in eight people. Madders says eligibility needs to be expanded. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The further easing of
lockdown was expected given the data is perhaps as positive as it possibly
could be. Hospital admissions and
deaths have fallen sharply. Even infection rates â that some warned would start
rising quickly with the opening of schools â have continued to drop. With the vaccination
programme going well, the UK is certainly in a strong position compared with most. Whatâs more, the steps being
taken from 12 April are not considered particularly high risk. Itâs the return of indoor
mixing in May that is more of a worry â and then how to allow foreign travel
and big events such as live sport and music concerts. The prime minister was
careful not to make any promises on these. Government modelling suggests
a resurgence of hospital cases and deaths is still âhighly likelyâ in the
future. Thatâs because the vaccine
does not work for everyone and not all those in the at-risk groups have come
forward for a jab. Thereâs good reason to
believe this resurgence will be limited â perhaps no worse than a bad flu
season â but itâs the possibility it could be much worse that is causing the
concern. Parts of the Philippines are under tight controls to stop the spread of Covid A Filipino man who was found breaking quarantine rules has died after being made to do 300 squat-like exercises by police as punishment, his family says. Darren Manaog Penaredondo was allegedly stopped by officers while buying water after 18:00 local time in Cavite province on Thursday. He collapsed the following day and later died. Cavite province, on the island of Luzon, is currently under strict lockdown to tackle the spread of Covid. Marlo Solero, police chief of General Trias City, says there is no physical punishment for those found violating curfew rules, only lectures from officers. He tells local media thatif officers were found to have enforced the punishment, it would not be tolerated.,external A relative of the victim, Adrian Lucena, announced his death on Facebook. He says Mr Penaredondo and others found violating the curfew were told to do 100 squat-like exercises in sync together. If they failed to do them at the same time, they would have to repeat the set, he says. The group ended up doing 300 of the exercises. Mr Penaredondo came home at 06:00 on Friday morning in pain, his brother says. His live-in partner told local news outlet Rappler that hestruggled to move throughout Friday,external. ""That whole day, he struggled to walk, he was just crawling. But I did not take that seriously because he said it's just a simple body ache,"" Reichelyn Balce says. The following day he collapsed and stopped breathing. Ms Balce asked the neighbours to help revive him, but he reportedly died not long after. Read more here. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The Prime Minister hasnât yet said how
the vaccine certification system will work. But it seems likely the
governmentwill go for
an in-house solution of the NHS app, which was launched in early 2019 to
give people in England access to their GP services, and is separate to the
contact-tracing app. As this app can already give users access to their GP records, adding in
their vaccination history should be relatively simple. But with the app needing
to record a personâs broader Covid status - recent test results for those
whoâve not been vaccinated - and the need to make it more user-friendly, both
for those showing it and those checking it, there is still  plenty of work
to be done. That means there is a race to have it ready by the time all
restrictions could be lifted in England in late June. It may be tested at
various events in May, but remember what happened with the Test and Trace app
last year when a trial on the Isle of Wight showed up problems which were only
resolved with a full rollout in late September. Even if the
technology works, there will be more headaches for the government - the NHS app
only works for people in England, so it will be no use to people in other parts
of the UK and those travelling there. Then of course there is the continuing
opposition to the whole idea from right across the political spectrum. While it
looks inevitable that travel overseas will require a vaccine passport, it is
far from certain that carrying an app proving your Covid status will become
normal behaviour in the UK. On 12 April, the government is expected to release information on how international travel is expected to continue while preventing further Covid variants from spreading in the UK. No earlier than 17 May, the government is expected to announce when international travel should resume to and from the country. The government says the announcement will consider variants abroad, the speed of vaccine roll-outs both here and abroad, as well as the global picture of the virus. The taskforce is to be led by the Department for Transport and the prime minister. Moving away from Westminster now - the mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv says the city's healthcare system is ""very close"" to collapsing. ""Today our hospitals are almost completely full,"" Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Ukrayina 24 television. His comments come as new measures came into force as infections surge across the country. The new curbs include primary school closures and travel restrictions. Only essential workers such as doctors are allowed to use public transport. The country of 40 million has recorded more than 1.7 million Covid infections and more than 34,000 deaths. There were lots of announcements in today's Downing Street briefing so here's a quick summary of the main points: Â© 2025 BBC.

Pilot eventswill take place from mid-April to trial the system, with later events checking vaccinations. Speaking in Downing Street, the prime minister also said the government was ""hopeful"" international travel could resume in the next stage of lockdown easing on 17 May, but cautioned against the effects of the surge of coronavirus in other parts of the world. He said the government would set out ""well before 17 May what is reasonable"" and aim to give the aviation industry ""as much notice as possible"". What can I do from 12 April? What is the new traffic light system for holidays? What's happening with pools, haircuts and pubs? Hairdressers and homeware shops reopen in Scotland It comes as the government has publishedan update on a series of reviews,externalinto Covid certificates, the safe return of mass events, international travel and social distancing rules. In the document, the government says it cannot yet confirm international travel can resume on 17 May ""given the state of the pandemic abroad"", and advises people not to book summer holidays abroad ""until the picture is clearer"". It also confirms further details on a risk-based ""traffic light"" system for foreign travel will be published in a report later this week. On Covid status certification, the paper says this could have an important role to play both domestically and internationally and ""is likely to become a feature of our lives"" while the pandemic continues. A certification scheme could record whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity. The NHS is working on digital and non-digital ways for individuals to demonstrate their Covid status, according to the government paper, but there were no details on whether this might include using an app. More than 40 Conservative MPs havesigned a cross-party letteropposing the use of vaccine passports for access to jobs or services, with critics calling such a move ""discriminatory"". The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said vaccine passports had managed to ""achieve the remarkable political feat of uniting a former Labour leader and a former Conservative leader against them"", as he asked the prime minister if there would be a vote in Parliament on their introduction. Mr Johnson said the question of a Commons vote was ""taking too many fences at once"", and that the government needs to work out its proposal. He stressed that certification would not be introduced either for the 12 April lockdown easing or for the planned further changes from 17 May that would see pubs and restaurants serving customers indoors. But he said ""all countries"" were looking at vaccination status for international travel, adding: ""I do think that's going to be part of the way people deal with it and we need to think about that."" The government's review said that public transport and essential shops and services would never require Covid status certification, but it could play a role in allowing people to return to theatres, nightclubs, and events such as festivals or sports fixtures. It is also possible that requiring customers to prove their status could ""play a role in reducing social distancing requirements in other settings"" such as pubs and restaurants, the document states. The government said this would be considered in consultation with the industry, and that businesses should continue to plan to reopen in line with the latest guidance. Labour has backed the move to proceed as planned on 12 April, but shadow health minister Justin Madders told the BBC the party had concerns about how vaccine passports could affect ""liberties and freedoms"". Meanwhile, Tory former chief whip Mark Harper, leader of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptics, has called for Parliament to be given a vote on vaccine passports, warning they would lead to a ""two-tier Britain"". And the Confederation of British Industry said firms would need help to navigate ""ethical, legal and practical implementation challenges"" around status certificates.

Twice-weekly Covid tests offered to all in England,"Everyone in England is to be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday, under an extension of the government's testing programme. The lateral flow kits, which can provide results in around 30 minutes, will be available for free at testing sites, pharmacies and through the post. The health secretary said it would help squash any outbreaks as lockdown eases. But critics of the programme say it risks becoming a ""scandalous"" waste of money. It comes as Boris Johnson is due to meet the cabinet to sign offthe next stage of lockdown easing in England, which will see non-essential shops reopen and pubs and restaurants start serving outdoors from 12 April. Rapid home Covid tests to be available for workers How many people have been vaccinated so far? Covid passports would be time-limited - minister Hairdressers and homeware shops reopen in Scotland Later, the prime minister will hold a Downing Street briefing, where he is expected to confirm countries will be graded under a traffic light system when international leisure travel resumes. He is also set to outline plans forcoronavirus passports- recording whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity - as a means of enabling mass-audience events to take place in the future. However, dozens of MPs oppose the use of Covid passports and Mr Johnsonfaces the prospect of a rebellionamong a number of senior Conservatives if he proceeds with them. Lateral flow tests are already available forschool children and their familiesto take at home as well as for those who have to leave home for work. The prime minister hailed the plan to offer everyone testing from 9 April, saying: ""As we continue to make good progress on our vaccine programme and with our road map cautiously easing restrictions under way, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted."" Health minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he expected the lateral flow tests to be used by those returning to work in the coming weeks as the ""economy starts opening up again"". He said fewer than one in every 1,000 lateral flow tests gave a false positive result and refused to set an ""arbitrary"" date for when testing would end. Mr Argar said the tests would be paid for as part of NHS Test and Trace's funding of Â£37bn over two years, with 80% of that expected to be used for testing. The rapid tests are aimed at those without any Covid symptoms and can be taken at home. The government introduced lateral flow testing for secondary school children and staff earlier this year, under plans to reopen classes in England by March. In February, the scheme was extended to the families of all school and college-age children in England. Kits were also offered to those who cannot work from home in the pandemic, so they can be tested twice a week. From 9 April, kits will be available through: Community testing sites operated by local authorities Collection from a nearby PCR test site during specific time windows Existing workplace testing programmes An online home ordering service with kits then delivered through the post Participating local pharmacies where a box of 7 tests can be collected to be used twice a week at home Anyone who tests positive using a lateral flow test will be expected to self-isolate along with their household. They can then order a second PCR Covid test, typically used for symptomatic cases, which will be sent off to a laboratory for analysis. If the confirmatory test comes back negative, their quarantine period is considered over immediately and they can resume normal life. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how lateral flow tests work and how to do one The schools testing programme, combined with the wider use of workplace testing, has led to a jump in the number of lateral flow tests carried out in England. There were about 250,000 rapid tests a day taken in mid-February - climbing to more than a million a day by the end of March. Dr Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 strategic response director at Public Health England, said rapid testing might find cases that would not otherwise be discovered, helping to break chains of transmission and suppress the spread of variants or mutations of coronavirus. The Department of Health said parents may wish to consider testing children under the age of 11 but the current Public Health England advice was that there was a ""limited public health benefit from testing primary school age children with lateral flow devices"". Secondary school children in England have been using lateral flow tests since all classes restarted in March Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Around one in three people who have Covid-19 show no symptoms, and as we reopen society and resume parts of life we have missed, regular rapid testing is going to be fundamental in helping us quickly spot positive cases and squash any outbreaks."" Shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said any expansion of the testing scheme must be backed by financial support so people could self-isolate, adding: ""Lack of adequate sick pay and support remains a dangerous hole in our defences against this horrific virus."" The latest data shows that, of the 4.2 million lateral flow tests taken in schools and colleges in the week from 18 to 24 March, 4,502 returned a positive result. Critics of the programme say that when rates are at low levels, it makes it hard to distinguish between actual infections and so-called ""false positives"" - an error where the test registers a positive result incorrectly. ""Mass testing is a scandalous waste of money,"" said Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University. ""When the prevalence rate of coronavirus falls as low as it is at the moment then an increasing proportion of cases are likely to be false positives meaning that cases and contacts will self isolate unnecessarily."" Prof Pollock said it is likely that mass testing ""is going to do more harm than good"" and there had been no evaluation of mass testing programmes by the government. The government requires secondary school children to take a second PCR or lab test if their first rapid lateral flow test comes back positive in school. Parents and scientists hadwarned some pupils were self-isolating unnecessarilyafter just returning to the classroom. The government said that for every 1,000 lateral flow tests carried out, there was less than one false positive result, and the rapid tests were particularly useful at detecting high levels of virus.

In Northern Ireland, a spokesperson for the department of health said rapid testing was recently extended to private sector firms with more than 50 staff, and ""consideration may be provided to other sectors"". The Scottish government said it was expanding rapid testing in hospitals, care homes, schools and in the community to spot asymptomatic cases in high prevalence areas, while also ""considering the implications"" of the announcement in England. The Welsh government said 22% of the population already had access to regular rapid testing and this would continue to grow with the expansion of workplace and community testing programmes.

How would a vaccine passport app work?,"There is speculation the NHS app could be amended to include a Covid vaccine certificate As the UK gets closer to easing its coronavirus lockdowns, attention is turning to how we might safely mix again and what role tech might play. And despiteprevious denialsthat a ""Covid passport"" app was being considered, it is now on the agenda. After all the hoo-ha and costs involved in creating the contact-tracing apps last year, you might think that a very brave decision. But earlier this weekThe Times reported,externalthat the facility would be built into the existing NHS app used to access health services in England. It is distinct from the NHS Covid-19 app used by England and Wales to warn people if they might have recently been infected, and fewer people have downloaded it. But according to Google's own figures, it has been installed on more than one million Android devices (Apple does not share stats for iOS), which represents a decent start. Officially, Downing Street says the matter is still under review and it does not want to pre-empt anything by speculating on the subject. But it's clear there would be several benefits. Firstly, the NHS app, which serves patients in England only, already links up to users' GP services to give smartphone owners access to their medical records. In fact, it can already provide a record of whether some people have been given one of the coronavirus jabs, if the GP surgeries involved have shared the information. (Confusingly, this sometimes appears under the Medicines tab rather than the Immunisations one if you've had an injection and want to check yourself). So health chiefs would not need to build new IT infrastructure to get at the information. There is a risk countries develop Covid passports that rely on local systems that do not intercommunicate Secondly, the app has already tackled many of the security issues involved. To set it up you must provide your NHS number, email address, phone number and then upload either an image of your passport or driving licence. The smartphone then takes a scan of your face to check it matches the characteristics on the image on your official identification. And then, as a supplement to the automated checks, a human review takes place before you are granted access. However, there are still issues to be addressed. People would need to get to the certificate without having to hunt around several menus - possibly via a button at the bottom of the screen. And then the information would have to be presented in a format that someone else could verify quickly and easily. Another health pass app points the way to how that might be done. Tested.me displays a scannable barcode over an image of the user's face to provide employers with a means of keeping track of the health status of their staff. Of course, if the NHS app adopts a similar scheme, it will require other software to be developed so that establishments can verify a person's barcode when they present it. Tested.me presents a QR barcode over a view of the user's face to provide a quick way for employers to verify and log their health status And there are further hurdles to overcome to prevent people who have yet to be vaccinated from simply passing off a screenshot of someone else's code, with their own face edited in, to access a venue. That presupposes that it would be acceptable for businesses and other organisations to deny people access to a venue or their workplace if they have not been vaccinated. And one must bear in mind that while vaccines reduce the risk of someone getting seriously ill from at least some of the Covid-19 variants, it is still unknown how much impact they will have on people becoming infected and passing the virus on. So the point of having such an app might only be to demonstrate that you would be unlikely to get seriously ill by entering an area, rather than proving you do not pose a threat to others. A further consideration is that these ""passports"" would probably not be used for travel abroad. The World Health Organization is exploringwhat specifications an international scheme,externalwould require to work across borders and support different countries' immunisation programmes. It already oversees an International Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate. And the requirements of such a scheme might be different from those used by the NHS app. The face-scanning tech used by the NHS app is supplied by iProov One last issue is whether the government would allow third-party apps to tap into its system to offer specialised vaccine certificates of their own. These would be customised for use in certain workplaces or leisure activities, where the details could be stored alongside ticketing or other relevant non-health-related data. Identity-check technology provider iProov, whose face-scanning software is already integrated into the NHS app, is among those keen to do this. Its chief executive, Andrew Bud, pointed out that the NHS already had a mechanism to allow private apps to tap into GP records subject to strict security requirements. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? But whether ministers would want to complicate matters by allowing there to be multiple ways to present a vaccine passport is another matter. In any case, speaking to sources within NHSX - the division likely to be responsible for any digital certificate involving the NHS app in England - one thing becomes apparent: discussions about what would be involved are at a very early stage. And that means it will be many months before the idea of presenting an app to door staff to prove you have been jabbed has any chance of becoming a reality.

LiveLivePM to lead briefing on England lockdown roadmap2 minutes ago,"UK PM Boris Johnson confirms non-essential retail can reopen and restaurants allowed to serve outdoors from 12 April Gyms and spas, as well as zoos and theme parks, can also reopen on the same date Johnson says the public's patience is ""paying off"", but warns against complacency in the face of rising cases in mainland Europe The PM says the UK is ""hopeful"" international travel can resume from 17 May, but there are difficulties around ""importing"" virus variants Hairdressers, homeware shops and garden centres are reopening in Scotland as Covid restrictions on the economy have eased India has recorded its highest number yet of coronavirus infections in a single day, with 103,558 confirmed cases Portugal is entering its second phase of rolling back restrictions, with museums, cafe terraces and some schools reopening Edited by Rob Corp and James Clarke That's it from us today. We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from around the world. Today's live page was edited by Rob Corp and James Clarke and written by Becky Morton, Richard Morris, George Bowden, George Wright and Mal Siret. It's been a busy bank holiday Monday for coronavirus news in the UK but we're bringing our live coverage to a close now - so here's a summary of the main stories today: India reported more than 100,000 cases in a day We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day in a few minutes. Here are some of the day's major developments from around the world: The prime minister touched on plans for the resumption of international travel during his briefing earlier, saying he was ""hopeful"" it could restart from 17 May. But Boris Johnson said the country didn't want to see the virus reimported from abroad and it was important to be ""mindful"" of the surge taking place in other parts of the world. This video can not be played As Covid-19 swept the world, so did misinformation about how to treat it. But sometimes misinformation can develop even around ideas that have some truth to them - and that can be the most difficult kind to tackle. Early or low quality research can be shared out of context online and the confusion this creates can be exploited by people promoting conspiracy theories. Our health reporter Rachel Schraer has looked into what is known - and what is not -about the use of Vitamin D in treating Covid. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent There were two documents published this afternoon, alongside the news conference hosted by the Prime Minister. The first providesan update,externalon the four reviews that have been under way in government since what ministers call their ""roadmap"" for England's unlocking was published in February. On what we'll get used to calling ""covid status certification"" there'll be no need to prove anything to go for a pint in England next Monday, nor to do so in the next stage of unlocking currently planned for 17 May. But there may be from 21 June: ""Covid status certification could potentially play a role in settings such as
theatres, nightclubs, and mass events such as festivals,"" the document says. It adds: ""It is possible that Covid status certification could also play a role in reducing social
distancing requirements in other settings which people tend to visit more frequently,
for example in hospitality settings."" The second came from the SAGE scientists who advise the government. They said the
reopening of shops, pub gardens and hairdressers from next week is ""highly
unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". But
later steps of the Prime Minister's ""roadmap"" out of lockdown,
including indoor mixing, are ""highly likely"" to lead to a resurgence
in hospitalisations and deaths, SPI-M - a subgroup of the government's
Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - predict. There is a lot of uncertainty, they say, and it is likely any resurgence would be
smaller than the peak in January. There was a plausible, though
pessimistic, scenario, however, in which opening up society could lead to
another peak the size of this winter's.  The prime minister has confirmed the next stage of lifting the lockdown can go ahead in England from 12 April. Changes from that date include: You can read more about the plans for easing lockdown across the UK over the coming monthshere. The Saudi government has said only people immunised against coronavirus will be allowed to perform the year-round umrah pilgrimage from the start of Ramadan, the holy fasting month for Muslims. Three categories of people will be considered ""immunised"" - those who have received two doses of the vaccine, those administered a single dose at least 14 days prior, and people who have recovered from the infection - according to a statement. Only those who fit into those three categories will be able to perform umrah, as well as to attend prayers in the Grand Mosque in the holy city of Mecca. Saudi Arabia has reported more than 393,000 infections and 6,700 deaths from the virus. The government says it has administered more than five million vaccines, in a country with a population of over 34 million. Senior Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, has again criticised the government's potential use of vaccine passports. He says Parliament must be given approval on whether or not domestic vaccine passports should be introduced. ""Trying to introduce these domestic vaccine passports by the back door by linking them to removing social distancing rules just won't be acceptable either,"" he states. He warns Covid passports ""will lead to a two-tier Britain and these issues need debating thoroughly and carefully before we allow them to affect the lives of our constituents."" Thailand's capital Bangkok will
close 196 entertainment venues for two weeks as the city battles a surge in coronavirus cases. The venues will be closed from tomorrow to 19 April. They all lie in three districts where some venues have been linked
to a new cluster of more than 100 people who tested positive for
Covid-19 in recent days, says Aswin Kwanmuang, governor of
the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. ""We will close entertainment venues in the three districts,
while other venues where cases are found will be individually
closed,"" Aswin said, according to the Reuters news agency. Thailand has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, with 29,321
cases and 95 deaths. This video can not be played PM: 'From Monday 12 April we will move to step two of road map' Speaking a couple of hours ago, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that from next week, two visitors will be allowed to go to care home residents, as well as hairdressers opening, pubs for outdoor drinks, shops, gyms, zoos and holiday campsites. He says further relaxation is dependent on avoiding complacency, as sickness continues to affect other countries. The travel industry has broadly welcomed plans for a risk-basedtraffic light systemwhen international travel restarts from England - but it called for more details on how this would work. Destinations will be designated either green, amber or red, with greater restrictions on travel, such as quarantine, for red and amber countries. Pre-departure and post-arrival testing will still be required for lower-risk green destinations. Heathrow
Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye says it is ""disappointing"" the opportunity has been missed to ""provide more certainty"" and calls for a ""clearer timetable"" for the return of international travel. The Airport Operators Association says ""potentially costly and onerous testing requirements"" for ""green"" destinations will limit travel options for many people. Abta, which represents travel agents and tour operators, says a priority for the industry is ""a more stable system which avoids the situation of last summer where travel to many destinations was quickly turned on and off"". Chief executive Mark Tanzer calls for clarification on how the transition between green, amber and red levels will work. But Clive Wratten, CEO of the
Business Travel Association, voices his concern more bluntly. âTodayâs
announcement from the Prime Minister is beyond disappointing,"" he says. ""We are leading
the way in vaccination and science. This is a cause of huge celebration, but,
if we are to re-start our economy, we need to have a clear pathway to
international travel and trade. This has once again been kicked down the road. ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by todayâs lack of
movement."" A passenger arrives at Malpensa Airport in Milan Italy is extending special measures that allow citizens of EU countries to quarantine for a shorter period of five days to include UK travellers. The measure, which reduces the quarantine time from 14 days, will include the UK by Wednesday this week and will last until at least 30 April. Austria and Israel are also included in Italy's list of so-called ""safe countries"", largely as a result of successful vaccination campaigns. A negative test result will be required within 72 hours before entering Italy, and again before any departure. Italy entered a strict three-day lockdown on Saturday to try to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases over Easter. Following the holiday weekend many different regions will remain in either ""orange zone"" or ""red zone"" - the highest tier - restrictions until the end of the month. Red zone restrictions normally mean all non-essential travel is banned. Labour MP and shadow health minister Justin Madders tells the BBC News Channel he thinks the announcement today is ""positive that it appears to be working so far"" and he's ""very happy that things appear to be on track"". But he adds there are some things the UK ""could be doing an awful lot better"". He says Labour ""have got concerns"" about vaccine passports, as they could have a ""major impact on everyone"" and individual liberties and freedoms. There are ""very significant questions"" about whether these are ""the right and fair thing to do"". There are ""lots of unanswered questions"" about the passports, he adds. Madders says he was ""a little bit worried"" the prime minister did not fully rule out vaccine passports for pubs and shops from 17 May. On travel, he says overseas travel is ""very difficult"" and the situation continues to change ""on a daily basis"" but he says the industry needs some assurance for the summer. He says testing is important to show people when they are ill, but he says Covid support payments, to help those to self-isolate who are on low incomes, are only available to one in eight people. Madders says eligibility needs to be expanded. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The further easing of
lockdown was expected given the data is perhaps as positive as it possibly
could be. Hospital admissions and
deaths have fallen sharply. Even infection rates â that some warned would start
rising quickly with the opening of schools â have continued to drop. With the vaccination
programme going well, the UK is certainly in a strong position compared with most. Whatâs more, the steps being
taken from 12 April are not considered particularly high risk. Itâs the return of indoor
mixing in May that is more of a worry â and then how to allow foreign travel
and big events such as live sport and music concerts. The prime minister was
careful not to make any promises on these. Government modelling suggests
a resurgence of hospital cases and deaths is still âhighly likelyâ in the
future. Thatâs because the vaccine
does not work for everyone and not all those in the at-risk groups have come
forward for a jab. Thereâs good reason to
believe this resurgence will be limited â perhaps no worse than a bad flu
season â but itâs the possibility it could be much worse that is causing the
concern. Parts of the Philippines are under tight controls to stop the spread of Covid A Filipino man who was found breaking quarantine rules has died after being made to do 300 squat-like exercises by police as punishment, his family says. Darren Manaog Penaredondo was allegedly stopped by officers while buying water after 18:00 local time in Cavite province on Thursday. He collapsed the following day and later died. Cavite province, on the island of Luzon, is currently under strict lockdown to tackle the spread of Covid. Marlo Solero, police chief of General Trias City, says there is no physical punishment for those found violating curfew rules, only lectures from officers. He tells local media thatif officers were found to have enforced the punishment, it would not be tolerated.,external A relative of the victim, Adrian Lucena, announced his death on Facebook. He says Mr Penaredondo and others found violating the curfew were told to do 100 squat-like exercises in sync together. If they failed to do them at the same time, they would have to repeat the set, he says. The group ended up doing 300 of the exercises. Mr Penaredondo came home at 06:00 on Friday morning in pain, his brother says. His live-in partner told local news outlet Rappler that hestruggled to move throughout Friday,external. ""That whole day, he struggled to walk, he was just crawling. But I did not take that seriously because he said it's just a simple body ache,"" Reichelyn Balce says. The following day he collapsed and stopped breathing. Ms Balce asked the neighbours to help revive him, but he reportedly died not long after. Read more here. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The Prime Minister hasnât yet said how
the vaccine certification system will work. But it seems likely the
governmentwill go for
an in-house solution of the NHS app, which was launched in early 2019 to
give people in England access to their GP services, and is separate to the
contact-tracing app. As this app can already give users access to their GP records, adding in
their vaccination history should be relatively simple. But with the app needing
to record a personâs broader Covid status - recent test results for those
whoâve not been vaccinated - and the need to make it more user-friendly, both
for those showing it and those checking it, there is still  plenty of work
to be done. That means there is a race to have it ready by the time all
restrictions could be lifted in England in late June. It may be tested at
various events in May, but remember what happened with the Test and Trace app
last year when a trial on the Isle of Wight showed up problems which were only
resolved with a full rollout in late September. Even if the
technology works, there will be more headaches for the government - the NHS app
only works for people in England, so it will be no use to people in other parts
of the UK and those travelling there. Then of course there is the continuing
opposition to the whole idea from right across the political spectrum. While it
looks inevitable that travel overseas will require a vaccine passport, it is
far from certain that carrying an app proving your Covid status will become
normal behaviour in the UK. On 12 April, the government is expected to release information on how international travel is expected to continue while preventing further Covid variants from spreading in the UK. No earlier than 17 May, the government is expected to announce when international travel should resume to and from the country. The government says the announcement will consider variants abroad, the speed of vaccine roll-outs both here and abroad, as well as the global picture of the virus. The taskforce is to be led by the Department for Transport and the prime minister. Moving away from Westminster now - the mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv says the city's healthcare system is ""very close"" to collapsing. ""Today our hospitals are almost completely full,"" Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Ukrayina 24 television. His comments come as new measures came into force as infections surge across the country. The new curbs include primary school closures and travel restrictions. Only essential workers such as doctors are allowed to use public transport. The country of 40 million has recorded more than 1.7 million Covid infections and more than 34,000 deaths. There were lots of announcements in today's Downing Street briefing so here's a quick summary of the main points: Â© 2025 BBC.

"New curriculum 'must be delayed' in Covid's wakeImplementing the changes in 2022 does not give schools sufficient time post-pandemic, a union says.Wales","The new curriculum, due to be implemented in 2022, will be the biggest shake-up in 30 years of Wales' education system Rollout of a new school curriculum in Wales must be delayed so teachers can focus on helping pupils in the wake of the pandemic, a union has warned. Changes are set to be introduced in 2022 for all children currently in year three or below. However, the NASUWT said it must be pushed back to enable teachers to help pupils get back on track, otherwise the curriculum's success will be at risk. The Welsh government said curriculum reform remained a ""priority"". The changes represent the first complete reform of the curriculum in Wales in more than 30 years. Schools will be required to deliver areas of learning, although detailed plans for exactly what schools should be teaching has not yet been issued. Six areas of learning and experience 1Maths and numeracy 2Languages, literacy and communication 3Health and well-being 4Humanities 5Science and technology 6Expressive arts Changes mean schools will be required to teach lifesaving skills and first aid, while the teaching ofthe histories of Black and Asian and Minority Ethnic communities will be mandatory. However, ahead of its annual conference, teaching union the NASUWT said ministers' decision to ""forge ahead"" with its plans to introduce the curriculum in 2022 despite the Covid pandemic, will ""put its success at risk"". Some pupils returned to classrooms before the Easter break, but all children are set to return on 12 April, after months of home schooling. 'All pupils should get free school meals' Coronavirus, schools and children - what are the risks? Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said teachers now needed to have time to get pupils used to being back, before changes were made. ""These are landmark reforms which will have a profound and lasting impact on the futures of a generation of children and young people,"" he said. ""It is therefore absolutely vital that these changes are introduced in a way which commands the confidence of teachers, pupils and parents. ""The Welsh government must give teachers sufficient time, training and resources to ensure the introduction of the new curriculum runs smoothly."" The government said curriculum reform ""remained a key priority"" and ""must continue"". A national continuity plan has been published in response to Covid-19 that was ""closely aligned"" with the new curriculum, in order to support pupils' wellbeing, knowledge and skills, a spokesperson said. ""We are providing record levels of investment in staff professional learning to further support schools as they prepare for the introduction of the new curriculum in 2022,"" they said. Plaid Cymru said while the new curriculum had ""great potential"" it would not succeed without the right investment and resources. ""We need to listen to the very valid concerns raised by teachers, unions and school staff,"" the party's Sian Gwenllian said. While leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said: ""The new curriculum will play a key role in our path to recovery. ""There is significant momentum for change and we should collectively grip this to support learners as the curriculum starts to be implemented from 2022."" The Welsh Conservatives said they would postpone the introduction of the new curriculum until September 2023, if voted into government after the 6 May election. ""This would help teachers and pupils to catch up from a year of lost learning, before having to take on the enormous challenge of a implementing a new curriculum,"" they said.

We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from around the world. Today's live page was edited by Rob Corp and James Clarke and written by Becky Morton, Richard Morris, George Bowden, George Wright and Mal Siret. It's been a busy bank holiday Monday for coronavirus news in the UK but we're bringing our live coverage to a close now - so here's a summary of the main stories today: India reported more than 100,000 cases in a day We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day in a few minutes. Here are some of the day's major developments from around the world: The prime minister touched on plans for the resumption of international travel during his briefing earlier, saying he was ""hopeful"" it could restart from 17 May. But Boris Johnson said the country didn't want to see the virus reimported from abroad and it was important to be ""mindful"" of the surge taking place in other parts of the world. This video can not be played As Covid-19 swept the world, so did misinformation about how to treat it. But sometimes misinformation can develop even around ideas that have some truth to them - and that can be the most difficult kind to tackle. Early or low quality research can be shared out of context online and the confusion this creates can be exploited by people promoting conspiracy theories. Our health reporter Rachel Schraer has looked into what is known - and what is not -about the use of Vitamin D in treating Covid. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent There were two documents published this afternoon, alongside the news conference hosted by the Prime Minister. The first providesan update,externalon the four reviews that have been under way in government since what ministers call their ""roadmap"" for England's unlocking was published in February. On what we'll get used to calling ""covid status certification"" there'll be no need to prove anything to go for a pint in England next Monday, nor to do so in the next stage of unlocking currently planned for 17 May. But there may be from 21 June: ""Covid status certification could potentially play a role in settings such as
theatres, nightclubs, and mass events such as festivals,"" the document says. It adds: ""It is possible that Covid status certification could also play a role in reducing social
distancing requirements in other settings which people tend to visit more frequently,
for example in hospitality settings."" The second came from the SAGE scientists who advise the government. They said the
reopening of shops, pub gardens and hairdressers from next week is ""highly
unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". But
later steps of the Prime Minister's ""roadmap"" out of lockdown,
including indoor mixing, are ""highly likely"" to lead to a resurgence
in hospitalisations and deaths, SPI-M - a subgroup of the government's
Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - predict. There is a lot of uncertainty, they say, and it is likely any resurgence would be
smaller than the peak in January. There was a plausible, though
pessimistic, scenario, however, in which opening up society could lead to
another peak the size of this winter's.  The prime minister has confirmed the next stage of lifting the lockdown can go ahead in England from 12 April. Changes from that date include: You can read more about the plans for easing lockdown across the UK over the coming monthshere. The Saudi government has said only people immunised against coronavirus will be allowed to perform the year-round umrah pilgrimage from the start of Ramadan, the holy fasting month for Muslims. Three categories of people will be considered ""immunised"" - those who have received two doses of the vaccine, those administered a single dose at least 14 days prior, and people who have recovered from the infection - according to a statement. Only those who fit into those three categories will be able to perform umrah, as well as to attend prayers in the Grand Mosque in the holy city of Mecca. Saudi Arabia has reported more than 393,000 infections and 6,700 deaths from the virus. The government says it has administered more than five million vaccines, in a country with a population of over 34 million. Senior Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, has again criticised the government's potential use of vaccine passports. He says Parliament must be given approval on whether or not domestic vaccine passports should be introduced. ""Trying to introduce these domestic vaccine passports by the back door by linking them to removing social distancing rules just won't be acceptable either,"" he states. He warns Covid passports ""will lead to a two-tier Britain and these issues need debating thoroughly and carefully before we allow them to affect the lives of our constituents."" Thailand's capital Bangkok will
close 196 entertainment venues for two weeks as the city battles a surge in coronavirus cases. The venues will be closed from tomorrow to 19 April. They all lie in three districts where some venues have been linked
to a new cluster of more than 100 people who tested positive for
Covid-19 in recent days, says Aswin Kwanmuang, governor of
the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. ""We will close entertainment venues in the three districts,
while other venues where cases are found will be individually
closed,"" Aswin said, according to the Reuters news agency. Thailand has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, with 29,321
cases and 95 deaths. This video can not be played PM: 'From Monday 12 April we will move to step two of road map' Speaking a couple of hours ago, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that from next week, two visitors will be allowed to go to care home residents, as well as hairdressers opening, pubs for outdoor drinks, shops, gyms, zoos and holiday campsites. He says further relaxation is dependent on avoiding complacency, as sickness continues to affect other countries. The travel industry has broadly welcomed plans for a risk-basedtraffic light systemwhen international travel restarts from England - but it called for more details on how this would work. Destinations will be designated either green, amber or red, with greater restrictions on travel, such as quarantine, for red and amber countries. Pre-departure and post-arrival testing will still be required for lower-risk green destinations. Heathrow
Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye says it is ""disappointing"" the opportunity has been missed to ""provide more certainty"" and calls for a ""clearer timetable"" for the return of international travel. The Airport Operators Association says ""potentially costly and onerous testing requirements"" for ""green"" destinations will limit travel options for many people. Abta, which represents travel agents and tour operators, says a priority for the industry is ""a more stable system which avoids the situation of last summer where travel to many destinations was quickly turned on and off"". Chief executive Mark Tanzer calls for clarification on how the transition between green, amber and red levels will work. But Clive Wratten, CEO of the
Business Travel Association, voices his concern more bluntly. âTodayâs
announcement from the Prime Minister is beyond disappointing,"" he says. ""We are leading
the way in vaccination and science. This is a cause of huge celebration, but,
if we are to re-start our economy, we need to have a clear pathway to
international travel and trade. This has once again been kicked down the road. ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by todayâs lack of
movement."" A passenger arrives at Malpensa Airport in Milan Italy is extending special measures that allow citizens of EU countries to quarantine for a shorter period of five days to include UK travellers. The measure, which reduces the quarantine time from 14 days, will include the UK by Wednesday this week and will last until at least 30 April. Austria and Israel are also included in Italy's list of so-called ""safe countries"", largely as a result of successful vaccination campaigns. A negative test result will be required within 72 hours before entering Italy, and again before any departure. Italy entered a strict three-day lockdown on Saturday to try to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases over Easter. Following the holiday weekend many different regions will remain in either ""orange zone"" or ""red zone"" - the highest tier - restrictions until the end of the month. Red zone restrictions normally mean all non-essential travel is banned. Labour MP and shadow health minister Justin Madders tells the BBC News Channel he thinks the announcement today is ""positive that it appears to be working so far"" and he's ""very happy that things appear to be on track"". But he adds there are some things the UK ""could be doing an awful lot better"". He says Labour ""have got concerns"" about vaccine passports, as they could have a ""major impact on everyone"" and individual liberties and freedoms. There are ""very significant questions"" about whether these are ""the right and fair thing to do"". There are ""lots of unanswered questions"" about the passports, he adds. Madders says he was ""a little bit worried"" the prime minister did not fully rule out vaccine passports for pubs and shops from 17 May. On travel, he says overseas travel is ""very difficult"" and the situation continues to change ""on a daily basis"" but he says the industry needs some assurance for the summer. He says testing is important to show people when they are ill, but he says Covid support payments, to help those to self-isolate who are on low incomes, are only available to one in eight people. Madders says eligibility needs to be expanded. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The further easing of
lockdown was expected given the data is perhaps as positive as it possibly
could be. Hospital admissions and
deaths have fallen sharply. Even infection rates â that some warned would start
rising quickly with the opening of schools â have continued to drop. With the vaccination
programme going well, the UK is certainly in a strong position compared with most. Whatâs more, the steps being
taken from 12 April are not considered particularly high risk. Itâs the return of indoor
mixing in May that is more of a worry â and then how to allow foreign travel
and big events such as live sport and music concerts. The prime minister was
careful not to make any promises on these. Government modelling suggests
a resurgence of hospital cases and deaths is still âhighly likelyâ in the
future. Thatâs because the vaccine
does not work for everyone and not all those in the at-risk groups have come
forward for a jab. Thereâs good reason to
believe this resurgence will be limited â perhaps no worse than a bad flu
season â but itâs the possibility it could be much worse that is causing the
concern. Parts of the Philippines are under tight controls to stop the spread of Covid A Filipino man who was found breaking quarantine rules has died after being made to do 300 squat-like exercises by police as punishment, his family says. Darren Manaog Penaredondo was allegedly stopped by officers while buying water after 18:00 local time in Cavite province on Thursday. He collapsed the following day and later died. Cavite province, on the island of Luzon, is currently under strict lockdown to tackle the spread of Covid. Marlo Solero, police chief of General Trias City, says there is no physical punishment for those found violating curfew rules, only lectures from officers. He tells local media thatif officers were found to have enforced the punishment, it would not be tolerated.,external A relative of the victim, Adrian Lucena, announced his death on Facebook. He says Mr Penaredondo and others found violating the curfew were told to do 100 squat-like exercises in sync together. If they failed to do them at the same time, they would have to repeat the set, he says. The group ended up doing 300 of the exercises. Mr Penaredondo came home at 06:00 on Friday morning in pain, his brother says. His live-in partner told local news outlet Rappler that hestruggled to move throughout Friday,external. ""That whole day, he struggled to walk, he was just crawling. But I did not take that seriously because he said it's just a simple body ache,"" Reichelyn Balce says. The following day he collapsed and stopped breathing. Ms Balce asked the neighbours to help revive him, but he reportedly died not long after. Read more here. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The Prime Minister hasnât yet said how
the vaccine certification system will work. But it seems likely the
governmentwill go for
an in-house solution of the NHS app, which was launched in early 2019 to
give people in England access to their GP services, and is separate to the
contact-tracing app. As this app can already give users access to their GP records, adding in
their vaccination history should be relatively simple. But with the app needing
to record a personâs broader Covid status - recent test results for those
whoâve not been vaccinated - and the need to make it more user-friendly, both
for those showing it and those checking it, there is still  plenty of work
to be done. That means there is a race to have it ready by the time all
restrictions could be lifted in England in late June. It may be tested at
various events in May, but remember what happened with the Test and Trace app
last year when a trial on the Isle of Wight showed up problems which were only
resolved with a full rollout in late September. Even if the
technology works, there will be more headaches for the government - the NHS app
only works for people in England, so it will be no use to people in other parts
of the UK and those travelling there. Then of course there is the continuing
opposition to the whole idea from right across the political spectrum. While it
looks inevitable that travel overseas will require a vaccine passport, it is
far from certain that carrying an app proving your Covid status will become
normal behaviour in the UK. On 12 April, the government is expected to release information on how international travel is expected to continue while preventing further Covid variants from spreading in the UK. No earlier than 17 May, the government is expected to announce when international travel should resume to and from the country. The government says the announcement will consider variants abroad, the speed of vaccine roll-outs both here and abroad, as well as the global picture of the virus. The taskforce is to be led by the Department for Transport and the prime minister. Moving away from Westminster now - the mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv says the city's healthcare system is ""very close"" to collapsing. ""Today our hospitals are almost completely full,"" Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Ukrayina 24 television. His comments come as new measures came into force as infections surge across the country. The new curbs include primary school closures and travel restrictions. Only essential workers such as doctors are allowed to use public transport. The country of 40 million has recorded more than 1.7 million Covid infections and more than 34,000 deaths.

Israel's PM made 'illegitimate use' of power,"Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently denied any wrongdoing The first witness in Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial has said he was told to make negative stories about the Israeli PM ""disappear"". Former Walla CEO Ilan Yeshua alleged he was also ordered by the news website's owner, Shaul Elovitch, to post content that attacked Mr Netanyahu's rivals. Prosecutors said Mr Netanyahu made regulatory decisions worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Mr Elovitch in return for favourable coverage. Both men have denied any wrongdoing. The prime minister, who is being tried on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases, dismissed the hearing as a ""charade"" and accused the prosecution of a ""coup attempt"". What are the allegations against him? Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM It comes as Israel's president meets parliamentarians to ask whom they support to form the next government following last month's election. The vote failed to end the long period of political stalemate that has led to four elections in two years, leaving both Mr Netanyahu's right-wing bloc and the parties opposed to him short of a majority. President Reuven Rivlin will consult party leaders this week, then nominate who he thinks has the best chance of forming a new coalition government. He has been indicted in three cases, known as 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000: Case 1,000- Fraud and breach of trust: he is accused of receiving gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours Case 2,000- Fraud and breach of trust: Mr Netanyahu is accused of offering to help improve the circulation of Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot in exchange for positive coverage Case 4,000- Bribery, fraud and breach of trust: As PM and minister of communications at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Netanyahu is accused of promoting regulatory decisions favourable to Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder in Israeli telecom giant Bezeq, in exchange for positive coverage by Mr Elovitch's Walla news site Mr Netanyahu has denied all the charges against him, branding them a ""witch-hunt"" by his political opponents, and has vowed to clear his name. This video can not be played November 2019 - Benjamin Netanyahu rails against corruption charges Dozens of Netanyahu supporters and protesters demanding his removal from office gathered outside the Jerusalem District Court as the prime minister arrived for the start of the trial's evidentiary stage. Mr Netanyahu sat with his lawyers as lead prosecutor Liat Ben Ari delivered her opening statement, describing what she called a ""substantial and serious case involving government corruption"". She alleged the prime minister made ""improper use of the major government power placed in him to demand and obtain improper benefits from the owners of major Israeli media outlets to advance his personal interests"". ""The relationship between Netanyahu and the defendants became currency, something that could be traded,"" she told the three-judge panel. ""This currency could distort a public servant's judgment."" Protesters demanding Mr Netanyahu's resignation were outside the court on Monday Afterwards, Mr Netanyahu was allowed to leave the courtroom and Mr Yeshua took the stand. The former Walla CEO's testimony is seen as key to Case 4,000, the most serious against the prime minister because it involves the bribery charge. He told the court that in late 2012 he began to receive requests from Mr Elovitch ""to make negative articles about the prime minister and his wife disappear and post articles that benefit them"". There were also ""requests to post articles against various people who were against the prime minister"", he said, including Naftali Bennett, a former protÃ©gÃ© of Mr Netanyahu who served in his cabinet from 2013 to 2020. Mr Yeshua testified that there were times when he was instructed to take down a story immediately ""because this week [Mr Netanyahu] has to sign something for me"". ""How much can you lie?"" Mr Elovitch's wife, Iris, shouted as Mr Yeshua spoke. Supporters of the prime minister also held a raucous demonstration Mr and Mrs Elovitch have been charged with bribery and obstruction of justice in connection with Case 4,000. They have denied wrongdoing. Mr Netanyahu has insisted he received nothing from Mr Elovitch and that Walla's coverage of him was negative. He has said experts supported the regulatory decisions he made, which prosecutors allege were of substantial financial value to Mr Elovitch. Several hours after Monday's hearing ended, Mr Netanyahu denounced as ""hypocrisy"" the prosecution's claim that he abused his powers. ""The entire proceeding against me was an abuse of the destructive power the prosecution holds,"" he told a news conference. ""This is how you try to topple a strong prime minister from the right wing,"" he added. ""This is what a coup attempt looks like."" He is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise, and there is currently no legal barrier to him staying in office as prime minister. And even if convicted, Mr Netanyahu would not be required to step down until the appeals process is exhausted - something that could take years. A former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stepped down as his party's leader when he was under investigation for corruption in 2008 but technically remained in office until elections the following year - polls which brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power. Mr Olmert was eventually convicted of bribery, fraud, obstruction of justice and breach of trust in connection with several cases. He served 16 months of a 27-month prison sentence.

"Twice-weekly Covid tests offered to all in EnglandThe rapid tests are being made available for free, ahead of the next stage of lockdown easing.UK","Everyone in England is to be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday, under an extension of the government's testing programme. The lateral flow kits, which can provide results in around 30 minutes, will be available for free at testing sites, pharmacies and through the post. The health secretary said it would help squash any outbreaks as lockdown eases. But critics of the programme say it risks becoming a ""scandalous"" waste of money. It comes as Boris Johnson is due to meet the cabinet to sign offthe next stage of lockdown easing in England, which will see non-essential shops reopen and pubs and restaurants start serving outdoors from 12 April. Rapid home Covid tests to be available for workers How many people have been vaccinated so far? Covid passports would be time-limited - minister Hairdressers and homeware shops reopen in Scotland Later, the prime minister will hold a Downing Street briefing, where he is expected to confirm countries will be graded under a traffic light system when international leisure travel resumes. He is also set to outline plans forcoronavirus passports- recording whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity - as a means of enabling mass-audience events to take place in the future. However, dozens of MPs oppose the use of Covid passports and Mr Johnsonfaces the prospect of a rebellionamong a number of senior Conservatives if he proceeds with them. Lateral flow tests are already available forschool children and their familiesto take at home as well as for those who have to leave home for work. The prime minister hailed the plan to offer everyone testing from 9 April, saying: ""As we continue to make good progress on our vaccine programme and with our road map cautiously easing restrictions under way, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted."" Health minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he expected the lateral flow tests to be used by those returning to work in the coming weeks as the ""economy starts opening up again"". He said fewer than one in every 1,000 lateral flow tests gave a false positive result and refused to set an ""arbitrary"" date for when testing would end. Mr Argar said the tests would be paid for as part of NHS Test and Trace's funding of Â£37bn over two years, with 80% of that expected to be used for testing. The rapid tests are aimed at those without any Covid symptoms and can be taken at home. The government introduced lateral flow testing for secondary school children and staff earlier this year, under plans to reopen classes in England by March. In February, the scheme was extended to the families of all school and college-age children in England. Kits were also offered to those who cannot work from home in the pandemic, so they can be tested twice a week. From 9 April, kits will be available through: Community testing sites operated by local authorities Collection from a nearby PCR test site during specific time windows Existing workplace testing programmes An online home ordering service with kits then delivered through the post Participating local pharmacies where a box of 7 tests can be collected to be used twice a week at home Anyone who tests positive using a lateral flow test will be expected to self-isolate along with their household. They can then order a second PCR Covid test, typically used for symptomatic cases, which will be sent off to a laboratory for analysis. If the confirmatory test comes back negative, their quarantine period is considered over immediately and they can resume normal life. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how lateral flow tests work and how to do one The schools testing programme, combined with the wider use of workplace testing, has led to a jump in the number of lateral flow tests carried out in England. There were about 250,000 rapid tests a day taken in mid-February - climbing to more than a million a day by the end of March. Dr Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 strategic response director at Public Health England, said rapid testing might find cases that would not otherwise be discovered, helping to break chains of transmission and suppress the spread of variants or mutations of coronavirus. The Department of Health said parents may wish to consider testing children under the age of 11 but the current Public Health England advice was that there was a ""limited public health benefit from testing primary school age children with lateral flow devices"". Secondary school children in England have been using lateral flow tests since all classes restarted in March Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Around one in three people who have Covid-19 show no symptoms, and as we reopen society and resume parts of life we have missed, regular rapid testing is going to be fundamental in helping us quickly spot positive cases and squash any outbreaks."" Shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said any expansion of the testing scheme must be backed by financial support so people could self-isolate, adding: ""Lack of adequate sick pay and support remains a dangerous hole in our defences against this horrific virus."" The latest data shows that, of the 4.2 million lateral flow tests taken in schools and colleges in the week from 18 to 24 March, 4,502 returned a positive result. Critics of the programme say that when rates are at low levels, it makes it hard to distinguish between actual infections and so-called ""false positives"" - an error where the test registers a positive result incorrectly. ""Mass testing is a scandalous waste of money,"" said Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University. ""When the prevalence rate of coronavirus falls as low as it is at the moment then an increasing proportion of cases are likely to be false positives meaning that cases and contacts will self isolate unnecessarily."" Prof Pollock said it is likely that mass testing ""is going to do more harm than good"" and there had been no evaluation of mass testing programmes by the government. The government requires secondary school children to take a second PCR or lab test if their first rapid lateral flow test comes back positive in school. Parents and scientists hadwarned some pupils were self-isolating unnecessarilyafter just returning to the classroom. The government said that for every 1,000 lateral flow tests carried out, there was less than one false positive result, and the rapid tests were particularly useful at detecting high levels of virus. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? In Northern Ireland, a spokesperson for the department of health said rapid testing was recently extended to private sector firms with more than 50 staff, and ""consideration may be provided to other sectors"". The Scottish government said it was expanding rapid testing in hospitals, care homes, schools and in the community to spot asymptomatic cases in high prevalence areas, while also ""considering the implications"" of the announcement in England. The Welsh government said 22% of the population already had access to regular rapid testing and this would continue to grow with the expansion of workplace and community testing programmes.

How would an NHS Covid vaccine passport app work?,"There is speculation the NHS app could be amended to include a Covid vaccine certificate As the UK gets closer to easing its coronavirus lockdowns, attention is turning to how we might safely mix again and what role tech might play. And despiteprevious denialsthat a ""Covid passport"" app was being considered, it is now on the agenda. After all the hoo-ha and costs involved in creating the contact-tracing apps last year, you might think that a very brave decision. But earlier this weekThe Times reported,externalthat the facility would be built into the existing NHS app used to access health services in England. It is distinct from the NHS Covid-19 app used by England and Wales to warn people if they might have recently been infected, and fewer people have downloaded it. But according to Google's own figures, it has been installed on more than one million Android devices (Apple does not share stats for iOS), which represents a decent start. Officially, Downing Street says the matter is still under review and it does not want to pre-empt anything by speculating on the subject. But it's clear there would be several benefits. Firstly, the NHS app, which serves patients in England only, already links up to users' GP services to give smartphone owners access to their medical records. In fact, it can already provide a record of whether some people have been given one of the coronavirus jabs, if the GP surgeries involved have shared the information. (Confusingly, this sometimes appears under the Medicines tab rather than the Immunisations one if you've had an injection and want to check yourself). So health chiefs would not need to build new IT infrastructure to get at the information. There is a risk countries develop Covid passports that rely on local systems that do not intercommunicate Secondly, the app has already tackled many of the security issues involved. To set it up you must provide your NHS number, email address, phone number and then upload either an image of your passport or driving licence. The smartphone then takes a scan of your face to check it matches the characteristics on the image on your official identification. And then, as a supplement to the automated checks, a human review takes place before you are granted access. However, there are still issues to be addressed. People would need to get to the certificate without having to hunt around several menus - possibly via a button at the bottom of the screen. And then the information would have to be presented in a format that someone else could verify quickly and easily. Another health pass app points the way to how that might be done. Tested.me displays a scannable barcode over an image of the user's face to provide employers with a means of keeping track of the health status of their staff. Of course, if the NHS app adopts a similar scheme, it will require other software to be developed so that establishments can verify a person's barcode when they present it. Tested.me presents a QR barcode over a view of the user's face to provide a quick way for employers to verify and log their health status And there are further hurdles to overcome to prevent people who have yet to be vaccinated from simply passing off a screenshot of someone else's code, with their own face edited in, to access a venue. That presupposes that it would be acceptable for businesses and other organisations to deny people access to a venue or their workplace if they have not been vaccinated. And one must bear in mind that while vaccines reduce the risk of someone getting seriously ill from at least some of the Covid-19 variants, it is still unknown how much impact they will have on people becoming infected and passing the virus on. So the point of having such an app might only be to demonstrate that you would be unlikely to get seriously ill by entering an area, rather than proving you do not pose a threat to others. A further consideration is that these ""passports"" would probably not be used for travel abroad. The World Health Organization is exploringwhat specifications an international scheme,externalwould require to work across borders and support different countries' immunisation programmes. It already oversees an International Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate. And the requirements of such a scheme might be different from those used by the NHS app. The face-scanning tech used by the NHS app is supplied by iProov One last issue is whether the government would allow third-party apps to tap into its system to offer specialised vaccine certificates of their own. These would be customised for use in certain workplaces or leisure activities, where the details could be stored alongside ticketing or other relevant non-health-related data. Identity-check technology provider iProov, whose face-scanning software is already integrated into the NHS app, is among those keen to do this. Its chief executive, Andrew Bud, pointed out that the NHS already had a mechanism to allow private apps to tap into GP records subject to strict security requirements. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? But whether ministers would want to complicate matters by allowing there to be multiple ways to present a vaccine passport is another matter. In any case, speaking to sources within NHSX - the division likely to be responsible for any digital certificate involving the NHS app in England - one thing becomes apparent: discussions about what would be involved are at a very early stage. And that means it will be many months before the idea of presenting an app to door staff to prove you have been jabbed has any chance of becoming a reality.

We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from around the world. Today's live page was edited by Rob Corp and James Clarke and written by Becky Morton, Richard Morris, George Bowden, George Wright and Mal Siret. It's been a busy bank holiday Monday for coronavirus news in the UK but we're bringing our live coverage to a close now - so here's a summary of the main stories today: India reported more than 100,000 cases in a day We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day in a few minutes. Here are some of the day's major developments from around the world: The prime minister touched on plans for the resumption of international travel during his briefing earlier, saying he was ""hopeful"" it could restart from 17 May. But Boris Johnson said the country didn't want to see the virus reimported from abroad and it was important to be ""mindful"" of the surge taking place in other parts of the world. This video can not be played As Covid-19 swept the world, so did misinformation about how to treat it. But sometimes misinformation can develop even around ideas that have some truth to them - and that can be the most difficult kind to tackle. Early or low quality research can be shared out of context online and the confusion this creates can be exploited by people promoting conspiracy theories. Our health reporter Rachel Schraer has looked into what is known - and what is not -about the use of Vitamin D in treating Covid. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent There were two documents published this afternoon, alongside the news conference hosted by the Prime Minister. The first providesan update,externalon the four reviews that have been under way in government since what ministers call their ""roadmap"" for England's unlocking was published in February. On what we'll get used to calling ""covid status certification"" there'll be no need to prove anything to go for a pint in England next Monday, nor to do so in the next stage of unlocking currently planned for 17 May. But there may be from 21 June: ""Covid status certification could potentially play a role in settings such as
theatres, nightclubs, and mass events such as festivals,"" the document says. It adds: ""It is possible that Covid status certification could also play a role in reducing social
distancing requirements in other settings which people tend to visit more frequently,
for example in hospitality settings."" The second came from the SAGE scientists who advise the government. They said the
reopening of shops, pub gardens and hairdressers from next week is ""highly
unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". But
later steps of the Prime Minister's ""roadmap"" out of lockdown,
including indoor mixing, are ""highly likely"" to lead to a resurgence
in hospitalisations and deaths, SPI-M - a subgroup of the government's
Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - predict. There is a lot of uncertainty, they say, and it is likely any resurgence would be
smaller than the peak in January. There was a plausible, though
pessimistic, scenario, however, in which opening up society could lead to
another peak the size of this winter's.  The prime minister has confirmed the next stage of lifting the lockdown can go ahead in England from 12 April. Changes from that date include: You can read more about the plans for easing lockdown across the UK over the coming monthshere. The Saudi government has said only people immunised against coronavirus will be allowed to perform the year-round umrah pilgrimage from the start of Ramadan, the holy fasting month for Muslims. Three categories of people will be considered ""immunised"" - those who have received two doses of the vaccine, those administered a single dose at least 14 days prior, and people who have recovered from the infection - according to a statement. Only those who fit into those three categories will be able to perform umrah, as well as to attend prayers in the Grand Mosque in the holy city of Mecca. Saudi Arabia has reported more than 393,000 infections and 6,700 deaths from the virus. The government says it has administered more than five million vaccines, in a country with a population of over 34 million. Senior Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, has again criticised the government's potential use of vaccine passports. He says Parliament must be given approval on whether or not domestic vaccine passports should be introduced. ""Trying to introduce these domestic vaccine passports by the back door by linking them to removing social distancing rules just won't be acceptable either,"" he states. He warns Covid passports ""will lead to a two-tier Britain and these issues need debating thoroughly and carefully before we allow them to affect the lives of our constituents."" Thailand's capital Bangkok will
close 196 entertainment venues for two weeks as the city battles a surge in coronavirus cases. The venues will be closed from tomorrow to 19 April. They all lie in three districts where some venues have been linked
to a new cluster of more than 100 people who tested positive for
Covid-19 in recent days, says Aswin Kwanmuang, governor of
the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. ""We will close entertainment venues in the three districts,
while other venues where cases are found will be individually
closed,"" Aswin said, according to the Reuters news agency. Thailand has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, with 29,321
cases and 95 deaths. This video can not be played PM: 'From Monday 12 April we will move to step two of road map' Speaking a couple of hours ago, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that from next week, two visitors will be allowed to go to care home residents, as well as hairdressers opening, pubs for outdoor drinks, shops, gyms, zoos and holiday campsites. He says further relaxation is dependent on avoiding complacency, as sickness continues to affect other countries. The travel industry has broadly welcomed plans for a risk-basedtraffic light systemwhen international travel restarts from England - but it called for more details on how this would work. Destinations will be designated either green, amber or red, with greater restrictions on travel, such as quarantine, for red and amber countries. Pre-departure and post-arrival testing will still be required for lower-risk green destinations. Heathrow
Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye says it is ""disappointing"" the opportunity has been missed to ""provide more certainty"" and calls for a ""clearer timetable"" for the return of international travel. The Airport Operators Association says ""potentially costly and onerous testing requirements"" for ""green"" destinations will limit travel options for many people. Abta, which represents travel agents and tour operators, says a priority for the industry is ""a more stable system which avoids the situation of last summer where travel to many destinations was quickly turned on and off"". Chief executive Mark Tanzer calls for clarification on how the transition between green, amber and red levels will work. But Clive Wratten, CEO of the
Business Travel Association, voices his concern more bluntly. âTodayâs
announcement from the Prime Minister is beyond disappointing,"" he says. ""We are leading
the way in vaccination and science. This is a cause of huge celebration, but,
if we are to re-start our economy, we need to have a clear pathway to
international travel and trade. This has once again been kicked down the road. ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by todayâs lack of
movement."" A passenger arrives at Malpensa Airport in Milan Italy is extending special measures that allow citizens of EU countries to quarantine for a shorter period of five days to include UK travellers. The measure, which reduces the quarantine time from 14 days, will include the UK by Wednesday this week and will last until at least 30 April. Austria and Israel are also included in Italy's list of so-called ""safe countries"", largely as a result of successful vaccination campaigns. A negative test result will be required within 72 hours before entering Italy, and again before any departure. Italy entered a strict three-day lockdown on Saturday to try to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases over Easter. Following the holiday weekend many different regions will remain in either ""orange zone"" or ""red zone"" - the highest tier - restrictions until the end of the month. Red zone restrictions normally mean all non-essential travel is banned. Labour MP and shadow health minister Justin Madders tells the BBC News Channel he thinks the announcement today is ""positive that it appears to be working so far"" and he's ""very happy that things appear to be on track"". But he adds there are some things the UK ""could be doing an awful lot better"". He says Labour ""have got concerns"" about vaccine passports, as they could have a ""major impact on everyone"" and individual liberties and freedoms. There are ""very significant questions"" about whether these are ""the right and fair thing to do"". There are ""lots of unanswered questions"" about the passports, he adds. Madders says he was ""a little bit worried"" the prime minister did not fully rule out vaccine passports for pubs and shops from 17 May. On travel, he says overseas travel is ""very difficult"" and the situation continues to change ""on a daily basis"" but he says the industry needs some assurance for the summer. He says testing is important to show people when they are ill, but he says Covid support payments, to help those to self-isolate who are on low incomes, are only available to one in eight people. Madders says eligibility needs to be expanded. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The further easing of
lockdown was expected given the data is perhaps as positive as it possibly
could be. Hospital admissions and
deaths have fallen sharply. Even infection rates â that some warned would start
rising quickly with the opening of schools â have continued to drop. With the vaccination
programme going well, the UK is certainly in a strong position compared with most. Whatâs more, the steps being
taken from 12 April are not considered particularly high risk. Itâs the return of indoor
mixing in May that is more of a worry â and then how to allow foreign travel
and big events such as live sport and music concerts. The prime minister was
careful not to make any promises on these. Government modelling suggests
a resurgence of hospital cases and deaths is still âhighly likelyâ in the
future. Thatâs because the vaccine
does not work for everyone and not all those in the at-risk groups have come
forward for a jab. Thereâs good reason to
believe this resurgence will be limited â perhaps no worse than a bad flu
season â but itâs the possibility it could be much worse that is causing the
concern. Parts of the Philippines are under tight controls to stop the spread of Covid A Filipino man who was found breaking quarantine rules has died after being made to do 300 squat-like exercises by police as punishment, his family says. Darren Manaog Penaredondo was allegedly stopped by officers while buying water after 18:00 local time in Cavite province on Thursday. He collapsed the following day and later died. Cavite province, on the island of Luzon, is currently under strict lockdown to tackle the spread of Covid. Marlo Solero, police chief of General Trias City, says there is no physical punishment for those found violating curfew rules, only lectures from officers. He tells local media thatif officers were found to have enforced the punishment, it would not be tolerated.,external A relative of the victim, Adrian Lucena, announced his death on Facebook. He says Mr Penaredondo and others found violating the curfew were told to do 100 squat-like exercises in sync together. If they failed to do them at the same time, they would have to repeat the set, he says. The group ended up doing 300 of the exercises. Mr Penaredondo came home at 06:00 on Friday morning in pain, his brother says. His live-in partner told local news outlet Rappler that hestruggled to move throughout Friday,external. ""That whole day, he struggled to walk, he was just crawling. But I did not take that seriously because he said it's just a simple body ache,"" Reichelyn Balce says. The following day he collapsed and stopped breathing. Ms Balce asked the neighbours to help revive him, but he reportedly died not long after. Read more here. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The Prime Minister hasnât yet said how
the vaccine certification system will work. But it seems likely the
governmentwill go for
an in-house solution of the NHS app, which was launched in early 2019 to
give people in England access to their GP services, and is separate to the
contact-tracing app. As this app can already give users access to their GP records, adding in
their vaccination history should be relatively simple. But with the app needing
to record a personâs broader Covid status - recent test results for those
whoâve not been vaccinated - and the need to make it more user-friendly, both
for those showing it and those checking it, there is still  plenty of work
to be done. That means there is a race to have it ready by the time all
restrictions could be lifted in England in late June. It may be tested at
various events in May, but remember what happened with the Test and Trace app
last year when a trial on the Isle of Wight showed up problems which were only
resolved with a full rollout in late September. Even if the
technology works, there will be more headaches for the government - the NHS app
only works for people in England, so it will be no use to people in other parts
of the UK and those travelling there. Then of course there is the continuing
opposition to the whole idea from right across the political spectrum. While it
looks inevitable that travel overseas will require a vaccine passport, it is
far from certain that carrying an app proving your Covid status will become
normal behaviour in the UK. On 12 April, the government is expected to release information on how international travel is expected to continue while preventing further Covid variants from spreading in the UK. No earlier than 17 May, the government is expected to announce when international travel should resume to and from the country. The government says the announcement will consider variants abroad, the speed of vaccine roll-outs both here and abroad, as well as the global picture of the virus. The taskforce is to be led by the Department for Transport and the prime minister. Moving away from Westminster now - the mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv says the city's healthcare system is ""very close"" to collapsing. ""Today our hospitals are almost completely full,"" Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Ukrayina 24 television. His comments come as new measures came into force as infections surge across the country. The new curbs include primary school closures and travel restrictions. Only essential workers such as doctors are allowed to use public transport. The country of 40 million has recorded more than 1.7 million Covid infections and more than 34,000 deaths.

The taskforce is to be led by the Department for Transport and the prime minister. Moving away from Westminster now - the mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv says the city's healthcare system is ""very close"" to collapsing. ""Today our hospitals are almost completely full,"" Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Ukrayina 24 television. His comments come as new measures came into force as infections surge across the country. The new curbs include primary school closures and travel restrictions. Only essential workers such as doctors are allowed to use public transport. The country of 40 million has recorded more than 1.7 million Covid infections and more than 34,000 deaths. There were lots of announcements in today's Downing Street briefing so here's a quick summary of the main points: Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from around the world. Today's live page was edited by Rob Corp and James Clarke and written by Becky Morton, Richard Morris, George Bowden, George Wright and Mal Siret. It's been a busy bank holiday Monday for coronavirus news in the UK but we're bringing our live coverage to a close now - so here's a summary of the main stories today: India reported more than 100,000 cases in a day We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day in a few minutes. Here are some of the day's major developments from around the world: The prime minister touched on plans for the resumption of international travel during his briefing earlier, saying he was ""hopeful"" it could restart from 17 May. But Boris Johnson said the country didn't want to see the virus reimported from abroad and it was important to be ""mindful"" of the surge taking place in other parts of the world. This video can not be played As Covid-19 swept the world, so did misinformation about how to treat it. But sometimes misinformation can develop even around ideas that have some truth to them - and that can be the most difficult kind to tackle. Early or low quality research can be shared out of context online and the confusion this creates can be exploited by people promoting conspiracy theories. Our health reporter Rachel Schraer has looked into what is known - and what is not -about the use of Vitamin D in treating Covid. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent There were two documents published this afternoon, alongside the news conference hosted by the Prime Minister. The first providesan update,externalon the four reviews that have been under way in government since what ministers call their ""roadmap"" for England's unlocking was published in February. On what we'll get used to calling ""covid status certification"" there'll be no need to prove anything to go for a pint in England next Monday, nor to do so in the next stage of unlocking currently planned for 17 May. But there may be from 21 June: ""Covid status certification could potentially play a role in settings such as
theatres, nightclubs, and mass events such as festivals,"" the document says. It adds: ""It is possible that Covid status certification could also play a role in reducing social
distancing requirements in other settings which people tend to visit more frequently,
for example in hospitality settings."" The second came from the SAGE scientists who advise the government. They said the
reopening of shops, pub gardens and hairdressers from next week is ""highly
unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". But
later steps of the Prime Minister's ""roadmap"" out of lockdown,
including indoor mixing, are ""highly likely"" to lead to a resurgence
in hospitalisations and deaths, SPI-M - a subgroup of the government's
Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - predict. There is a lot of uncertainty, they say, and it is likely any resurgence would be
smaller than the peak in January. There was a plausible, though
pessimistic, scenario, however, in which opening up society could lead to
another peak the size of this winter's.  The prime minister has confirmed the next stage of lifting the lockdown can go ahead in England from 12 April. Changes from that date include: You can read more about the plans for easing lockdown across the UK over the coming monthshere. The Saudi government has said only people immunised against coronavirus will be allowed to perform the year-round umrah pilgrimage from the start of Ramadan, the holy fasting month for Muslims. Three categories of people will be considered ""immunised"" - those who have received two doses of the vaccine, those administered a single dose at least 14 days prior, and people who have recovered from the infection - according to a statement. Only those who fit into those three categories will be able to perform umrah, as well as to attend prayers in the Grand Mosque in the holy city of Mecca. Saudi Arabia has reported more than 393,000 infections and 6,700 deaths from the virus. The government says it has administered more than five million vaccines, in a country with a population of over 34 million. Senior Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, has again criticised the government's potential use of vaccine passports. He says Parliament must be given approval on whether or not domestic vaccine passports should be introduced. ""Trying to introduce these domestic vaccine passports by the back door by linking them to removing social distancing rules just won't be acceptable either,"" he states. He warns Covid passports ""will lead to a two-tier Britain and these issues need debating thoroughly and carefully before we allow them to affect the lives of our constituents."" Thailand's capital Bangkok will
close 196 entertainment venues for two weeks as the city battles a surge in coronavirus cases. The venues will be closed from tomorrow to 19 April. They all lie in three districts where some venues have been linked
to a new cluster of more than 100 people who tested positive for
Covid-19 in recent days, says Aswin Kwanmuang, governor of
the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. ""We will close entertainment venues in the three districts,
while other venues where cases are found will be individually
closed,"" Aswin said, according to the Reuters news agency. Thailand has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, with 29,321
cases and 95 deaths. This video can not be played PM: 'From Monday 12 April we will move to step two of road map' Speaking a couple of hours ago, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that from next week, two visitors will be allowed to go to care home residents, as well as hairdressers opening, pubs for outdoor drinks, shops, gyms, zoos and holiday campsites. He says further relaxation is dependent on avoiding complacency, as sickness continues to affect other countries. The travel industry has broadly welcomed plans for a risk-basedtraffic light systemwhen international travel restarts from England - but it called for more details on how this would work. Destinations will be designated either green, amber or red, with greater restrictions on travel, such as quarantine, for red and amber countries. Pre-departure and post-arrival testing will still be required for lower-risk green destinations. Heathrow
Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye says it is ""disappointing"" the opportunity has been missed to ""provide more certainty"" and calls for a ""clearer timetable"" for the return of international travel. The Airport Operators Association says ""potentially costly and onerous testing requirements"" for ""green"" destinations will limit travel options for many people. Abta, which represents travel agents and tour operators, says a priority for the industry is ""a more stable system which avoids the situation of last summer where travel to many destinations was quickly turned on and off"". Chief executive Mark Tanzer calls for clarification on how the transition between green, amber and red levels will work. But Clive Wratten, CEO of the
Business Travel Association, voices his concern more bluntly. âTodayâs
announcement from the Prime Minister is beyond disappointing,"" he says. ""We are leading
the way in vaccination and science. This is a cause of huge celebration, but,
if we are to re-start our economy, we need to have a clear pathway to
international travel and trade. This has once again been kicked down the road. ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by todayâs lack of
movement."" A passenger arrives at Malpensa Airport in Milan Italy is extending special measures that allow citizens of EU countries to quarantine for a shorter period of five days to include UK travellers. The measure, which reduces the quarantine time from 14 days, will include the UK by Wednesday this week and will last until at least 30 April. Austria and Israel are also included in Italy's list of so-called ""safe countries"", largely as a result of successful vaccination campaigns. A negative test result will be required within 72 hours before entering Italy, and again before any departure. Italy entered a strict three-day lockdown on Saturday to try to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases over Easter. Following the holiday weekend many different regions will remain in either ""orange zone"" or ""red zone"" - the highest tier - restrictions until the end of the month. Red zone restrictions normally mean all non-essential travel is banned. Labour MP and shadow health minister Justin Madders tells the BBC News Channel he thinks the announcement today is ""positive that it appears to be working so far"" and he's ""very happy that things appear to be on track"". But he adds there are some things the UK ""could be doing an awful lot better"". He says Labour ""have got concerns"" about vaccine passports, as they could have a ""major impact on everyone"" and individual liberties and freedoms. There are ""very significant questions"" about whether these are ""the right and fair thing to do"". There are ""lots of unanswered questions"" about the passports, he adds. Madders says he was ""a little bit worried"" the prime minister did not fully rule out vaccine passports for pubs and shops from 17 May. On travel, he says overseas travel is ""very difficult"" and the situation continues to change ""on a daily basis"" but he says the industry needs some assurance for the summer. He says testing is important to show people when they are ill, but he says Covid support payments, to help those to self-isolate who are on low incomes, are only available to one in eight people. Madders says eligibility needs to be expanded. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The further easing of
lockdown was expected given the data is perhaps as positive as it possibly
could be. Hospital admissions and
deaths have fallen sharply. Even infection rates â that some warned would start
rising quickly with the opening of schools â have continued to drop. With the vaccination
programme going well, the UK is certainly in a strong position compared with most. Whatâs more, the steps being
taken from 12 April are not considered particularly high risk. Itâs the return of indoor
mixing in May that is more of a worry â and then how to allow foreign travel
and big events such as live sport and music concerts. The prime minister was
careful not to make any promises on these. Government modelling suggests
a resurgence of hospital cases and deaths is still âhighly likelyâ in the
future. Thatâs because the vaccine
does not work for everyone and not all those in the at-risk groups have come
forward for a jab. Thereâs good reason to
believe this resurgence will be limited â perhaps no worse than a bad flu
season â but itâs the possibility it could be much worse that is causing the
concern. Parts of the Philippines are under tight controls to stop the spread of Covid A Filipino man who was found breaking quarantine rules has died after being made to do 300 squat-like exercises by police as punishment, his family says. Darren Manaog Penaredondo was allegedly stopped by officers while buying water after 18:00 local time in Cavite province on Thursday. He collapsed the following day and later died. Cavite province, on the island of Luzon, is currently under strict lockdown to tackle the spread of Covid. Marlo Solero, police chief of General Trias City, says there is no physical punishment for those found violating curfew rules, only lectures from officers. He tells local media thatif officers were found to have enforced the punishment, it would not be tolerated.,external A relative of the victim, Adrian Lucena, announced his death on Facebook. He says Mr Penaredondo and others found violating the curfew were told to do 100 squat-like exercises in sync together. If they failed to do them at the same time, they would have to repeat the set, he says. The group ended up doing 300 of the exercises. Mr Penaredondo came home at 06:00 on Friday morning in pain, his brother says. His live-in partner told local news outlet Rappler that hestruggled to move throughout Friday,external. ""That whole day, he struggled to walk, he was just crawling. But I did not take that seriously because he said it's just a simple body ache,"" Reichelyn Balce says. The following day he collapsed and stopped breathing. Ms Balce asked the neighbours to help revive him, but he reportedly died not long after. Read more here. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The Prime Minister hasnât yet said how
the vaccine certification system will work. But it seems likely the
governmentwill go for
an in-house solution of the NHS app, which was launched in early 2019 to
give people in England access to their GP services, and is separate to the
contact-tracing app. As this app can already give users access to their GP records, adding in
their vaccination history should be relatively simple. But with the app needing
to record a personâs broader Covid status - recent test results for those
whoâve not been vaccinated - and the need to make it more user-friendly, both
for those showing it and those checking it, there is still  plenty of work
to be done. That means there is a race to have it ready by the time all
restrictions could be lifted in England in late June. It may be tested at
various events in May, but remember what happened with the Test and Trace app
last year when a trial on the Isle of Wight showed up problems which were only
resolved with a full rollout in late September. Even if the
technology works, there will be more headaches for the government - the NHS app
only works for people in England, so it will be no use to people in other parts
of the UK and those travelling there. Then of course there is the continuing
opposition to the whole idea from right across the political spectrum. While it
looks inevitable that travel overseas will require a vaccine passport, it is
far from certain that carrying an app proving your Covid status will become
normal behaviour in the UK. On 12 April, the government is expected to release information on how international travel is expected to continue while preventing further Covid variants from spreading in the UK. No earlier than 17 May, the government is expected to announce when international travel should resume to and from the country. The government says the announcement will consider variants abroad, the speed of vaccine roll-outs both here and abroad, as well as the global picture of the virus.
