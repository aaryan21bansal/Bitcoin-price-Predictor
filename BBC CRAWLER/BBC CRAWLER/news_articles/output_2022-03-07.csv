NHS dental practices 'may struggle financially',"Health service-committed practices are ""overstretched and underfunded"", the BDA says Northern Ireland dental practices that provide NHS services may ""struggle to remain financially viable"", the British Dental Association (BDA) has said. The body has warned they are becoming ""increasingly reliant"" on private work to maintain health service dentistry within their practices. The BDA has launched its manifesto ahead of the assembly elections in May. It said that fees provided for NHS care have fallen by ""as much as a quarter in real terms"" in the last 10 years. The chair of the BDA's Northern Ireland Council, Roz McMullan, said an ""ambitious oral health strategy"" is needed. ""Northern Ireland's dentists are working to a financial model that no longer adds up,"" she said. The Department of Health said the uplift in fee levels each year is informed by the recommendations from the UK wide Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) and that its recommendations have been implemented in full since 2016/17. On Monday evening, the BDA said it was ""gutted"" at the outcome of talks with the Department of Health and the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB). It described new funding arrangements announced for general dental services as ""totally inadequate"". The body hoped for a bigger increase in fees to help practices facing financial pressures but said a proposed 25% enhancement to dental fees left NHS dentists ""worried for the future"". Earlier, Ms McMullan said dentists were ""overstretched and underfunded"" ""Health service-committed practices are struggling to remain financially viable,"" she added. ""Colleagues feel they are being pushed out of NHS dentistry - at the very time we face a huge Covid backlog. ""We all need to know this service has a future, because otherwise the UK's deepest oral health inequalities will only widen."" Ms McMullan said the association was calling on politicians to ensure that NHS dentistry is a priority in the next mandate. In an interview with BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster on Monday, she warned that there was ""a real possibility"" that access to NHS dentistry for all is at risk. Ms McMullan said the fees paid to dentists for NHS work had gone down by 40% in real terms since 2009. ""It got to the point where the more NHS work a practice did, the less was the income,"" she said. But Ms McMullan said dentists wanted to remain positive. Dental disease often affects those less advantaged in society, she said. ""We are passionate that they can retain access to a preventative-based dental treatment. ""We have to look at a new way of delivering dentistry that all people can access at the time they need it for NHS dentistry."" Group meets over rebuilding dental services in NI In a statement, the department said dentists were ""not sheltered from fluctuations in operating costs and given the current rate of inflation those costs have increased"". ""It is expected that this will be taken into account in the next publication of the DDRB report due in June 2022, the recommendations of which will be given full consideration,"" it continued. ""In December 2021 the minister established the General Dental Services Contract Reform group to develop of options for a new contract for General Dental Services. ""One of the primary objectives of any new contract is that, when considered in isolation to private care, it is financially viable and attractive to providers."" The British Dental Association has also called for investment in increased places at the School of Dentistry at Queen's University. Last year, the number of allocated undergraduate places in Northern Ireland remained fixed at 60, according to figures from the Office for Students. There was a 10% increase in the number of allocated undergraduate places in England in the same period.

Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar,"Petrol prices have hit another record high as oil and gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled. It came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, as it looked to other countries to increase supplies. However, European leaders rejected that idea on Monday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. And Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said: ""The painful reality is we are still very much dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil and if you now force European companies to quit doing business with Russia that would have enormous ramifications around Europe including Ukraine but also around the world. ""We have to reduce our dependency. That will take time,"" he added. UK petrol prices have hit an average of 155p a litre, the AA motoring group said. The market turmoil is fuelling concerns that the price of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating,already rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, could be pushed higher. Analysts have already warned that UK energy bills could reach as high as Â£3,000 a yeardue to the surge in oil and gas prices. Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. The price of Brent crude rose by more than a fifth last week amid fears of a reduction in Russian supplies. After peaking at $139.13 a barrel early on Monday, the price of Brent crude - an international benchmark - fell back to around $125. Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' EU mulls weaponising energy in Russia crisis The latest rise in UK petrol prices has pushed the cost to more than Â£7 a gallon, the AA said. Filling up a car with a 55-litre tank now costs nearly Â£17 more than a year ago, rising from Â£68.60 to Â£85.59. The boss of fuel delivery firm Portland Fuel, James Spencer, told the BBC he thought fuel prices could reach Â£1.70-Â£1.75 a litre. ""Even if we can get extra [oil] supplies on to the market, nothing will happen quickly."" He said that, to a certain extent, individual car drivers have options to cut their use by driving less, but added that businesses that have no alternatives were really starting to feel the squeeze. The crisis continues to affect share markets. The main stock exchanges in France and Germany sank more than 4% in early trading before paring their losses, closing 1.3% and 2% lower respectively. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped more than 2%, but then recovered to close 0.4% lower. Last week, the FTSE had its worse week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. In the US, markets ended lower with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 2.4% and 3% respectively. The Dow is now in a ""correction"", having fallen 10% since its last record closing level on 4 January. The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months. These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us. The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to Â£100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK. But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above Â£6 per therm. If in the first half of this year these prices average Â£3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to Â£3,000 a year or Â£250 a month. On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies. The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. ""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights. Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies. On Sunday, energy giantShell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oildespite the invasion of Ukraine. The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe. ""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added. A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports. However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.

Ed Sheeran appears at High Court copyright trial,"Ed Sheeran gave evidence at the High Court on Monday Ed Sheeran has told the High Court he does not ""borrow"" ideas from unknown songwriters without credit. The singer-songwriter has been accused by two other songwriters of copying parts of his 2017 hit Shape Of You. Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue's barrister suggested Sheeran treated lesser-known songwriters differently from famous ones. Sheeran denied this, telling the court he had cleared parts of songs with ""lots"" of unknown artists. Shape of You was number one for 14 weeks in the UK in 2017, becoming the best-selling song of the year around the world. Allow YouTube content?

On Friday, their barrister Andrew Sutcliffe QC claimed Sheeran ""borrows ideas and throws them into his songs, sometimes he will acknowledge it but sometimes he won't"". But Sheeran denied the claim that he is a ""magpie"" who lifts other people's work without acknowledgment, pointing out that he has often shared credit with lesser-known artists, including Shivers and Visiting Hours, and a song that sampled an ""unknown composer's"" work from Buffy The Vampire Slayer. ""All those examples are not famous artists that we've cleared songs with and that's what I have to say on that,"" he told the court. Sami Chokri performs under the name Sami Switch Sheeran created Shape of You with co-writers Steve Mac - real name Steven McCutcheon - and Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid, both of whom were also in court. After its release,Sheeran added the team behind TLC's 1999 single No Scrubsto the song's writing credits after some commentators pointed out similarities. On Monday, Mr Sutcliffe told the star: ""The evidence is overwhelming that at the time of writing Shape of You, your songwriting process involved collecting ideas."" Sheeran replied: ""You say it's overwhelming, I don't agree with that."" In written evidence, the singer said the contested element of Shape of You was ""very short"", and the relevant parts of both songs were ""entirely commonplace"". He said: ""Even so, if I had heard Oh Why at the time and had referenced it, I would have taken steps to clear it."" He added: ""I have always tried to be completely fair in crediting anyone who makes any contribution to any song I write. ""I do refer to other works on occasion when I write, as do many songwriters. If there is a reference to another work, I notify my team so that steps can be taken to obtain clearance. ""I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly."" Dressed in a sharp black suit, Ed Sheeran is firm, determined and just a little bit irritated on the stand as lawyers for Chokri and O'Donoghue deconstruct his songwriting process, looking for hints that he might take inspiration from outside sources. Sheeran testifies that he mostly works in collaboration with other writers, and that it's often hard to identify who has written each individual part of a song once it's finished. Referencing his Shape of You co-writer Johnny McDaid, he says: ""My and Johnny's writing partnership is very much like a game of tennis. He'll say something and I'll say something back. We're quite quick when we go back and forth."" Asked repeatedly whether he is responsible for the chorus to his 2015 song Photograph, Sheeran replies tersely: ""I honestly couldn't tell you. I don't know. We wrote the song together."" It's a phrase he returns to several times throughout the morning's questioning. Photograph is relevant because it was the subject of a separate copyright claim from Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, who wrote Matt Cardle's 2011 single Amazing. The duo were eventually given a share of the song's royalties and a Â£4m lump sum in an out-of-court settlement. Sheeran says he settled the claim because it was a ""nuisance"" and ""more trouble than it was worth"". Asked why he would pay out such a ""substantial"" sum instead of taking the case to court, he says he did so on the advice of his lawyers. Mr Sutcliffe said Sheeran had known about Chokri before Shape Of You was written because the grime artist had tweeted Sheeran directly, and the singer had given a shout out to Sami Switch on stage in 2011. But Sheeran replied: ""This isn't stuff that's true."" Chokri had also appeared on YouTube channel SBTV at around the same time as Sheeran, who described its founder Jamal Edwards as his ""best friend"". But he said the music entrepreneur,who died last month, didn't share songs like Oh Why with him. Instead, the pair would ""talk about football, talk about his mum, talk about theatre"", he said. Sheeran was also asked about his role as a talent-spotter for his own label Gingerbread Man Records. He denied being aware of Oh Why, saying he had just signed Jamie Lawson to the label and ""wasn't looking for anyone else"" to work with. The musician told the court he quit social media in 2015, adding that for ""the whole of 2016"" he was ""off"" social media and was using a ""flip phone from Tesco"". In May 2018, Sheeran and his co-writers issued proceedings asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O'Donoghue's copyright. The pair then issued a counter claim for copyright infringement. The trial is expected to continue for about three weeks.

McDonald's and Coca-Cola boycott calls grow,"Pressure is growing on Western food and drink giants to pull out of Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. McDonald's and Coca-Cola have been criticised on social media for failing to speak out about the attacks and continuing to operate in the country. Well-known firms includingNetflix and Levi's have already suspended salesor stopped providing services in Russia. McDonald's and Coca-Cola have not responded to the BBC's request for comment. #BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaCola were trending on Twitter on Monday and over the weekend respectively. Dragon's Den investor Deborah Meaden also spoke out on social media against the fizzy drinks company, urging people to stop drinking its products. Allow Twitter content?

The criticism comes amid calls for other well-known Western firms such as KFC, Pepsi, Starbucks and Burger King to close their outlets and stop sales in Russia. However, most firms have stayed silent on the issue with Pepsi, Starbucks and Burger King also declining to respond to the BBC's requests for comment. Fast food chain KFC did not respond initially but its owner Yum Brands, which also owns Pizza Hut, has since announced that it has suspended future investments in Russia. Yum Brands is the world's second-biggest restaurant chain, and there are about 1,000 KFC outlets and 50 Pizza Hut restaurants in Russia. The company was not pulling out entirely, but Yum said that it would ""redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts"". It is also donating $1m (Â£762,000) to the Red Cross. Many of the firms the BBC has contacted have a large number of stores in the country. In recently-published informationon its website,external, McDonald's said that it has 847 stores in Russia. The company also owns the majority of these outlets, whereas across the rest of the world most are typically operated by franchisees. Both McDonald's and Pepsi, who have had a presence in Russia for decades, have also been singled out by the boss of New York state's pension fund. The oldest Russian McDonald's branch, off Pushkin Square in central Moscow, opened in 1990. Thomas DiNapoli, comptroller of the New York state common retirement fund, wrote letters to the companies, according to Reuters reports, urging them to review their businesses in Russia because they face ""significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks"". Often, franchise owners will be able to take the decision as to whether or not to shut chains down, depending on terms of agreements they might have with big food chains like KFC or Starbucks. In a recent statement, Kevin Johnson, the boss of Starbucks, described attacks on Ukraine as ""unprovoked"" and ""unjust"". But most of its sites in Russia remain open, according to its website. Most of these franchises are run by the Kuwait-based Alshaya Group. Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis, said McDonald's and Coca-Cola were ""very complicated businesses"", which would not make it easy to make a decision to leave Russia quickly. She told the BBC's Today programme that Coca-Cola had an ""incredibly complicated structure"" with bottling plants in Russia. ""I don't think it's as simple as saying can you just pull out of Russia,"" she said. ""These are complicated businesses and there's a lot to consider, but right now the reputation risk could really hit their share prices so they may have no choice going forward."" But Dr Ian Peters, director of the Institute for Business Ethics, told BBC News: ""This is not a time to sit on the fence. ""The world is likely to judge companies by what they do in such circumstances, and ethical judgement will be as important as complying with any government-led regulations and sanctions."" He said that most firms would have what they refer to as an ""ethical compass"" they use to make big decisions. ""We would advise firms in such circumstances always to look at the bigger picture and seek to do the right thing, putting the wider interest above short-term profit,"" he added. He cited important ethical dilemmas that might come up for companies when considering to suspend operations in Russia too: What duty of care do these companies hold to employees on the ground? Is it fair to deprive Russian citizens of basic goods? Professor of business ethics at Henley Business School, Kleio Akrivou, suggested that these types of decisions might be more difficult to reach for food companies than, say, consulting firms. ""When it comes to sanctions which deprive the Russian population of its basic goods and dignity, firms may need to approach the situation more thoughtfully, with an appeal to practical reason."" She said now is the time for fast food giants to balance how real people are affected by such moves, alongside any reputational risk.

UK calls for 'step-by-step' move from Russian fuel,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says no European country had done more than the UK to settle vulnerable people since 2015 Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas as a result of the Ukraine war. After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives. Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have ""enormous consequences"". And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas. In a statement, he said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. Will Russia's invasion push up gas bills? Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar Is the UK doing enough to help refugees? Ukrainians on way to UK hit paperwork dead-end in Calais Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. ""Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine. Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are ""moving very, very fast"" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are ""now very much on the table"". He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%. Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be ""diligent and not overnight"", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy. An immediate change would ""basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,"" he said, adding: ""It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself."" Mr Johnson also announced a further Â£175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials. Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Johnson said previously unthinkable options for Western leaders were now ""very much on the table"" Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday. During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""processing thousands"" and would be ""very generous"" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Will new legal powers find Putin's loot? The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry. Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict. But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a ""complete mess"" and the government must establish a ""simple route to sanctuary"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was ""not doing anywhere near enough"" to help refugees. More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Home Office is in a ""complete mess"" over how Ukrainians can get to the UK Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals. In recent days, the government has announced asset freezes and travel bans on a number of oligarchs - but hasfaced accusations of being too slowto sanction those with links to President Putin.

Day 12 of Russia's war in Ukraine explained,"This video can not be played Jeremy Bowen was on the frontline in Irpin as residents came under Russian fire while trying to flee On day 12 of the invasion, there was no let-up in the Russian shelling of major population centres, despite a proposal from Moscow to create safe escape routes. Mariupol, Volnovakha, Sumy and Kharkiv spent another day under fierce attack, which prevented the evacuation of civilians, said Ukraine's foreign ministry. Russia said earlier that humanitarian corridors would allow people to leave some of the threatened areas. But Ukraine branded the proposal ""immoral"" after it emerged many of the routes would only take civilians to Russia or its ally, Belarus. It urged all countries to put pressure on Moscow for a ceasefire. The mayor of Irpin, a beleaguered town on the north-western outskirts of Kyiv, said 1,000 people had been taken to safety. He said Ukrainian forces had repelled Russian attacks and they had pulled back. Residents of Irpin have been fleeing the Russian assault on their city, which is half an hour's drive from the capital. You can read Orla Guerin's account of their struggle here. The Ukrainians said other towns in the area, including Bucha and Hostomel, were in Russian hands and the situation was critical. Rescue workers say at least 13 people were killed when an air strike hit an industrial bakery west of the capital, Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said everyone who commits atrocities against Ukraine's civilians will be punished. He said Ukrainians would not forgive or forgetand accused invading Russian troops of deliberate murder. ""There will be no quiet place on Earth for you. Except for the grave,"" the president said. Ukrainian officials say Russia is striking civilian targets around the country, including hospitals, nurseries and schools. But Russia denies targeting civilians, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" against Ukrainian ""nationalists"" and ""neo-Nazis"". Meanwhile, delegations from Russia and Ukraine have held a third round of talks in Belarus with little progress. Contacts between the two sides have so far come to nothing, with Russia insisting it will only stop the invasion if Ukraine meets all its demands. Russian troops have surrounded the perimeter of the plant More than 100 workers at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant - the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 - have been stuck there for more than 12 days, unable to leave after Russian forces seized the plant on the first day of the invasion. Another 200 Ukrainian guards, who'd been in charge of security at the time of the assault, also remain trapped. Workers continue to go about their duties and the atmosphere is said to be calm, butthe BBC has been told that the conditions inside are difficult, with food and medicine limited. Dusia Kostiuk, 91, travelled from Kharkiv to Lviv on her way to Poland Despite the fierce fighting, huge numbers of Ukrainians are on the move. The western city of Lviv has reached the limit of its capacity to help refugees displaced by the Russian invasion, its mayor, Andriy Sadoviy, said on Monday. Hundreds of thousands of displaced people have flowed into Lviv since the invasion began, putting a huge strain on the city's resources. Among them was 91-year-old Dusia Kostiuk, who spent 27 hours on a train from the heavily bombed city of Kharkiv. ""Our house was still there when we left but shelling was happening all around and we were told that terrible shelling is happening there now,""she told the BBC's Joel Gunter. ""We didn't take anything with us, I took two dresses and that's it. ""I was born and raised in Kharkiv. I didn't really travel before, I don't like to travel. I never thought I would leave my home like this."" This video can not be played Watch: The children with cancer fleeing war in Ukraine More than 1.7 million Ukrainianshave so far fled the war-torn country, The vast majority of them - more than one million - are heading to neighbouring Poland. Others are crossing to neighbouring countries to the west, such as Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova. Among the refugees are Ukrainian children with cancer. They are being evacuated by non-governmental organization Herosi, co-ordinated by the US-based St Jude Children's Research Hospital. Efforts are under way to find the patients places in medical care centres across Europe. Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak is facing disciplinary proceedings by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) for displaying the letter ""Z"" on the podium next to a Ukrainian rival in Qatar. But what does the symbol mean? In Russia, the ""Z"" is fast becoming seen as a staunchly pro-war symbol of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine. It has been sported by politicians, seen on the sides of cars, vans and advertising hoardings - as well as daubed on bus shelters. It has even been used by Serbs at pro-Russian demonstration in Belgrade. Photographs have been widely shared on social media. You can read more about it here. On the global financial markets, the impact of the war is still being felt. Oil and gas costs have been soaringamid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Oil jumped to $139 (Â£106) a barrel at one point on Monday, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled. The price surge came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, with other countries urged to increase supplies. However, not all EU countries are ready to enforce such a ban. Big powers Germany and Italy - far more reliant on Russian energy than most - feel more threatened by the prospect of skyrocketing energy prices that would surely follow any sanctions on Russian oil or gas imports,as the BBC's Katya Adler reports.

Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war symbol?,"Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak is facing disciplinary proceedings by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) for displaying the letter ""Z"" on the podium next to a Ukrainian rival in Qatar. But what does the symbol mean? In Russia, the ""Z"" is fast becoming seen as a staunchly pro-war symbol of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine. It has been sported by politicians, seen on the sides of cars, vans and advertising hoardings - as well as daubed on bus shelters. It has even been used by Serbs at pro-Russian demonstration in Belgrade. Photographs have been widely shared on social media. It has become a social media conversation, says Aglaya Snetkova, a lecturer in international politics at the School of Slavonic and Eastern European Studies at UCL. ""In many ways, this shows the extent to which Russia is, or has been, very much part of the global world."" While zed in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet is written differently - and looks like a 3 - most Russians recognise Latin letters. Emily Ferris - Russia and Eurasia research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) - says the ""Z"" is a powerful and easily recognisable symbol. ""Often with propaganda the simplest things catch on the quickest,"" she says. ""It looks rather intimidating and quite stark. From an aesthetic perspective, it's a very powerful symbol."" It has taken less than a fortnight for the ""Z"" to spread among those supportive of President Putin's invasion. In the central Russian city of Kazan, about 60 children and staff at a hospice were photographed outside in the snow forming a giant ""Z"" in front of their building. Several theories have circulated as to what the ""Z"" symbol actually means. It first caught attention on social media after Russian tanks with ""Zs"" on the side were spotted en route to Ukraine. Initially, it was thought that the ""Z"" was in fact a number ""2"" - representing the 22 February (22/02/2022). That was the day Russia ratified an agreement on ""friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance"" with the self-proclaimed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk. But it is now believed the symbol is simply a way for Russia's military to identify its own forces. Last week, viewers to a news programme on Russia's state-controlled Channel One were told that a ""Z"" was a common marking on Russian military equipment. The Orthodox Christian pro-Putin website Tsargrad told readers the simple marking could ""avoid friendly fire"" and couldn't be ""mixed up with anything else"". Russian special forces veteran Sergey Kuvykin told the Russian magazine website, Life, that different symbols signified different military units. ""Symbols like these are used - a 'Z' in a square, a 'Z' in a circle, a 'Z' with a star or simply 'Z' on its own."" He said the markings helped make sure that troops, who might not be in contact with other comrades, were where they should be. Russian warplanes fly too quickly to see the daubed white markings, says US Air Force Lt Col Tyson Wetzel - a senior Air Force fellow with The Atlantic Council think tank. But, in an interview with theTask and Purpose,externalwebsite, he agrees the ""Zs"" are a ""de-confliction measure to help prevent fratricide"" - friendly fire from Russian attack helicopters or artillery. The spread of ""Z"" in Russia has not only been because of social media spontaneity - cautions Aglaya Snetkov from UCL. ""It has also been pushed by the regime."" One Russian politician, Maria Butina, shared a video of how to write the ""Z"" insignia on a business jacket - she explains - ""so you can go into work and show it to everyone without shouting about it."" But Ms Snetkov says the symbol shouldn't be seen as fascist. ""There are lots of memes transforming the 'Z' into a swastika, but that's done by people who want to push back against the regime."" And there are other symbols appearing, too. The letter ""V"" for instance - also not in the Cyrillic alphabet - appears in posts on theofficial Instagram account,externalof the Russian department of defence, alongside images of ""Zs"". There are written captions. ""Za PatsanoV"" reads one, meaning ""for the lads"" - while another says ""Sila V pravde"", which translates into English as ""strength in truth"". One theory is that the two Latin letters might stand for ""vostok"", meaning east, and ""zapad"", meaning west. But onsocial media,external, it has also been suggested that the Ukrainian military believes the ""Z"" refers to Russia's ""Eastern Forces"" - and the ""V"" to the ""Naval infantry"".

Large fire at high-rise London tower block,"This video can not be played Debris falls from burning tower block About 60 people were evacuated from a tower block in east London after a large fire broke out. More than 125 firefighters tackled the blaze at the high-rise block of flats and offices on Whitechapel High Street, in Aldgate East, on Monday afternoon. Large flames could be seen fanning out of the 17th floor of the building and footage showed burning debris had fallen to the ground. A 64m (210ft) ladder - Europe's largest - was used. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said a woman had to be given ""fire survival advice"" until firefighters got to her as she was trapped on the 17th floor. Station commander Chris Jenner, who was at the scene, said: ""Fire crews used a fire escape hood to help lead the woman to safety via the internal staircase."" A fire escape hood offers up to 15 minutes protection from four of the main fire gases (carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen chloride and acrolein). They do not provide oxygen but temporarily filter toxic smoke to make breathing easier, LFB said. The fire was on the 17th floor of the block of flats and offices London Ambulance Service said two patients were taken to hospital while two others were checked over at the scene. The blaze also affected balconies on the 18th and 19th floors. It was put out by about 19:00 GMT, LFB confirmed. Lynn Ling, 25, lives on the 20th floor of the tower block with her husband Yuri. Ms Ling said: ""I did not hear an alarm. I think there was a fire alarm on the ground floor but I could not hear it clearly on the 20th. ""I went out of my door but I found there was smoke in the corridor so I went downstairs. I forgot to take my coat. It was very scary."" Allow Twitter content?

The fire service said the cause of the blaze was not yet known. Mr Jennar said: ""We mobilised a 64 metre turntable ladder to the scene. This is the tallest firefighting ladder in Europe and allowed us to get water on to the fire from outside the building. ""The professionalism, hard work and quick actions of control officers and firefighters limited the damage to the block and prevented serious injuries."" The building is a 22-storey mixed use development of commercial office space and 207 residential apartments, according to property developer Hondo Enterprises, which sold the building in 2018. It is located over Aldgate East Tube Station between the City - the financial heart of London - and neighbourhoods Aldgate and Spitalfields.

PM calls for 'step-by-step' move from Russian fuel,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says no European country had done more than the UK to settle vulnerable people since 2015 Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas as a result of the Ukraine war. After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives. Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have ""enormous consequences"". And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas. In a statement, he said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. Will Russia's invasion push up gas bills? Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar Is the UK doing enough to help refugees? Ukrainians on way to UK hit paperwork dead-end in Calais Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. ""Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine. Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are ""moving very, very fast"" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are ""now very much on the table"". He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%. Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be ""diligent and not overnight"", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy. An immediate change would ""basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,"" he said, adding: ""It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself."" Mr Johnson also announced a further Â£175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials. Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Johnson said previously unthinkable options for Western leaders were now ""very much on the table"" Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday. During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""processing thousands"" and would be ""very generous"" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Will new legal powers find Putin's loot? The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry. Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict. But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a ""complete mess"" and the government must establish a ""simple route to sanctuary"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was ""not doing anywhere near enough"" to help refugees. More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Home Office is in a ""complete mess"" over how Ukrainians can get to the UK Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals. In recent days, the government has announced asset freezes and travel bans on a number of oligarchs - but hasfaced accusations of being too slowto sanction those with links to President Putin.

Missing airman had binge-drink problem - inquest,"Corrie Mckeague went missing after a night out in September 2016 An airman who vanished following a night out developed a ""significant binge-drinking problem"" after a friend died on a railway line when he was a teenager, an inquest heard. Corrie Mckeague, from Dunfermline, was 23 when he vanished in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September 2016. Police believe he died after climbing into a waste bin after a night out. The inquest, due to last four weeks, is being held at Suffolk Coroner's Court in Ipswich. The last confirmed sighting of Mr Mckeague was at 03:25 BST, when CCTV cameras recorded him walking into an area in central Bury St Edmunds known as the ""horseshoe"", behind Greggs and Superdrug, where industrial waste bins were stored. A Â£2m police investigation was carried out into his disappearance, including a trawl of a landfill site at Milton, near Cambridge. His body has never been found. Mr Mckeague was last seen on CCTV after leaving a nightclub In a statement read out at the inquest, Martin Mckeague described his son as a ""happy child"". However, Mr Mckeague said there were ""major events"" that shaped his life including the separation of his parents when he was 10 years old and the discovery of his friend's body on a railway line when he was 15. ""I believe Corrie developed a significant binge-drinking problem,"" Mr Mckeague said. A landfill site at Milton, near Cambridge, was extensively searched as part of the investigation He said the death of his son's friend ""was a terrible shock for a 15-year-old boy to suffer, and one I don't think he ever truly got over"". Martin Mckeague continued: ""I don't believe Corrie was ever suicidal. ""This has been a heart-breaking tragedy."" Nicola Urquhart, second from right, pictured with her two other sons Darroch, left, and Makeyan, is at the inquest in Ipswich Mr Mckeague's mother Nicola Urquhart agreed the friend's death had a ""huge impact"" on her son. In a statement read to the inquest, she said Corrie, who had started to train as a hairdresser and then as a PE teacher before joining the RAF, had been prescribed antidepressants in the past. But, she said, he was ""back to his usual happy self"" by 2015. Ms Urquhart said her son ""regularly lost his phone or wallet on nights out"" but ""was never aggressive with or without alcohol"". ""There was nothing to suggest Corrie had any problems or concerns around the time of his disappearance,"" she said. Ms Urquhart said added: ""Despite what's in the press, as far as I'm aware Corrie had never slept in a bin nor had he ever climbed into a bin to sleep."" Posters were distributed in the search of Mr Mckeague when he went missing Suffolk's senior coroner Nigel Parsley said Mr Mckeague, who had served in the RAF for three years, drank a ""significant amount of alcohol during the evening"" of 23 September. He said Mr Mckeague was asked to leave Flex nightclub and ""was seen on a number of occasions on CCTV"". Mr Parsley said police investigations and searches failed to locate him and there had been no contact with family and no financial transactions that could be linked to him. He said over the coming weeks, jurors would hear evidence about Mr Mckeague's movements, his contact with any witnesses and ""hypotheses and possible scenarios relating to Corrie's disappearance"".

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a ""complete mess"" and the government must establish a ""simple route to sanctuary"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was ""not doing anywhere near enough"" to help refugees.

World leaders in London for Ukraine talks,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says no European country had done more than the UK to settle vulnerable people since 2015 Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas as a result of the Ukraine war. After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives. Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have ""enormous consequences"". And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas. In a statement, he said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. Will Russia's invasion push up gas bills? Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar Is the UK doing enough to help refugees? Ukrainians on way to UK hit paperwork dead-end in Calais Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. ""Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine. Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are ""moving very, very fast"" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are ""now very much on the table"". He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%. Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be ""diligent and not overnight"", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy. An immediate change would ""basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,"" he said, adding: ""It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself."" Mr Johnson also announced a further Â£175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials. Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Johnson said previously unthinkable options for Western leaders were now ""very much on the table"" Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday. During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""processing thousands"" and would be ""very generous"" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Will new legal powers find Putin's loot? The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry. Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict. But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review.

"TikTok limits services as Netflix pulls out of RussiaTikTok suspends live streaming and new content from its platform, while Russians can no longer access Netflix.","Video-sharing site TikTok and streaming giant Netflix have limited and cut their services respectively in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. TikTok said it had suspended live streaming and new content from its platform as it assesses tough new laws to crack down on ""fake news"" about Russia's armed forces. Netflix said it was pulling out in protest at the invasion. Visa, Mastercard and PwC also joined the list of western firms cutting ties. TikTok, which has around 36 million users in Russia, said its move was about ensuring the safety of its staff and users. Since Friday, anyone who writes news deemed false about the military could face up to 15 years in jail. Among other things, the Kremlin objects to the conflict being called a war, instead calling it a ""special military operation"". The BBC and other news outlets have already stopped reporting in Russia, saying they can no longer be independent. In a series of Tweets, TikTok said: ""In light of Russia's new 'fake news' law, we have no choice but to suspend live-streaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law. ""Our in-app messaging service will not be affected."" BBC suspends its journalists' work in Russia Facebook hits out at Russia blocking its platforms Apple halts sales and limits services in Russia It added: ""We will continue to evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services with safety as our top priority."" Chinese-owned TikTok, which has one billion users worldwide, has been criticised for not speaking out against Russia invading Ukraine, unlike its peers Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Twitter. But in a longer statement on its website on Sunday, it described the war in Ukraine as ""devastating"", adding that it had ""brought pain to our community and our people"". TikTok says it ""doesn't break down user numbers by country"" but we know that Russia is one of the company's top territories. It's thought that around 36m people use the app and TikTok's new rules reduce them to spectators of other people's content. TikTok says it's making the move to protect its users from breaking Russia's new ""fake news"" laws. But it will no doubt help the company too. Moderating social networks during times of crisis is hard enough, but having to vet content under the new draconian laws in Russia puts all platforms in a tough position. I wouldn't be surprised if other apps took similar measures to protect themselves. Russia has many high-profile creators who make their living from TikTok so we can expect even more people to be motivated to protest against the ""fake news"" laws. The Kremlin may also lose out in the information war too with less pro-Russia content on people's timelines. Last week, Netflixtemporarily stopped all future projects and acquisitionsin Russia as it assessed the impact of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. But on Sunday, a spokesperson said: ""Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia."" The firm launched in Russia in 2016 and only has 1 million subscribers there - a fraction of the 220 million it has worldwide. But according to Variety magazine, the streaming platform had four Russian originals in the works. That includes the crime thriller series Zato, which was shooting and has since been put on hold. A host of companies have suspended their operationsin Russia since it attacked its neighbour, including Apple, Jaguar Land Rover, H&M and Burberry. Many other firms are reviewing their positions, while some are looking to offload stakes in Russian ventures. On Sunday, two of the Big Four accounting firms KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) said they would no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion. Visa, Mastercard and American Express also suspended operations in Russia, although the country's banks played down the impact on consumers.

Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food',"The war in Ukraine will deliver a shock to the global supply and cost of food, the boss of one of the world's biggest fertiliser companies has said. Yara International, which operates in more than 60 countries, buys considerable amounts of essential raw materials from Russia. Fertiliser prices were already high due to soaring wholesale gas prices. Yara's boss, Svein Tore Holsether, has warned the situation could get even tougher. ""Things are changing by the hour,"" he told the BBC. ""We were already in a difficult situation before the war... and now it's additional disruption to the supply chains and we're getting close to the most important part of this season for the Northern hemisphere, where a lot of fertiliser needs to move on and that will quite likely be impacted."" Russia and Ukraine are some of the biggest producers in agriculture and food globally. Russia also produces enormous amounts of nutrients, like potash and phosphate - key ingredients in fertilisers, which enable plants and crops to grow. ""Half the world's population gets food as a result of fertilisers... and if that's removed from the field for some crops, [the yield] will drop by 50%,"" Mr Holsether said. ""For me, it's not whether we are moving into a global food crisis - it's how large the crisis will be."" Svein Tore Holsether said fertiliser prices were already high due to soaring gas prices His company has already been affected by the conflict after a missile hit Yara's office in Kyiv. The 11 staff were unharmed. The Norwegian-based company isn't directly affected by sanctions against Russia, but is having to deal with the fall-out. Trying to secure deliveries has become more difficult due to disruption in the shipping industry. Just hours after Mr Holsether spoke to the BBC, the Russian government urged its producers to halt fertiliser exports. He pointed out that about a quarter of the key nutrients used in European food production come from Russia. ""At the same time we're doing whatever we can do at the moment to also find additional sources. But with such short timelines it's limited,"" he said before the news emerged. Analysts have also warned that the move would mean higher costs for farmers and lower crop yields. That could feed through into even higher costs for food. Fears of UK food and fuel prices rising due to war Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Energy shock: The economic reality of Putin's war Nutrients aren't the only factor to consider, either. Huge amounts of natural gas are needed to produce ammonia, the key ingredient in nitrogen fertiliser. Yara International relies on vast quantities of Russian gas for its European plants. Last year, it was forced to temporarily suspend production of about 40% of its capacity in Europe because of the spike in the price of wholesale gas. Other producers also cut supplies. Combined with higher shipping rates, sanctions on Belarus (another major potash supplier) and extreme weather - this prompted a big jump in fertiliser prices last year, adding to a surge in food prices. The company says it's making day-to-day evaluations on how to maintain supply and that it is too early to say if more shutdowns may be on the cards. It acknowledges it has a ""very strong obligation"" to keep production running at what it describes as a critical point. But Yara's boss says the world must, in the long-term, reduce its dependency on Russia for global food production. ""On the one hand, we're trying to keep fertiliser flowing to the farmers to keep up the agricultural yields. ""At the same time... there has to be a strong reaction. We condemn the Russian military invasion of Ukraine so this is a dilemma and one that frankly is very difficult."" Climate change and growing populations had already been adding to the challenges the global food production system faces - all before the pandemic started. The Yara International chief executive describes the war as ""a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe"", highlighting just how vulnerable to shocks the global food supply chain now is. It will increase food insecurity in poorer countries, he adds. ""We have to keep in mind that in the last two years, there's been an increase of 100 million more people that go to bed hungry... so for this to come on top of it is really worrying.""

TikTok limits services as Netflix pulls out of Russia,"Video-sharing site TikTok and streaming giant Netflix have limited and cut their services respectively in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. TikTok said it had suspended live streaming and new content from its platform as it assesses tough new laws to crack down on ""fake news"" about Russia's armed forces. Netflix said it was pulling out in protest at the invasion. Visa, Mastercard and PwC also joined the list of western firms cutting ties. TikTok, which has around 36 million users in Russia, said its move was about ensuring the safety of its staff and users. Since Friday, anyone who writes news deemed false about the military could face up to 15 years in jail. Among other things, the Kremlin objects to the conflict being called a war, instead calling it a ""special military operation"". The BBC and other news outlets have already stopped reporting in Russia, saying they can no longer be independent. In a series of Tweets, TikTok said: ""In light of Russia's new 'fake news' law, we have no choice but to suspend live-streaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law. ""Our in-app messaging service will not be affected."" BBC suspends its journalists' work in Russia Facebook hits out at Russia blocking its platforms Apple halts sales and limits services in Russia It added: ""We will continue to evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services with safety as our top priority."" Chinese-owned TikTok, which has one billion users worldwide, has been criticised for not speaking out against Russia invading Ukraine, unlike its peers Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Twitter. But in a longer statement on its website on Sunday, it described the war in Ukraine as ""devastating"", adding that it had ""brought pain to our community and our people"". TikTok says it ""doesn't break down user numbers by country"" but we know that Russia is one of the company's top territories. It's thought that around 36m people use the app and TikTok's new rules reduce them to spectators of other people's content. TikTok says it's making the move to protect its users from breaking Russia's new ""fake news"" laws. But it will no doubt help the company too. Moderating social networks during times of crisis is hard enough, but having to vet content under the new draconian laws in Russia puts all platforms in a tough position. I wouldn't be surprised if other apps took similar measures to protect themselves. Russia has many high-profile creators who make their living from TikTok so we can expect even more people to be motivated to protest against the ""fake news"" laws. The Kremlin may also lose out in the information war too with less pro-Russia content on people's timelines. Last week, Netflixtemporarily stopped all future projects and acquisitionsin Russia as it assessed the impact of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. But on Sunday, a spokesperson said: ""Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia."" The firm launched in Russia in 2016 and only has 1 million subscribers there - a fraction of the 220 million it has worldwide. But according to Variety magazine, the streaming platform had four Russian originals in the works. That includes the crime thriller series Zato, which was shooting and has since been put on hold. A host of companies have suspended their operationsin Russia since it attacked its neighbour, including Apple, Jaguar Land Rover, H&M and Burberry. Many other firms are reviewing their positions, while some are looking to offload stakes in Russian ventures. On Sunday, two of the Big Four accounting firms KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) said they would no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion. Visa, Mastercard and American Express also suspended operations in Russia, although the country's banks played down the impact on consumers.

Oil and gas prices soar as shares plunge,"Petrol prices have hit another record high as oil and gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled. It came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, as it looked to other countries to increase supplies. However, European leaders rejected that idea on Monday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. And Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said: ""The painful reality is we are still very much dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil and if you now force European companies to quit doing business with Russia that would have enormous ramifications around Europe including Ukraine but also around the world. ""We have to reduce our dependency. That will take time,"" he added. UK petrol prices have hit an average of 155p a litre, the AA motoring group said. The market turmoil is fuelling concerns that the price of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating,already rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, could be pushed higher. Analysts have already warned that UK energy bills could reach as high as Â£3,000 a yeardue to the surge in oil and gas prices. Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. The price of Brent crude rose by more than a fifth last week amid fears of a reduction in Russian supplies. After peaking at $139.13 a barrel early on Monday, the price of Brent crude - an international benchmark - fell back to around $125. Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' EU mulls weaponising energy in Russia crisis The latest rise in UK petrol prices has pushed the cost to more than Â£7 a gallon, the AA said. Filling up a car with a 55-litre tank now costs nearly Â£17 more than a year ago, rising from Â£68.60 to Â£85.59. The boss of fuel delivery firm Portland Fuel, James Spencer, told the BBC he thought fuel prices could reach Â£1.70-Â£1.75 a litre. ""Even if we can get extra [oil] supplies on to the market, nothing will happen quickly."" He said that, to a certain extent, individual car drivers have options to cut their use by driving less, but added that businesses that have no alternatives were really starting to feel the squeeze. The crisis continues to affect share markets. The main stock exchanges in France and Germany sank more than 4% in early trading before paring their losses, closing 1.3% and 2% lower respectively. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped more than 2%, but then recovered to close 0.4% lower. Last week, the FTSE had its worse week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. In the US, markets ended lower with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 2.4% and 3% respectively. The Dow is now in a ""correction"", having fallen 10% since its last record closing level on 4 January. The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months. These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us. The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to Â£100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK. But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above Â£6 per therm. If in the first half of this year these prices average Â£3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to Â£3,000 a year or Â£250 a month. On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies. The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. ""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights. Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies. On Sunday, energy giantShell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oildespite the invasion of Ukraine. The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe. ""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added. A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports. However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.

The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months. These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us. The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to Â£100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK. But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above Â£6 per therm. If in the first half of this year these prices average Â£3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to Â£3,000 a year or Â£250 a month. On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies. The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. ""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights. Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies. On Sunday, energy giantShell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oildespite the invasion of Ukraine. The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe. ""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added. A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports. However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.

Bird flu restrictions imposed on Jersey,"Keepers are being asked to prevent birds mixing with wild birds Restrictions and biosecurity measures have been introduced to stop the spread of bird flu on Jersey. Keepers are being asked to prevent their birds having contact with wild birds, the island's chief veterinary officer, Alistair Breed, said. Adead red-breasted goose from Jersey Zoobecame the third bird this year to test positive for Avian Influenza on the island. The Government of Jersey said more details would be released on Monday. The rules come into effect immediately for birds less than 3km (1.9 miles) from Jersey Zoo, but for owners further away they have until 11 March to comply. Main requirements for bird keepers: Poultry and other captive birds must be housed or otherwise kept separate from wild birds Poultry and other captive birds must be provided with feed and water which is not accessible to wild birds No bird gatherings can take place, including bird fairs, markets, shows and exhibitions No game birds are to be released Mr Breed said he expected the restrictions to stay in place for ""at least one month"" but this was dependent on how the situation developed on the island. In February, two dead wild buzzards tested positive for bird flu in Jersey. The UK Health Security Agency said that Avian Influenza was primarily a disease of birds and the risk to public health from bird flu was low. However, the public are advised not to handle unwell or dead wild birds, the government said.

NI oil prices up since Russia invaded Ukraine,"Oil prices have soared to 10-year highs Northern Ireland's oil prices have shot up more than 35% in the week after Russia invaded Ukraine - so what does it mean for the UK's most oil-dependent nation? More than two-thirds of homes in Northern Ireland rely on oil for heating -the highest percentage in Western Europe,external- compared to just 4% in England and Wales. In the seven days afterthe invasion, the average price for 900 litres of home heating oil went up more than Â£200, from Â£555.72 on 24 February, to Â£758.11 on 3 March,figures from the Northern Ireland Consumer Council,externalshow. Meanwhile the number of households in fuel poverty in Northern Ireland is predicted to have doubled, from 22% to more than 40%, according to National Energy Action (NEA). It has also prompted a run on home heating oil, with some companies limiting their sales, or selling beyond their stock levels, so they will likely be selling at a loss if prices continue to rise. Pat Austin, NEA's Northern Ireland director, said the charity was seeing more people who had completely run out of fuel. Two weeks ago they topped up oil for a man in Belfast whose tank had been empty since last August, she said. The man, aged in his thirties, had been rationing his electricity by using his kettle to bathe - turning on the immersion heater for a shower just once a fortnight. The number of households in fuel poverty in Northern Ireland is predicted to have doubled As of Friday, a spot check of oil prices in Northern Ireland by the Consumer Council puts the average for 900 litres at Â£758.11. That's a 44% rise since 3 February, when the average price was Â£527.97. ""These figures have to be putting fuel poverty in the region of 40% easy; it is a perfect storm,"" Ms Austin said. ""We're looking at emergency interventions. We're dealing with people who are out of electricity overnight, we are now having to send people on to food banks."" Tensions between Russia and the West were already driving power prices up and that's accelerated since Russia invaded Ukraine last week, pushing them to 10-year highs. Russia is one of the world's largest energy producers. But it's now subject toa number of sanctions from Western nations, and that's reportedlycausing problems for buyers of Russian oil,external. Energy bills could reach Â£3,000 as oil price soars Oil hits $113 a barrel despite emergency measures Major oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, have also announcedplans to exit Russian operations. And price rises are expected to continue in the near-term. Why are energy bills going up? Oil prices have been climbing, like gas and electricity, but because oil is unregulated in Northern Ireland, cost increases are passed on directly to the buyer, Peter McClenaghan, director of infrastructure and sustainability at the Consumer Council, said. ""Russia supplies about 12% of global oil supplies so that's really worrying for Northern Ireland consumers because Northern Ireland consumers pay straight away what the world market is saying. ""Whereas with gas there's a time period before they can pass on increases, in oil that doesn't happen so those spikes in prices have been seen in Northern Ireland straight away, so it's a really significant, negative change for Northern Ireland consumers and one that's happened just virtually overnight."" Russian gas flows through pipelines across eastern and central Europe In 2016, when fuel poverty was last measured in Northern Ireland,it was at 22%,external, but estimates from the Housing Executive forin 2017 and 2018 put it as low as 17%,externaland 18%. But in 2009, fuel poverty levels were double that at 44% - and that's where NEA expects it to be in Northern Ireland now. Donna Lennon gets her oil via a social enterprise buying group, which reduces costs for its members by buying in bulk, and allows smaller purchases so customers avoid the higher costs of ordering low volumes directly from the supplier. Without it, the single mother of two, who lives in Newcastle, County Down, said she would be in fuel poverty. Northern Ireland also hasseveral oil buying clubs,external, which work on a similar principle. Donna Lennon says she relies on the saving she gets buying in bulk via Fuel Round She said the discount she gets is the difference between running oil and heating the whole house, and using only her fireplace. ""Especially when you have a young family and your oil is on a lot, I would have to choose between that and wood, and just light a fire and sit in the sitting room. ""It could be the difference between heating the bedrooms and sitting in the living room for the fire."" James McGovern, from the buying group Fuel Round in County Down, said households were reducing the size of their orders as costs increased. ""Overall demand has noticeably risen since the Ukraine crisis, but the per-order volume is markedly down, as households grapple with increased costs."" This week some Northern Ireland oil companies cut the volume of each sale. Others sold beyond their stock levels, meaning they could lose money on orders when prices rise beyond what quoted for. Damian Fusco, from Bangor Fuels, said: ""The general public is under the impression that we have large stocks of oil - stock generally lasts days not weeks. ""Most heating oil retailers would have a volume of stock on their premises which they replenish daily - that volume is sold. ""I'm taking orders for more than week away which I haven't got the stock for, so it may by the time I get to that call I may have ended up having to pay more than that for the oil."" Northern Ireland imports all its oil via a handful of multinational suppliers. That means local firms have no power to increase their orders to match demand. On Tuesday, none of Omagh firm MAC Fuels' three suppliers would deliver oil, its company director Yvonne Wilson said. They limited their sales to 400 litres this week. ""One customer has told me that she is working just to eat and heat, while another said its a case of keeping the house warm while his children get ready for school and bed. When the children aren't at home he just wears a coat rather than waste any oil -this is the reality of how families and the elderly are struggling at the minute.""

Trudeau and Rutte in London for Ukraine talks,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says no European country had done more than the UK to settle vulnerable people since 2015 Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas as a result of the Ukraine war. After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives. Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have ""enormous consequences"". And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas. In a statement, he said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. Will Russia's invasion push up gas bills? Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar Is the UK doing enough to help refugees? Ukrainians on way to UK hit paperwork dead-end in Calais Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. ""Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine. Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are ""moving very, very fast"" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are ""now very much on the table"". He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%. Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be ""diligent and not overnight"", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy. An immediate change would ""basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,"" he said, adding: ""It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself."" Mr Johnson also announced a further Â£175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials. Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Johnson said previously unthinkable options for Western leaders were now ""very much on the table"" Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday. During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""processing thousands"" and would be ""very generous"" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Will new legal powers find Putin's loot? The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry. Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict. But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a ""complete mess"" and the government must establish a ""simple route to sanctuary"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was ""not doing anywhere near enough"" to help refugees. More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Home Office is in a ""complete mess"" over how Ukrainians can get to the UK Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals.

Oil soars to 13-year high over Ukraine conflict,"Petrol prices have hit another record high as oil and gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled. It came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, as it looked to other countries to increase supplies. However, European leaders rejected that idea on Monday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. And Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said: ""The painful reality is we are still very much dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil and if you now force European companies to quit doing business with Russia that would have enormous ramifications around Europe including Ukraine but also around the world. ""We have to reduce our dependency. That will take time,"" he added. UK petrol prices have hit an average of 155p a litre, the AA motoring group said. The market turmoil is fuelling concerns that the price of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating,already rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, could be pushed higher. Analysts have already warned that UK energy bills could reach as high as Â£3,000 a yeardue to the surge in oil and gas prices. Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. The price of Brent crude rose by more than a fifth last week amid fears of a reduction in Russian supplies. After peaking at $139.13 a barrel early on Monday, the price of Brent crude - an international benchmark - fell back to around $125. Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' EU mulls weaponising energy in Russia crisis The latest rise in UK petrol prices has pushed the cost to more than Â£7 a gallon, the AA said. Filling up a car with a 55-litre tank now costs nearly Â£17 more than a year ago, rising from Â£68.60 to Â£85.59. The boss of fuel delivery firm Portland Fuel, James Spencer, told the BBC he thought fuel prices could reach Â£1.70-Â£1.75 a litre. ""Even if we can get extra [oil] supplies on to the market, nothing will happen quickly."" He said that, to a certain extent, individual car drivers have options to cut their use by driving less, but added that businesses that have no alternatives were really starting to feel the squeeze. The crisis continues to affect share markets. The main stock exchanges in France and Germany sank more than 4% in early trading before paring their losses, closing 1.3% and 2% lower respectively. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped more than 2%, but then recovered to close 0.4% lower. Last week, the FTSE had its worse week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. In the US, markets ended lower with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 2.4% and 3% respectively. The Dow is now in a ""correction"", having fallen 10% since its last record closing level on 4 January. The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months. These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us. The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to Â£100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK. But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above Â£6 per therm. If in the first half of this year these prices average Â£3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to Â£3,000 a year or Â£250 a month. On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies. The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. ""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights. Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies. On Sunday, energy giantShell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oildespite the invasion of Ukraine. The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe. ""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added. A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports. However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.
