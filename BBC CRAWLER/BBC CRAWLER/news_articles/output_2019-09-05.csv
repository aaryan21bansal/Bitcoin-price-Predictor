Rees-Mogg 'bullying Brexit whistleblowers',"This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg likened Dr Nicholl to Dr Wakefield during a debate in the Commons A doctor who spoke out against the government's no-deal plans has said Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg is ""bullying whistleblowers"". David Nicholl expressed concern over medical plans for a no-deal Brexit during a radio phone-in this week. On Thursday, Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs that Dr Nicholl was ""as irresponsible as Dr [Andrew] Wakefield"", who inaccurately linked the MMR vaccine with autism. The Conservative MP later apologised to Dr Nicholl for making the comparison. The British Medical Association called Mr Rees-Mogg's comments ""irresponsible"". Slouching Jacob Rees-Mogg lampooned in memes PM: I'd rather be dead in ditch than delay Brexit Next week 'only chance' to act on no deal Dr Nicholl, a consultant neurologist with Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, shared his concerns about the supply of drugs in the event of a no-deal Brexitin an interview with BBC Newsnight in March. And on Monday he called in to LBC to ask Mr Rees-Mogg what mortality rate he would accept if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal. Mr Rees-Mogg said this was ""the worst excess of Project Fear"" and the doctor should be ""quite ashamed"". This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg clashes with Dr David Nicholl over no-deal Brexit 'mortality rate' question Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Mr Rees-Mogg referred to the exchange when challenged about preparations for leaving the EU without a deal. ""Preparations have been made, they are in place and they have been done with remarkable efficiency, but a lot of remainers wish to make our skins crawl,"" he said. ""I'm afraid it seems to me that Dr David Nicholl is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield. ""What he [Nicholl] had to say - I will repeat it - is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield. ""In threatening that people will die because we leave the European Union - what level of irresponsibility was that?"" In response, Dr Nicholl said he was ""appalled"" by the comments and visited Westminster to call on the MP to apologise. This video can not be played A neurologist who was involved in planning for a no-deal Brexit calls out Rees-Mogg for ""bullying"" him He added that the remarks were ""an attempt by government to bully whistleblowers, and it's not just doctors."" ""I challenge him to repeat outside the chamber the allegation that I am comparable to Andrew Wakefield - let's see what happens."" As an MP, Mr Rees-Mogg cannot be sued for any comments he makes during his duties in the House of Commons. But on Thursday evening, the MP for North East Somerset, apologised to Dr Nicholl for his comments in the Commons. In a statement he said he had ""the utmost respect for all of the country's hardworking medical professionals and the work they do in caring for the people of this country."" He added that the government was ""working closely with the NHS, industry and distributors to help ensure the supply of medicine and medical products remains uninterrupted"" by the UK's withdrawal from the EU. By Newsnight correspondent Deborah Cohen Dr Nicholl came to Newsnight in March with his concerns about the inability to stockpile medicines for conditions such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain and bipolar disorder in the event of no-deal Brexit. He was neurology lead for Brexit planning and gave us NHS England documents. He said it was his duty as a doctor to speak up over concerns about patient safety. A range of health organisations supported him, telling the BBC there needed to be transparency about supplies. Unavailability of certain drugs may affect doctors' decisions about what to prescribe. His concerns were later supported by Operation Yellowhammer - the leaked government report describing the possible consequences of leaving without a deal - which said there may be significant disruption to medicines supplies lasting up to six months. In response to the row, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof Sally Davies, has written to Mr Rees-Mogg to express her ""sincere disappointment in the disrespectful way"" he spoke to and about Dr David Nicholl. In the letter, she said that Brexit ""obviously divides opinion"" but that comparing Dr Nicholl to Dr Wakefield is ""going too far and is frankly unacceptable"". She thanked Dr Nicholl for his help in planning for no-deal and added that ""there are now full plans in place that we believe, if enacted to plan, should ensure unhindered medical supplies"".

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association, said Mr Rees-Mogg's ""unwarranted attack"" was ""utterly disgraceful and totally irresponsible"". ""Highly experienced doctors like David Nicholl who decide to speak out about risks to life and patient care, should be supported and listened to, not attacked and derided by those who hold positions of responsibility."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised Mr Rees-Mogg's comments, describing them on Twitter as ""offensive, irresponsible garbage"". He added: ""His casual belittling of experienced, medical opinion really is shameful and straight out of the Trump playbook."" Alistair Burt, who was one of 21 MPs who lost the Tory whip after they rebelled against the party, said: ""The Brexit obsession is giving rise to sheer irrationality."" He added: ""As a former minister fully aware of the worldwide risks to health security from Wakefield's anti-vax consequences, I am distressed such a comparison could come from a government minister in the UK.""

Door open for 23 minutes on 80mph train,"The door of the carriage was open for 23 minutes A door on a passenger train was open for 23 minutes while the vehicle travelled at 80mph (128km/h). A passenger reported it to the driver at Hockley station, in Essex, at 07:20 BST on the Liverpool Street to Southend line on 22 August, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said. The train travelled in traffic for 16 miles (26km) with the door open. Train operator Greater Anglia said the carriage had immediately been taken out of service. The RAIB has conducted an investigation and will release a ""safety digest"" at a later date. Martin Moran, Greater Anglia commercial and customer service director, said: ""Safety is our highest priority. ""We immediately took the train out of service when this happened and carried out our own investigation into the incident. ""We have also carried out checks on every single door on that type of train that we have. ""No-one was injured in this incident and there have been no further incidents since."" The train stopped at Hockley station while the incident was dealt with A witness who was not on the train, who wished to remain anonymous, said he had seen Greater Anglia staff shouting and a technician working on the door. He said: ""All of a sudden there was a technician there looking at the door at the side. It must have been loose because they were able to slide it back.""

He said: ""It could be a dangerous situation if the train is crowded and a lot of people are standing there, which fortunately it doesn't sound like it was in this case. ""It should never have happened.""

Coroner finds failings in Great Ormond Street care,"Amy Allan died at Great Ormond Street Hospital last year The coroner looking into the death of Scottish teenager Amy Allan has found significant failings in her care by Great Ormond Street Hospital. Amy, from Dalry in North Ayrshire, was 14 when she died in September last year following surgery on her spine. Coroner Edwyn Buckett outlined poor planning and support from the hospital. But he said he ""was not able to make a firm conclusion"" that those omissions ""had caused or materially contributed to her death."" The coroner is however likely to issue a prevention of future deaths report. Great Ormond Street Hospital admitted Amy's care ""fell short of the high standards"" it should be meeting but said it had made changes to the way it worked. Amy Allan was born with a genetic condition called Noonan Syndrome, which caused a number of heart problems throughout her life. As she got older her spine started to curve due to scoliosis and it was clear she needed surgery to reduce her pain and prevent it getting worse. However, her heart problem - pulmonary hypertension- made the surgery more complicated. It was decided the operation should be carried out at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London, because it had the necessary heart specialists on site to treat any complications, specifically a life-support system known as ECMO which oxygenates blood outside the body. However, when Amy's ventilation tube was removed after the operation and she needed the back-up cardiac and ECMO teams, they were not available. Giving a narrative verdict, the coroner found: there was poor planning of Amy's care once she was accepted on the intensive care unit. there was no ECMO life-support system for Amy and ""the therapy should have been at the forefront"" of the team looking after her. no-one was in charge of Amy's post-operative care, of ensuring that ECMO support was in place. Her ventilation tube was removed ""in the face of worsening vital signs"" and without a cardiac assessment having been made. Speaking to the BBC, Mrs Allan said her daughter was a ""live wire"" who always had a smile on her face. ""She had an attitude to life we all envied,"" her mother said. She said it took two years from her first hospital appointment in Kilmarnock until the date of the operation at Great Ormond Street. Amy had an heart condition from birth During that time Amy made four visits to the London hospital and underwent a battery of tests. ""She had every test known to man plus two multi-disciplinary meetings about her,"" her mother said. Her parents said there were assured that the ECMO back-up would be available if anything went wrong. Amy was excited about the operation, her parents said. Her biggest concern was the ventilation tube being left in for 24 hours after her operation. St Pancras Coroner's Court heard that a junior doctor extubated Amy - removed her ventilation tube - shortly after 23:20, just hours after her surgery, and she rapidly declined. Leigh and Richard Allan said their daughter had an attitude to life they all envied The tube was removed despite several medical readings suggesting she wasn't stable enough. It was only then that her parents found out that there was no ECMO back-up at that time of night and the cardiac team was not aware of Amy's presence. Amy's mother told the BBC: ""I wish I had asked more questions and said 'are these people on standby?' I honestly didn't think for a minute they weren't. I just assumed they were there."" Mrs Allan said she was told that the tube was removed because Amy had asked for it. ""That's the only justification they gave for taking it out,"" she said. ""I can't accept that was even a consideration. Of course, the child was going to wake up and want the tube out. Even an adult would want that."" Her parents were at the bedside as Amy's blood pressure plummeted and her heart rate start racing. Doctors 'panicked' as teen deteriorated after op Removal of teen's breathing tube 'wasn't right' Teen died after back surgery complications ""We watched it all,"" her father said. ""We were there all through the night watching them panic in front of our eyes."" They said Amy had been sedated earlier but she was conscious and ""terrified"" as doctors tried to help her. At about 03:00 they decided to put her tube back in and her parents were asked to leave. The ECMO team was assembled at 04:00 but did not begin to work on Amy until 07:15 because they are not routinely available at all hours. Amy died 23 days later from sepsis on 28 September. Her mother said: ""She didn't look like Amy by that point, she had suffered so much."" Amy's parents said Great Ormond Street had never admitted their mistakes and called for a full inquiry by the Care Quality Commission. She said: ""We are appalled to see the lack of openness and honesty in the hospital's response. We want GOSH to tell the truth."" ""It is not the 24-hour service they offer, there is a lack of nursing staff, there's a lack of consultants and I don't think it is the service they advertise. ""I would expect the relevant bodies to go in and look at it now because it's not right."" A spokesman for Great Ormond Street Hospital said: ""We are very sorry Amy's care fell short of the high standards we should always be meeting."" He said changes had already been made to the way they worked to support children with complex conditions. This included improving the way clinical information is shared between teams and enhancing multi-disciplinary assessments, he said. ""We will look closely at the Coroner's findings to consider if any additional action is needed,"" he said.

MPs have approved it It would force Boris Johnson to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit to prevent no-deal on 31 October Vanessa Barford and Keiligh Baker Former Labour MP Luciana Berger has joined the Liberal Democrats, saying the party is ""unequivocal in wanting to stop Brexit"" It's been another busy day in British politics. Boris Johnson said on Thursday afternoon that he would ""rather be dead in a ditch"" than ask the EU to delay Brexitbeyond 31 October. But lawyers representing businesswoman Gina Miller have said decision to suspend parliament isan unlawful abuse of power. In the latest blow to hit the new Prime Minister, his brotherJo announced he is resigning as an MP and minister, saying he is ""torn between family loyalty and the national interest"". Meanwhile, as the prospect of an early General Election looms,nearly 200,000 people have applied to register to vote in just 72 hours- and more than half of them are under 35. MPs will get another chanceto vote for an early election on Monday, the government has announced. And former Labour MPLuciana Berger has joined the Liberal Democrats, saying the party is ""unequivocal in wanting to stop Brexit"". That's the end of our live page coverage today. Gina Miller outside Parliament Leading judges are expected to announce their decision on Friday on the latest legal action brought over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and two other judges at the High Court in London have been urged to find that Mr Johnson's advice to the Queen on 28 August to prorogue Parliament for an ""exceptional"" length of time was an ""unlawful abuse of power"". After hearing submissions on Thursday on an urgent judicial review application brought by businesswoman Gina Miller, Lord Burnett announced that the hearing would be adjourned until 10am on Friday. The case brought by Ms Miller, who successfully challenged the government at the High Court in 2016 over the triggering of the Article 50 process to start the Brexit countdown, is supported by a number of other parties, including former prime minister Sir John Major. The action was contested by the prime minister, whose lawyer argued that the advice given to the Queen was not unlawful and that, in any event, Ms Miller's claim was ""academic"". Former Prime Minister John Major says Boris
Johnson should fire Dominic Cummings, the adviser behind his Brexit strategy. ""We have seen over-mighty advisors before. It is a familiar script. It always ends badly,"" Mr Major said in a speech at a Confederation of British Industry event in Glasgow. ""I offer the prime minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly."" Mr Cummings, architect of the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, is Mr Johnson's top adviser. Mr Major, who supported the referendum campaign to stay in the
EU, attacked Johnson's plan to suspend parliament for more than
a month before Britain is due to leave the European Union. ""I cannot believe any previous prime minister â from Pitt,
to Disraeli, to Churchill, to Thatcher â would have even
contemplated such an action,"" he said. Mr Major also criticised the government for publicly attacking
critics of its Brexit strategy. ""This is behaviour I never thought to see from any British
government, and it must stop,"" he added. Labour's Yvette Cooper has accused Boris Johnson of an ""abuse of power"" for using a backdrop of police officers in a ""political stunt"". The chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee said she would write to the Cabinet Secretary and West Yorkshire Police's chief constable. The Labour MP said: ""For Boris Johnson to make so many police stop their training and work to be part of his political stunt is an abuse of power. ""Police officers and trainees are overstretched and need to be able to get on with their job, not have to waste time listening to Boris Johnson's political press conference. ""For Boris Johnson to draw so many of them into a long, election-driven event like this is completely inappropriate and it is unfair on the people of West Yorkshire who are entitled to expect that their police are allowed to get on with the job of working and training to keep them safe. ""I am writing to the Cabinet Secretary as well as the West Yorkshire Chief Constable John Robins to ask how this has happened and what guidelines were followed."" Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he'd ""rather be dead in a ditch"" than go to ask Brussels for a delay to Brexit. He was responding to a question from a reporter after making a speech in front of police recruits in West Yorkshire. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'I'd rather be dead in a ditch' than ask for Brexit delay Speaking in West Yorkshire this afternoon, Mr Johnson accused Parliament of having ""absolutely torpedoed"" the UK's negotiating position with the EU by working to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He reiterated his call for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to back his efforts for a general election to be held on 15 October. The PM added: ""I really don't see how we can have a situation where the British ability to negotiate is absolutely torpedoed by Parliament in this way with powers of the British people handed over to Brussels so we can be kept incarcerated in the EU without that actually being put to the people in the form of a vote."" âHigh chanceâ of no deal feared in August Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Boris Johnson warned the cabinet on 28 August that there was a âhigh chanceâ that he would fail to get a new deal with the European Union over Brexit. The warning is contained in a minute of a cabinet conference-call that day, in which the prime minister briefed colleagues about the progress of talks with Brussels. The minutes, disclosed in the Brexit court cases today in England and Scotland, include a summary of final remarks from Mr Johnson to cabinet ministers. âConcluding the prime minister said that progress with the EU should not be exaggerated but it was substantial,â reads the document. âWhilst there was a good chance that a deal could be secured, there was also a high chance that it could notâ¦ The Cabinet took note.â Days earlier, in a BBC interview at the G7 summit, Mr Johnson had only said that a deal was âtouch and goâ. Earlier in the summer he said the chances of leaving the EU without a deal over trade and security were a  âmillion to oneâ. Hereâs the document: Jacob Rees-Mogg has been criticised by MPs for comparing a doctor who had been advising
the government as part of Operation Yellowhammer to the discredited Andrew Wakefield. Mr Wakefield is widely blamed for the scare over the MMR jab. On Monday, David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist who is pro-Remain, called an LBC phone-in show and asked the leader of the Commons what mortality rate he would accept if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal. During a Commons business statement, Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs: ""What he had to say, I will repeat it, is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield in threatening that people will die because we leave the European Union. ""What level of irresponsibility was that?"" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Rees-Mogg's comments were ""irresponsible"", while Liberal Democrat MP Dr Sarah Wollaston said they were ""absolutely disgusting"".

PC jailed for buying porn as child lay dead in home,"PC Avi Maharaj was jailed for 12 months after pleading guilty to fraud A police officer who bought pornography at the family home of a dead child has been jailed for 12 months. Met PC Avi Maharaj was asked to guard the house on 11 February 2018 while the family was ""being consoled elsewhere"" after their 14-year-old son had taken his own life. Maharaj guessed the password to the household Virgin Media account and downloaded four pornographic films. He was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday. Maharaj, 44, of Kingswood Place, Hayes, had previously pleaded guilty to fraud. The family had initially thought their son had downloaded the clips before realising Maharaj was responsible. Sentencing, Judge Deborah Taylor told him that while the parents of the boy were grieving elsewhere he had responsibility to guard the house. ""Instead of performing that duty with respect and professionalism, you took it upon yourself to guess the password to the household Virgin Media account, to act as if you were the account holder, and use it to purchase, download and view four pornography films."" The judge added the family were ""vulnerable, traumatised by the loss of their son, and trusted you to guard their house"" and his actions had led to a ""false understanding of their son's last hours"". ""All right-thinking people would be appalled by your gross lack of decency and respect in indulging yourself at all in those circumstances, let alone deviously, and at the expense of the bereaved parents."" Pc Maharaj was supposed to be waiting for the undertaker to take the body away when he downloaded pornography worth Â£25.96. He then falsified his attendance logs, claiming he left the property in Littleton Street almost two hours earlier than he really did as part of a bid to cover up his actions, the court heard. In a letter, the boy's father, Graham Miller, said Maharaj's actions had initially ""upset"" his image of his son, adding it ""made me feel like I didn't know my own son"". The boy's father only realised his son was not responsible for the downloads when he contacted Virgin Media and was told what time the clips were downloaded. Maharaj, who was based in Earlsfield, Wandsworth, initially denied the allegations when interviewed by police, the court heard. ""He provided officers with a prepared statement in which he denied the allegation and questioned security of the premises,"" Prosecutor Gregor McKinley said. Edmund Gritt, representing Maharaj, said the defendant ""expressed his wholly ashamed apologies to the Miller family"". Avi Maharaj pleaded guilty to fraud at Westminster Magistrates' Court in July Mr Gritt told the court that Maharaj's guilty plea would ""terminate"" his police career ""forever"". He added it was ""inevitable"" he would be dismissed. The Met officer's conviction follows a complaint from a member of the child's family, which led to an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The IOPC's regional director Sal Naseem described PC Maharaj's behaviour as ""shocking"" and ""deceitful"", adding that he ""caused considerable distress for the family involved who were dealing with the sudden death of a family member"".

PM's plan 'an unlawful abuse of power',"Gina Miller is an investment manager and philanthropist Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament is an unlawful abuse of power, lawyers representing businesswoman Gina Miller have said. Outlining her case against prorogation at the High Court in London, Lord Pannick QC said it breached the legal principle of Parliamentary sovereignty. He added that a five-week suspension was of ""exceptional length"", saying in most cases it was for a week or less. Mr Johnson's lawyers argued prorogation was a political, not a legal, matter. A judgement is expected on Friday morning. A similar legal challenge heard at Edinburgh's Court of Session on Wednesday failed. In 2017, Gina Miller won a case which stopped ministers triggering the Article 50 process - by which the UK leaves the EU - without a vote in parliament. The prime minister announced on 28 August he wanted the five-week shutdown - a process known as prorogation - to start next week. This means MPs and peers will not return to parliament until 14 October for the Queen's Speech, when Mr Johnson says he will outline his ""exciting agenda"" for the new term. The latest case from Ms Miller,external- to challenge the legality of the prorogation - is being heard by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and two other leading judges. Opening the hearing, Lord Pannick said Mr Johnson saw Parliament as a ""threat to the implementation of his policies"", in particular whether a deal could be made with the EU. He said the reason given by Mr Johnson for suspending Parliament - to introduce a new programme of legislation - did not require a five-week suspension. And he posed the question: ""If the prime minister can, unregulated by the courts, advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, then why would he not be able to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament for a lengthier period of time?"" Lord Pannick also said that, in his submission, the prime minister ""has been very clear"" that he viewed Parliament as a ""nuisance"" and a ""detriment"". In a partially redacted handwritten note, Boris Johnson says there is nothing especially shocking about prorogation He pointed to a note in Mr Johnson's own handwriting which said the whole September session of Parliament was a rigmarole introduced to show the public that MPs were earning their crust - and he saw nothing ""especially shocking"" about this prorogation. Lord Pannick argued that this showed Mr Johnson did not understand the role of Parliament in proposing and considering legislation and holding the government to account during ""such a critical period"". Another document released to the court were the minutes of a Cabinet conference call on 28 August, in which Boris Johnson warned ministers that there was a ""high chance"" he would fail to get a new deal with the EU over Brexit. In a summary of final remarks about the progress of talks with Brussels, the minutes read: ""Concluding the prime minister said that progress with the EU should not be exaggerated but it was substantial. ""Whilst there was a good chance that a deal could be secured, there was also a high chance that it could not."" Days earlier, in a BBC interview at the G7 summit, Mr Johnson had said that a deal was ""touch and go"". In his case, Lord Pannick went on to stress that the court was not being asked to express any view about the wisdom of the UK leaving the European Union, nor what action should be taken before 1 November. ""If the prorogation is declared unlawful, it will be entirely for Parliament to decide what to do when it sits during the relevant five weeks. ""Our case is concerned - and only concerned - with issues of law,"" he said. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, centre, President of the Queen's Bench Division Dame Victoria Sharp and Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton are hearing the case in London In response, Sir James Eadie QC, representing Mr Johnson, argued proroguing Parliament was an inherently political act - not a matter for the courts and law. He also said the sitting of Parliament was a matter of constitutional convention rather than law - and judges cannot tinker with conventions as they are a matter for political balance. Sir James rejected Gina Miller's lawyer's claim that prorogation was intended to deprive Parliament of an ability to legislate, specifically in relation to a no-deal Brexit. ""The last few days [in Westminster] indicate that that is just simply untenable in fact,"" he said, adding that recent events illustrated the ""political maelstrom into which the court is being invited"". Sir John Major, former Conservative prime minister, was given the go ahead to join her legal action and intervene in the case in writing. He believes Mr Johnson's move is aimed at preventing MPs from opposing a no-deal Brexit. Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC, who is Scotland's senior law officer, the Welsh government and shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti have also been given permission to intervene in writing. It is not possible to mount a legal challenge to the Queen's approval of the suspension but Sir John and Ms Miller believe they can legally challenge the advice the Queen's prime minister gives her. How can the government suspend Parliament? Major backs legal bid to stop Parliament suspension Who is Gina Miller? Today's legal battle between Gina Miller and the government - her second major constitutional challenge on the balance of power between ministers and Parliament - comes down to a headline question and what may be a very fine judgement. Did Boris Johnson manifestly abuse his power by advising the Queen to prorogue Parliament for an exceptional five weeks - and can judges do anything about it if he did? Ms Miller's QC, Lord Pannick, avoided suggesting that prime ministers don't have the right to halt Parliamentary business ahead of a Queen's Speech. He focused on the manner in which Mr Johnson went about this prorogation and its duration when ""time is of the essence"". The outcome may feel academic because of the progress of the no-deal Brexit-blocking bill in the Lords. But the Supreme Court could ultimately deliver a ground-breaking judgement on the sovereignty of Parliament. This video can not be played Lord Doherty: ""This is political territory and decision making which cannot be measured against legal standards."" In Scotland, a group of politicians are attempting to overturn a court ruling made on Wednesday that Mr Johnson's plan to shut down parliament ahead of Brexit is, in fact, legal. Lord Doherty, sitting at the Court of Session, said the prime minister had not broken any laws by asking the Queen for a five-week suspension as it was for Parliament and the electorate to judge the prime minister's actions - not the courts. The group of more than 70 largely pro-Remain politicians, headed by SNP MP Joanna Cherry, argue that Mr Johnson is exceeding his powers and attempting to undermine democracy by avoiding parliamentary scrutiny before the UK leaves the EU on 31 October. After Lord Doherty's ruling, a UK government spokesman said: ""We welcome the court's decision and hope that those seeking to use the judiciary to frustrate the government take note and withdraw their cases."" Court releases PM's Parliament shutdown memos Read Lord Doherty's full opinion,external In Belfast, a campaigner for victims of the Troubles is due to bring a case on Friday arguing that no-deal could jeopardise the Northern Ireland peace process. The lawyers of Raymond McCord - whose son was murdered by the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force in 1997 - argue no-deal would endanger the Good Friday Agreement and suspending parliament is unconstitutional. At a preliminary hearing on Thursday, a lawyer for the government argued for a delay to the case, saying Hilary Benn's no-deal Brexit Bill had ""changed the paradigm"" and altered the need for an urgent judgment. But Mr McCord's lawyer said the case was ready to proceed and while it ""looked as if"" the bill would become law, ""we don't know"". He also said he was ""sorry to have to make the proposition"" that the government might not abide by the law.

Pilot strike still on after BA snubs talks offer,"British Airways and its pilots have been urged by Number 10 to ""sort out"" the dispute which will see pilots walk out next week in a row over pay. ""The unions and BA need to get round the table and sort this out. The public would expect nothing less,"" it said. BA pilots are due to strike on Monday and Tuesday over a pay offer pilots' union Balpa says is too low. The vast majority of flights are expected to be cancelled on those two days, causing knock-on disruption. BA would not say how many flights had been affected, but reports suggested it was around 1,600 flights. ""Nobody should have their travel plans disrupted or their holidays ruined,"" Number 10 said. The airline says it has emailed customers travelling on flights that are affected but the flight's status can still be checkedon the website,external. The airline and the union did not provide an update on the status of their dispute on Friday. The two-day strike, set for next week, follows failed negotiations between the union and the airline over a pay offer of 11.5% over three years. Unite and GMB, representing cabin crew and engineers, have accepted the offer. However, pilots have argued that the pay award should be higher, following recent years of low pay increases and BA's recent strong financial performance. BA has said it was open to ""constructive talks"", but said Balpa was not acting in good faith. The union has said it would call off the strike if BA would discuss a new proposal outlined in a letter on Thursday to the airline. Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes Passengers angry at BA 'silence' amid strike chaos The union's general secretary Brian Strutton said his members were still ""very angry"" with BA, but were also willing to be flexible. ""They also want to leave no stone unturned in trying to find a resolution to their dispute,"" he said. In response, BA had said: ""We do not believe the union is acting in good faith by making an 11th-hour inflated proposal which would cost an additional Â£50m."" The airline said Balpa should return to the talks without pre-conditions. The union was acting ""cynically"" by waiting until a late stage when the airline had already made arrangements to manage the industrial action, BA added. ""Our customers need the certainty that Balpa will call off the strikes for good, not just for two days next week,"" the airline said. A further day of strike action is scheduled for 27 September.

My 'anxiety' was actually a rare heart condition,"Three-year-old Bobby is enjoying having his mum home after five weeks in hospital When Arlene Leitch went to her GP complaining about heart palpitations she was relieved to be told they were likely to be a result of anxiety or drinking too much caffeine. However, the 32-year-old mother-of-one, from Port Glasgow, then suffered a cardiac arrest one night as she slept. Doctors later said the quick reaction of her husband Barry probably helped ""save her life"". Arlene has now been told she has a rare condition known as ARVC (Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) and wants to raise awareness about underlying heart issues that can often go undiagnosed. She toldBBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie programme: ""I was in my 20s when I started getting the palpitations more often. ""They were kind of panicking me a wee bit because they were quite intense. ""It felt like my heart was sucking in and then beating out really hard, and then as if it was trying to catch up with itself."" Arlene Leitch with her gran and mum Jackie Her doctor did some tests, but when the results came back and showed nothing out of the ordinary, her symptoms were put down to anxiety, which she said she was relieved to hear. However the heart palpitations continued and began to cause her to wake during the night. On the night of her cardiac arrest, her husband woke to find her almost unconscious. ""He said that he heard me making noises, my eyes were glassy and I just wasn't breathing properly,"" Arlene said. ""He had to phone an ambulance and my mum because my wee boy was in the next room asleep and he was conscious of him waking up."" Her mother, Jackie Dunn, had spent the evening with her daughter so the 05:00 phone call came as a shock. Her parents rushed to the house. ""By the time we arrived and got upstairs Barry was on top of Arlene giving her CPR. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing,"" Jackie told the programme. ""Barry had a three-way conversation going with the ambulance people and they were counting him in and telling him to keep doing what he was doing, and that he was doing everything right."" Doctors say Barry 'saved Arlene's life' with his fast response Jackie said Arlene's father Patrick did not think she was going to ""make it"" and left the room while the ambulance crew used a life-saving defibrillator. She was taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock and put into an induced coma to let her body rest while the intensive care team did tests. 'We just stayed by her bedside,"" her mother said. ""We didn't know if she was going to have brain damage or be able to speak or recognise anybody."" 'I really don't want to die on stage' 'I was aged 24, and dead for five minutes' Thousands 'unaware of sudden death risk' The following morning she woke and within minutes recognised her husband. ""We knew then that something was functioning, but when she said 'Barry' it was a kind of relief for us all that she was going to hopefully pull through,"" said Jackie. On the road to recovery- now Arlene wants other people to take heart palpitations seriously ARVC is a rare inherited disease of the heart muscle and often those who have it do not know. It affects the heart's ability to pump blood effectively as the muscle cells become thin and stretchy and are not secure, resulting in poor function. The tests that were done on Arlene before her attack did not link to her condition. Only a MRI scan, along with other specific heart tests, can identify the condition. Maureen Talbot, a senior cardiac nurse from the British Heart Foundation, told BBC Scotland it is difficult to diagnose without sufficient testing. She said: ""There are no typical symptoms but symptoms could include what Arlene experienced, some people have none at all. ""Others may have swelling in ankles, legs and in some cases to the abdomen, with extreme fatigue and breathlessness, which it's worth getting checked out especially if you are fainting."" The main symptom for many, including Arlene, is a cardiac arrest. Ms Talbot said the condition acts in an inherited pattern so there was a need for the family of people with AVRC to be tested. ""I don't think there was a point I realised that I had a cardiac arrest, I was just drip-fed it everyday until I understood,"" says Arlene After the doctors identified Arlene's heart disease she was moved to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where she underwent surgery to have a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (SCID) fitted in her side. ""I feel much more confident now knowing that I have an SICD fitted,"" Arlene says. ""I feel more reassured with that being in because before I was always getting these heart palpitations and obviously in the back of your mind that is what you're thinking - 'Am I going to have a heart attack?'"" After five weeks recovering in hospital, Arlene is home and gradually getting back to normal life and taking each day as it comes. ""You know your own body. If you're not feeling right and something's not right you need to just be persistent,"" she said.

US offered millions to Iranian tanker captain,"The Adrian Darya 1 left Gibraltar in August, despite a last-minute US effort to keep it detained The US state department has confirmed it offered millions of dollars to the captain of an Iranian oil tanker which is at the centre of a diplomatic row. Brian Hook, head of the department's Iran Action Group, emailed the captain of the Adrian Darya 1 about sailing it somewhere the US could seize it. The vessel was suspected of moving oil to Syria, and was temporarily impounded by UK authorities in Gibraltar in July. It was released last month after Iran gave assurances about its destination. The US justice department, which had tried to block the release, then issueda warrant to seize the tanker. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained Reports of the cash offer first appeared in the Financial Times,externalon Wednesday and have been confirmed by the state department. ""We have conducted extensive outreach to several ship captains as well as shipping companies,"" a spokeswoman told AFP news agency. The US blacklisted the tankerlast Friday.A treasury department statement said the vessel was being used to transport 2.1 million barrels of Iranian crude oil,externalfor the benefit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard - a branch of the country's armed forces the US has designated a terrorist organisation. According to the Financial Times, Mr Hook sent an email to the Indian captain of the Adrian Darya 1, Akhilesh Kumar, before it imposed sanctions on the ship. ""I am writing with good news,"" the email read. The Trump administration was willing to pay the captain several million dollars to take the ship somewhere it could be seized by US authorities. The emails reportedly carried a state department phone number to make sure the captain - who took over the ship after it was impounded - did not think they were fake. This video can not be played The BBC obtained footage of the inside of the tanker when it was detained in Gibraltar Mr Hook told the newspaper the state department was ""working very closely with the maritime community to disrupt and deter illicit oil exports"". Mr Kumar ignored the emails. The US then imposed sanctions on him personally when they blacklisted the Adrian Darya 1. On Twitter, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif accused the US of ""outright blackmail"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Trump administration announced on Wednesday new sanctions on an Iranian shipping network used to sell oil,external, and offered $15m to anyone who could help to disrupt the system. The Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, wasdetained by British authorities in Gibraltaron 4 July after it was suspected of moving oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. It was releasedon 15 August after Iran gave assurances it would not discharge its cargo in Syria - despite the last-minute US effort to prevent its release. Tracking websites indicate the ship is currently in the eastern Mediterranean, although it has reportedly turned off its signalling device. Its initial seizure sparked a diplomatic crisis between the UK and Iran, which saw Iran seize a British-flagged and Swedish-owned oil tanker, the Stena Impero, in the Gulf. On Wednesday it released seven of the ship's 23 international crew. The remaining 16 crew members are believed to be with the vessel near Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas.

Viagogo sidesteps legal action with website fixes,"The secondary ticketing website Viagogo has improved how it communicates with customers, prompting the Competition and Markets Authority to suspend plans for legal action. The competition watchdog said its concerns over how Viagogo presented information had been addressed. The website was now ""worlds apart"" from the one that prompted the legal action, the CMA's chief executive said. However, he said it had taken Viagogo far too long to make the changes. ""Key information needed to make informed decisions before buying a ticket is now much clearer, including on where you'll sit in a venue and whether you might be turned away at the door,"" said Andrea Coscelli. ""What is clearly not acceptable is the time it's taken to get to this stage."" A spokesperson for Viagogo said the company was ""pleased"" it had been able to work with the CMA ""to find solutions to the final few areas of discussion"". ""This has been a complex and detailed process, and open dialogue with the market authority has been essential. ""We are grateful to the CMA for their engagement over the past few months and the ability of both parties to work collaboratively to reach this point."" Google suspends ticket site Viagogo Viagogo faces new court action from watchdog Viagogo, like rival ticket reselling operator, Stubhub, offers customers the chance to resell tickets for concerts, theatre, sporting, and other events that they have already purchased via an app. But the arrival of such sites was blamed for hugely inflating costs for ordinary fans, with ticket touts buying up large numbers of tickets for resale on the secondary market. Last year, the CMA asked operators to improve the information provided about things like whether there is a risk the buyer will be turned away at the door, which ticket they are getting, and the availability and popularity of tickets. Two other rival sites, GetMeIn and Seatwave, subsequently closed down. Earlier this year, Viagogo was told it would face legal action because it had failed to comply adequately with the CMA's instructions. However, the CMA said as a result of improvements to the Viagogo website since then the watchdog had now suspended its preparations for court action. But it said it had not ruled out future action if the problems recurred or if other issues were identified. The CMA said it would keep up its pressure on Viagogo to ensure that it complied with UK consumer protection law.

PC jailed for buying porn as child lay dead in homePC Avi Maharaj was alone at the family home when he used their TV account to buy porn.London,"PC Avi Maharaj was jailed for 12 months after pleading guilty to fraud A police officer who bought pornography at the family home of a dead child has been jailed for 12 months. Met PC Avi Maharaj was asked to guard the house on 11 February 2018 while the family was ""being consoled elsewhere"" after their 14-year-old son had taken his own life. Maharaj guessed the password to the household Virgin Media account and downloaded four pornographic films. He was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday. Maharaj, 44, of Kingswood Place, Hayes, had previously pleaded guilty to fraud. The family had initially thought their son had downloaded the clips before realising Maharaj was responsible. Sentencing, Judge Deborah Taylor told him that while the parents of the boy were grieving elsewhere he had responsibility to guard the house. ""Instead of performing that duty with respect and professionalism, you took it upon yourself to guess the password to the household Virgin Media account, to act as if you were the account holder, and use it to purchase, download and view four pornography films."" The judge added the family were ""vulnerable, traumatised by the loss of their son, and trusted you to guard their house"" and his actions had led to a ""false understanding of their son's last hours"". ""All right-thinking people would be appalled by your gross lack of decency and respect in indulging yourself at all in those circumstances, let alone deviously, and at the expense of the bereaved parents."" Pc Maharaj was supposed to be waiting for the undertaker to take the body away when he downloaded pornography worth Â£25.96. He then falsified his attendance logs, claiming he left the property in Littleton Street almost two hours earlier than he really did as part of a bid to cover up his actions, the court heard. In a letter, the boy's father, Graham Miller, said Maharaj's actions had initially ""upset"" his image of his son, adding it ""made me feel like I didn't know my own son"". The boy's father only realised his son was not responsible for the downloads when he contacted Virgin Media and was told what time the clips were downloaded. Maharaj, who was based in Earlsfield, Wandsworth, initially denied the allegations when interviewed by police, the court heard. ""He provided officers with a prepared statement in which he denied the allegation and questioned security of the premises,"" Prosecutor Gregor McKinley said. Edmund Gritt, representing Maharaj, said the defendant ""expressed his wholly ashamed apologies to the Miller family"". Avi Maharaj pleaded guilty to fraud at Westminster Magistrates' Court in July Mr Gritt told the court that Maharaj's guilty plea would ""terminate"" his police career ""forever"". He added it was ""inevitable"" he would be dismissed. The Met officer's conviction follows a complaint from a member of the child's family, which led to an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The IOPC's regional director Sal Naseem described PC Maharaj's behaviour as ""shocking"" and ""deceitful"", adding that he ""caused considerable distress for the family involved who were dealing with the sudden death of a family member"". The Met said there would be a special case hearing on Monday.

Industry bill for PPI claims could hit Â£53bnThe new estimate for the cost of claims comes as shares in CYBG plunge as it warns of a higher bill.Business,"The payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal could cost banks Â£53bn, according to a forecast made as firms warned of mounting bills from claims. Dominic Lindley of New City Agenda made the estimate as CYBG warned of a potential Â£450m bill for new claims. Shares fell 21% to record lows. The owner of Clydesdale, Yorkshire and Virgin Money blamed an ""unprecedented volume"" of complaints sparked by the 29 August deadline for claims. Other banks also face higher costs. Royal Bank of Scotland, owner of NatWest, said on Wednesday it could face a Â£900m charge, while Co-operative Bank said on Thursday it was assessing its costs. Mr Lindley, who has been keeping a tally at the think tank, said:  ""This means that total provisions from the banks could reach Â£53bn."" He believes the bank with the biggest bill, Lloyds Banking Group, could announce an extra provision of Â£2bn, while Barclays might set aside as much as Â£1bn more. Neither Lloyds nor Barclays was able to comment on the speculation. The FCA advert urged customers to make claims before the 29 August deadline The Financial Conduct Authority set the deadline for PPI claims at 23:59 on 29 August to try to stem the wave of claims. Policies were mis-sold to people who were borrowing money, but did not need the cover or would not be able to use it. PPI was designed to protect borrowers if they had an accident, fell sick or lost their job. But in millions of cases, the policyholders did not understand what they were paying for or that they might not be covered. Virgin Money bought by CYBG for Â£1.7bn The deadline sparked a wave of publicity and fresh claims, according to the industry. CYBG, which bought Virgin Money last year, said it received more than eight months' worth of requests for information about potential claims in just one month, with approximately 340,000 in aggregate over five weeks,. Some 120,000 of these were received in the final three days. It said it also received a sustained increase in complaints during the same period, with an average of 5,000 a week during the first four weeks of August and an additional 22,000 complaints submitted during the final three days. The typical compensation award across the industry is running at more than Â£2,000, but some people have been sent tens of thousands. Co-op Bank on Thursday said it had ""received a substantially greater volume of inquiries and complaints than expected in the final days prior to the complaint deadline"" and was assessing the impact on its costs for processing and paying out claims. Mr Lindley said the last-minute spike in PPI complaints would have ""a significant impact on the banks when they announce their next financial results"". Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec, said the announcement by CYBG was ""really quite shocking in terms of the anticipated damage"". He pointed out that Â£400m is 20% of CYBG's current stock market. He now assumes that the bank will not pay a dividend for this year. CYBG's shares fell 20% to 110p - the lowest levelsince since it was spun out of National Australia Bank in 2016.

Doors open for 23 minutes on 80mph train,"The door of the carriage was open for 23 minutes A door on a passenger train was open for 23 minutes while the vehicle travelled at 80mph (128km/h). A passenger reported it to the driver at Hockley station, in Essex, at 07:20 BST on the Liverpool Street to Southend line on 22 August, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said. The train travelled in traffic for 16 miles (26km) with the door open. Train operator Greater Anglia said the carriage had immediately been taken out of service. The RAIB has conducted an investigation and will release a ""safety digest"" at a later date. Martin Moran, Greater Anglia commercial and customer service director, said: ""Safety is our highest priority. ""We immediately took the train out of service when this happened and carried out our own investigation into the incident. ""We have also carried out checks on every single door on that type of train that we have. ""No-one was injured in this incident and there have been no further incidents since."" The train stopped at Hockley station while the incident was dealt with A witness who was not on the train, who wished to remain anonymous, said he had seen Greater Anglia staff shouting and a technician working on the door. He said: ""All of a sudden there was a technician there looking at the door at the side. It must have been loose because they were able to slide it back."" M6 reopens after gin spill traffic chaos Couple 'shocked' to find migrant in car roof box 'Children just seem sad nowadays' Derek Monnery, chairman of the Essex Rail Users Federation, said it was an unusual incident and it may have been down to recent refurbishment work on Greater Anglia's rolling stock. He said: ""It could be a dangerous situation if the train is crowded and a lot of people are standing there, which fortunately it doesn't sound like it was in this case. ""It should never have happened."" Greater Anglia confirmed the carriage was one of those which had been refurbished but said it was unable to say if this had been a factor in the incident until its investigation had been completed.

Hurricane Dorian heads to US after lashing Bahamas,"This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian causes floods and tornadoes in South Carolina Heavy rains from Hurricane Dorian are battering the south-eastern seaboard of the US after causing at least 30 deaths and much destruction in the Bahamas. Dorian, now a category one storm, has left thousands of homes in South and North Carolina without power as it moves slowly northwards. Forecasters warn that some areas could experience dangerous storm surges. On 1 September, Dorian hit the Bahamas with winds of up to 185mph - equalling the highest ever recorded at landfall. It battered the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama, in the north of the archipelago, for two days. Officials say the final death toll in the Bahamas will be staggering. Dorian is expected to weaken slowly over the next few days. It currently has maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h), down from 105mph earlier in the day. In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Hurricane Dorian: Who's at risk? Have you been affected by Hurricane Dorian? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external This video can not be played Residents in the Bahamas say ""it's total devastation"" Bahamas PM Hubert Minnis called the storm ""one of the greatest national crises in our country's history"". He expected the number of fatalities to increase. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said thatat 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT) Dorian  was 55 miles (90km) east of Wilmington,externalin North Carolina and moving north-east at about 15mph. The NHC said Dorian would move ""near or over"" the coast of North Carolina in the next few hours. In South Carolina, more than 250,000 homes and businesses in coastal areas were left without power, officials said. Social media footage showed flooding in the centre of the city of Charleston.

More than 2.2 million people have been ordered to evacuate along the eastern seaboard. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, the Abaco Islands We've heard about the record-breaking strength of Hurricane Dorian for days now but to see the impact on the ground is staggering. Roofs were just lifted up and slammed to the ground, buildings all but destroyed. Having flown over the Abaco Islands, I can tell you there is mile upon mile of this. The northern Bahamas have borne the brunt of the storm's ire. This is where, in the coming days, the humanitarian needs are going to be acute. Although Grand Bahama suffered severe damage and floods, the Abaco Islands were hardest hit. Footage taken from the air showed vast swathes of destruction. Homes, roads and businesses were torn apart, and high waters remain. The official death toll so far is 30, but Health Minister Duane Sands said he believed the final toll would be far higher. ""Let me say that I believe the number will be staggering,"" he told local radio. ""I have never lived through anything like this and I don't want to live through anything like this again."" Thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed on the Abaco Islands ""There's nothing left in most of Marsh Harbour,"" said Alicia Cook, who evacuated from the area in the Abaco Islands. ""People are starting to panic: pillaging, looting."" Bob Cornea also spoke to the BBC in the capital Nassau after being evacuated from Marsh Harbour. He said he and his wife had taken shelter on the second storey of their son's house. ""Water was up to my neck. It stayed like that for two or three hours... My son... he got us out and we got over to safety. ""We've been through all kinds of hurricanes, all kinds of storms: never anything that bad. I mean, it was like we were standing in the middle of the ocean. That's what it looked like. Waves, the water just crashing in over us. Horrifying. Absolutely horrifying."" From the air - the destruction of the Abaco Islands The British Royal Navy vessel RFA Mounts Bay has begun landing personnel and emergency aid on the Abacos. Helicopters and three UK humanitarian experts have been helping to co-ordinate the rescue response. The aid operation on Grand Bahama has been hampered by severe damage to its airport. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed. Residents share images of devastation Some 70,000 people are in ""immediate need"" of aid, UN officials said. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

More violent crime reported on British railways,"Crime recorded on British railways increased by 12% last year including a rise in the number of violent and sexual offences, new figures show. British Transport Police recorded 68,313 crimes in 2018/19, up from 60,867 during the previous 12 months. Violent crime accounted for a fifth of all cases after a 16% rise to 13,591, while sexual offences rose by 8% over the same period to 2,635. BTP said the figures show serious crime is rare across 3.3 billion journeys. Knife attacker jailed for 'savage' train murder Railway bicycle theft hotspots revealed Children sexually assaulted on railways More sexual offences reported on trains The latest figures show theft of passenger property was the most common offence recorded on the network - accounting for more than one in five (21%) crimes. Police figures also show a number of other crimes increasing on the rail network, including: Possession of controlled drug (up 52% to 2,305) Theft from person (up 36% to 7,593) Theft from vehicle (up 26% to 823) Assault on police (up 17% to 750) BTP noted that there was fewer than one serious crime per million passenger journeys in 2018/19. The total number of all crimes recorded per million journeys made has fallen from 25.6 in 2009/10 to 20.8 in 2018/19. Deputy chief constable Adrian Hanstock said that last year's overall increase in crime was ""of concern"" but that ""with record levels of passengers using the railway, we anticipated there could be a subsequent rise in crime"". ""As stations become increasingly commercial environments, a large proportion of this increase is as a result of theft of passenger property, anti-social behaviour or shoplifting,"" he said. ""Despite this increase, when put into context, it is important to remember that the chance of becoming a victim of crime on the railway is very low."" He added: ""Of course, any rise in crime is of concern to us and we are tackling this head-on through our problem-solving initiatives at key locations."" Susie Homan of the Rail Delivery Group, said the figures show ""Britain's railway remains one of the safest in the world"". She added: ""As an industry we are working with the BTP to return to a long-term trend of falling crime on the railway, by trialling and investing in new technology like body-worn cameras for staff and working with police to increase the reporting of crime.""

"Hurricane Dorian heads to US after lashing BahamasA deadly storm surge is feared from Georgia to Virginia, as the Bahamas reels from the devastation.US & Canada","This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian causes floods and tornadoes in South Carolina Heavy rains from Hurricane Dorian are battering the south-eastern seaboard of the US after causing at least 30 deaths and much destruction in the Bahamas. Dorian, now a category one storm, has left thousands of homes in South and North Carolina without power as it moves slowly northwards. Forecasters warn that some areas could experience dangerous storm surges. On 1 September, Dorian hit the Bahamas with winds of up to 185mph - equalling the highest ever recorded at landfall. It battered the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama, in the north of the archipelago, for two days. Officials say the final death toll in the Bahamas will be staggering. Dorian is expected to weaken slowly over the next few days. It currently has maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h), down from 105mph earlier in the day. In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Hurricane Dorian: Who's at risk? Have you been affected by Hurricane Dorian? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external This video can not be played Residents in the Bahamas say ""it's total devastation"" Bahamas PM Hubert Minnis called the storm ""one of the greatest national crises in our country's history"". He expected the number of fatalities to increase. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said thatat 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT) Dorian  was 55 miles (90km) east of Wilmington,externalin North Carolina and moving north-east at about 15mph. The NHC said Dorian would move ""near or over"" the coast of North Carolina in the next few hours. In South Carolina, more than 250,000 homes and businesses in coastal areas were left without power, officials said. Social media footage showed flooding in the centre of the city of Charleston.

Graphics showed waters could rise up to 8ft (2.4m) above ground level on the South Carolina coast, andup to 15in of rain could fall,externalin the coming days. More than 2.2 million people have been ordered to evacuate along the eastern seaboard. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, the Abaco Islands We've heard about the record-breaking strength of Hurricane Dorian for days now but to see the impact on the ground is staggering. Roofs were just lifted up and slammed to the ground, buildings all but destroyed. Having flown over the Abaco Islands, I can tell you there is mile upon mile of this. The northern Bahamas have borne the brunt of the storm's ire. This is where, in the coming days, the humanitarian needs are going to be acute. Although Grand Bahama suffered severe damage and floods, the Abaco Islands were hardest hit. Footage taken from the air showed vast swathes of destruction. Homes, roads and businesses were torn apart, and high waters remain. The official death toll so far is 30, but Health Minister Duane Sands said he believed the final toll would be far higher. ""Let me say that I believe the number will be staggering,"" he told local radio. ""I have never lived through anything like this and I don't want to live through anything like this again."" Thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed on the Abaco Islands ""There's nothing left in most of Marsh Harbour,"" said Alicia Cook, who evacuated from the area in the Abaco Islands. ""People are starting to panic: pillaging, looting."" Bob Cornea also spoke to the BBC in the capital Nassau after being evacuated from Marsh Harbour. He said he and his wife had taken shelter on the second storey of their son's house. ""Water was up to my neck. It stayed like that for two or three hours... My son... he got us out and we got over to safety. ""We've been through all kinds of hurricanes, all kinds of storms: never anything that bad. I mean, it was like we were standing in the middle of the ocean. That's what it looked like. Waves, the water just crashing in over us. Horrifying. Absolutely horrifying."" From the air - the destruction of the Abaco Islands The British Royal Navy vessel RFA Mounts Bay has begun landing personnel and emergency aid on the Abacos. Helicopters and three UK humanitarian experts have been helping to co-ordinate the rescue response. The aid operation on Grand Bahama has been hampered by severe damage to its airport. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed. Residents share images of devastation Some 70,000 people are in ""immediate need"" of aid, UN officials said. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/hSome minor flooding, little structural damage.Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/hRoofs and trees could be damaged.Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/hHouses suffer damage, severe floodingStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/hSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""Mayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...

"Iran reveals next steps in nuclear brinkmanshipIt is the third time Iran defies limits on its nuclear activity, increasing pressure to save deal.Middle East","Hassan Rouhani (2nd right) has given European powers two months to save the nuclear deal Iran is to lift all limits on its development of centrifuges used to enrich uranium on Friday - the latest step in reducing its commitments under a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. President Hassan Rouhani said the country would do whatever was necessary to be able to accelerate enrichment. Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. Iran stopped abiding by two commitments in July in response to sanctions the US reinstated when it abandoned the deal. President Donald Trump wants to force Iran to negotiate a new agreement that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles. But Iran has so far refused. Why limits on Iran's enrichment matter Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Can the nuclear deal can be saved? Other countries which are parties to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - have tried to keep it alive. But the sanctions have caused Iran's oil exports to collapse, the value of its currency to plummet, and sent its inflation rate soaring. Inspectors from the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed on 1 July that Iran had breached the 300kg (660lb) limit on the amount of enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained Six days later, Iran began enriching uranium to 4.5% concentration so it could make fuel for its Bushehr power plant - beyond the 3.67% cap enshrined in the nuclear deal. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. On Wednesday night, President Rouhani announced that ""all limitations"" imposed on Iran's research and development of centrifuge technology would also be lifted. ""We will witness research and development on different kinds of centrifuges and new centrifuges and also whatever is needed for enriching uranium in an accelerated way,"" he said. Mr Rouhani stressed the activities would be peaceful and supervised by the IAEA. Under the accord, Iran is allowed to operate no more than 5,060 IR-1 centrifuges - the oldest and least efficient model - until 2026. The country is also permitted to continue research and development in a manner that does not accumulate enriched uranium, and to test more advanced IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges, which can more quickly enrich uranium. After 2024, it may commence the testing of up to 30 IR-6 centrifuges. The installation of advanced centrifuges would shorten Iran's so-called ""break-out time"" - the time required for it to produce enough fissile material for a bomb. Unlike the United States, which has simply abandoned the nuclear deal, Iran has stuck with the agreement, only gradually breaching some of its terms in protest at what it sees as the failure of the other parties to come up with the benefits they promised. But Iran's latest decision to breach the limits on its development and production of advanced centrifuges raises one inevitable question. Just how far can it go in abandoning elements of the deal before it is rendered worthless? France is desperately trying to establish a financial lifeline for Iran to keep the deal alive. But would the US countenance such a move? Washington insists upon applying ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran. But is this strategy working? Iran - unsurprisingly - shows no sign of seeking a new (and more restrictive) nuclear deal. And neither does it appear to be scaling back its ambitious regional plans that have prompted recent Israeli air strikes in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. European Commission spokesman Carlos Martin Ruiz De Gordejuela urged Iran to reverse its latest decision, warning that it was ""inconsistent"" with the nuclear deal. ""And in this context we urge Iran to reverse these steps and refrain from further measures that undermine the nuclear deal,"" he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was a staunch opponent of the agreement, said Iran's announcement showed it was ""striving to attain nuclear weapons"" and insisted there should be no negotiations with the country. ""This is not the time to have talks with Iran. It is time to step up pressure on Iran,"" he said. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal Mr Netanyahu was speaking to reporters before flying to London for talks with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US Defence Secretary Mark Esper. Mr Rouhani also said on Wednesday that he would give European powers two months to fulfil their commitments to shield the Iranian economy from the US sanctions. Iranian officials have given a cautious welcome to a French proposal to offer Iran a $15bn (Â£12.5bn) line of credit, secured by oil, in return for its full compliance with the nuclear deal. That would allow Iran to obtain foreign currency. A senior US official told Reuters news agency that the Trump administration was ""pretty sceptical"" of the French initiative but had not ruled out approving it. ""We have not yet seen anything, a concrete proposal that would be compliant with our sanctions and other actions so it's very difficult to judge,"" the official added.

Boris Johnson said on Thursday afternoon that he would ""rather be dead in a ditch"" than ask the EU to delay Brexitbeyond 31 October. But lawyers representing businesswoman Gina Miller have said decision to suspend parliament isan unlawful abuse of power. In the latest blow to hit the new Prime Minister, his brotherJo announced he is resigning as an MP and minister, saying he is ""torn between family loyalty and the national interest"". Meanwhile, as the prospect of an early General Election looms,nearly 200,000 people have applied to register to vote in just 72 hours- and more than half of them are under 35. MPs will get another chanceto vote for an early election on Monday, the government has announced. And former Labour MPLuciana Berger has joined the Liberal Democrats, saying the party is ""unequivocal in wanting to stop Brexit"". That's the end of our live page coverage today. Gina Miller outside Parliament Leading judges are expected to announce their decision on Friday on the latest legal action brought over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and two other judges at the High Court in London have been urged to find that Mr Johnson's advice to the Queen on 28 August to prorogue Parliament for an ""exceptional"" length of time was an ""unlawful abuse of power"". After hearing submissions on Thursday on an urgent judicial review application brought by businesswoman Gina Miller, Lord Burnett announced that the hearing would be adjourned until 10am on Friday. The case brought by Ms Miller, who successfully challenged the government at the High Court in 2016 over the triggering of the Article 50 process to start the Brexit countdown, is supported by a number of other parties, including former prime minister Sir John Major. The action was contested by the prime minister, whose lawyer argued that the advice given to the Queen was not unlawful and that, in any event, Ms Miller's claim was ""academic"". Former Prime Minister John Major says Boris
Johnson should fire Dominic Cummings, the adviser behind his Brexit strategy. ""We have seen over-mighty advisors before. It is a familiar script. It always ends badly,"" Mr Major said in a speech at a Confederation of British Industry event in Glasgow. ""I offer the prime minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly."" Mr Cummings, architect of the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, is Mr Johnson's top adviser. Mr Major, who supported the referendum campaign to stay in the
EU, attacked Johnson's plan to suspend parliament for more than
a month before Britain is due to leave the European Union. ""I cannot believe any previous prime minister â from Pitt,
to Disraeli, to Churchill, to Thatcher â would have even
contemplated such an action,"" he said. Mr Major also criticised the government for publicly attacking
critics of its Brexit strategy. ""This is behaviour I never thought to see from any British
government, and it must stop,"" he added. Labour's Yvette Cooper has accused Boris Johnson of an ""abuse of power"" for using a backdrop of police officers in a ""political stunt"". The chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee said she would write to the Cabinet Secretary and West Yorkshire Police's chief constable. The Labour MP said: ""For Boris Johnson to make so many police stop their training and work to be part of his political stunt is an abuse of power. ""Police officers and trainees are overstretched and need to be able to get on with their job, not have to waste time listening to Boris Johnson's political press conference. ""For Boris Johnson to draw so many of them into a long, election-driven event like this is completely inappropriate and it is unfair on the people of West Yorkshire who are entitled to expect that their police are allowed to get on with the job of working and training to keep them safe. ""I am writing to the Cabinet Secretary as well as the West Yorkshire Chief Constable John Robins to ask how this has happened and what guidelines were followed."" Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he'd ""rather be dead in a ditch"" than go to ask Brussels for a delay to Brexit. He was responding to a question from a reporter after making a speech in front of police recruits in West Yorkshire. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'I'd rather be dead in a ditch' than ask for Brexit delay Speaking in West Yorkshire this afternoon, Mr Johnson accused Parliament of having ""absolutely torpedoed"" the UK's negotiating position with the EU by working to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He reiterated his call for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to back his efforts for a general election to be held on 15 October. The PM added: ""I really don't see how we can have a situation where the British ability to negotiate is absolutely torpedoed by Parliament in this way with powers of the British people handed over to Brussels so we can be kept incarcerated in the EU without that actually being put to the people in the form of a vote."" âHigh chanceâ of no deal feared in August Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Boris Johnson warned the cabinet on 28 August that there was a âhigh chanceâ that he would fail to get a new deal with the European Union over Brexit. The warning is contained in a minute of a cabinet conference-call that day, in which the prime minister briefed colleagues about the progress of talks with Brussels. The minutes, disclosed in the Brexit court cases today in England and Scotland, include a summary of final remarks from Mr Johnson to cabinet ministers. âConcluding the prime minister said that progress with the EU should not be exaggerated but it was substantial,â reads the document. âWhilst there was a good chance that a deal could be secured, there was also a high chance that it could notâ¦ The Cabinet took note.â Days earlier, in a BBC interview at the G7 summit, Mr Johnson had only said that a deal was âtouch and goâ. Earlier in the summer he said the chances of leaving the EU without a deal over trade and security were a  âmillion to oneâ. Hereâs the document: Jacob Rees-Mogg has been criticised by MPs for comparing a doctor who had been advising
the government as part of Operation Yellowhammer to the discredited Andrew Wakefield. Mr Wakefield is widely blamed for the scare over the MMR jab. On Monday, David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist who is pro-Remain, called an LBC phone-in show and asked the leader of the Commons what mortality rate he would accept if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal. During a Commons business statement, Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs: ""What he had to say, I will repeat it, is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield in threatening that people will die because we leave the European Union. ""What level of irresponsibility was that?"" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Rees-Mogg's comments were ""irresponsible"", while Liberal Democrat MP Dr Sarah Wollaston said they were ""absolutely disgusting"".

"Iran reveals next steps in nuclear brinkmanshipIt is the third time Iran defies limits on its nuclear activity, increasing pressure to save deal.","Hassan Rouhani (2nd right) has given European powers two months to save the nuclear deal Iran is to lift all limits on its development of centrifuges used to enrich uranium on Friday - the latest step in reducing its commitments under a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. President Hassan Rouhani said the country would do whatever was necessary to be able to accelerate enrichment. Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. Iran stopped abiding by two commitments in July in response to sanctions the US reinstated when it abandoned the deal. President Donald Trump wants to force Iran to negotiate a new agreement that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles. But Iran has so far refused. Why limits on Iran's enrichment matter Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Can the nuclear deal can be saved? Other countries which are parties to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - have tried to keep it alive. But the sanctions have caused Iran's oil exports to collapse, the value of its currency to plummet, and sent its inflation rate soaring. Inspectors from the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed on 1 July that Iran had breached the 300kg (660lb) limit on the amount of enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained Six days later, Iran began enriching uranium to 4.5% concentration so it could make fuel for its Bushehr power plant - beyond the 3.67% cap enshrined in the nuclear deal. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. On Wednesday night, President Rouhani announced that ""all limitations"" imposed on Iran's research and development of centrifuge technology would also be lifted. ""We will witness research and development on different kinds of centrifuges and new centrifuges and also whatever is needed for enriching uranium in an accelerated way,"" he said. Mr Rouhani stressed the activities would be peaceful and supervised by the IAEA. Under the accord, Iran is allowed to operate no more than 5,060 IR-1 centrifuges - the oldest and least efficient model - until 2026. The country is also permitted to continue research and development in a manner that does not accumulate enriched uranium, and to test more advanced IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges, which can more quickly enrich uranium. After 2024, it may commence the testing of up to 30 IR-6 centrifuges. The installation of advanced centrifuges would shorten Iran's so-called ""break-out time"" - the time required for it to produce enough fissile material for a bomb. Unlike the United States, which has simply abandoned the nuclear deal, Iran has stuck with the agreement, only gradually breaching some of its terms in protest at what it sees as the failure of the other parties to come up with the benefits they promised. But Iran's latest decision to breach the limits on its development and production of advanced centrifuges raises one inevitable question. Just how far can it go in abandoning elements of the deal before it is rendered worthless? France is desperately trying to establish a financial lifeline for Iran to keep the deal alive. But would the US countenance such a move? Washington insists upon applying ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran. But is this strategy working? Iran - unsurprisingly - shows no sign of seeking a new (and more restrictive) nuclear deal. And neither does it appear to be scaling back its ambitious regional plans that have prompted recent Israeli air strikes in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. European Commission spokesman Carlos Martin Ruiz De Gordejuela urged Iran to reverse its latest decision, warning that it was ""inconsistent"" with the nuclear deal. ""And in this context we urge Iran to reverse these steps and refrain from further measures that undermine the nuclear deal,"" he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was a staunch opponent of the agreement, said Iran's announcement showed it was ""striving to attain nuclear weapons"" and insisted there should be no negotiations with the country. ""This is not the time to have talks with Iran. It is time to step up pressure on Iran,"" he said. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal Mr Netanyahu was speaking to reporters before flying to London for talks with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US Defence Secretary Mark Esper. Mr Rouhani also said on Wednesday that he would give European powers two months to fulfil their commitments to shield the Iranian economy from the US sanctions. Iranian officials have given a cautious welcome to a French proposal to offer Iran a $15bn (Â£12.5bn) line of credit, secured by oil, in return for its full compliance with the nuclear deal. That would allow Iran to obtain foreign currency. A senior US official told Reuters news agency that the Trump administration was ""pretty sceptical"" of the French initiative but had not ruled out approving it. ""We have not yet seen anything, a concrete proposal that would be compliant with our sanctions and other actions so it's very difficult to judge,"" the official added.

In pictures: Dorian's devastation,"The Bahamas has begun to count the cost of the devastation brought by Hurricane Dorian. Dorian struck the Abaco Islands as a category five hurricane, then pounded Grand Bahama for two days. Thousands of homes were destroyed and at least 20 lives lost, though that toll is expected to rise. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said the storm had caused ""generational devastation"". Dorian has headed north and is now threatening the eastern US seaboard. Grand Bahama: Dorian severely damaged the international airport on the island, hampering rescue efforts. Some newer homes survived well, while other structures were obliterated. Abaco Islands: The Abacos took the full force of Dorian last weekend. Only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane matched its landfall wind speed of 185mph (298km/h). The town of Marsh Harbour was devastated. Entire communities were flattened on the Abacos, with thousands of people needing shelter and aid. The coastal surges have still to recede in many parts. There was joy for some families as they were reunited in the capital, Nassau, after evacuations from the Abacos. Photos are copyright.

US offered millions to Iran tanker captain,"The Adrian Darya 1 left Gibraltar in August, despite a last-minute US effort to keep it detained The US state department has confirmed it offered millions of dollars to the captain of an Iranian oil tanker which is at the centre of a diplomatic row. Brian Hook, head of the department's Iran Action Group, emailed the captain of the Adrian Darya 1 about sailing it somewhere the US could seize it. The vessel was suspected of moving oil to Syria, and was temporarily impounded by UK authorities in Gibraltar in July. It was released last month after Iran gave assurances about its destination. The US justice department, which had tried to block the release, then issueda warrant to seize the tanker. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained Reports of the cash offer first appeared in the Financial Times,externalon Wednesday and have been confirmed by the state department. ""We have conducted extensive outreach to several ship captains as well as shipping companies,"" a spokeswoman told AFP news agency. The US blacklisted the tankerlast Friday.A treasury department statement said the vessel was being used to transport 2.1 million barrels of Iranian crude oil,externalfor the benefit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard - a branch of the country's armed forces the US has designated a terrorist organisation. According to the Financial Times, Mr Hook sent an email to the Indian captain of the Adrian Darya 1, Akhilesh Kumar, before it imposed sanctions on the ship. ""I am writing with good news,"" the email read. The Trump administration was willing to pay the captain several million dollars to take the ship somewhere it could be seized by US authorities. The emails reportedly carried a state department phone number to make sure the captain - who took over the ship after it was impounded - did not think they were fake. This video can not be played The BBC obtained footage of the inside of the tanker when it was detained in Gibraltar Mr Hook told the newspaper the state department was ""working very closely with the maritime community to disrupt and deter illicit oil exports"". Mr Kumar ignored the emails. The US then imposed sanctions on him personally when they blacklisted the Adrian Darya 1. On Twitter, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif accused the US of ""outright blackmail"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, wasdetained by British authorities in Gibraltaron 4 July after it was suspected of moving oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. It was releasedon 15 August after Iran gave assurances it would not discharge its cargo in Syria - despite the last-minute US effort to prevent its release. Tracking websites indicate the ship is currently in the eastern Mediterranean, although it has reportedly turned off its signalling device. Its initial seizure sparked a diplomatic crisis between the UK and Iran, which saw Iran seize a British-flagged and Swedish-owned oil tanker, the Stena Impero, in the Gulf. On Wednesday it released seven of the ship's 23 international crew. The remaining 16 crew members are believed to be with the vessel near Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas.

MPs have approved it It would force Boris Johnson to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit to prevent no-deal on 31 October Vanessa Barford and Keiligh Baker Former Labour MP Luciana Berger has joined the Liberal Democrats, saying the party is ""unequivocal in wanting to stop Brexit"" It's been another busy day in British politics. Boris Johnson said on Thursday afternoon that he would ""rather be dead in a ditch"" than ask the EU to delay Brexitbeyond 31 October. But lawyers representing businesswoman Gina Miller have said decision to suspend parliament isan unlawful abuse of power. In the latest blow to hit the new Prime Minister, his brotherJo announced he is resigning as an MP and minister, saying he is ""torn between family loyalty and the national interest"". Meanwhile, as the prospect of an early General Election looms,nearly 200,000 people have applied to register to vote in just 72 hours- and more than half of them are under 35. MPs will get another chanceto vote for an early election on Monday, the government has announced. And former Labour MPLuciana Berger has joined the Liberal Democrats, saying the party is ""unequivocal in wanting to stop Brexit"". That's the end of our live page coverage today. Gina Miller outside Parliament Leading judges are expected to announce their decision on Friday on the latest legal action brought over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and two other judges at the High Court in London have been urged to find that Mr Johnson's advice to the Queen on 28 August to prorogue Parliament for an ""exceptional"" length of time was an ""unlawful abuse of power"". After hearing submissions on Thursday on an urgent judicial review application brought by businesswoman Gina Miller, Lord Burnett announced that the hearing would be adjourned until 10am on Friday. The case brought by Ms Miller, who successfully challenged the government at the High Court in 2016 over the triggering of the Article 50 process to start the Brexit countdown, is supported by a number of other parties, including former prime minister Sir John Major. The action was contested by the prime minister, whose lawyer argued that the advice given to the Queen was not unlawful and that, in any event, Ms Miller's claim was ""academic"". Former Prime Minister John Major says Boris
Johnson should fire Dominic Cummings, the adviser behind his Brexit strategy. ""We have seen over-mighty advisors before. It is a familiar script. It always ends badly,"" Mr Major said in a speech at a Confederation of British Industry event in Glasgow. ""I offer the prime minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly."" Mr Cummings, architect of the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, is Mr Johnson's top adviser. Mr Major, who supported the referendum campaign to stay in the
EU, attacked Johnson's plan to suspend parliament for more than
a month before Britain is due to leave the European Union. ""I cannot believe any previous prime minister â from Pitt,
to Disraeli, to Churchill, to Thatcher â would have even
contemplated such an action,"" he said. Mr Major also criticised the government for publicly attacking
critics of its Brexit strategy. ""This is behaviour I never thought to see from any British
government, and it must stop,"" he added. Labour's Yvette Cooper has accused Boris Johnson of an ""abuse of power"" for using a backdrop of police officers in a ""political stunt"". The chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee said she would write to the Cabinet Secretary and West Yorkshire Police's chief constable. The Labour MP said: ""For Boris Johnson to make so many police stop their training and work to be part of his political stunt is an abuse of power. ""Police officers and trainees are overstretched and need to be able to get on with their job, not have to waste time listening to Boris Johnson's political press conference. ""For Boris Johnson to draw so many of them into a long, election-driven event like this is completely inappropriate and it is unfair on the people of West Yorkshire who are entitled to expect that their police are allowed to get on with the job of working and training to keep them safe. ""I am writing to the Cabinet Secretary as well as the West Yorkshire Chief Constable John Robins to ask how this has happened and what guidelines were followed."" Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he'd ""rather be dead in a ditch"" than go to ask Brussels for a delay to Brexit. He was responding to a question from a reporter after making a speech in front of police recruits in West Yorkshire. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'I'd rather be dead in a ditch' than ask for Brexit delay Speaking in West Yorkshire this afternoon, Mr Johnson accused Parliament of having ""absolutely torpedoed"" the UK's negotiating position with the EU by working to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He reiterated his call for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to back his efforts for a general election to be held on 15 October. The PM added: ""I really don't see how we can have a situation where the British ability to negotiate is absolutely torpedoed by Parliament in this way with powers of the British people handed over to Brussels so we can be kept incarcerated in the EU without that actually being put to the people in the form of a vote."" âHigh chanceâ of no deal feared in August Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Boris Johnson warned the cabinet on 28 August that there was a âhigh chanceâ that he would fail to get a new deal with the European Union over Brexit. The warning is contained in a minute of a cabinet conference-call that day, in which the prime minister briefed colleagues about the progress of talks with Brussels. The minutes, disclosed in the Brexit court cases today in England and Scotland, include a summary of final remarks from Mr Johnson to cabinet ministers. âConcluding the prime minister said that progress with the EU should not be exaggerated but it was substantial,â reads the document. âWhilst there was a good chance that a deal could be secured, there was also a high chance that it could notâ¦ The Cabinet took note.â Days earlier, in a BBC interview at the G7 summit, Mr Johnson had only said that a deal was âtouch and goâ. Earlier in the summer he said the chances of leaving the EU without a deal over trade and security were a  âmillion to oneâ. Hereâs the document: Jacob Rees-Mogg has been criticised by MPs for comparing a doctor who had been advising
the government as part of Operation Yellowhammer to the discredited Andrew Wakefield. Mr Wakefield is widely blamed for the scare over the MMR jab. On Monday, David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist who is pro-Remain, called an LBC phone-in show and asked the leader of the Commons what mortality rate he would accept if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal. During a Commons business statement, Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs: ""What he had to say, I will repeat it, is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield in threatening that people will die because we leave the European Union. ""What level of irresponsibility was that?"" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Rees-Mogg's comments were ""irresponsible"", while Liberal Democrat MP Dr Sarah Wollaston said they were ""absolutely disgusting"".

He added: ""I think serious questions need to be asked about the use of police time in this way, potential politicisation of the police."" BBC political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Iran to develop centrifuges for uranium enrichment,"Hassan Rouhani (2nd right) has given European powers two months to save the nuclear deal Iran is to lift all limits on its development of centrifuges used to enrich uranium on Friday - the latest step in reducing its commitments under a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. President Hassan Rouhani said the country would do whatever was necessary to be able to accelerate enrichment. Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. Iran stopped abiding by two commitments in July in response to sanctions the US reinstated when it abandoned the deal. President Donald Trump wants to force Iran to negotiate a new agreement that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles. But Iran has so far refused. Why limits on Iran's enrichment matter Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Can the nuclear deal can be saved? Other countries which are parties to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - have tried to keep it alive. But the sanctions have caused Iran's oil exports to collapse, the value of its currency to plummet, and sent its inflation rate soaring. Inspectors from the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed on 1 July that Iran had breached the 300kg (660lb) limit on the amount of enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained Six days later, Iran began enriching uranium to 4.5% concentration so it could make fuel for its Bushehr power plant - beyond the 3.67% cap enshrined in the nuclear deal. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. On Wednesday night, President Rouhani announced that ""all limitations"" imposed on Iran's research and development of centrifuge technology would also be lifted. ""We will witness research and development on different kinds of centrifuges and new centrifuges and also whatever is needed for enriching uranium in an accelerated way,"" he said. Mr Rouhani stressed the activities would be peaceful and supervised by the IAEA. Under the accord, Iran is allowed to operate no more than 5,060 IR-1 centrifuges - the oldest and least efficient model - until 2026. The country is also permitted to continue research and development in a manner that does not accumulate enriched uranium, and to test more advanced IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges, which can more quickly enrich uranium. After 2024, it may commence the testing of up to 30 IR-6 centrifuges. The installation of advanced centrifuges would shorten Iran's so-called ""break-out time"" - the time required for it to produce enough fissile material for a bomb. Unlike the United States, which has simply abandoned the nuclear deal, Iran has stuck with the agreement, only gradually breaching some of its terms in protest at what it sees as the failure of the other parties to come up with the benefits they promised. But Iran's latest decision to breach the limits on its development and production of advanced centrifuges raises one inevitable question. Just how far can it go in abandoning elements of the deal before it is rendered worthless? France is desperately trying to establish a financial lifeline for Iran to keep the deal alive. But would the US countenance such a move? Washington insists upon applying ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran. But is this strategy working? Iran - unsurprisingly - shows no sign of seeking a new (and more restrictive) nuclear deal. And neither does it appear to be scaling back its ambitious regional plans that have prompted recent Israeli air strikes in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. European Commission spokesman Carlos Martin Ruiz De Gordejuela urged Iran to reverse its latest decision, warning that it was ""inconsistent"" with the nuclear deal. ""And in this context we urge Iran to reverse these steps and refrain from further measures that undermine the nuclear deal,"" he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was a staunch opponent of the agreement, said Iran's announcement showed it was ""striving to attain nuclear weapons"" and insisted there should be no negotiations with the country. ""This is not the time to have talks with Iran. It is time to step up pressure on Iran,"" he said. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal Mr Netanyahu was speaking to reporters before flying to London for talks with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US Defence Secretary Mark Esper. Mr Rouhani also said on Wednesday that he would give European powers two months to fulfil their commitments to shield the Iranian economy from the US sanctions. Iranian officials have given a cautious welcome to a French proposal to offer Iran a $15bn (Â£12.5bn) line of credit, secured by oil, in return for its full compliance with the nuclear deal. That would allow Iran to obtain foreign currency. A senior US official told Reuters news agency that the Trump administration was ""pretty sceptical"" of the French initiative but had not ruled out approving it. ""We have not yet seen anything, a concrete proposal that would be compliant with our sanctions and other actions so it's very difficult to judge,"" the official added.

"US offered millions to Iran tanker captainThe offer was made to the ship at the centre of an international row, the state department confirms.Middle East","The Adrian Darya 1 left Gibraltar in August, despite a last-minute US effort to keep it detained The US state department has confirmed it offered millions of dollars to the captain of an Iranian oil tanker which is at the centre of a diplomatic row. Brian Hook, head of the department's Iran Action Group, emailed the captain of the Adrian Darya 1 about sailing it somewhere the US could seize it. The vessel was suspected of moving oil to Syria, and was temporarily impounded by UK authorities in Gibraltar in July. It was released last month after Iran gave assurances about its destination. The US justice department, which had tried to block the release, then issueda warrant to seize the tanker. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained Reports of the cash offer first appeared in the Financial Times,externalon Wednesday and have been confirmed by the state department. ""We have conducted extensive outreach to several ship captains as well as shipping companies,"" a spokeswoman told AFP news agency. The US blacklisted the tankerlast Friday.A treasury department statement said the vessel was being used to transport 2.1 million barrels of Iranian crude oil,externalfor the benefit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard - a branch of the country's armed forces the US has designated a terrorist organisation. According to the Financial Times, Mr Hook sent an email to the Indian captain of the Adrian Darya 1, Akhilesh Kumar, before it imposed sanctions on the ship. ""I am writing with good news,"" the email read. The Trump administration was willing to pay the captain several million dollars to take the ship somewhere it could be seized by US authorities. The emails reportedly carried a state department phone number to make sure the captain - who took over the ship after it was impounded - did not think they were fake. This video can not be played The BBC obtained footage of the inside of the tanker when it was detained in Gibraltar Mr Hook told the newspaper the state department was ""working very closely with the maritime community to disrupt and deter illicit oil exports"". Mr Kumar ignored the emails. The US then imposed sanctions on him personally when they blacklisted the Adrian Darya 1. On Twitter, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif accused the US of ""outright blackmail"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Trump administration announced on Wednesday new sanctions on an Iranian shipping network used to sell oil,external, and offered $15m to anyone who could help to disrupt the system. The Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, wasdetained by British authorities in Gibraltaron 4 July after it was suspected of moving oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. It was releasedon 15 August after Iran gave assurances it would not discharge its cargo in Syria - despite the last-minute US effort to prevent its release. Tracking websites indicate the ship is currently in the eastern Mediterranean, although it has reportedly turned off its signalling device. Its initial seizure sparked a diplomatic crisis between the UK and Iran, which saw Iran seize a British-flagged and Swedish-owned oil tanker, the Stena Impero, in the Gulf. On Wednesday it released seven of the ship's 23 international crew. The remaining 16 crew members are believed to be with the vessel near Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas.

"More violent crime reported on British railwaysOverall crime also increased across the railway network, British Transport Police figures show.UK","Crime recorded on British railways increased by 12% last year including a rise in the number of violent and sexual offences, new figures show. British Transport Police recorded 68,313 crimes in 2018/19, up from 60,867 during the previous 12 months. Violent crime accounted for a fifth of all cases after a 16% rise to 13,591, while sexual offences rose by 8% over the same period to 2,635. BTP said the figures show serious crime is rare across 3.3 billion journeys. Knife attacker jailed for 'savage' train murder Railway bicycle theft hotspots revealed Children sexually assaulted on railways More sexual offences reported on trains The latest figures show theft of passenger property was the most common offence recorded on the network - accounting for more than one in five (21%) crimes. Police figures also show a number of other crimes increasing on the rail network, including: Possession of controlled drug (up 52% to 2,305) Theft from person (up 36% to 7,593) Theft from vehicle (up 26% to 823) Assault on police (up 17% to 750) BTP noted that there was fewer than one serious crime per million passenger journeys in 2018/19. The total number of all crimes recorded per million journeys made has fallen from 25.6 in 2009/10 to 20.8 in 2018/19. Deputy chief constable Adrian Hanstock said that last year's overall increase in crime was ""of concern"" but that ""with record levels of passengers using the railway, we anticipated there could be a subsequent rise in crime"". ""As stations become increasingly commercial environments, a large proportion of this increase is as a result of theft of passenger property, anti-social behaviour or shoplifting,"" he said. ""Despite this increase, when put into context, it is important to remember that the chance of becoming a victim of crime on the railway is very low."" He added: ""Of course, any rise in crime is of concern to us and we are tackling this head-on through our problem-solving initiatives at key locations."" Susie Homan of the Rail Delivery Group, said the figures show ""Britain's railway remains one of the safest in the world"". She added: ""As an industry we are working with the BTP to return to a long-term trend of falling crime on the railway, by trialling and investing in new technology like body-worn cameras for staff and working with police to increase the reporting of crime."" The figures do not cover Northern Ireland, as railway policing there is the responsibility of the PSNI.
