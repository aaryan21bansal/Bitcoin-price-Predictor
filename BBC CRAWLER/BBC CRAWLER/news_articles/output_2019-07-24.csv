How much would PM's shopping list cost?,"Boris Johnson has made a series of spending promises both before and after becoming prime minister. How much would all of this cost? The plan:Immediate funds to help prepare the UK for a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October. What it means:Just over a week after Mr Johnson become prime minister, the Treasury announced that Â£2.1bn would be spent bolstering border and customs operations, stockpiling critical medical supplies and supporting UK nationals abroad. Money will also be spent on a public awareness campaign ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit outcome. The cost:Ramping up no deal preparations will cost Â£2.1bn. This is on top of the Â£4.2bnTheresa May's previous government had already allocated on preparing for Brexit,external- with or without a deal. In total, the Treasury has now made Â£6.3bn available since 2016. The plan:Â£1.85bn for upgrades and new equipment at hospitals in England. What it means:The funding,externalis divided into two parts - Â£1bn will be available immediately to fund existing upgrade projects and tackle urgent needs. The Nuffield Trust has argued that this Â£1bn is money that NHS providers were promised in return for making savings over the past three years and then told they couldn't spend. But it is nonetheless a pot of money that the NHS did not have available to spend before this announcement, which it now can spend. The other Â£850m will be shared over the next five years between 20 hospitals in England to fund things like a new adult mental health inpatient unit in Manchester and four new hospital wards in Norwich. The cost:Successive governments havefailed to spendthe amount they said they would on capital projects, but if this government does manage to spend the full Â£1.85bn over five years, the Barnett formula would also require it to allocate Â£180m for Scotland, Â£110m for Wales and Â£60m for Northern Ireland, taking the total to Â£2.2bn. The plan:Hire an extra 20,000 police officers by 2022. What it means:There are 122,000 police officers in England and Wales, down from 143,000 in 2010 when Theresa May became home secretary. Mr Johnson repeated in Downing Street his plan to reverse almost all of those cuts. There has been some dispute about the link between police numbers and levels of violent crime, with Theresa May saying there was not a direct link. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said there is ""some link"" between the two. The cost:Mr Johnson has given a figure of Â£1.1bn. For police officers outside London,the lowest pay,externalwas about Â£25,400 in 2016 (although this differs from force to force). That comes to Â£500m a year but these costs will increase once they complete training, which takes about two years. Typically, after four years, the pay will increase to Â£33,700 (again outside London) - so almost Â£700m but this doesn't account for training costs. The Nottinghamshire police force,externalestimated recruitment and training to be about Â£13,000 per officer in 2012 (not including salary received during training). This would come in at about Â£258m for 20,000 new officers but again this would differ from force to force. Conservative MP Kit Malthouse, who supports Mr Johnson, says part-time special constables, who already have police training, would be recruited to become police officers, to help alleviate training costs. The plan:Create an extra 10,000 prison places in England and Wales. What it means:Michael Gove announced,externalthe building of 10,000 new prison places in 2015 and it was a commitment in the Conservative Party's manifesto for the 2017 election. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has now told BBC News that the government is only planning to create about 3,500 of those and that the extra 10,000 will start from now - so about 6,500 of the previously announced places have clearly been scrapped. ""By the end of the programme in the mid-2020s we'll have delivered about 13,500 extra prison places,"" he said. The first new prison will be built at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire where there is already a maximum security prison. The new prison at Full Sutton was previouslyannounced in 2017. The cost:The programme is supposed to cost ""up to Â£2.5bn"" by the mid-2020s. That's the cost of building or refurbishing cells, not the ongoing cost of running them, which has not yet been announced. The justice secretary maintains that ""this is new money"", but it is not clear how much of the Â£1.3bn previously allocated to building 10,000 new prison places has been spent so far. If Â£2.5bn is actually spent then underthe Barnett formulaabout an extra Â£300m would need to be allocated to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The plan:It is currently government policy,externalto have full-fibre broadband across the UK by 2033 - Mr Johnson says he will have it done by 2025. What it means:Having full-fibre broadband means getting high-speed optical cables going into buildings so there is no use of copper cables. The telecoms regulatorOfcom said,externalthat in May only 7% of UK properties had full-fibre broadband. Increasing that to 100% in six years would be a big project and there has been no detail so far of how Mr Johnson plans to do it. The cost:Mr Johnson has said that government money would be needed to make this happen but has not specified how much. Commercial operators could be expected to fund this work in densely populated areas where they could expect to get a decent rate of return. But in more remote areas, there may have to be government subsidies. The government's current plan,externalestimates that getting full-fibre broadband to the most remote 10% of properties will require it to spend between Â£3bn and Â£5bn - it is reasonable to assume that doing it in six years instead of 14 years would increase that cost. Figures of about Â£30bn have been cited but it is not clear how much of that would be government money and how much would come from commercial investment. The plan:Level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools in England What it means:Mr Johnson wants to make sure per pupil funding is at least Â£5,000 in secondary schools across the country. He also said he wanted to increase funding in primary schools. And there were hints during the leadership campaign that he would reverse previous cuts to school spending, which would be considerably more expensive. MPs on the education select committee saidthat ""a multi-billion cash injection"" was needed. The cost:Taking per pupil funding to Â£5,000 in secondary schools would be relatively cheap - about Â£50m a year. Reversing previous cuts to spending was estimated during the campaign to cost about Â£4.6bn, although teaching unions have said that schools need an extra Â£12.6bn. The plan:Raise the higher income tax rate from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. What it means:At the moment,individuals have to pay 40% income tax on any earnings above Â£50,000,external. So, a person earning Â£55,000 a year, pays 40% on Â£5,000. Under Mr Johnson's plan - outlined during the leadership campaign but not set out in detail since - the point at which the 40% higher rate kicks in would be raised to Â£80,000. This would not benefit Scottish workers because the Scottish government sets its own income tax rates and bands. Mr Johnson also wants to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance, absorbing some of the cost by also raising the point at which they stop paying NI. National Insurance is a separate tax. It's paid for by workers and companies and is meant to fund state benefits, such as the NHS. Under this new tax regime, someone earning Â£60,000 a year could benefit by Â£1,000 a year, while someone on Â£80,000 or more would gain a maximum of Â£3,000 (because some of the benefits would be lost because of National Insurance increases). What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Laura Kuenssberg: 'Hard part' begins as Johnson wins contest Is there a Brexit war chest? But it's wealthy pensioners who stand to benefit the most - up to Â£6,000 each, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's because pensioners don't pay National Insurance to begin with. So, if someone already receives a generous work pension, not only would they be subject to less income tax (up to the new threshold), they also would not be affected by the changes to National Insurance. The cost:Changing the tax system in this way would cost about Â£10bn a year, according to Mr Johnson. He says the bill could be funded from Â£26.6bn of ""fiscal headroom"". This ""headroom"" refers to government borrowing, which came in lower than originally expected and had been earmarked by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. However, if Mr Johnson chooses to fund his tax changes with this Â£26.6bn, it would not amount to a permanent solution. That's because the money can be spent once only. So, to pay for the policy in the long term, Mr Johnson would need to raise taxes elsewhere, announce spending cuts or continue to fund it from government borrowing. The plan:Mr Johnson has spoken favourably about cutting corporation tax but has not been specific about how much he would like to cut it by. What it means:The corporation tax rate, which is the tax companies pay on their profits, has been cut from 28% in 2010 to the current rate of 19%. It is due to fall again, to 17%, next year. While the other candidate in the leadership election, Jeremy Hunt, wanted to cut the rate further to 12.5%, Mr Johnson was not as specific. The cost:Mr Johnson claimed at a hustings in Darlington that every time corporation tax has been cut in this country, the amount of revenue raised has increased. That is not the case.While there have been occasions since 2010 when corporation tax has been cut and revenue has risen, in the years after the rate was cut in 2008, revenue fell. The government currently estimates that an extra one percentage point cut in corporation tax would cost Â£3.1bn in 2022-23. In the longer term, some of that money would be clawed back in extra investment, wages or consumption.

May bids farewell before Johnson enters No 10,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""You achieve nothing alone and so my final words are of sincere thanks"" Theresa May has delivered a farewell speech in Downing Street before tendering her resignation to the Queen. She wished new Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his government well, adding: ""Their successes will be our country's successes."" Earlier, Mrs May faced MPs' questions for the final time and looked visibly emotional as she left to applause. Mr Johnson will speak outside No 10 too, before announcing several senior cabinet appointments. He is expected to use the opportunity to increase the number of women in full cabinet positions and boost the representation of ethnic minorities. During his journey to Buckingham Palace to accept the Queen's invitation to form a government, Mr Johnson's car was briefly held up by protesters from Greenpeace, who formed a human chain across The Mall. LIVE: Latest updates as Johnson replaces May as PM Boris Johnson's battles What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Bouquets and brickbats: May's final PMQs Mrs May gave her final speech in Downing Street - her husband Philip alongside her - before heading to Buckingham Palace. She said serving as prime minister had been ""the greatest honour"" and thanked all those who had worked with her. ""This is a country of aspiration and opportunity, and I hope that every young girl who has seen a woman prime minister now knows there are no limits to what she can achieve."" Mr May was briefly interrupted by a protester shouting ""Stop Brexit!"" but responded by saying: ""I think the answer to that is - I think not."" Boris Johnson arrived at Buckingham Palace once Theresa May had resigned Climate protesters formed a chain in front of Mr Johnson's car A short time earlier, at her final PMQs, Mrs May said she would continue as a constituency MP and was ""looking forward to asking the questions"" in future. She said she was happy to hand over to a successor committed to delivering Brexit and creating ""a bright future for this country"". A number of MPs took the opportunity to praise her commitment to office and her achievements on issues like modern slavery, mental health and getting more women into politics. May's political career in three minutes... And six charts Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn acknowledged Mrs May's ""respect for public service"", but criticised her record on the economy, homelessness and Brexit. He asked whether she would consider joining him ""in opposing the reckless plans of her successor"". She, in reply, listed what she felt were her successes, including school improvements, more employment and greater home ownership. ""At its heart, politics isn't about exchanges across these despatch boxes, nor about eloquent speeches or media headlines,"" she said. ""It is about the difference we make every day to the lives of people up and down this country."" In a parting shot at Mr Corbyn, she added: ""As a party leader who has accepted when her time was up, perhaps the time is now for him to do the same."" This video can not be played As she left the chamber for the last time as prime minister, Theresa May was cheered by members across the House Former London mayor Mr Johnson won a decisive victory over Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in a ballot of Tory members - gaining a 66.4% total share of the vote. Conversations are said to be ""ongoing"" between Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson about the foreign secretary's next role. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says Mr Johnson's choice of his top team is critical in his efforts to bring the warring factions of his party together. Mr Johnson is resolute that his leadership rival should not stay on at the Foreign Office, but Mr Hunt is firm that he won't accept anything less than his current role - or becoming home secretary, chancellor or deputy prime minister - and considers other moves a demotion. Our political editor says it is a risky decision for the new PM - forcing Mr Hunt out would be a bad move in terms of uniting the party, but giving in to his refusal to budge is a challenge to his authority. This video can not be played Boris Johnson's victory speech Another key decision Mr Johnson faces is who will take over at the Treasury as chancellor. The incumbent,Philip Hammond, handed in his resignation to,externalMrs May, saying the new PM should be free to choose someone ""fully aligned"" with his views on Brexit. Those said to be in the frame to replace him include current Home Secretary Sajid Javid, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Liz Truss, Mr Hammond's deputy at the Treasury. Meanwhile, Dominic Cummings, the former chief of the Vote Leave campaign, is expected to become a senior adviser to the new prime minister. Allow Twitter content?

David Frost, a former ambassador and senior official at the Foreign Office, will be appointed as a key negotiator on Brexit. After his victory, Mr Johnson said his priorities were to deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Former Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his congratulations,externalto the new PM and wished him well for the ""great privilege and responsibility"" to come. Boris Johnson's political inheritance has all the makings of a disaster. He has no Commons majority. There is no mandate from the general public - remember this election has only been decided by Tory members. There are policy problems everywhere in sight, whether that's trying to solve the conundrums of Brexit with a reluctant EU and a divided party, or trying to address deep-seated problems at home. And just as among his fans there is genuine excitement that he will, at last, be in Number 10, there is scepticism and disbelief from the opposition parties, and double-sided concerns in his own party. Read Laura's full analysis here Sweeping changes are expected in the wider cabinet, with a number of other ministers, including Justice Secretary David Gauke and Development Secretary Rory Stewart, having said they cannot serve under Mr Johnson due to his determination to leave the EU, with or without a deal, on 31 October. Those tipped for promotion include Employment Minister Alok Sharma and Local Government Minister Rishi Sunak. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Is belief enough to sustain Johnson as PM? What does a prime minister actually do? A look at Mr Johnson's in-tray First job? Impress the cat Priti Patel could return to the cabinet less than two years after resigning as international development secretary over a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ms Patel said she did not want to ""speculate"" on a potential cabinet role, but added it was ""important that we have a government that reflects modern Britain"". And former Sports Minister Tracey Crouch, who quit last year in a dispute with the Treasury over fixed-odds betting terminals, could also be in line for a recall. A source close to Mr Johnson said: ""Boris will build a cabinet showcasing all the talents within the party that truly reflect modern Britain."" Meanwhile, Tory donor Sir Mick Davis has resigned as chief executive of the Conservative Party, saying the new leader should be able to choose his own team. In a letter, he urged fellow donors to get behind Boris Johnson, adding the new PM ""can only be effective if a strong and unified party stands behind him"". Mr Johnson will inherit a wafer-thin parliamentary majority and, like his predecessor, will continue to rely on the support of the Democratic Unionists of Northern Ireland to govern. Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have said they will oppose him over Brexit, although they have stopped short of threatening an immediate vote of no confidence. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said ""discussions are ongoing"" between Labour and potential Tory rebels to find out who might support such a vote. He told Radio 4's Today programme it was ""the nuclear option"" which should be ""used carefully"". Priti Patel (left) and Liz Truss (right) are among those tipped for new jobs This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""I know Nigel will work well with Boris"" Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said he isopen to an electoral pact with Mr Johnson- if the new Tory leader is genuine about taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Mr Farage said Mr Johnson would need to call an election if he wanted a no-deal Brexit, in order to ""change the arithmetic"" in the Commons. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who is part of Mr Johnson's transition team, said the incoming PM didn't want to see an early election. ""There is no way that we are going to have any kind of electoral pact with the Brexit Party and Nigel Farage,"" he told the Today programme. What the US makes of Boris Johnson US President Donald Trump, speaking to a right-wing youth organisation in Washington DC, said Mr Johnson and Mr Farage would do ""tremendous things"" together. A political strategist and adviser known for his bullish style, Mr Cummings is a long-time Eurosceptic. In 2004, he led the campaign against a North East regional assembly, and in 2007 went to work for Conservative MP Michael Gove, first in opposition and then while he served as education secretary. In 2015, Mr Cummings was appointed campaign director of Vote Leave and became a key architect of its messages, including ""take back control"" and the controversial ""Â£350m-a-week for the NHS"" pledge. Since the referendum, Mr Cummings has often been outspoken on the Brexit process, describing it in 2018 as having been ""irretrievably botched"" by the May government. Laura Kuenssberg said some Brexiteers would be pleased with his appointment, seeing it as a strong sign of Mr Johnson's commitment to a 31 October exit. However, she said there was a lot of very angry water under the bridge between him and Tory MPs on the ERG wing because he refused to allow many of them to be involved in Vote Leave. Earlier this year,Mr Cummings was found in contempt of Parliamentfor refusing to give evidence to a committee of MPs investigating ""fake news"". In return, he accused the committee of ""spreading errors and lies"".

And what's his track record?,"Boris Johnson, the UK's new prime minister, was already one of the UK's most recognisable politicians. His high profile - built up as an MP, London mayor and foreign secretary - has often seen his achievements accompanied by controversy. As editor of the Spectator magazine and a Have I Got News For You contestant, Boris Johnson was already well known for his shambolic persona. In 2001, he became an MP,replacing Michael Heseltine,externalin the safe Conservative seat of Henley-on-Thames. Gay rights He was considered more liberal than many Tories. As a journalist, he hadquestioned the repeal of laws banning the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities,external. But as an MP, he changed tack and said the state should not interfere in people's lives. He also voted in favour of civil partnerships. Boris Johnson during one of his Have I Got News For You appearances, in 2004 Mr Johnson continued to attract controversy. In October 2004, then Conservative leader Michael Howardordered him to visit Liverpool to apologise,externalfor a Spectator article accusing its residents of wallowing in ""disproportionate"" grief after Ken Bigley - an engineer from the city - was kidnapped and killed in Iraq. And the following month, he was sacked as shadow arts minister, amid claims he hadmisled Mr Howard about reports of an affair with Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt.,external Political career 7 yearsMP for Henley (2001-2008) 8 yearsMayor of London (2008-2016) 4 yearsMP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (2015- 2 yearsForeign Secretary (2016-2018) Nevertheless, a year later, he was on the rise again - resigning from his Spectator post when new Tory leaderDavid Cameron made him shadow higher education minister,external. However, he continued to write for the Telegraph and had to make another apology - to a whole country - after helinked Papua New Guinea to ""cannibalism and chief-killing"",externalin a column. By 2007, the Henley MP had his sights set on one of the biggest jobs in UK politics. Taking over from Labour's Ken Livingstone in 2008, Boris Johnson remained London mayor until 2016. It is the longest continuous period of public office that he has held. He's often spoken of what he considers to be his biggest achievements during that period: on crime, housing and transport.

Crime The homicide rate in London - which includes murder and manslaughter - fell from 22 per million to 12 per million people during his time as mayor. However, it was also falling during his predecessor's second term. And in the first few years after Mr Johnson took over, knife crime rose by over 15% - although from 2012-13 onwards it started to fall. Mr Johnson had backed the police use of stop-and-search powers to tackle violent crime. And he said he would ensure police numbers would go up despite central government cuts. Home Office figures show police numbers in London rose slightly, from 31,460 to 32,125, between March 2008 and March 2016. Across England and Wales in that period the number of officers fell by 17,603. Housing There was an increase in the number of affordable homes built - 101,525 by the end of March 2016, of which the Greater London Authority contributed to 94,001. This was a rise compared with the two terms of Mr Livingstone, although the definition of affordable housing had changed in 2011 so the figures are not directly comparable. Transport He scrapped the so-called bendy buses- which he said were too big for narrow streets and encouraged fare-dodgers. In their place, he introduced a new version of the popular Routemaster London bus - a move that was criticised as a vanity project. There were complaints about non-opening windows and problems with the hybrid engines. They also cost considerably more than a normal bus. Do Boris Johnson's claims about his record as mayor of London add up? The transport legacy of Boris Johnson in London One of his most famous transport initiatives was the so-called ""Boris Bike"" cycle scheme, introduced in July 2010. Mr Johnson regularly promoted the hire bikes by riding them himself and the number of rentals reached more than 10.3 million during his last year as mayor. However, critics pointed to the Â£11m-a-year cost of keeping the bikes on the road. Others pointed out that plans for a bike hire scheme had been announced while Mr Livingstone had been mayor. Olympics As mayor, Mr Johnson became involved in overseeing arrangements for the 2012 Olympics, planning for which started after they were awarded to London in 2005. One of the most memorable moments was when he got stuck on a zip wire, while celebrating the UK's first gold medal win. The Olympics were widely seen as a success and there were claimsthat they had provided a major economic boost. But there were also questions raised about the Olympics' legacy, including criticism of the conversion of the Olympic Stadium into a football ground. In 2017, an independent review saidthe conversion had cost Â£323m - far more than the original estimate of Â£190m. Garden Bridge The latter part of his time as mayor sawa plan to build a garden bridge over the River Thamesas a memorial to Princess Diana. The pedestrian-only bridge, with trees and plants, which was first suggested by the actress Joanna Lumley in 1998, was to be funded by private and public money. But it was cancelled in 2017, after a review recommended the project be scrapped - Â£53m had already been spent on the project; Â£43m of which came from the public purse. Appointed foreign secretary in 2018 - after Boris Johnson's resignation Was health secretary for a record six years Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? Mr Johnson decided he wanted to return to Parliament before his term as mayor ended, in 2016. He won the seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in 2015. After resuming life as an MP, he declared his opposition to expanding nearby Heathrow airport, saying he would lie in front of the bulldozers. As London mayor, he had promoted an alternative scheme, for an island airport in the Thames estuary,an idea rejected on cost and environmental grounds. But Mr Johnson was noticeably absent when MPs subsequently voted on Heathrow expansion in June 2018, as he was on an official trip to Afghanistan. Mr Johnson had been appointed foreign secretary by the new prime minister, Theresa May, in 2016. He had also run in the Tory leadership campaign that yearbut dramatically pulled outafter Michael Gove's surprise decision to enter the race. The job as foreign secretary was seen as an acknowledgement of his role as a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU. However, there was also some surprise at the choice, with Lib Dem leader Tim Farron saying he would""spend more time apologising to nations he's offended""than working as foreign secretary. And there were the disparaging comments about other countries and their leaders - some of which were made before he got the job. They included a Limerick - which won a Â£1,000 award in 2016 - about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a goat. And he said the Libyan city of Sirte could be the new Dubai if""they... clear the dead bodies away"". Russian expulsions As foreign secretary, Mr Johnson supported a tough line against Russia,with the expulsion of its diplomats after the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal. Twenty-nine countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and EU states, joined the UK, expelling more than 140 Russian diplomats in a co-ordinated move. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran since 2016 Iran But in the case of British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, jailed in Iran, Mr Johnson had to apologise in Parliament. He had said she had been teaching journalists in Iran when she had been detained, contradicting her statement that she had been on holiday at the time. He later clarified that she had in fact been on holiday but has also said he does not believe his remarks made a difference to her plight - a claim rejected by her family. A few days after Mr Johnson made his remarks, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned before an Iranian judge, to face charges of engaging in propaganda against the regime. How Boris Johnson insulted the world Boris Johnson's most controversial foreign insults Saudi Arabia As foreign secretary,he also earned a rebuke from Downing Street, after comments emerged in which he had criticised close ally Saudi Arabia for engaging in proxy wars in the Middle East. Nevertheless, he continued to allow sales of UK arms to Saudi Arabia, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. In 2018, Mr Johnson also faced criticism after writing in the Daily Telegraph thatMuslim women wearing the burka ""looked like letterboxes"". By this stage, though, he had left the government, resigning in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plan. Boris Johnson was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum. He became well known for his attacks on the EU and for advocating the benefits of Brexit. He declared that he was ""pro-having cake and pro-eating it"". But it hadn't always been clear which side he would support. In fact, while mayor of London, he'd spoken of the benefits of being in the single market. And in an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2013,external, weighing up the pros and cons of being in the EU, he had said that leaving would not solve the UK's problems. However, he also made clear he supported plans to ask the British people to decide about EU membership. During the Brexit campaign, he came undersustained criticism from those in favour of Remain, for his claims about the benefits of leaving and what he called ""taking back control"". Â£350m claim Most controversial was a claim about how much money the UK sent to the EU. The Â£350m-a-week figure, which appeared on the side of a bus during the campaign,recently led to an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute him.Critics pointed out at the time that the figure was wrong as it did not take into account the UK's rebate, or indeed money subsequently spent in the UK. For his part, Mr Johnson dismissed warnings that leaving the EU could spark a recession,describing one such study as propaganda. And he has continued to advocate a harder form of Brexit, sharply criticising both the deal that Mrs May agreed and her whole approach to the negotiations with the EU. He described it asleading the UK into the ""status of a colony"", in his resignation letter, in July 2018. Mr Johnson has continued to insist that the UK can and should leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal.

Boris Johnson's first PM speech in full,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson's first speech as prime minister in full Boris Johnson has delivered his first speech in Downing Street after becoming the UK's new prime minister. You can read the full text of his speech below. Good afternoon. I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen who has invited me to form a government and I have accepted. I pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor and her deep sense of public service. But in spite of all her efforts, it has become clear that there are pessimists at home and abroad who think that after three years of indecision, that this country has become a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016 and that in this home of democracy we are incapable of honouring a basic democratic mandate. And so I am standing before you today to tell you, the British people, that those critics are wrong. The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters - they are going to get it wrong again. The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts, because we are going to restore trust in our democracy and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of Parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31, no ifs or buts. And we will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit while allowing us to develop a new and exciting partnership with the rest of Europe, based on free trade and mutual support. I have every confidence that in 99 days' time we will have cracked it. But you know what - we aren't going to wait 99 days, because the British people have had enough of waiting. The time has come to act, to take decisions, to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better. And though the Queen has just honoured me with this extraordinary office of state my job is to serve you, the people. Because if there is one point we politicians need to remember, it is that the people are our bosses. My job is to make your streets safer - and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets and we start recruiting forthwith. My job is to make sure you don't have to wait 3 weeks to see your GP - and we start work this week, with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the front line. My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care. And so I am announcing now - on the steps of Downing Street - that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve. My job is to make sure your kids get a superb education, wherever they are in the country - and that's why we have already announced that we are going to level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools. And that is the work that begins immediately behind that black door. And though I am today building a great team of men and women, I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see. Never mind the backstop - the buck stops here. And I will tell you something else about my job. It is to be prime minister of the whole United Kingdom. And that means uniting our country, answering at last the plea of the forgotten people and the left-behind towns by physically and literally renewing the ties that bind us together. So that with safer streets and better education and fantastic new road and rail infrastructure and full fibre broadband we level up across Britain with higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity. We close the opportunity gap, giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes and giving business the confidence to invest across the UK. Because it is time we unleashed the productive power not just of London and the South East, but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red, white, and blue flag - who together are so much more than the sum of their parts, and whose brand and political personality is admired and even loved around the world. For our inventiveness, for our humour, for our universities, our scientists, our armed forces, our diplomacy for the equalities on which we insist - whether race or gender or LGBT or the right of every girl in the world to 12 years of quality education - and for the values we stand for around the world Everyone knows the values that flag represents. It stands for freedom and free speech and habeas corpus and the rule of law, and above all it stands for democracy. And that is why we will come out of the EU on October 31. Because in the end, Brexit was a fundamental decision by the British people that they wanted their laws made by people that they can elect and they can remove from office. And we must now respect that decision, and create a new partnership with our European friends -  as warm and as close and as affectionate as possible. And the first step is to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU nationals now living and working among us, and I say directly to you - thank you for your contribution to our society. Thank you for your patience, and I can assure you that under this government you will get the absolute certainty of the rights to live and remain. And next I say to our friends in Ireland, and in Brussels and around the EU: I am convinced that we can do a deal without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks and yet without that anti-democratic backstop. And it is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate, and we are forced to come out with no deal, not because we want that outcome - of course not - but because it is only common sense to prepare. And let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted, and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready at some point in the near future to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control, fully determined at last to take advantage of Brexit. Because that is the course on which this country is now set. With high hearts and growing confidence, we will now accelerate the work of getting ready. And the ports will be ready and the banks will be ready, and the factories will be ready, and business will be ready, and the hospitals will be ready, and our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more, not just here but around the world. And don't forget that in the event of a no deal outcome, we will have the extra lubrication of the Â£39 billion, and whatever deal we do we will prepare this autumn for an economic package to boost British business and to lengthen this country's lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment. And to all those who continue to prophesy disaster, I say yes - there will be difficulties, though I believe that with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed. But if there is one thing that has really sapped the confidence of business over the last three years, it is not the decisions we have taken - it is our refusal to take decisions. And to all those who say we cannot be ready, I say do not underestimate this country. Do not underestimate our powers of organisation and our determination, because we know the enormous strengths of this economy in life sciences, in tech, in academia, in music, the arts, culture, financial services. It is here in Britain that we are using gene therapy, for the first time, to treat the most common form of blindness. Here in Britain that we are leading the world in the battery technology that will help cut CO2 and tackle climate change and produce green jobs for the next generation. And as we prepare for a post-Brexit future, it is time we looked not at the risks but at the opportunities that are upon us. So let us begin work now to create free ports that will drive growth and thousands of high-skilled jobs in left-behind areas. Let's start now to liberate the UK's extraordinary bioscience sector from anti-genetic modification rules, and let's develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world. Let's get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems - UK assets orbiting in space, with all the long term strategic and commercial benefits for this country. Let's change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research. And let's promote the welfare of animals that has always been so close to the hearts of the British people. And yes, let's start now on those free trade deals - because it is free trade that has done more than anything else to lift billions out of poverty. All this and more we can do now and only now, at this extraordinary moment in our history. And after three years of unfounded self-doubt, it is time to change the record. To recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain, generous in temper and engaged with the world. No one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country. They will not succeed today. We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves, and that work begins now. Thank you very much. Watch Johnson's first speech as PM in full.

Boris Johnson becomes UK's new prime minister,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson's first speech as UK PM: ""Never mind the backstop, the buck stops here"" Boris Johnson has given key cabinet roles to leading Brexiteers after becoming the UK's new prime minister. Dominic Raab and Priti Patel return to government as foreign secretary and home secretary respectively. Sajid Javid has been named as the new chancellor as more than half of Theresa May's old cabinet, including leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, quit or were sacked. Earlier, Mr Johnson said the Brexit ""doomsters and gloomsters"" were wrong and the UK would leave on 31 October. Speaking outside No 10, he said the UK would meet that deadline ""no ifs, no buts"", adding: ""The buck stops with me."" Who is in Boris Johnson's cabinet? Mr Johnson then turned his attention to a radical overhaul of the government, with 17 of Mrs May's former senior ministers being axed or stepping down. Announcing his departure, Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said he had been offered an alternative role but had turned it down. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, a leading Brexiteer who is popular across the party, was the most surprising departure. She has been replaced by Ben Wallace, a former soldier and longstanding ally of Mr Johnson's. Another prominent Brexiteer, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, was also ousted, along with Business Secretary Greg Clark - a vocal opponent of a no-deal Brexit. All three supported Mr Hunt in the Tory leadership contest. Sajid Javid is moving from the Home Office to the Treasury Education Secretary Damian Hinds,Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley,Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes, Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire have also gone, along with Chris Grayling, whose record as Transport Secretary was much criticised. Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who has left his position after four years,joked whether there would be ""room"" on the backbenches after all the dismissals. Allow Twitter content?

This comes on top of the earlier resignations of four leading ministers, including Chancellor Philip Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Cabinet Office minister David Lidington. Conservative MP Nigel Evans described the changes as a ""summer's day massacre"". Do Boris Johnson's tax and spend plans add up? And what is his Brexit plan? The BBC's chief political correspondent Vicki Young said the sackings suggested Mr Johnson wasn't looking to build bridges across the party. Instead, she said, he was focused above all else on assembling the team he thought would bring about the results he needed, even if that was controversial. As the upheaval in government was happening, hundreds of people gathered outside the gates of Downing Street in protest against Mr Johnson's appointment. Downing Street was locked down as anti-Boris Johnson protesters gathered on Whitehall Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid - a banker before entering politics - has been given the key role of chancellor, having thrown his weight behind Boris Johnson after being eliminated from the leadership race himself. Priti Patel - whoquit as international development secretary in 2017after holding unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials - succeeds Mr Javid at the Home Office, where she said she would focus on keeping the UK country safe and fighting ""the scourge of crime"". Dominic Raab is a former Brexit secretary, but quit over Mrs May's handling of the process. He said he was ""hugely humbled"" by his appointment and said the UK needed to ""bring finality"" to Brexit so it could focus on the other big challenges. Other figures involved in the Vote Leave referendum campaign have also been rewarded. Michael Gove leaves behind his environment brief to become Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a more senior ministerial role but one without a specific portfolio. Meanwhile, Jacob Rees-Mogg becomes leader of the House of Commons - his first government role. This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg learns of new role from the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Priti Patel was forced to quit her previous cabinet post in 2017, but is back in a key post Ben Wallace is the new defence secretary Liz Truss moves from second in command at the Treasury to head the Department for International trade while Steve Barclay has been re-appointed as Brexit Secretary. Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd are among the few ministers who backed Remain who have kept their jobs. Ms Rudd also takes on the women and equalities brief. Meanwhile, there is a speedy return to office for Gavin Williamson as education secretary. He was sacked as defence secretary less than three months agoafter No 10 concluded he was responsible for the leaking of unauthorised information from a National Security Council meeting - which he denied. Mr Johnson's team has promised a record number of women in the cabinet. Nicky Morgan, Theresa Villiers and Andrea Leadsom have all returned to top jobs, taking on the culture, environment and business briefs respectively. There are also promotions for Robert Buckland (justice) and Alok Sharma (international development) while former party chairman Grant Shapps, a key member of Boris Johnson's leadership campaign team, makes a comeback at transport. Former Chief Whip Julian Smith is the new Northern Ireland Secretary, while Dumfries and Galloway MP Alister Jack, who was only elected to Parliament last year, is expected to become Scottish Secretary. Alun Cairns remains as Welsh Secretary. Earlier, in a 13-minute speech outside Downing Street, Mr Johnson listed a wide range of domestic ambitions, chiefly a promise to sort out care for the elderly ""once and for all"". Reforms to the social care sector have eluded previous governments because of their cost and complexity. ""We will fix it once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve,"" he insisted. Boris Johnson's battles Bouquets and brickbats: May's final PMQs A solemn start in No 10 Mr Johnson also pledged to improve infrastructure, recruit 20,000 new police officers and ""level up"" school spending. He promised reforms to ensure the Â£20bn in extra funding earmarked for the NHS ""really gets to the front line"". And he pledged to boost the UK's biotech and space science sectors, change the tax rules to provide incentives for investment, and do more to promote the welfare of animals. Carrie Symonds, Mr Johnson's partner, was among those greeting him at Downing Street Setting out his priorities for office, the former London mayor hit out at the ""pessimists"" who did not believe Brexit could be delivered and called for an end to three years of indecision. ""The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts because we are going to restore trust in our democracy,"" he said. ""The time has come to act, to take decisions and change this country for the better."" He said he had ""every confidence"" the UK would leave the EU in 99 days time with a deal, but preparations for the ""remote possibility"" of a no-deal Brexit would be accelerated. Mr Johnson vowed to bring all four nations of the United Kingdom - or what he described as the ""awesome foursome"" - together in the task of strengthening a post-Brexit country. ""Though I am today building a great team of men and women, I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see,"" he concluded. ""Never mind the backstop, the buck stops here."" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's speech was ""all rhetoric"". New Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said she would welcome a cross-party push to find a solution on social care, but attacked Mr Johnson's ""bluster and bravado"" over Brexit. Climate protesters blocked Mr Johnson's route to the palace Officials welcomed the new prime minister to Downing Street Mr Johnson took over after Theresa May handed in her resignation to the Queen. Earlier, as she relinquished power after three years,Mrs May said being prime minister had been ""the greatest honour""and wished her successor well. During his journey to Buckingham Palace, Mr Johnson's car was briefly held up by protesters from Greenpeace, who formed a human chain across The Mall.

Who is Dominic Cummings?,"Pictures of Mr Cummings leaving No 10 dominated newspaper front pages Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year. But the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times. Rarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister. His critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10. Mr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. Cummings: I discussed ousting PM after 2019 election PM resisted lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Agree with him or not, Cummings's words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings He left his Downing Street rolefollowing an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare. In his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a Â£40,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. There was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, theUK's new ""high risk"" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects. But he appears to have a different career path in mind. In February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm,according to Companies House,external, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. But in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government. The BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg. And he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal. But he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter. He plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but ""more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc"" will only be available to subscribers who pay Â£10 a month. He is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that ""slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project"". This new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. But he adds: ""It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments. ""Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation. ""Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules."" There are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however. Little was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April. After being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April. As well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make aseries of accusations against the PMand questioned his ""competence and integrity"". The following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson ""unfit for the job"", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns. He also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying. This sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations. It thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time sincehis now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year. This video can not be played Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham While staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London. This revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out ""Do I feel OK driving?"" He also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London. Asked why he had given a story that was ""not the 100% truth"" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that ""the way we handled the whole thing was wrong"". This video can not be played Cummings says he drove to Barnard Castle to test vision Boris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis. Cummings accuses government of Covid secrecy Kuenssberg: What led to Cummings' departure? Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Some said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election. This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends his senior adviser Dominic Cummings in May 2020 But it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project. The two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. The combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. Mr Cummings was credited with formulating the ""take back control"" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history. Yet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way. It proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a ""Get Brexit Done"" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. Many of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them. ""Levelling up"" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system. The team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched ""elite"". Lee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did. Mr Cummings watches the PM in action at a coronavirus briefing There had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style. There were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state. None of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers. Mr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order. But he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs. A longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates. He grabbed headlines when heposted an advert on his personal blogfor ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked ""deep expertise"" in many policy areas. Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law during referendum Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' Review: Brexit - The Uncivil War starring Benedict Cumberbatch The Vote Leave bus was one of its most notable campaign tactics Mr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. He is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat isChillingam Castle,external, in Northumberland. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East. In what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public. He is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world. Mr Cummings facing questions from the media outside his home He re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. The pair would rail against what they called ""the blob"" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. He left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party. He once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as ""thick as mince"" and as ""lazy as a toad"" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a ""career psychopath"". Benedict Cumberbatch was widely praised for his portrayal of Dominic Cummings in Brexit: The Uncivil War His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy. Vote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. Like most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides.

Who's in the new cabinet?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has carried out a reshuffle of ministers in cabinet positions, two months after winning the general election. There was speculation ahead of the reshuffle about how diverse the new Cabinet would be, particularly considering women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Who's in what job? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places. Boris Johnson's election win in December secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987. While his election campaign promised to ""get Brexit done"", Mr Johnson has said his ""one nation government"" will also ""massively increase investment in the NHS"". Mr Johnson succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in July, having served as foreign secretary since 2016 in what was only his first cabinet post. His views on how to deliver Brexit brought him into conflict with Mrs May, and led to his resignation in 2018. Rishi Sunak replaces Sajid Javid, who resigned as Chancellor during the reshuffle on Thursday. Appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July, Rishi Sunakâs status as a rising star was highlighted when he was sent to stand in for Boris Johnson at the BBCâs seven-party election debate. He was previously a successful businessman, co-founding a large investment firm. Mr Sunak is married to Akshata Murthy daughter of an Indian billionaire. The couple lived in California for a number of years before coming back to the UK. They now have two daughters. Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in Boris Johnsonâs first cabinet and has kept her position since then. A prominent Brexiteer, Ms Patel had previously argued that Mr Johnson was the only person who could save Brexit and the Tories. She had previously served as Theresa May's international development secretary, until she was forced to quit following a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. She was first elected to the seat of Witham, Essex, in 2010, after working for several years in PR for the Conservative Party, as well as lobbying for tobacco and alcohol industries. Dominic Raab was appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state in Boris Johnson's first cabinet in July and remains in post. A staunch Brexiteer, Mr Raab served as a justice minister in 2015, but was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister the following year. He made a return as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after the resignation of David Davis, but quit only months later in opposition to Mrs Mayâs Brexit deal. Mr Raab started his career as an international lawyer, before joining the Foreign Office as a diplomat. He is married with two sons. Michael Gove is the cabinet minister with the most experience - but his aspirations for the top job are well known. He lost out to Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership campaign in summer 2019. Mr Gove became environment secretary in June 2017 and proved a key advocate of Theresa Mayâs Brexit deal, while other Brexiteer cabinet ministers resigned. In 2016, he famously scuppered the leadership hopes of his friend Boris Johnson, by announcing his own candidature on the morning of Johnson's own campaign launch. Mr Gove was a key ally of former Prime Minister David Cameron and has served as MP for Surrey Heath since 2005. He made his name as a radical education secretary, bringing in major changes to exams and the curriculum and battling teaching unions during his four years in the role. Appointed defence secretary by Boris Johnson last July, Ben Wallace previously served as security minister. Mr Wallace backed Remain in 2016 and has warned that leaving the EU without a deal would hit UK-EU security ties and have a ""real impact"" on protecting the public. After training at Sandhurst, Mr Wallace joined the Scots Guards as a platoon commander. He spent eight years in the Army, serving in Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and Central America. He was a member of the Scottish Parliament, before winning his seat of Lancaster and Wyre in 2005. Liz Truss was made international trade secretary and also women and equalities minister when Boris Johnson took office and remains in that role. She was previously in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as the first female lord chancellor between 2016 and 2017. She served as environment secretary in David Cameron's government from 2014-16. Ms Truss was elected to Parliament in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. In a widely-publicised speech in June 2018, she attacked cabinet colleagues for demanding more money, saying it would only lead to higher taxation. Mr Hancock remains in post as health secretary. At 40, he was youngest contender in the Tory leadership race in the summer of 2019. He quit the contest a day after he came sixth in the first ballot and later endorsed Boris Johnson. The ambitious MP for West Suffolk was promoted to health secretary in 2018 after only a few months as culture secretary. He campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum but backed both Theresa May's and Mr Johnson's Brexit deal. The former Bank of England economist likes to see himself as one of the most technology-savvy politicians at Westminster - he was the first MP to have his own smartphone app. Gavin Williamson made a swift return to the cabinet last July following his sacking by Theresa May two months earlier after row over the leaking of information from the National Security Council. Mr Williamson is influential within the Tory party, having served as a ministerial aide to David Cameron and then as chief whip, in charge of party discipline. At that time, he famously kept a tarantula named Cronus on his desk in the House of Commons. Mr Williamson, who backed remain in the EU referendum, also helped to run Boris Johnsonâs campaign in the first phase of the Tory leadership contest last summer. The 41-year old MP for Hertsmere is a rising star in the Conservative ranks and replaces Nicky Morgan as Culture Secretary. Since last summer, he has been a minister in the Cabinet Office â playing a key role working with No 10 in implementing government policy. Before becoming an MP, the Cambridge-educated law graduate worked in public relations and cut his teeth in the Conservative Research Department. He then worked as an adviser to David Cameron, becoming his deputy chief of staff in Downing Street. He subsequently received a CBE for his services. In his maiden speech, he told the House of Commons he could make a legitimate claim to be the MP for TV soap Eastendersâ Albert Square, as it was filmed in his constituency. During his five years in the Commons, he has campaigned on greater legal protection for the Green Belt, more money for education and simplification of the tax system. The former International Development Secretary replaces Andrea Leadsom. The MP for Reading West backed Boris Johnson for prime minister and joined the cabinet in July 2019. Mr Sharma will also be the minister responsible for the Glasgow COP26 climate summit in November. Prior to being elected in 2010, he qualified as a chartered accountant and worked in banking. He is married with two daughters. Former Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick represented the Conservatives on the under 30s Question Time debate during the general election campaign. In the summer he joined other rising stars Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden in saying Boris Johnson was the only one who could save the Tory party from an ""existential threat"". He drew criticism in 2017 when, as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on international trade, he attended US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Mr Jenrick was elected as MP for Newark in a by-election in June 2014 after Patrick Mercer resigned in disgrace, and won the seat with an increased majority at the general election of 2015. He voted Remain in the EU referendum. Former environment minister Therese Coffey was appointed after Amber Rudd resigned over the government's approach to Brexit. Ms Coffey has previously served in a number of roles including Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. She backed Remain in the 2016 referendum and later voted in favour of Theresa May's Brexit deal. However, she has since spoken about the need to honour the referendum result and supported Boris Johnson's Tory leadership bid. The former solicitor general moved to be prisons minister in the justice department in May 2019. He supported Boris Johnson for the leadership describing him as a ""moderate, open-minded, one-nation Conservative"". Mr Buckland campaigned to remain in the EU, but has said it is important to deliver on the result of the referendum. He has, however, previously spoken out against a no-deal Brexit and of the need for compromise. He was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority, and has subsequently held the seat with an increased share of the vote. He had previously practised as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and planning. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed replaces Alok Sharma as International Development Secretary. Ms Trevelyan was promoted to a role as Armed Forces minister shortly after the Conservativesâ 2019 election victory. An outspoken Brexiteer, she resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in November 2018 in protest at the Brexit withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May. The former chartered accountant has also served on the Public Accounts Committee, responsible for scrutinising government spending. The former international development minister Grant Shapps became transport secretary in July 2019. He was once seen as a high-flyer in the Tory party until he resigned following allegations he ignored warnings about bullying when he was party co-chairman. A former remainer, he has since said he is backing Brexit ""as hard as you like"". He was born in Watford and educated at a local grammar school, before going on to Manchester Polytechnic to study business and finance. He later set up his own successful printing business. Mr Shapps, a father-of-three, was elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire in 2005. George Eustice replaces Theresa Villiers as environment secretary. Mr Eustice previously held ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May, but resigned in 2019 in protest the latter's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal failed to pass the House of Commons. He has represented the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth since 2010. Brandon Lewis replaces Julian Smith as Northern Ireland Secretary. The former Conservative Party chairman rejoined cabinet under Boris Johnson as home office minister in July 2019. Previous positions include minister without portfolio, minister for housing and and minister for immigration. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood Borough Council, Essex, Mr Lewis has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010. Businessman Alister Jack was elected MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017 and has supported what he calls ""a successful Brexit for Scotland"". He founded tent-hire and self-storage companies and is also a dairy farmer. His constituency includes the busiest ferry-port serving Northern Ireland. He was appointed assistant government whip in February 2019. Simon Hart was appointed as Welsh secretary to replace Alun Cairns last November. Mr Cairns resigned at the start of the general election campaign amid a row over what he knew about an aide's role in the collapse of a rape trial. The job was a promotion for Mr Hart, who has represented Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire since 2010. He previously served as a junior minister in the Cabinet Office. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016, her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University, where she studied social and political sciences. She went on to become deputy director of the Conservative research department. She was previously deputy director of the centre-right Policy Exchange think-tank. She was also director of the New Schools Network, the organisation set up by Rachel Wolf, which runs the free schools programme. Amanda Milling replaces James Cleverly as Conservative Party chairman and will attend Cabinet as minister without portfolio. She was previously deputy chief whip, and was elected to Parliament as member for Cannock Chase in 2015. Amanda Milling is known as a key ally of Boris Johnson and worked on his leadership campaign. Jacob Rees Mogg is one of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers and a key member of party's European Research Group (ERG). He was a constant critic of former Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit, and has long argued that the UK would be best to leave the EU with no deal. Before being elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010, Mr Rees-Mogg worked in finance, originally based in Hong Kong and later moving back to London. He set up his own investment management company in 2007. Mr Rees-Mogg, a Catholic, is married with six children. He is against abortion and gay marriage, but it is his position on Brexit, as well as his old-fashioned dress and courteous manner, which have brought him mainstream attention. During the election campaign, he was criticised for saying it would have been ""common sense"" to flee the Grenfell Tower fire, ignoring fire brigade advice. Boris Johnson's chief enforcer, in theory, has an easier job now the party has a large majority. But Mr Spencer is no stranger to the role, having served in the whips' office since 2016. He has also been given the role of parliamentary secretary to the Treasury. From farming family, Mr Spencer did not attend Oxbridge, unlike many of his colleagues. He attended Shuttleworth Agricultural College before joining the family farming business. He started his political career as a local councillor and won the Sherwood seat from Labour in the 2010 general election. Suella Braverman replaces Geoffrey Cox as attorney general. A strong Brexit supporter, Ms Braverman chaired the European Research Group from June 2017 to January 2018 and became a minister at the Department for Leaving the EU under Theresa May. She resigned in November 2018 in protest at Mrs May's draft EU withdrawal deal Suella Braverman has served as MP for Fareham since 2015. Stephen Barclay will attend Cabinet in a new role as chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Barclay previously served as Brexit secretary under Theresa May and Boris Johnson - a position which became defunct at 11.01pm on 31 January as the UK left the EU. He was elected MP for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010. Note:BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) is a term widely used in the UK to describe people of non-white descent, as defined by the Institute of Race Relations. This is the second reshuffle for Mr Johnson, who became prime minister last July after winning a Conservative leadership election. Big names to have left cabinet on Thursday includedChancellor Sajid Javid, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. The make-up of the cabinet has also changed. The proportion of women in it has increased - but the actual number has fallen from eight to seven because some positions were closed. Members of the cabinet are more than 10 times more likely to have gone to a private school than members of the public. Under Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, 70% of cabinet had not been privately educated, whereas almost 70% of Mr Johnson's new cabinet have. According to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Gordon Brown.  Half of Mr Johnson's cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge universities. This compares with 27% of all Conservative MPs and 18% of Labour MPs. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said December's election led to a seismic shift in the political landscape and Conservative MPs now represent a more diverse range of constituencies than before. ""Yet in terms of educational background, the make-up of Johnson's cabinet is still over 60% from independent schools,"" he said. ""Today's findings underline how unevenly spread the opportunities are to enter the elites and this is something Boris Johnson must address."" Michael Gove is by far the most experienced of Mr Johnson's new top team. The ministers who have had 204 days of cabinet experience are new faces appointed by the PM when he took power in July last year. Click here,externalif you cannot see the Cabinet Guide.

Facebook to pay $5bn to settle privacy concerns,"Facebook will pay a record $5bn fine to settle privacy concerns, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has said. The social network must also establish an independent privacy committee that Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will not have control over. The FTC had been probing allegations political consultancy Cambridge Analyticaimproperly obtained the data of up to 87 million Facebook users. The probe then widened to include other issues such as facial recognition. The $5bn fine is believed to be the biggest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers' privacy. ""Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers' choices,"" said FTC chairman Joe Simons. Will the US break up the tech giants? Technology giants' power to be probed in US He added that the heavy fine was designed ""to change Facebook's entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations"". Facebook's financial results reported on Wednesday did not reflect any move by customers to shun the network over privacy concerns. It said monthly active users had risen 8% in the second quarter. Revenues, mainly advertising sales, rose by 28%, beating analysts' forecasts. What did Facebook do wrong? The FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection began investigating Facebook in March 2018 after it was revealed that personal data was illegally harvested from an online personality quiz and sold to Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm. There were subsequent claims the data may have been used to try and influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. Although only 270,000 people took the quiz, whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleges that the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. But Cambridge Analytica was not the only firm to have access to users' personal data - the data was gathered using Facebook's infrastructure at that time, and many other developers had taken advantage of it without authorisation. Facebook was fined Â£500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdogfor its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal in October. Confirming previous reports, the FTC found that certain Facebook policies violated rules against deceptive practices. For instance, it said Facebook's data policy was deceptive to people who used its facial recognition tool. The social network also fell foul of the regulator by not revealing that phone numbers collected for two-factor authentication would be used for advertising. FTC representatives from both the Democrat and Republican parties voted the settlement deal through, although some dissented, arguing it did not go far enough. Democrat Rohit Chopra tweeted the fine would not stop Facebook from ""engaging in surveillance"" and that Mark Zuckerberg and other executives had got ""blanket immunity for their role in the violations"".

Facebook has deep pockets - the firm's annual revenue last year was $55bn. However, the FTC's fine will still irritate the tech giant. In a press release, the company acknowledged unequivocally that its involvement in the Cambridge Analytica scandal was ""a breach of trust"" with its users. The regulatory action will be taken by some as a general sign that mishandling user data can incur real consequences from US authorities. For years, apps and websites have casually harvested personal information for murky ends. While this will undoubtedly continue in many quarters, with every crackdown, such activity only becomes more contentious. But there are those who think the FTC could have gone further. And one, Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer,thinks the settlement actually benefits the company,external. By restricting the flow of data, Facebook may get to effectively hoard its 2.4 billion users, he argues, rather than allow them to access third party apps or competing social networks. Former Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix In May 2018,Cambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy in the US, blaming a ""siege of media coverage"" for driving away customers and forcing its closure. As part of a separate settlement with the FTC, two of the defendants - former Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix and app developer Aleksandr Kogan - have agreed to administrative orders restricting how they conduct any business in the future. The pair are also required to delete or destroy any personal information they collected. The FTC alsolaunched a lawsuit,externalagainst the bankrupt company, which is yet to settle the agency's allegations. In a post on Facebook,external, Mr Zuckerberg said the firm had ""a responsibility to protect people's privacy"" and would be changing how its products were developed and how the company is run. He said that Facebook was reviewing its technical systems to identify possible privacy risks, and going forward, whenever the social network built a new product that used data, or a feature changed the way it used data, possible privacy risks would need to be addressed. ""Overall, these changes go beyond anything required under US law today,"" he said. ""We expect it will take hundreds of engineers and more than a thousand people across our company to do this important work. And we expect it will take longer to build new products following this process going forward,"" he added. At the same time that the FTC made its announcement, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges against Facebook for making misleading disclosures regarding its handling of user data. As a result, Facebook has agreed to pay $100m to settle the claims. The SEC found that although Facebook discovered the misuse of its users' information in 2015, it did not clarify this for two years, instead telling investors that user data ""may"" have been improperly accessed. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) is alsoinvestigating leading online platformsto see whether they are unfairly restricting competition. The DoJ did not name any firms, but giants such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple are likely to be scrutinised in the wide-ranging probe.

Sturgeon has 'profound concerns',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Boris Johnson has ""no sense of principle"" Scotland's first minister has called on Boris Johnson to rule out a no-deal Brexit as she repeated her ""profound concerns"" about the prospect of him leading the country. Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Johnson should be in no doubt about the gravity of the situation he is about to inherit as PM. And she pledged to work with other parties to ""stop Brexit and block a no-deal Brexit"". Her statement came just minutes after Mr Johnson was elected as Tory leader. The former London mayor will succeed Theresa May as prime minister on Wednesday after defeating Jeremy Hunt by 92,153 votes to 46,656 in the ballot of Conservative Party members. Ms Sturgeon said she congratulated Mr Johnson on his victory despite the ""many differences"" between them In his victory speech, Mr Johnson promised he would ""deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn"". He has previously insisted that he is ""not aiming for a no-deal outcome"" for Brexit - but has also pledged that the UKwill be leaving the EU on 31 October ""deal or no deal"". In her statement, Ms Sturgeon congratulated Mr Johnson on his victory in the leadership contest, and said she would do ""everything possible to ensure that he respects Scotland's views and interests"". Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM Live reaction as Johnson wins Tory leadership Could Boris Johnson break up the UK? She added: ""However, I have profound concerns about the prospect of his premiership and it would be hypocritical not to be frank about these. ""These are concerns that I am certain will be shared by the vast majority of people in Scotland who, had they been given any say, would not have chosen to hand the keys of Number 10 to someone with his views and track record. ""Mr Johnson should be in no doubt about the gravity of the situation he is about to inherit as prime minister nor, in particular, about the strength with which I and others will oppose his threat of a no-deal Brexit"".

Reacting to the news, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said that Mr Johnson would face an""enormous task"" as prime minister at an ""incredibly challenging time"". She congratulated her fellow Tory on his victory, despite having backed his rival Jeremy Hunt. Ms Davidson said her priority was to make sure that Mr Johnson ""will deliver for Scotland within the UK"". Analysis by BBC Scotland Political Editor Brian Taylor Mr Johnson took part in a hustings in Perth during the leadership contest campaign In terms of intent, of political pitch, Mr Johnson's acceptance speech probably hit the right, temporary note. Void of content. Heavy on rhetoric. Giving the immediate audience what they wanted to hear. Brexit? A dawdle. Corbyn? Ancient history. UK unity? Leave it to B. After the agonies of Theresa May's uncertain leadership - which followed a catastrophic election campaign in 2017 - the Tories want robust reassurance, not timid acquiescence. They want Churchill, not Chamberlain. Mr Johnson is many things. But he is not daft. He knows - he knows - that he faces a huge problem to deliver Brexit, especially by the target date of Hallowe'en. A problem to strike a deal with a reluctant and increasing fractious and bored EU. A problem to steer a no-deal departure - which he insists he doesn't want - past a determined, if divided, Commons. Energy there will be. But energy may not be enough. Read more from Brian here The first minister claimed that any form of Brexit would be ""deeply damaging"" to Scotland and the rest of the UK. And she said that Mr Johnson's commitment to leaving by 31 October regardless of whether an exit deal had been agreed ""flies in the face of logic, common sense or any basic regard for the wellbeing of the people and nations of the UK"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""It is a deeply irresponsible threat, and not one that should be contemplated by any serious political leader. It should now be taken off the table without delay or equivocation."" She promised that the Scottish government, and SNP MPs at Westminster, would be at the forefront of any and all moves to oppose Brexit, and in particular a no-deal Brexit. The first minister said: ""We will be joined in those efforts by others from across the political spectrum - and the fact that Mr Johnson already faces strong opposition from members of his own party who oppose a no-deal Brexit underlines the seriousness of the position he finds himself in. ""Scotland did not vote for Brexit, or for the current Tory government - and certainly not for Boris Johnson as prime minister. All of this underlines the need for Scotland to have the right to determine our own future, in line with the democratic wishes of all those who live here.""

"Rare Nike trainers sell for more than Â£350,000","A pair of rare Nike trainers designed by the sportswear giant's co-founder has sold for a record-breaking $437,500 (Â£351,772). They were the last shoes to sell inan auction of 100 pairsof trainers - from Adidas to Air Jordans - in New York. The 1972 Nike Waffle Racing Flat Moon Shoe was expected to fetch $160,000. But Canadian collector, Miles Nadal paid almost three-times that, having already forked out $850,000 for the other 99 pairs in the auction. The Nike Waffle Moon Shoes were designed by Bill Bowerman, a track coach who co-founded Nike. Nike hit by conservative backlash over 'racist trainer' Nike's phone-controlled self-lacing trainers Just 12 pairs were hand-made, with a number being handed out to runners at the 1972 Olympic trials, and the pair being auctioned is thought to be the only one not to be worn. Noah Wunsch, Sotheby's global head of e-commerce, said Mr Bowerman used a waffle iron to imprint the tread on the shoes. This video can not be played Father-and-son Troy and Chase Reed have opened a New York pawn shop specialising in second-hand sneakers The new owner of the shoes, Mr Nadal - who founded an investment firm, Peerage Capital - said he was thrilled at his purchase, calling the Moon Shoe a ""true historical artefact in sports history and pop culture"". ""I think sneaker culture and collecting is on the verge of a breakout moment,"" he added, saying he plans to display them, along with the other 99 pairs he bought last week, at his private automobile museum in Toronto. Mr Nadal's haul included two pairs of Nike Mags, shoes made famous in the 1989 Back to the Future Part II because they had automatic lacing - a technology the company didn't bring to the market until almost three decades later. The limited edition Back to the Future 2016 sneakers were thought to have fetched between $50,000 and $70,000. Another star of the auction was the Jeter edition Air Jordan 11, created to commemorate New York Yankee baseball star Derek Jeter's retirement in 2017. Only five pairs were made. They were estimated to have sold for close to $60,000.

Forever 21 accused of 'fat shaming' over diet bars,"US fashion retailer Forever 21 is in hot water after sending out free diet bars with online orders of clothing. Customers flocked to social media complaining the retailer was ""fat-shaming"" women after they received Atkin bars with plus-sized orders. ""What are you trying to tell me Forever 21 - that I'm fat, lose weight?"" asked one angry customer on Twitter. The retailer has responded, apologising for the ""oversight"" and insisting that all customers were sent the snack bars. ""From time to time, Forever 21 surprises our customers with free test products from third parties in their e-commerce orders,"" Forever 21 said in a statement. Allow Twitter content?

Technology giants' power to be probed in US,"The US Justice Department has announced an investigation into leading online platforms, examining whether they are unfairly restricting competition. The DoJ did not name any firms, but companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple are likely to be scrutinised in the wide-ranging probe. It was sparked by ""widespread concerns"" about ""search, social media, and some retail services online,"" the DoJ said. It marks the latest scrutiny of tech firms' power over the US economy. The DoJ has sweeping powers to investigate firms it suspects of breaching competition laws, and it can even break up companies that it thinks are too dominant. Will the US break up the tech giants? The US Federal Trade Commission is already looking into similar concerns, while there are also investigations taking place in the European Union. Last month, the Justice Department was reported to be preparing an investigation of Google to determine whether the search engine giant had broken anti-trust law. The US Department of Justice said its anti-trust review would consider ""whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers"". It is likely to examine issues including how the largest tech firms have grown in size and power, and expanded into additional businesses, as well as how they have used the powers that come with having very large networks of users. ""Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who heads the Anti-trust Division, said in a statement. ""The department's anti-trust review will explore these important issues."" The Department of Justice hasn't said specifically which companies are under investigation, but it can be safely assumed Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google will be the focus of their attention. The broad question is whether newcomers are truly able to compete against the scale and riches of the Silicon Valley giants. What will make these firms nervous is that the DoJ isn't looking at any specific allegation, but instead embarking on a look at how the companies came to power, and what they've done to remain there. This latest investigation is in addition to an ongoing probe by the US Federal Trade Commission into similar concerns, as well as investigations taking place in the European Union. The tech companies insist they have viable competition, and warn that breaking up big American firms might pave the way for foreign competitors, particularly out of China. Google and Facebook now dominate online advertising as consumers use their smartphones to order food, watch films and socialise online. Meanwhile the growing popularity of online shopping has boosted the fortunes of firms such as Amazon. Daniel Ives, an analyst at research firm Wedbush Securities, said the DoJ investigation was a ""major shot across the bows"" of big tech companies. However, he said the end result was likely to result in ""business model tweaks"" or in a worst-case scenario potential fines rather than forced break-ups of the underlying businesses. Technology companies are facing a growing global backlash, driven by concerns that they have too much power and are harming users and business rivals. Google and Apple declined to comment, while Facebook and Amazon did not immediately comment.

Can Johnson deliver Brexit in 99 days?,"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders.

Johnson wins race to be leader,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has three priorities, to deliver Brexit, unite the country and beat Jeremy Corbyn Boris Johnson has been elected new Conservative leader in a ballot of party members and will become the next UK prime minister. He beat Jeremy Hunt comfortably, winning 92,153 votes to his rival's 46,656. The former London mayor takes over from Theresa May on Wednesday. In his victory speech, Mr Johnson promised he would ""deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn"". Speaking at the Queen Elizabeth II centre in London, he said: ""We are going to energise the country. ""We are going to get Brexit done on 31 October and take advantage of all the opportunities it will bring with a new spirit of can do. ""We are once again going to believe in ourselves, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self doubt and negativity."" Watch the moment the result was revealed Boris Johnson's battles What does the prime minister actually do? And what can he expect on his first day? Mr Johnson thanked his predecessor, saying it had been ""a privilege to serve in her cabinet"". He was Mrs May's foreign secretary until resigning over Brexit. The outgoing PM - who is standing down after a revolt by Conservative MPs over her Brexit policy - congratulated her successor, promising him her ""full support from the backbenches"". This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: 'My remain vote was a hurdle we couldn't overcome' Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said he was ""very disappointed"", but Mr Johnson would do ""a great job"". He said he had ""total, unshakeable confidence in our country"" and that was a valuable quality at such a challenging time. Mr Hunt added: ""It was always going to be uphill for us because I was someone who voted Remain and I think lots of party members felt that this was a moment when you just had to have someone who voted for Brexit in the referendum. ""In retrospect, that was a hurdle we were never able to overcome."" Donald Trump told an event in Washington ""a really good man is going to be the prime minister of the UK now,"" and Mr Johnson would ""get it done"", referring to Brexit. The president added: ""They call him Britain Trump. That's a good thing."" Almost 160,000 Conservative members were eligible to vote in the contest and turnout was 87.4%. Mr Johnson's share of the vote - 66.4% - was slightly lower than that garnered by David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership election (67.6%). The former London mayor and ex-foreign secretary spoke to staff at Conservative Party HQ after his victory was announced. He was then given a rousing reception by Tory MPs at a meeting in Parliament, where he urged them to ""unite, unite, unite and win"". The BBC's Nick Eardley, who was outside the room, said such gatherings had been gloomy and downbeat for many months, but this one was full of laughter. One MP told our correspondent: ""The BoJo show is up and running."" Another said: ""The cloud has been lifted."" Mr Johnson will begin announcing his new cabinet on Wednesday, but it has already been confirmed that Mark Spencer, MP for Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, will become chief whip - the person responsible for enforcing party discipline in the Commons. A number of senior figures have already said they will not serve under Mr Johnson, though, citing their opposition to his stance on Brexit. He has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal exit will happen if a new agreement cannot be reached by then. Education Minister Anne Miltontweeted her resignation,externaljust half an hour before the leadership result was due to be revealed, insisting the UK ""must leave the EU in a responsible manner"". And International Development Secretary Rory Stewart confirmed he would be returning to the backbenches, where he would be spending more time ""serving Cumbria"" and ""walking"".

David Gauke, another vocal opponent of a no-deal Brexit,announced he was resigning,externalas justice secretary. They join the likes of Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan and Culture Minister Margot James who have all said they disagree too strongly with Mr Johnson's Brexit strategy to work closely with him. Boris Johnson will become our next prime minister. A sentence that might thrill you. A sentence that might horrify you. A sentence that 12 months ago even his most die-hard fans would have found hard to believe. But it's not a sentence, unusually maybe for politics, that won't bother you either way. Because whatever you think of Boris Johnson, he is a politician that is hard to ignore. With a personality, and perhaps an ego, of a scale that few of his colleagues can match. This is the man who even as a child wanted to be ""world king"". Now, he is the Tory king, and the Brexiteers are the court. Read Laura's blog here The EU Commission's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he was looking forward to working with Mr Johnson ""to facilitate the ratification of the withdrawal agreement and achieve an orderly Brexit"". The new Tory leader has previously said the agreement Mrs May reached with the EU was ""dead"", having been rejected three times by MPs. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit co-ordinator, said the parliament would hold an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday in response to Mr Johnson's election. What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? What will he mean for Northern Ireland? Watch his victory speech in full Jeremy Corbyn reacted to the result by tweeting that Mr Johnson had ""won the support of fewer than 100,000 unrepresentative Conservative Party members"". ""The people of our country should decide who becomes the prime minister in a general election,"" he added. Speaking to the BBC later, Mr Corbyn said Labour planned to table a motion of no confidence in Mr Johnson. Asked when that would be, he replied: ""It will be an interesting surprise for you all."" Wednesday 12:00 BST onwards:Theresa May takes part in her last Prime Minister's Questions. After lunch she will make a short farewell speech outside No. 10 before travelling to see the Queen to tender her resignation. Boris Johnson will then arrive for an audience at Buckingham Palace where he will be invited to form a government. After that he will make a speech in Downing Street before entering the building for the first time as prime minister. Later, he will begin announcing his most senior cabinet appointments, such as chancellor, home secretary and foreign secretary, and will make and take his first calls from other world leaders. Thursday:Mr Johnson is expected to make a statement to Parliament about his Brexit strategy and take questions from MPs. Parliament will break up for its summer recess later. The new PM will also continue announcing his new cabinet. Boris Johnson's family - father Stanley, sister Rachel and fellow Tory MP Jo - attended the announcement This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Boris Johnson needs to think âa bit more carefullyâ about his priorities Newly-elected Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Mr Johnson had ""shown time and time again that he isn't fit to be the prime minister of our country"". First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Johnson, but said she had ""profound concerns"" about him becoming prime minister. The new leader also received congratulations from Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose support has kept the Conservatives in government since the 2017 general election. She said the pact - known as a confidence and supply agreement - continued and would be reviewed over the coming weeks ""to explore the policy priorities of both parties"". Leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson, who backed Mr Hunt in the campaign, also sent her congratulations, adding that the new PM had ""an enormous task ahead of him"". In the often divisive Brexit world of ""them and us"" it's easy to forget that, beyond Brexit, EU leaders still see the UK as a close partner and ally. Today's messages of congratulation to Boris Johnson from across Europe were a timely reminder. Whatever happens with Brexit, France, Germany, Poland et al still very much hope to work closely with the UK on international issues like Russia sanctions, Iran, and human rights protection. But EU leaders' welcoming tone does not signal a willingness to accept whatever Prime Minister Johnson might demand in terms of changes to the Brexit deal. He's right when he says a no-deal Brexit is bad for Brussels, but he overestimates EU wiggle room. Amendments will only be forthcoming if EU leaders deem them workable and are convinced the new prime minister commands a majority in Parliament to get an agreement through once and for all.

Kuenssberg: Is belief enough?,"Boris Johnson's political inheritance has all the makings of a disaster. He has no Commons majority. There is no mandate from the general public - remember this election has only been decided by Tory members. There are policy problems everywhere in sight - whether that's trying to solve the conundrums of Brexit with a reluctant EU and a divided party or trying to address some of the deep-seated problems at home. And just as among his fans there is genuine excitement that he will, at last, be in Number 10, there is scepticism and disbelief from the opposition parties, and double-sided concerns in his own party. Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM There is anxiety on one wing of the Tory party that he will pursue a rapid Brexit and cravenly, hang the consequences of what might be at risk. But in darker moments on the right of the Tory Party, there are suspicions that underneath the Brexit bluff there's a metropolitan wet, who could betray them. Their man for now, but a prime minister who needs to be strapped into place. For those who know him best though, the point about Boris Johnson is that he, frustratingly even to them, can be, maybe even wants to be more than one thing at the same time. They hope he could be a canvas on which others project their hopes and aspirations. A leader who can use his panache to manage all of those competing interests. A leader who will not be bowed by upsetting one side or another. An incoming prime minister who, in dramatic contrast to Theresa May, can communicate his will to the public and his party, his conviction to get this done. His plans for the Cabinet, to appoint a record number of women, a record number of ethnic minority MPs, and to promote the next generation, a contrast to the image held by some Conservatives who see him as the one to recreate perceived glories of the past. And his fans are often willing to accept whatever he actually says or does because the mistakes, or promises come from his lips. For them perhaps, the belief is in him, beyond actions he takes. Belief is a powerful commodity but it doesn't preserve a government on its own. For many of Mr Johnson's critics the jokes are old already. For those worried about Brexit, a rousing speech just doesn't solve it. To govern is not to make people feel good, it is to choose. And as soon as the decisions actually get made, Mr Johnson might find that like Theresa May he finds himself in stalemate. So sprinkle salt on vows made now about going to the country to ask all of us for his own mandate. Willing success is not the same as delivering it. Ultimately, Boris Johnson will have more than his party to convince.  Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM Boris Johnson: What's his track record?

The new PM's first job: Impress the cat,"As the new PM walks into Number 10 he will be greeted with applause by Downing Street staff - but there is one employee who is notoriously hard to impress. Larry the cat currently holds the official role of chief mouser to the Cabinet Office, a position that's said to date back hundreds of years. So how have previous PMs warmed to their four-legged civil servant over the years? A cross-species special relationship or a classic case of feline indifference? In a 2016 interview with the Sunday Times, Theresa May said she was ""very happy to see Larry"", but hinted she was more of a dog person after growing up with them at home. She did note there were parts of Number 10 where Larry ""rules the roost"" with certain seats he expects to sit on. However, her own office chair was not one of them. Their relationship is unlikely to have improved after Larry was tactically extracted by police before Mrs May's resignation speech amid fears he would upstage the departing PM. With many outgoing prime ministers in their final days often rewarding or knighting members of their loyal staff, perhaps a chance to repair the relationship still remains. But the chief mouser is likely to be more interested in the ongoing turf war between him and his Foreign Office rival, Palmerston. Multiple fights have broken out in front of cameras on Downing Street, withsecurity guards having to step in to rescue Palmerston in October 2016,external. In his final Prime Minister's Questions before resigning, David Cameron quashed rumours he and the Downing Street cat did not get on by brandishing a picture of Larry curled up on his lap. ""Sadly, I cannot take Larry with me - he belongs to the house and the staff love him very much, as do I."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In significant moment in Anglo-American relations, Larry even allowed Barack Obama to stroke him during the presidential visit in 2011 with Mr Cameron later revealing Larry was ""all right"" with him. Mr Cameron was actually responsible for bringing Larry to Downing Street in 2011. The then four-year-old arrived from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home - his mouse-catching skills honed from his time as a stray. Larry is a patriotic Brit Before Larry took up occupation, black tabby Sybil - named after the Fawlty Towers character - briefly stalked the streets of Downing Street. But her home was not No 10, but No 11 with Chancellor Alistair Darling.

Johnson starts to pick his key advisers,"Pictures of Mr Cummings leaving No 10 dominated newspaper front pages Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year. But the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times. Rarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister. His critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10. Mr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. Cummings: I discussed ousting PM after 2019 election PM resisted lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Agree with him or not, Cummings's words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings He left his Downing Street rolefollowing an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare. In his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a Â£40,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. There was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, theUK's new ""high risk"" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects. But he appears to have a different career path in mind. In February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm,according to Companies House,external, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. But in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government. The BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg. And he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal. But he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter. He plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but ""more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc"" will only be available to subscribers who pay Â£10 a month. He is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that ""slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project"". This new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. But he adds: ""It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments. ""Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation. ""Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules."" There are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however. Little was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April. After being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April. As well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make aseries of accusations against the PMand questioned his ""competence and integrity"". The following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson ""unfit for the job"", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns. He also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying. This sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations. It thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time sincehis now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year. This video can not be played Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham While staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London. This revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out ""Do I feel OK driving?"" He also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London. Asked why he had given a story that was ""not the 100% truth"" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that ""the way we handled the whole thing was wrong"". This video can not be played Cummings says he drove to Barnard Castle to test vision Boris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis.

Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Some said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election. This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends his senior adviser Dominic Cummings in May 2020 But it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project. The two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. The combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. Mr Cummings was credited with formulating the ""take back control"" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history. Yet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way. It proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a ""Get Brexit Done"" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. Many of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them. ""Levelling up"" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system. The team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched ""elite"". Lee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did. Mr Cummings watches the PM in action at a coronavirus briefing There had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style. There were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state. None of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers. Mr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order. But he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs. A longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates. He grabbed headlines when heposted an advert on his personal blogfor ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked ""deep expertise"" in many policy areas. Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law during referendum Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' Review: Brexit - The Uncivil War starring Benedict Cumberbatch The Vote Leave bus was one of its most notable campaign tactics Mr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. He is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat isChillingam Castle,external, in Northumberland. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East. In what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public. He is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world. Mr Cummings facing questions from the media outside his home He re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. The pair would rail against what they called ""the blob"" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. He left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party. He once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as ""thick as mince"" and as ""lazy as a toad"" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a ""career psychopath"". Benedict Cumberbatch was widely praised for his portrayal of Dominic Cummings in Brexit: The Uncivil War His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy. Vote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. Like most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides. All that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government.

What else is in the new PM's in-tray?,"This video can not be played As in-trays go, it's a full one Brexit is THE priority of Boris Johnson's government. The new prime minister has just 99 days until the UK leaves the EU, andhe faces an uphill task to secure a new deal. But it's not the only demand on Mr Johnson's time. One criticism of Theresa May's time in Number 10 is that other important decisions that affected the future of the UK were put on hold because Brexit became all-consuming. But these nagging priorities have not gone away. So what are they? After years of the government rejecting complaints about funding shortages for England's schools, Boris Johnson is now promising to spend more. Like a constant stone in the shoe, worries about school budgets have hobbled the May government's efforts in education - and the incoming prime minister will be told this needs to be tackled as a priority. But how much will he offer? And will it be enough to satisfy head teachers who have been radicalised into unlikely activists over cash shortages? Mr Johnson's promise to increase per-pupil funding to at least Â£5,000 per year would mean an extra Â£50m - and in terms of the overall budget would be, to use one of his own phrases, only ""chickenfeed"". Other campaign comments suggested reversing the decline in budgets - which would mean closer to Â£5bn. So schools will be waiting to see how much bristle is on the new broom. Investing in education is a key part of Mr Johnson's post-Brexit pitch - and universities will be seen as important to research, boosting infrastructure and creating an economy of bright ideas. They will also be seen as an important international export opportunity and source of soft power - and all the signs are that a Johnson administration will see overseas students as a financial asset rather than an immigration problem. The other big thorny question in the education in-tray will be whether to cut tuition fees to Â£7,500, as announced by a review requested by Theresa May. Universities will campaign against it, but with the prospect of an election never far away, could he really announce a U-turn on lowering fees, taking thousands off student debt? Schools 'desperately need' cash injection, MPs say Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap The challenge facing Mr Johnson in terms of both health and care in England - responsibility for both is devolved - can be summed up in one word: money. The NHS has been promised (relatively-speaking) lots of it - an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023. But it is how it is spent that matters. Social care - the system administered by councils to support the elderly and disabled - is in desperate need of more. But it is unclear where it will come from. Unlike Jeremy Hunt, who drew on his experience as health secretary, Boris Johnson had relatively little to say about the NHS during the leadership campaign. Perhaps his most revealing remarks came at a private garden party for Conservative party members. He talked about the NHS being the ""crowning glory"" of the country, but that in return for the cash injection, reform and greater productivity were needed. Many in the health service will scoff at this - a 2012 restructure is still fresh in the memory, and the NHS is already considered one of the most efficient health systems in the world. Finding a solution to the social care crisis is, after Brexit, perhaps the most difficult conundrum. Tales of frail and vulnerable people going without support are appearing more regularly. But the Tories - and Labour before them - have talked endlessly about what to do without actually doing it. Mr Johnson is, it is understood, sympathetic to the idea of over 40s paying what is effectively an extra tax to fund care for their old age. Theresa May unveils Â£20bn boost for NHS 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble For the past 20 years, the Home Office has struggled to come up with a modern migration system that satisfies everyone. A failure to reach a national consensus over migration was a driving factor behind many votes to leave the EU. Yet Boris Johnson could not be more different to Theresa May on immigration. As mayor of London, he witnessed first-hand the role migration played in boosting the capital's growth. He is so liberal on the issue that he has repeatedlyfloated an amnesty for migrants who arrived in the UK illegally,external. His instincts therefore chime with those of Sajid Javid who, as home secretary, disowned the phrase ""hostile environment"" and effectively abandoned his party's never-achieved net migration target. But the challenge remains massive. The Home Office is still dealing with the disaster of Windrush generation deportations - while seeking to win the trust of EU citizens worried about their future in a country they have made home. On top of that, it needs to devise a post-Brexit immigration system that many experts warn it is neither ready nor able to deliver. Draft plans published last yearpropose both scrapping a cap on skilled workers and no restriction on unskilled workers coming for up to a year. But what happens if the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal? Many experts predict Brussels will demand preferential access to the UK for its citizens in return for a trade deal. Reality Check: How has immigration changed since the referendum? Post-Brexit immigration system unveiled As Mr Johnson steps into Number 10, the cloud of uncertainty hovering over High Speed 2 (HS2) gets a little thicker. During the leadership campaign he said he wouldn't scrap plans for the new rail line linking London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. But he did express ""anxieties about the business case"". Then, last weekend, came reports the project's Â£56bn budgetcould balloon to as much as Â£85bn. Boris Johnson has already asked a former Chairman of HS2, to look at the scheme. Significant alterations would not be straightforward. However, it feels like the new prime minister will want to make his mark. Another project known as Northern Powerhouse Rail, which would see new and better rail lines linking cities in the north of England, got a clearer backing from Mr Johnson. And thenthere is Heathrow. Boris Johnson once promised to lie-down in front of the bulldozers to stop a third runway being built at the airport. However his opposition has become muted. Mr Johnson, I'm told, will not try to scupper the scheme. Perhaps more immediate than big infrastructure projects is the transport everyday: how to sort the UK's charging infrastructure so more people buy electric cars; what reforms are needed to improve the railways. A government-commissioned review will report this autumn. HS2- High-speed line cost 'could rise by Â£30bn' What do we know about HS2? Not surprisingly, the answer to many of these pressing demands is more money... Mr Johnson has his hands on three big policy levers almost immediately that could, in combination, reshape the economy. Firstly, our trading stance should change materially as a result of his Brexit approach. It detaches our total integration with the European economy, and appears to involve a closer relationship economically with the United States. If by 31 October he carries through his promise to leave, even without a deal, that change could be rather abrupt. Second, the approach on the public finances is about to change too. Tax, spending and borrowing plans - known as fiscal policy - will change. One former cabinet minister wooed by the Johnson team said the strategy was ""spend, spend, spend"". The tax cuts and spending pledges sprayed around the Conservative leadership campaign amounted to more than Â£30bn a year. In essence this dispenses with the idea of running a surplus. As spending will be higher, and taxes cut, planned deficits will rise. There is room for this, and interest rates paid on our national debts are still at historic lows. The risk of course is that a no-deal Brexit in combination with higher borrowing could cause problems. The Treasury will prepare a stimulus plan to help rescue impacted manufacturers and farmers, and perhaps consumers too. But this brings us on to the third lever - the Bank of England. Although traditionally independent on setting interest rates, or monetary policy, it is Mr Johnson's good fortune that his government will advise the Queen on the appointment of the bank's next governor, to replace Mark Carney. Some economists rather close to the new PM are in the mix. Inflation is on target. Rates could be cut further, and money created to flood the economy in the event of no deal. The bank could, as it has done repeatedly since the crisis, buy up the increased flow of government borrowing. There are other risks here. Mr Johnson's party has long decried the Opposition for its belief in a ""magic money tree"" - with the hurdles ahead he may well need to find his own smaller version - a magic money shrub.

Love Island goes to two series a year in 2020,"ITV has announced that one of its top shows, Love Island, is moving to two series a year in 2020. Love Island is currently the most watched programme for adults aged 16-34 in the UK, across any channel. The latest season saw a new record of more than 6 million viewers tune in across TV and devices. ""Off the back of a record-breaking year, we're delighted to be bringing an extra series.... to the 2020 schedule,"" said ITV's Paul Mortimer. ""Love Island has proven yet again to be the perfect format that engages younger audiences,"" the firm's head of digital channels and acquisitions added. ""In response to this viewer appetite, a new batch of young singletons will deliver some highly anticipated post-Christmas romance and drama from our new and luxurious location."" Love Island: Why so many Ofcom complaints? Eight-year-old children 'emulate Love Island' Love Island cleared over 'harassment' complaints Next year, Love Island will host a second series of the year in a new winter location - a brand new villa in South Africa. But profits and advertising have fallen, as the broadcaster reeled from an ""uncertain economic and political environment"". Pre-tax profits at ITV fell 16% to Â£222m from Â£265m in the same period in the previous year, while revenues dropped 7% to Â£1.4bn.  Advertising sales slid 5% to Â£849m from Â£890m, in 2018. However, its shares were up by 6% in morning trade in London, at 112.72 pence. Love Island is not merely a reality TV show - fans flock to its online shop, where you can buy everything from personalised water bottles and suitcases, to special make-up collections designed just for Love Island's audience. The show also has its own companion app, where users can take part in quizzes and access exclusive content such as podcasts and videos, vote for their favourite contestants, and even shop for the latest look. In an unusual move, fashion retailers need to pitch ITV before each new series of Love Island in order to win the coveted job of providing the contestants with wardrobes for the latest season. On top of having millions of viewers see the retailer's latest collections, direct links to clothing items on the retailer's website are featured within the Love Island app in its Style section. This year's official fashion partner is I Saw It First, which recently toldDrapers,externalfashion industry magazine that its sales jumped 67% month-on-month since Love Island series 5 began airing on 3 June. I Saw It First said that it had seen a 60% increase in traffic to its website, with spikes in site visits occurring on Monday nights after 9pm when the show airs on ITV2. According to Monterosa, which developed the Love Island mobile app, as of July 2018 - by the end of the fourth series - the app had more than 3.5 million users and had generated sales of in excess of Â£5m. ""The Love Island App... has more active users than other apps like Uber, Deliveroo, BBC News, Asos, Amex, and British Airways,"" mobile technology marketing experts Ogury Research wrote in its Mobile Marketing July 2018 report. Ogury told the BBC that the Love Island app is performing even better now than it did in summer 2018. Last year, the Love Island app ranked 29th in the Entertainment category in Ogury's mobile information platform, which analyses apps in the iOS and Android app stores. Now, the app is ranked 26th. Love Island is franchised overseas and currently airing in Australia, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden. In the US, CBS has bought the rights to the show, which just began airing its first series on 9 July. In May, ITV cancelled the Jeremy Kyle Show after the death of a participant who had reportedly failed a lie detector test. And there has been some controversy around Love Island after two former contestants died in 2017 and 2018. This year's Islanders were filmed arriving at the villa in June When asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether Love Island should be cancelled too, ITV's chief executive Carolyn McCall disagreed. She said that the circumstances surrounding the Jeremy Kyle Show were completely different to those around Love Island. ""Mind and the Samaritans tell the public constantly not to simplify links, and I'm afraid that's what media does,"" she said. ""The two contestants, who were really popular contestants - Sophie and Mike - there was nearly a two-year gap for each of them and they did lots and lots of other things after Love Island, so I think it's a strange thing... to bring up to be honest."" This video can not be played Former Love Island contestant Zara Holland on what it's like inside the villa She defended ITV's decision to offer contestants counselling after they leave the show: ""We offer that because we think it is important if you come out of a villa after eight weeks - you were living a very different life and you're now coming out into the real world. ""And adjusting to that real world can be quite difficult to some people, and that's why we offer counselling or therapy."" Ms McCall said she watches the show every night and felt that Love Island does offer the public value. ""The thing about Love Island is that it's a dating show. If you watch it, it is entertaining, but it is also about the every-day ups and downs of relationships,"" she said. ""They are also very kind and supportive and they discuss a lot of issues that a lot of people value because they are issues that happen in modern-day relationships.""

Facebook to pay $5bn to settle privacy concernsSocial network must also establish an independent privacy committee that Mark Zuckerberg cannot control.Business,"Facebook will pay a record $5bn fine to settle privacy concerns, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has said. The social network must also establish an independent privacy committee that Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will not have control over. The FTC had been probing allegations political consultancy Cambridge Analyticaimproperly obtained the data of up to 87 million Facebook users. The probe then widened to include other issues such as facial recognition. The $5bn fine is believed to be the biggest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers' privacy. ""Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers' choices,"" said FTC chairman Joe Simons. Will the US break up the tech giants? Technology giants' power to be probed in US He added that the heavy fine was designed ""to change Facebook's entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations"". Facebook's financial results reported on Wednesday did not reflect any move by customers to shun the network over privacy concerns. It said monthly active users had risen 8% in the second quarter. Revenues, mainly advertising sales, rose by 28%, beating analysts' forecasts. What did Facebook do wrong? The FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection began investigating Facebook in March 2018 after it was revealed that personal data was illegally harvested from an online personality quiz and sold to Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm. There were subsequent claims the data may have been used to try and influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. Although only 270,000 people took the quiz, whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleges that the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. But Cambridge Analytica was not the only firm to have access to users' personal data - the data was gathered using Facebook's infrastructure at that time, and many other developers had taken advantage of it without authorisation. Facebook was fined Â£500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdogfor its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal in October. Confirming previous reports, the FTC found that certain Facebook policies violated rules against deceptive practices. For instance, it said Facebook's data policy was deceptive to people who used its facial recognition tool. The social network also fell foul of the regulator by not revealing that phone numbers collected for two-factor authentication would be used for advertising. FTC representatives from both the Democrat and Republican parties voted the settlement deal through, although some dissented, arguing it did not go far enough. Democrat Rohit Chopra tweeted the fine would not stop Facebook from ""engaging in surveillance"" and that Mark Zuckerberg and other executives had got ""blanket immunity for their role in the violations"".

Facebook has deep pockets - the firm's annual revenue last year was $55bn. However, the FTC's fine will still irritate the tech giant. In a press release, the company acknowledged unequivocally that its involvement in the Cambridge Analytica scandal was ""a breach of trust"" with its users. The regulatory action will be taken by some as a general sign that mishandling user data can incur real consequences from US authorities. For years, apps and websites have casually harvested personal information for murky ends. While this will undoubtedly continue in many quarters, with every crackdown, such activity only becomes more contentious. But there are those who think the FTC could have gone further. And one, Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer,thinks the settlement actually benefits the company,external. By restricting the flow of data, Facebook may get to effectively hoard its 2.4 billion users, he argues, rather than allow them to access third party apps or competing social networks. Former Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix In May 2018,Cambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy in the US, blaming a ""siege of media coverage"" for driving away customers and forcing its closure. As part of a separate settlement with the FTC, two of the defendants - former Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix and app developer Aleksandr Kogan - have agreed to administrative orders restricting how they conduct any business in the future. The pair are also required to delete or destroy any personal information they collected. The FTC alsolaunched a lawsuit,externalagainst the bankrupt company, which is yet to settle the agency's allegations. In a post on Facebook,external, Mr Zuckerberg said the firm had ""a responsibility to protect people's privacy"" and would be changing how its products were developed and how the company is run. He said that Facebook was reviewing its technical systems to identify possible privacy risks, and going forward, whenever the social network built a new product that used data, or a feature changed the way it used data, possible privacy risks would need to be addressed. ""Overall, these changes go beyond anything required under US law today,"" he said. ""We expect it will take hundreds of engineers and more than a thousand people across our company to do this important work. And we expect it will take longer to build new products following this process going forward,"" he added. At the same time that the FTC made its announcement, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges against Facebook for making misleading disclosures regarding its handling of user data. As a result, Facebook has agreed to pay $100m to settle the claims. The SEC found that although Facebook discovered the misuse of its users' information in 2015, it did not clarify this for two years, instead telling investors that user data ""may"" have been improperly accessed. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) is alsoinvestigating leading online platformsto see whether they are unfairly restricting competition. The DoJ did not name any firms, but giants such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple are likely to be scrutinised in the wide-ranging probe.

Shares dive as Aston Martin cuts sales forecastsThe luxury carmaker says it will sell fewer cars this year because of weaker demand in Europe.Business,"The Aston Martin DB11 on display at the Annual Chicago Auto Show in February Shares in Aston Martin have dived more than 20% after the luxury carmaker cut its sales forecasts for 2019.

"Technology giants' power to be probed in USFirms like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple will be scrutinised in a Department of Justice probe.BusinessComments","The US Justice Department has announced an investigation into leading online platforms, examining whether they are unfairly restricting competition. The DoJ did not name any firms, but companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple are likely to be scrutinised in the wide-ranging probe. It was sparked by ""widespread concerns"" about ""search, social media, and some retail services online,"" the DoJ said. It marks the latest scrutiny of tech firms' power over the US economy. The DoJ has sweeping powers to investigate firms it suspects of breaching competition laws, and it can even break up companies that it thinks are too dominant. Will the US break up the tech giants? The US Federal Trade Commission is already looking into similar concerns, while there are also investigations taking place in the European Union. Last month, the Justice Department was reported to be preparing an investigation of Google to determine whether the search engine giant had broken anti-trust law. The US Department of Justice said its anti-trust review would consider ""whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers"". It is likely to examine issues including how the largest tech firms have grown in size and power, and expanded into additional businesses, as well as how they have used the powers that come with having very large networks of users. ""Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who heads the Anti-trust Division, said in a statement. ""The department's anti-trust review will explore these important issues."" The Department of Justice hasn't said specifically which companies are under investigation, but it can be safely assumed Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google will be the focus of their attention. The broad question is whether newcomers are truly able to compete against the scale and riches of the Silicon Valley giants. What will make these firms nervous is that the DoJ isn't looking at any specific allegation, but instead embarking on a look at how the companies came to power, and what they've done to remain there. This latest investigation is in addition to an ongoing probe by the US Federal Trade Commission into similar concerns, as well as investigations taking place in the European Union. The tech companies insist they have viable competition, and warn that breaking up big American firms might pave the way for foreign competitors, particularly out of China. Google and Facebook now dominate online advertising as consumers use their smartphones to order food, watch films and socialise online. Meanwhile the growing popularity of online shopping has boosted the fortunes of firms such as Amazon. Daniel Ives, an analyst at research firm Wedbush Securities, said the DoJ investigation was a ""major shot across the bows"" of big tech companies. However, he said the end result was likely to result in ""business model tweaks"" or in a worst-case scenario potential fines rather than forced break-ups of the underlying businesses. Technology companies are facing a growing global backlash, driven by concerns that they have too much power and are harming users and business rivals.

You can follow updates to the Mueller report saga and reaction to today's hearings on our main story,here. Want more analysis? Check out Anthony Zurcher's piece on what we learnedhere. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Robert Mueller has been presented, at various times and by
various parties, as a hero or villain - an avenging angel who would expose
corruption or the part of a corrupt establishment himself. After six hours of
testimony, the former special counsel â for two years the silent sphynx of Washington
â spoke extensively, but he revealed he had little of the superhuman powers
that have been attributed to him. In his sometimes stumbling testimony, he stuck by the text
of his voluminous report â leaving the American political landscape much the way
it sat before he entered the committee room on Wednesday morning. Democrats hoping that Mr Mueller would offer the kind of
sweeping testimony that fuels calls for presidential impeachment will surely be
disappointed. Republicans, including the president himself, who were hoping for
vindication at last â âNo collusion! No obstruction!â - did not receive it. Instead, the partisan muddle remains. Investigations in
Congress will continue to plod along. Those on the left will continue to decry
what they see as the presidentâs obvious crimes and ethical shortcomings.
Republicans will continue to insist the president is being smeared by false
accusations. In the end, like all political disputes, the American public
will be the final arbiter. In this case, that judgement will be passed at the
ballot box, 15 months from now.  Despite earlier claims that he wouldn't be tuning in, President Trump issued tweets throughout Mueller's testimony - all declaring the day had been a win for the White House. His most recent came after the hearings ended. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

entire spectacle has always been about the Democrats trying to undo the
legitimate result of the 2016 election and today they again failed miserably. ""Robert Mueller confirmed what we already knew: no collusion, no obstruction,
and the way President Trump has been treated is unprecedented. ""Almost three
years and tens of millions of dollars have been wasted on this witch
hunt and it is now even more apparent that Democrats are completely consumed
with their hatred of the president and their obsession with overturning the
will of the people who elected him.â Schiff excuses Mueller and then the hearing is adjourned. ""You would not tell us whether the president should be impeached, nor did we ask you, since it is our responsibility to determine the proper conduct,"" Schiff says in his closing statements. ""Whether we decide to impeach the president or not... we must protect the country while he is in office."" Schiff says it's now on the House to look into possible money laundering, compromised individuals in the administration, and any foreign financial inducements to influence US policy. ""One thing is clear from your report, your testimony...the Russians massively intervened in 2016 and they are prepared to do so again in voting that is set to begin a mere eight months from now. The president seems to welcome the help again."" He says lawmakers must protect the sanctity of elections and ""make them [Russians] pay"". Democratic Chair Schiff ends by talking about holding leaders to a higher standard. Mueller agrees that accepting foreign aid in an election can be ""a crime"" and is not moral or patriotic. ""And wrong,"" Schiff adds. ""True,"" Mueller replies. ""The need to act in an ethical manner is not just a moral one, but when people act unethically it also exposes them to compromise, particularly in dealing with foreign powers,"" says Schiff. ""True."" Mueller won't speculate on Trump's future plans post-presidency, so Schiff concludes by saying: ""We are all left to wonder whether the president is representing us or his financial interests."" Conservative and liberal commentators alike took to Twitter to declare the hearing a devastating blow for Democrats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Trump's written answers were done under oath, says Mueller, after he confers with his aide sitting beside him. But he adds that he would have liked to discuss other things with him if Trump had ever agreed to an in-person interview.  Mueller says Trump's written answers ""were certainly not as useful as the interview would be"". But he says the investigation did not subpoena the president because they assumed he would fight it in court and there was a need to expedite ""the end of the investigation"". âWe had to make a balanced decision,"" he says. Democrat Peter Welch asks if Mueller shares his concern about a campaign encouraging help from a foreign adversary. ""Have we established a new normal from this past campaign that will apply to future campaigns?â Mueller replies: âI hope this is not the new normal, but I fear it is.â Allow Twitter content?

Democrat Denny Heck asks if it's fair to say Trump, Kushner, Cohen and others ""all tried to use their connections with the Trump organisation to profit from Russia, which was openly seeking relief from sanctions"". Mueller says he is not able to agree. Heck goes on: ""That was not only dangerous, that was un-American. Greed corrupts!"" Asked by reporters about Mueller's testimony, former Vice President and Democratic White House front-runner Joe Biden said that President Trump has committed ""impeachable offences"". ""I think the president should be tried for it,"" Biden said while on a campaign stop in Michigan. He added that Congress should pursue an impeachment inquiry in an ""orderly way"" so that the American people do not view the process as politically motivated. Biden also says Mueller's probe provides ""plenty of reasons"" for Trump to be charged after he leaves office. Republican Congressman Will Hurd, who has shown a past willingness to cross party lines, says that as a former CIA officer, his focus is on preventing Russia from meddling in another US election. He asks Mueller if campaigns should be required to disclose when a foreign nation approaches them with offers of help. ""It sounds like a worthwhile endeavour,"" says Mueller, adding that offers ""should be pursued, aggressively and early"". He adds that many other countries are now capable of ""replicating what Russia has done"". Hurd asks if the Russian attempt in 2016 was a one-off or if more attacks are being planned in Moscow. ""It's not a single attempt. They're doing it as we sit here,"" says Mueller, adding that Russia will attempt to meddle in the next campaign as well.  Democrat Joaquin Castro asks about Michael Cohen and plans for a Trump Tower Moscow. ""According to your report, Cohen lied to minimise links between the [tower] project and Trump and stick to the party line in order to not contradict Trump's message that no connection existed between Trump and Russia,"" Castro says. ""If it's in the report, consequently I do believe it to be true,"" Mueller replies. Trump discussed a tower in Moscow several times over many years. In 2015, it came up in discussions between Trump Organization aides, led by Cohen, and Russian contacts. Castro asks if Mueller looked into whether Trump could be blackmailed over dealings with Moscow over the tower. Mueller says he can't answer. More on Trump's tower that never was New York Republican Elise Stefanik asks if Mueller has read the Steele Dossier, but Mueller says he won't answer that question. As she continues to press him on the dossier, alleging Trump ties with Russia, she says they are important questions because the dossier forms the early basis on Mueller's investigation. Mueller has said that he will not answer questions about the beginning of the investigation, despite Republicans pressing him, because the investigation started nearly a year before he was appointed to lead the special counsel. Eric Swalwell, who recently ended his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, asked Mueller about information kept secret, and if Mueller wanted to interview the president (Mueller says yes). Swalwell then asks if, ""as a result of lies, deletion of text message, obstruction and witness tampering"", it's fair to say Mueller's team wasn't able to fully assess the role of Russian interference in the election - and any part Trump played in it. Mueller says he can't agree with all of that, but does not specify which parts he might agree with. ""We don't know what we don't know,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

S Korea and Russia spar over airspace 'intrusion'South Korea says Russia initially apologised for violating its airspace - which Moscow has now denied.Asia,"South Korea said a Russian A-50 early warning and control plane twice violated its airspace (file photo) Russia has strongly denied ever apologising for violating South Korean airspace, as the fall-out from an incident involving warplanes from four countries continues. South Korea's presidential office earlier said a Russian official had expressed ""deep regret"" for Tuesday's aerial intrusion. It says a Russian aircraft twice violated its territorial airspace during a joint exercise with China. But Moscow denies any intrusion. ""We have seen statements in the South Korean media quoting words allegedly said by our acting military attachÃ©,"" a spokesman for Russia's embassy in South Korea said, according to Interfax news agency. ""We have paid attention to these statements. In this connection we can speak for ourselves that there is a lot in them which does not correspond to reality."" South Korean jets fired nearly 400 warning shots and 20 flares on Tuesday near the Russian surveillance plane that both it and Japan said flew near disputed islands in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, that the two countries claim. What are the Dokdo/Takeshima islands? How an Asian trade row could hit electronics supplies S Korea expands air defence zone On Wednesday, South Korea's government said that a Russian official had admitted the violation on Tuesday, saying it was unintended and that Moscow would immediately launch an investigation into the case, which the official blamed on a ""technical glitch"". ""Moscow said if the aircraft flew according to an initially planned route, this incident would not have occurred,"" a spokesman for the presidential Blue House, Yoon Do-han, told reporters. Meanwhile, China has defended the exercise, which was the first ever joint air patrol between it and Russia. Defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian told reporters they ""strictly abided by the relevant regulations of international law and did not enter the airspace of other countries"". Japan also scrambled bombers during Tuesday's incident. The alleged incursion happened over the disputed Dokdo/Takeshima islands, which are occupied by South Korea but also claimed by Japan. South Korea's military said that in total three Russian and two Chinese military aircraft entered the Korea Air Defence Identification Zone (KADIZ) on Tuesday morning. One of those planes - an A-50 Russian surveillance plane - also violated its territorial airspace twice, it said, before leaving. South Korea said its jets fired flares and machine-gun warning shots when the Russian plane intruded. It also deployed F-15 and F-16 planes to intercept it. Russian and Chinese bombers and reconnaissance planes have occasionally entered the zone in recent years, but this is the first incident of its kind between Russia and South Korea. South Korean F-15 jets were sent to intercept the Russian plane Russia's defence ministry denied any airspace violation and said it did not recognise the KADIZ. Russia also accused the South Korean pilots of ""hooliganism in the air"", saying that the patrol had been more than 25km from the Dokdo/Takeshima islands. Lt Gen Kobylash said Russia had complained to South Korea about its crews' ""illegal and dangerous actions"". The government in Tokyo lodged a complaint against both Russia and South Korea. Because it claims sovereignty over the islands, Japan's government said that Russia had violated its airspace. It also said that South Korea's response had been extremely regrettable. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""In light of Japan's stance regarding sovereignty over Takeshima, the South Korean military aircraft's having carried out warning shots is totally unacceptable and extremely regrettable."" This first ""joint air patrol"" involving Russian and Chinese long-range aircraft in the Asia Pacific region, sends a powerful signal of the developing military relationship between Moscow and Beijing. This still falls short of a formal alliance but their joint exercises are larger and more sophisticated. In turn this is a reflection of the ever closer economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries who, though they still have points of tension, are drawing ever closer together. They broadly share a similar world view, hostile to Western liberal democracy, eager to promote an alternative model, protective of their own national sovereignty, and often willing to ride rough-shod over that of others. This poses a huge challenge for US strategy. The nightmare in Washington is an ever closer relationship between an assertive, but declining Russia, and a rising China, which looks set to overtake the US as a technological and economic power in the years ahead. An air defence identification zone (ADIZ) is an airspace which a country seeks to monitor on grounds of national security. Overseas aircraft should identify themselves before entering an air defence zone. An ADIZ usually extends well beyond national airspace to allow for sufficient warning of a potential threat. But ADIZs are not governed by international law and the self-defined boundaries can be disputed or overlap with other countries' claims, which may lead to violations.

What the US makes of Boris Johnson,"This video can not be played Do Americans recognise UK's new prime minister? What's an American to make of Boris Johnson? Not the person-on-the-street American, who may look at a photograph of the new British Conservative leader and think they're being asked to identify an aging 1970s glam rocker. I'm talking about the US media analysts and commentators who get paid to think about politics and, occasionally, cast their eyes across the oceans to see what the rest of the world is up to. At this point in US history, it's hard for Americans to view any major political event outside the context of the rise and rule of Donald Trump - the crashing cacophony that drowns out all other thought. Emmanuel Macron is elected president of France? A rebuke of Trumpism! The Liberal/National right-leaning coalition prevails in Australia? Trumpism triumphs! Such is the case with the Mr Johnson. The comparisons between the two Anglophone leaders have come fast and furious - some facile and others more nuanced. Even Mr Trump himself got in on the game, in a speech in Washington on Tuesday afternoon. ""He's tough and he's smart,"" Mr Trump said of Mr Johnson. ""They call him 'Britain Trump', and it's people saying that's a good thing. They like me over there. That's what they wanted. That's what they need."" There are plenty of other opinions, of course - that Mr Johnson is either the second coming of Donald Trump in a good way or in a bad way; a British original or a knock-off nationalist. ""The front-runner to become Britain's next prime minister is a portly white man with unkempt blond hair, an adoring base of supporters, disdain for Europe, a dodgy private life and a loose relationship with truth and principle,""the New York Times editorial board wrote last month,external. ""There are also differences between Boris Johnson and Donald Trump, but the similarities have been much noted in some European circles, with no small misgivings."" The hair is where the comparisons always start - althoughthe Associated Press's Gregory Katz and Natasha Livingstone note,externalthat while both pay careful attention to their trademark coifs, they do so in differing ways. ""President Donald Trump's hair is very carefully styled before he appears in public, while Johnson's precisely the opposite,"" they write (in fact, Johnson is known to ruffle his hair before he goes on camera). ""From the start of his political career Johnson has sported what could only be called the 'slept-on' look, declining to style his locks in any way so they have a natural, spontaneous, even unpredictable quality."" Beyond appearances, American observers note that both Mr Trump and Mr Johnson were born in New York City, and both have elite college pedigrees - the former at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania and the latter at Oxford. The more discerning will note that Mr Johnson qualified through an academic scholarship, while Mr Trump's admission reportedly required some familial arm-twisting. The many battles of Boris Johnson Mr Johnson also occasionally betrays his ivory tower pedigree with allusions to classical history or the arts, while Mr Trumpâ¦ does not. Both men also have taken unusual paths to power - the American through his real estate and reality television celebrity, and the Brit by being a sharp-tongued journalist. ""Johnson's rise is akin to Trump's: People in the political class don't like, or even trust, him,""writes Kyle Smith of the conservative National Review,external. ""Yet he found a path around them."" This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Chris Mason's guide to the political life of Boris Johnson That path includes riding a wave of populist sentiment to the highest pinnacles of power in their countries. ""Like President Trump, Johnson is a larger-than-life populist who has made controlling immigration and restoring his nation's standing in the world key issues in recent years,""writes National Public Radio's Frank Langfitt.,external""Like Trump, Johnson has also emphasized his unease with the changing face of his homeland, using language that plays well with much of his white base but angers minorities and urban liberals."" Despite distaste from the respective political establishments and vociferous objections from the left, both men prevailed in part through the outsized nature of their personalities. They both display an unfailing belief in the strength of their will to overcome obstacles that others have found insurmountable. ""I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves,"" Mr Trump said in his 2016 speech accepting the Republican Party's presidential nomination. ""Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it."" On Tuesday morning, Mr Johnson pledged to energise the country, which he compared to a sleeping giant. ""We are going to take advantage of all the opportunities that it will bring in a new spirit of can-do,"" he said. ""And we are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve."" The Atlantic's Tom McTague writes that,externalMr Johnson's view of the world is ""a romantic, egocentric belief in his personal power to do great things, to solve great puzzles, through the force of his personality"". What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? What can the new PM expect on his first day? Will there be another general election? Mr Trump bills himself as an expert negotiator, the master of the ""art of the deal"" - whether it's resolving longstanding disputes with North Korea, reopening trade deals with allies, brokering peace in the Middle East or offering to be the (apparently unwanted) arbiter of the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan. Francis Menton,who writes the Manhattan Contrarian blog,external, says the president's skill at negotiation - while the ultimate verdict is still out - is in his willingness to walk away from what he views as a bad deal. That's an attribute he suspects Mr Johnson shares. ""There is zero chance that a successful Brexit deal can be negotiated without at least some degree of brinksmanship,"" he says, adding that Mr Johnson's expressed willingness to accept a ""no deal"" Brexit demonstrates a ""breath of basic competence"". As the name of Menton's blog indicates, that's largely a contrarian view in the US right now. On Tuesday morning, the New York Times editorialised that Mr Johnson's career ""displays far more bluster than achievement, and a consistent disdain for hard work, probity or the truth"". Do Trump rally taunts mark new strategy? Five things the UK envoy row reveals about Trump 'Why we want Trump to win in 2020' Ishaan Tharoor, in The Washington Post, writes that,externalthe new Conservative leader's ""incessant appeals to the bravura and derring-do of Britain's past"" is entertaining but absurd, and ""won't translate easily into meaningful politics"". Many of these comparisons gloss over some of the very real policy differences between Mr Trump and his British counterpart that could outweigh their stylistic similarities and shared views on trade and immigration. Mr Johnson supports the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and vociferously defends his nation's government-run healthcare system, for instance - all anathema to the US president. Boris Johnson (left) and Donald Trump greet before a UN meeting in 2017 That could be why some on the American right also have their doubts about Mr Johnson. ""Boris Johnson is a fascinating and entertaining character, which is not the same as being a serious, prepared leader,""tweets Dan McLaughlin, a contributing columnist with the National Review.,external ""He's kind of a cross between [former Speaker of the House of Representatives] Newt Gingrich and Trump, but with a distinct Fleet Street flavour and little in common with US conservatives philosophically. You'd be a fool to rule out the possibility that Boris Johnson will be a successful prime minister, though the odds are against it."" Of course, the odds were pretty slim that Donald Trump and Boris Johnson would be where they are today. Americans these days don't put a lot of faith in political probabilities.

Are you ready for the heatwave?,"With a heatwave predicted to bring temperatures above 41C to parts of the UK over the next few days, how can the nation keep cool and carry on? Temperatures could be thehighest ever recorded in the UKthis week, beating the current record temperature from 2019, when a high of 38.7C was recorded in Cambridge. The Met Office has issued ared extreme heat warning,externalfor many parts of England, from London and the south-east up to York and Manchester. Amber warnings are also currently in place across the rest of England, all of Wales, and parts of Scotland. For those hoping to be given a day off, unfortunately, there are currentlyno laws in the UK,externalabout when it is too hot to work. Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures. It can, however, be too cold to work. Government guidance recommends a minimum working temperature of 16C (61F), or 13C, if employees are doing physical work. As avoiding work in the heat isn't an option, then there's the inevitable dilemma of what to wear. But can you wear flip-flops to work?Staff should have a relaxed dress code during the heatwave, union says. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

If you can't see the calculator,tap here,external That's the million dollar question. On sticky nights, drifting off can seem impossible. How to sleep in hot weather What you should - and shouldn't do - to stay cool Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Send your photos/videos of the hot weather toyourpics@bbc.co.uk A big part of the problem is humidity, which makes it hard for sweat to evaporate. To try and keep your bedroom as cool as possible, shut your blinds or curtains during the day - although doing so with metallic blinds and dark curtains could make the room hotter. You could also open windows on the shady side of your home and close them on the sunny side - and then open all the windows before going to bed to get a thorough breeze. That's not an option open to everyone, so an electric fan can be a handy substitute. A fan will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating. Other recommendations include: Putting reflective material or shades outside bedroom windows Having a lukewarm shower before bed Using thin cotton sheets Wearing lightweight materials for bed as they can keep you cooler - as can sleeping naked and avoiding sharing space with partners Putting your sheets in the freezer for a spell before you go to bed When it comes to children, the NHS says a cool bath before bedtime can help. Pyjamas and bedclothes should be kept to a minimum, and if a baby kicks off its bedcovers during the night then they could sleep in just a nappy - babies sleep most comfortably when their room is between 16C (61F) and 20C (68F). As if you don't have enough to think about with a baby, a heatwave brings an added risk of dehydration, sunburn and sunstroke. The NHS recommends,externalkeeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight, and older infants should be kept out of the sun as much as possible, particularly between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather Sun cream with a high sun protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids and the NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual, but will not need water as well as breast milk. If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Dressing for the weather may sound obvious, but clothes can make a real difference to how our bodies handle heat. As tempting as it might be to strip off, you may be at greater risk of sunburn which can affect your body's ability to cool itself. It's best to choose light colours over dark - which absorb heat more - and loose garments that can allow air to get in. Hats with ventilation will also help and fabric choice is key - materials like cotton and linen are more breathable, absorbing sweat and encouraging ventilation. This is fast becoming the first question asked when extreme weather events strike - and the answer remains the same. It is almost impossible to say that a specific event, like the current hot spell, is caused by global heating. However there are some very strong connections to human-induced warming that increase the likelihood of such weather. Last year's blazing summer in the UKwas said by the Met Office to have been made 30 times more likelybecause of emissions from human activity. And the Met Office also said warm spells in the UK have more than doubled in length - increasing from 5.3 days in the 1961-1990 period to more than 13 days in the decade from 2008 to 2017. The heatwave also follows on from a previousrecord-breaking June across Europe, which was 1C above the long term trend and an incredible 3C above the average from 1850-1900. When researchers carried out a rapid analysis to see the impact of climate change on the June heatwave,they concluded it was made at least five times more likelyby warming. It may well be that the current period of extremely hot weather is purely down to natural variability, said BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath. But even if so, the fingerprints of fossil fuel burning are heavily influencing the background - and making such events much more likely. Strawberries are among the foods recommended during a heatwave Hydration is key. Our bodies sweat more in hot weather, so it is really important to restock lost water levels. Don't rely on your physical thirst to judge how dehydrated you are as it's not a very good indicator(urine colour,externalis better), so you should try to drink plenty before you feel parched. And try not to consume too much alcohol. The NHS says good drink options include water, lower-fat milks and tea and coffee. Foods with high water content such as strawberries, cucumber, courgette, lettuce, celery and melon can also help you stay hydrated. Try to avoid large, heavy meals laden with carbohydrates and protein because they take more digesting, which in turn produces more body heat. Although it may not be what you fancy on sweaty days,scientific research suggests spicy and hot foods can actually help cool you down.,external More tips on what to eat in a heatwave from BBC Good Food,external Dogs in particular struggle in the hot weather because they are not able to cool down through sweating, as humans do, and those breeds with long coats are especially prone to overheating. The RSPCA has a series of tips,externalfor keeping animals safe and comfortable during the heatwave. These include avoiding leaving animals in hot cars, conservatories, outbuildings or caravans, which, even just for a short while, can be fatal due to rising temperatures. It also says it is best to walk a dog early in the morning or late in the evening when it is cooler, as paws can burn on a hot pavement. Exercise can also increase the risk of heatstroke. This video can not be played Five ways to keep your dog cool this summer For those pets kept in cages, hutches, fish tanks or other enclosures, they should be kept out of direct sunlight. And it's not just humans who need sun cream, it might also be beneficial to apply some to your pet. Animals' exposed spots, such as ears and noses, are vulnerable to sunburn and - just like people - sun damage can lead to skin cancer. The Blue Cross saywhite cats are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer,externalfrom sunlight exposure than others. This video can not be played Dog owners have been urged to check pavements using the ""seven-second test"" This video can not be played Humidity explainer Most people in the UK aren't used to such extreme temperatures, which can cause heat exhaustion and, more seriously, heatstroke. Signs of heat exhaustion can include tiredness or weakness, feeling faint or dizzy, having muscle cramps or feeling sick. If left untreated, the more serious symptoms of heatstroke can develop, including confusion, disorientation and even a loss of consciousness. Those suffering the signs of heat exhaustion should go to a cool place with air conditioning or shade, use a cool, wet sponge or flannel and drink fluids - ideally water, fruit juice or a rehydration drink, such as a sports drink. Those most vulnerable include the elderly, people with conditions such as diabetes, young children and people working or exercising outdoors. NHS guidance on dealing with heatstroke,external If you choose to exercise, listen to your body - it will be under greater strain than in usual conditions so your usual limits may be different. Aim to do it when the weather is at its coolest: early or late in the day. If you do intensive exercise, drink lots of water. Isotonic sports drinks can also help ensure you are rehydrating properly. Cold showers and blotting with damp, cold materials can also work wonders. In general, stay in the shade or in air-conditioned places as much as possible, especially at the hottest part of the day. The risk of sunburn depends on how sensitive your skin is, and how strong the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays are. The UV index will vary, depending on where you are in the world, the time of year, what the weather is like, the time of day, and how high up you are compared to sea level. During the UK's summer months, the sun's UV rays are strongest between 11:00 and 15:00. Cancer Research UK suggests,externalusing a simple ""shadow rule"" to estimate the strength of the sun. It suggests that if your shadow is shorter than your height, the sun's UV rays are strong - and you are therefore more likely to burn. How much sun cream to use and what to do if you burn There are lots of ""extended wear"" sunscreens on the market that advertise themselves as being for use ""once a day"", or claiming to last for eight hours. But dermatologists recommend that these products should still be applied at least every two hours, like any other sunscreen, since the risk that you may have missed a spot - or that it will rub or wash off in that time - are too high. The British Association of Dermatologists says sunscreen with SPF 30 is a ""satisfactory form of sun protection in addition to protective shade and clothing"" and that it should be reapplied at least every two hours, no matter what SPF it is. There are lots of places that rate sunscreen brands, including consumer websiteWhich?,external. However,the British Association of Dermatologists,external(BAD) says in general you should look for two ratings on bottles of sun creams. The sun emits two types of ultraviolet rays - UVA (most commonly responsible for premature ageing and wrinkles) and UVB (which causes most sunburn). The BAD says you need to be protected from both. The sun protection factor (SPF) offers guidance on a cream's protection against UVB rays, while a star system indicates the level of protection against UVA rays.

The view from Europe,"In the often-divisive Brexit world of ""them and us"" it's easy to forget that, beyond Brexit, EU leaders still see the UK as a close partner and ally. Their messages of congratulation to Boris Johnson from across Europe on Tuesday - notably from French President Emmanuel Macron - are a timely reminder of that. Whatever happens with Brexit, France, Germany, Poland et al still very much hope to work closely with the UK on international issues like Russia sanctions, Iran and human rights protection. On the world stage the EU considers the UK one of the good guys. But EU leaders' welcoming tone - a diplomatic courtesy at the end of the day - should not be misconstrued when it comes to Brexit and a Boris Johnson premiership. EU invitations to the new prime minister to work with them ""constructively"" do not signal a willingness to accept whatever the new prime minister might demand in terms of changes to the Brexit deal. One influential EU figure put it to me that there were currently two schools of thought in the EU when it comes to Boris Johnson: Number 1: Those who believe that, once in office, he will water down his rhetoric. These EU optimists believe that, as a chief architect of Brexit, Mr Johnson is best placed to sell a compromise deal to parliament. They also hope, after so much time longing to be prime minister, that Boris Johnson ultimately won't want to risk his fledging premiership by going for a no-deal Brexit this autumn. School of Thought Number 2: Those who predict ""Varoufakis the sequel"". These EU pessimists predict ""lots of pointless meetings"" with Prime Minister Johnson - as they believe was the case with Greece's controversial finance minister at the height of the Greek debt crisis. They think the result will be a no-deal Brexit. First and foremost though, the EU is waiting to see which figures will have Boris Johnson's ear once he's in Downing Street. ""Only then can we begin to understand what Boris Johnson's Brexit strategy will be,"" one EU diplomat commented to me. ""Up till now, all we've heard are slogans."" Of course, the EU is already familiar with Mr Johnson's so-called nuclear strategy - letting the EU know that he is very serious about a no-deal Brexit. He knows EU leaders would far prefer a coordinated Brexit. He seems to believe that the credible threat of no deal will provoke a fundamental rethink in Brussels. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has three priorities, to deliver Brexit, unite the country and beat Jeremy Corbyn But the problem with the no-deal threat is that it goes both ways. EU leaders also think no-deal is better than a bad deal. For them. And they believe they are far better prepared. Boris Johnson is right. The EU has more wiggle room around the Brexit deal than it has so far wanted to signal, but also I think he overestimates EU flexibility. Europe's leaders will not want to sign up to compromises over Brexit that ultimately will hurt them. Amendments will only be forthcoming if EU leaders deem them workable and if they are convinced the new prime minister commands a majority in parliament to get the Brexit deal through once and for all. And while limited changes to the backstop guarantee for the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland might be conceivable - if Dublin is willing - the Boris Johnson notion of abandoning the backstop altogether is nigh on unthinkable for Brussels. EU leaders want to safeguard their single market from non-regulation smuggled goods. This is about more than Brexit, more than the Northern Ireland peace process. The integrity of the single market is the cornerstone of the EU's success as a trading bloc. EU leaders will not want to be seen to be abandoning Ireland either. Smaller member states are now a force to be reckoned with in the EU - working together to counter-balance Franco-German influence as the UK prepares to leave the roost.

Can he impress Larry?,"As the new PM walks into Number 10 he will be greeted with applause by Downing Street staff - but there is one employee who is notoriously hard to impress. Larry the cat currently holds the official role of chief mouser to the Cabinet Office, a position that's said to date back hundreds of years. So how have previous PMs warmed to their four-legged civil servant over the years? A cross-species special relationship or a classic case of feline indifference? In a 2016 interview with the Sunday Times, Theresa May said she was ""very happy to see Larry"", but hinted she was more of a dog person after growing up with them at home. She did note there were parts of Number 10 where Larry ""rules the roost"" with certain seats he expects to sit on. However, her own office chair was not one of them. Their relationship is unlikely to have improved after Larry was tactically extracted by police before Mrs May's resignation speech amid fears he would upstage the departing PM. With many outgoing prime ministers in their final days often rewarding or knighting members of their loyal staff, perhaps a chance to repair the relationship still remains. But the chief mouser is likely to be more interested in the ongoing turf war between him and his Foreign Office rival, Palmerston. Multiple fights have broken out in front of cameras on Downing Street, withsecurity guards having to step in to rescue Palmerston in October 2016,external. In his final Prime Minister's Questions before resigning, David Cameron quashed rumours he and the Downing Street cat did not get on by brandishing a picture of Larry curled up on his lap.

In significant moment in Anglo-American relations, Larry even allowed Barack Obama to stroke him during the presidential visit in 2011 with Mr Cameron later revealing Larry was ""all right"" with him. Mr Cameron was actually responsible for bringing Larry to Downing Street in 2011. The then four-year-old arrived from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home - his mouse-catching skills honed from his time as a stray. Larry is a patriotic Brit Before Larry took up occupation, black tabby Sybil - named after the Fawlty Towers character - briefly stalked the streets of Downing Street. But her home was not No 10, but No 11 with Chancellor Alistair Darling. The lack of a feline presence in Gordon Brown's HQ raised questions, and Mr Brown's official spokesperson was forced to deny the PM and his wife had a problem with Sybil. The incoming prime minister had to share his home with the veteran Humphrey, who had already been patrolling the corridors for eight years when the Blairs moved in. Humphrey with Tony Blair's wife Cherie But rumours circled the Westminster village when Humphrey suddenly left. Downing Street was forced to deny he had been put down, insisting he had instead been re-housed for health reasons. This led to Conservative MP Alan Clark using a parliamentary question to ask Mr Blair to outline what ""steps were taken by Cabinet Office staff to establish the state of health of Humphrey the cat, prior to his departure from Downing Street"". In his response, the prime minister explained that he was sent away due to worries about the ""general deterioration in his condition"". Reports from the countryside suggested he had ""responded very well and put on weight"". In a career spanning 13 years, Wilberforce served under four prime ministers from Edward Heath through to Margaret Thatcher. According to informationrevealed by the Home Office in 2005,external, the earliest record of a chief mouser is from 1929 when a penny a day from the petty cash was requested to feed a cat called Peter. Peter was succeeded by two more Peters and a Peta, who caused a rift in No 10 because of her lack of toilet training.

S Korea and Russia spar over airspace 'intrusion',"South Korea said a Russian A-50 early warning and control plane twice violated its airspace (file photo) Russia has strongly denied ever apologising for violating South Korean airspace, as the fall-out from an incident involving warplanes from four countries continues. South Korea's presidential office earlier said a Russian official had expressed ""deep regret"" for Tuesday's aerial intrusion. It says a Russian aircraft twice violated its territorial airspace during a joint exercise with China. But Moscow denies any intrusion. ""We have seen statements in the South Korean media quoting words allegedly said by our acting military attachÃ©,"" a spokesman for Russia's embassy in South Korea said, according to Interfax news agency. ""We have paid attention to these statements. In this connection we can speak for ourselves that there is a lot in them which does not correspond to reality."" South Korean jets fired nearly 400 warning shots and 20 flares on Tuesday near the Russian surveillance plane that both it and Japan said flew near disputed islands in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, that the two countries claim. What are the Dokdo/Takeshima islands? How an Asian trade row could hit electronics supplies S Korea expands air defence zone On Wednesday, South Korea's government said that a Russian official had admitted the violation on Tuesday, saying it was unintended and that Moscow would immediately launch an investigation into the case, which the official blamed on a ""technical glitch"". ""Moscow said if the aircraft flew according to an initially planned route, this incident would not have occurred,"" a spokesman for the presidential Blue House, Yoon Do-han, told reporters. Meanwhile, China has defended the exercise, which was the first ever joint air patrol between it and Russia. Defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian told reporters they ""strictly abided by the relevant regulations of international law and did not enter the airspace of other countries"". Japan also scrambled bombers during Tuesday's incident. The alleged incursion happened over the disputed Dokdo/Takeshima islands, which are occupied by South Korea but also claimed by Japan. South Korea's military said that in total three Russian and two Chinese military aircraft entered the Korea Air Defence Identification Zone (KADIZ) on Tuesday morning. One of those planes - an A-50 Russian surveillance plane - also violated its territorial airspace twice, it said, before leaving. South Korea said its jets fired flares and machine-gun warning shots when the Russian plane intruded. It also deployed F-15 and F-16 planes to intercept it. Russian and Chinese bombers and reconnaissance planes have occasionally entered the zone in recent years, but this is the first incident of its kind between Russia and South Korea. South Korean F-15 jets were sent to intercept the Russian plane Russia's defence ministry denied any airspace violation and said it did not recognise the KADIZ. Russia also accused the South Korean pilots of ""hooliganism in the air"", saying that the patrol had been more than 25km from the Dokdo/Takeshima islands. Lt Gen Kobylash said Russia had complained to South Korea about its crews' ""illegal and dangerous actions"". The government in Tokyo lodged a complaint against both Russia and South Korea. Because it claims sovereignty over the islands, Japan's government said that Russia had violated its airspace. It also said that South Korea's response had been extremely regrettable. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""In light of Japan's stance regarding sovereignty over Takeshima, the South Korean military aircraft's having carried out warning shots is totally unacceptable and extremely regrettable."" This first ""joint air patrol"" involving Russian and Chinese long-range aircraft in the Asia Pacific region, sends a powerful signal of the developing military relationship between Moscow and Beijing. This still falls short of a formal alliance but their joint exercises are larger and more sophisticated. In turn this is a reflection of the ever closer economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries who, though they still have points of tension, are drawing ever closer together. They broadly share a similar world view, hostile to Western liberal democracy, eager to promote an alternative model, protective of their own national sovereignty, and often willing to ride rough-shod over that of others. This poses a huge challenge for US strategy. The nightmare in Washington is an ever closer relationship between an assertive, but declining Russia, and a rising China, which looks set to overtake the US as a technological and economic power in the years ahead. An air defence identification zone (ADIZ) is an airspace which a country seeks to monitor on grounds of national security. Overseas aircraft should identify themselves before entering an air defence zone. An ADIZ usually extends well beyond national airspace to allow for sufficient warning of a potential threat. But ADIZs are not governed by international law and the self-defined boundaries can be disputed or overlap with other countries' claims, which may lead to violations. This is the case in the East China Sea region, where South Korea, China and Japan all have overlapping ADIZs. In this case, South Korea says Russia went beyond its ADIZ and into the territorial airspace surrounding the islands. But other nations do not recognise South Korea's claim of sovereignty.

Brexit and beyond: What's in the new PM's in-tray?,"This video can not be played As in-trays go, it's a full one Brexit is THE priority of Boris Johnson's government. The new prime minister has just 99 days until the UK leaves the EU, andhe faces an uphill task to secure a new deal. But it's not the only demand on Mr Johnson's time. One criticism of Theresa May's time in Number 10 is that other important decisions that affected the future of the UK were put on hold because Brexit became all-consuming. But these nagging priorities have not gone away. So what are they? After years of the government rejecting complaints about funding shortages for England's schools, Boris Johnson is now promising to spend more. Like a constant stone in the shoe, worries about school budgets have hobbled the May government's efforts in education - and the incoming prime minister will be told this needs to be tackled as a priority. But how much will he offer? And will it be enough to satisfy head teachers who have been radicalised into unlikely activists over cash shortages? Mr Johnson's promise to increase per-pupil funding to at least Â£5,000 per year would mean an extra Â£50m - and in terms of the overall budget would be, to use one of his own phrases, only ""chickenfeed"". Other campaign comments suggested reversing the decline in budgets - which would mean closer to Â£5bn. So schools will be waiting to see how much bristle is on the new broom. Investing in education is a key part of Mr Johnson's post-Brexit pitch - and universities will be seen as important to research, boosting infrastructure and creating an economy of bright ideas. They will also be seen as an important international export opportunity and source of soft power - and all the signs are that a Johnson administration will see overseas students as a financial asset rather than an immigration problem. The other big thorny question in the education in-tray will be whether to cut tuition fees to Â£7,500, as announced by a review requested by Theresa May. Universities will campaign against it, but with the prospect of an election never far away, could he really announce a U-turn on lowering fees, taking thousands off student debt? Schools 'desperately need' cash injection, MPs say Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap The challenge facing Mr Johnson in terms of both health and care in England - responsibility for both is devolved - can be summed up in one word: money. The NHS has been promised (relatively-speaking) lots of it - an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023. But it is how it is spent that matters. Social care - the system administered by councils to support the elderly and disabled - is in desperate need of more. But it is unclear where it will come from. Unlike Jeremy Hunt, who drew on his experience as health secretary, Boris Johnson had relatively little to say about the NHS during the leadership campaign. Perhaps his most revealing remarks came at a private garden party for Conservative party members. He talked about the NHS being the ""crowning glory"" of the country, but that in return for the cash injection, reform and greater productivity were needed. Many in the health service will scoff at this - a 2012 restructure is still fresh in the memory, and the NHS is already considered one of the most efficient health systems in the world. Finding a solution to the social care crisis is, after Brexit, perhaps the most difficult conundrum. Tales of frail and vulnerable people going without support are appearing more regularly. But the Tories - and Labour before them - have talked endlessly about what to do without actually doing it. Mr Johnson is, it is understood, sympathetic to the idea of over 40s paying what is effectively an extra tax to fund care for their old age. Theresa May unveils Â£20bn boost for NHS 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble For the past 20 years, the Home Office has struggled to come up with a modern migration system that satisfies everyone. A failure to reach a national consensus over migration was a driving factor behind many votes to leave the EU. Yet Boris Johnson could not be more different to Theresa May on immigration. As mayor of London, he witnessed first-hand the role migration played in boosting the capital's growth. He is so liberal on the issue that he has repeatedlyfloated an amnesty for migrants who arrived in the UK illegally,external. His instincts therefore chime with those of Sajid Javid who, as home secretary, disowned the phrase ""hostile environment"" and effectively abandoned his party's never-achieved net migration target. But the challenge remains massive. The Home Office is still dealing with the disaster of Windrush generation deportations - while seeking to win the trust of EU citizens worried about their future in a country they have made home. On top of that, it needs to devise a post-Brexit immigration system that many experts warn it is neither ready nor able to deliver. Draft plans published last yearpropose both scrapping a cap on skilled workers and no restriction on unskilled workers coming for up to a year. But what happens if the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal? Many experts predict Brussels will demand preferential access to the UK for its citizens in return for a trade deal. Reality Check: How has immigration changed since the referendum? Post-Brexit immigration system unveiled As Mr Johnson steps into Number 10, the cloud of uncertainty hovering over High Speed 2 (HS2) gets a little thicker. During the leadership campaign he said he wouldn't scrap plans for the new rail line linking London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. But he did express ""anxieties about the business case"". Then, last weekend, came reports the project's Â£56bn budgetcould balloon to as much as Â£85bn. Boris Johnson has already asked a former Chairman of HS2, to look at the scheme. Significant alterations would not be straightforward. However, it feels like the new prime minister will want to make his mark. Another project known as Northern Powerhouse Rail, which would see new and better rail lines linking cities in the north of England, got a clearer backing from Mr Johnson. And thenthere is Heathrow. Boris Johnson once promised to lie-down in front of the bulldozers to stop a third runway being built at the airport. However his opposition has become muted. Mr Johnson, I'm told, will not try to scupper the scheme. Perhaps more immediate than big infrastructure projects is the transport everyday: how to sort the UK's charging infrastructure so more people buy electric cars; what reforms are needed to improve the railways. A government-commissioned review will report this autumn. HS2- High-speed line cost 'could rise by Â£30bn' What do we know about HS2? Not surprisingly, the answer to many of these pressing demands is more money... Mr Johnson has his hands on three big policy levers almost immediately that could, in combination, reshape the economy. Firstly, our trading stance should change materially as a result of his Brexit approach. It detaches our total integration with the European economy, and appears to involve a closer relationship economically with the United States. If by 31 October he carries through his promise to leave, even without a deal, that change could be rather abrupt. Second, the approach on the public finances is about to change too. Tax, spending and borrowing plans - known as fiscal policy - will change. One former cabinet minister wooed by the Johnson team said the strategy was ""spend, spend, spend"". The tax cuts and spending pledges sprayed around the Conservative leadership campaign amounted to more than Â£30bn a year. In essence this dispenses with the idea of running a surplus. As spending will be higher, and taxes cut, planned deficits will rise. There is room for this, and interest rates paid on our national debts are still at historic lows. The risk of course is that a no-deal Brexit in combination with higher borrowing could cause problems. The Treasury will prepare a stimulus plan to help rescue impacted manufacturers and farmers, and perhaps consumers too. But this brings us on to the third lever - the Bank of England. Although traditionally independent on setting interest rates, or monetary policy, it is Mr Johnson's good fortune that his government will advise the Queen on the appointment of the bank's next governor, to replace Mark Carney. Some economists rather close to the new PM are in the mix. Inflation is on target. Rates could be cut further, and money created to flood the economy in the event of no deal. The bank could, as it has done repeatedly since the crisis, buy up the increased flow of government borrowing. There are other risks here. Mr Johnson's party has long decried the Opposition for its belief in a ""magic money tree"" - with the hurdles ahead he may well need to find his own smaller version - a magic money shrub.

What Boris Johnson has said about other countries,"The UK has a new prime minister, and while Boris Johnson's biggest challenge is delivering Brexit, he will soon find plenty more on his agenda. World leaders will be eagerly studying Mr Johnson's previous opinions and positions to try to decide how he might act as prime minister. Luckily, his two years as foreign secretary, decades of newspaper and magazine columns, and a wealth of interviews will provide them with plenty of material. The special relationship just got more special. Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are - if not best buddies, then keen admirers of one another. It hasn't always been the case. In 2015, when Mr Trump was running for president, he falsely stated that parts of London were no-go areas. In response, Mr Johnson - then mayor of London - accused him of a ""quite stupefying ignorance that makes him frankly unfit to hold the office of president of the United States"". It's a position Mr Johnson himself once joked he could run for, as he was born in New York. Expect more of this His tone since Mr Trump became president has been much warmer (for the most part) and last month Mr Johnson suggested Britain could learn a lot from the US president. ""Actually, he has many, many good qualities,"" Mr Johnson said. ""This is a guy who, when all is said and done, has got the US economy motoring at about 3.6% growth."" (In fact, it is currently 3.1%). ""He's cut regulation, cut taxes in a way that has driven growth. My point is that... we Conservatives have failed, for too long, to talk up the agenda of free market economics."" Mr Trump has saidhe thinks Mr Johnson will do an ""excellent"" job as prime minister,external. The friendly tone bodes well for any hopes Mr Johnson has of striking a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. We're now in a situation where the leader of one country - Mr Johnson - has written a rude award-winning poem about the leader of another - Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr Johnson's 2016 limerick - which included an obscene reference to a goat and a creative new word to rhyme with ""Ankara"" - won him Â£1,000. He and Mr Erdogan met months later, and the limerick was apparently not mentioned. Mr Johnson has also stated how much he likes his ""very well-functioning Turkish washing machine"". What's Boris Johnson's track record? Mr Johnson once appeared to express concern at the prospect of Turkey and its 80 million citizens joining the European Union. Before the EU referendum in June 2016, he indicated - in a letter signed with two other pro-Brexit figures - thatanyone who did not want Turkey in the EU should vote to leave the bloc. But he did not go as far as saying that Turkey should not join the EU. Mr Johnson has family ties to Turkey -his great-grandfather Ali Kemal was a former Turkish minister of the interior, who was killed by a mob. Elders in Mr Johnson's ancestral regionhave already vowed to ""sacrifice many sheep in Boris' honour"",external. ""I made the classic, classic mistake of thinking it was possible to have a 'reset' with Russia"" Last month,Mr Johnson said too much power in Russia had been placed in the hands of ""oligarchs and cronies"",externaland that Vladimir Putin's recent comment that liberalism was dead was ""tremendous tripe"". But might we see moves by Mr Johnson to forge closer ties with the Kremlin as prime minister? Once bitten, twice shy, perhaps. He was the first British foreign minister to visit Russia in five years, but said after leaving his role that he had been too naive about what he could achieve. ""When I became foreign secretary I thought there was no objective reason why we should be quite so hostile to Russia,"" he said. ""Yes, there were lots of reasons to be suspicious, lots of reasons to be wary. But I thought it was possible - I made the classic, classic mistake of thinking it was possible to have a 'reset' with Russia."" ""For 10 years,""he wrote in a newspaper column in 2006,external, ""we in the Tory party have become used to Papua New Guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing."" He said he was happy to ""add Papua New Guinea to my global itinerary of apology"", but has not yet visited. ""How far removed and ill-informed can Mr Johnson be from the reality of the situation in modern-day Papua New Guinea?"" the country's high commissioner, Jean L Kekedo, said at the time. Mr Johnson has made all the right noises when it comes to charming a country with which it conducts more than $15bn ($18bn) of trade a year - a figure the UK hopes to increase after Brexit. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi won re-election in May, Mr Johnson was full of praise: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At a hustings in Bedfordshire last week, he indicated growing trade ties with India would be a priority. ""Trade with China has gone up by about 45% in the last 10 years,""the Hindustan Times reported him as saying,external. ""In India, volumes have remained almost static. We need to do far more. India is a massive natural market for the UK."" Writing in the Daily Telegraph in 2002,,externalbefore then-PM Tony Blair visited Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Johnson said: ""No doubt the AK47s will fall silent, and the pangas will stop their hacking of human flesh, and the tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles to see the big white chief touch down in his big white British taxpayer-funded bird."" His comments, criticised as racist, drew outrage, and he apologised when he ran for mayor of London six years later. Apart from Brexit, tension over Iran is probably the most pressing diplomatic issue sitting in Mr Johnson's in-tray,as our diplomatic correspondent points out. A deal signed with Iran to restrict its nuclear activity is teetering. The US has reimposed sanctions; Iran is enriching more and more uranium; and the UK is sending more warships to the Gulf amid fears Iran may seize its tankers. Can the Iran nuclear deal be saved? The new prime minister does not back an aggressive confrontation, an option Mr Trump has not ruled out. ""If you say that going to war with Iran now represents a sensible option for us in the West, I just don't believe it is,"" he said at a leadership debate last week. ""Diplomacy must be the best way forward. ""If you were to ask me... if I were to be prime minister now, would I be supporting military action against Iran, then the answer is no."" Buthe has indicated he is ready to reimpose sanctions on Iran,externalif it continues to enrich uranium at a rate not permitted under the nuclear deal. Whoever is in the role of British prime minister has to perform a delicate balancing act when it comes to Saudi Arabia. It is one of the UK's closest allies, or at least one of its most important arms buyers. But Saudi Arabia is also accused of rights abuses and ofpossibly committing war crimes in its war in Yemen. So what has Mr Johnson said about Saudi Arabia? As foreign secretary, he accused it (and Iran) of fighting proxy wars across the region, adding that there was not strong enough leadership in those countries. ""There are politicians who are twisting and abusing religion and different strains of the same religion in order to further their own political objectives,"" he said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You have these proxy wars being fought the whole time"" Downing Street then said that this was only his personal view, and did not represent the government's position. But he has also appeared happy to deal with Riyadh:emails that emerged last month, seen by the Guardian and the Independent,,externalshowed Mr Johnson was ""content"" to sell bomb parts to Saudi Arabia that were likely to be deployed in Yemen. His comments after recent protests in Hong Kong echoed those of the British government. He said he backed ""every inch of the way"" demonstrators who were angry about a new extradition law that would have seen people in Hong Kong sent to China's mainland. But he also emphasised how important it was for Beijing to respect the ""one country, two systems"" approach to Hong Kong that granted it a degree of autonomy from the mainland after it stopped being a British colony.

The MP closed his office in April for several weeks while he moved to Courtwood House Mr Arnold, who describes himself as a blogger and a digital marketing professional, rose to prominence in 2014 when he set up a social media account called Britain Furst which was intended to troll the right-wing political group Britain First. The following year he set up a satirical news website and posted fake news articles mocking tabloid titles. He told BBC 5 Live that he had been working for Mr O'Mara for eight weeks but had known him ""for absolutely years"". When asked about the method of his resignation, he said: ""I appreciate from the outside it looks like a really horrible thing to do."" But he added: ""We're left with a situation where there's people in Sheffield Hallam who are not being represented. ""There are people who are waiting on their immigration status, there are people who are not getting houses, there are people having their benefits stopped and all these things stopped just because he's not prepared to do his job properly. ""Yes it was a ridiculous statement but it's the one thing I think might motivate change."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Following his resignation, Mr Arnold took to his own account and tweeted: ""Well, I can't sleep. ""Did I do the right thing? Did I go the right way about it? Did I act in anger and frustration? ""I expect I'll come to learn these things soon."" Mr O'Mara, who now sits as an independent, told the BBC earlier this month that he intended to stand for election again despite criticism of his voting record. ""I am going nowhere, and I'm here for you whether you want me here for you or not."" he said at the time. ""With the support of those around me and with renewed vigour, I'm standing again next time."" In April Mr O'Maraclosed his office while he recruited new parliamentary staff and moved buildings, leaving his constituents unable to contact him for several weeks.

Russia 'regrets' S Korea airspace violation,"South Korea said a Russian A-50 early warning and control plane twice violated its airspace (file photo) Russia has strongly denied ever apologising for violating South Korean airspace, as the fall-out from an incident involving warplanes from four countries continues. South Korea's presidential office earlier said a Russian official had expressed ""deep regret"" for Tuesday's aerial intrusion. It says a Russian aircraft twice violated its territorial airspace during a joint exercise with China. But Moscow denies any intrusion. ""We have seen statements in the South Korean media quoting words allegedly said by our acting military attachÃ©,"" a spokesman for Russia's embassy in South Korea said, according to Interfax news agency. ""We have paid attention to these statements. In this connection we can speak for ourselves that there is a lot in them which does not correspond to reality."" South Korean jets fired nearly 400 warning shots and 20 flares on Tuesday near the Russian surveillance plane that both it and Japan said flew near disputed islands in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, that the two countries claim. What are the Dokdo/Takeshima islands? How an Asian trade row could hit electronics supplies S Korea expands air defence zone On Wednesday, South Korea's government said that a Russian official had admitted the violation on Tuesday, saying it was unintended and that Moscow would immediately launch an investigation into the case, which the official blamed on a ""technical glitch"". ""Moscow said if the aircraft flew according to an initially planned route, this incident would not have occurred,"" a spokesman for the presidential Blue House, Yoon Do-han, told reporters. Meanwhile, China has defended the exercise, which was the first ever joint air patrol between it and Russia. Defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian told reporters they ""strictly abided by the relevant regulations of international law and did not enter the airspace of other countries"". Japan also scrambled bombers during Tuesday's incident. The alleged incursion happened over the disputed Dokdo/Takeshima islands, which are occupied by South Korea but also claimed by Japan. South Korea's military said that in total three Russian and two Chinese military aircraft entered the Korea Air Defence Identification Zone (KADIZ) on Tuesday morning. One of those planes - an A-50 Russian surveillance plane - also violated its territorial airspace twice, it said, before leaving. South Korea said its jets fired flares and machine-gun warning shots when the Russian plane intruded. It also deployed F-15 and F-16 planes to intercept it. Russian and Chinese bombers and reconnaissance planes have occasionally entered the zone in recent years, but this is the first incident of its kind between Russia and South Korea. South Korean F-15 jets were sent to intercept the Russian plane Russia's defence ministry denied any airspace violation and said it did not recognise the KADIZ. Russia also accused the South Korean pilots of ""hooliganism in the air"", saying that the patrol had been more than 25km from the Dokdo/Takeshima islands. Lt Gen Kobylash said Russia had complained to South Korea about its crews' ""illegal and dangerous actions"". The government in Tokyo lodged a complaint against both Russia and South Korea. Because it claims sovereignty over the islands, Japan's government said that Russia had violated its airspace. It also said that South Korea's response had been extremely regrettable. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""In light of Japan's stance regarding sovereignty over Takeshima, the South Korean military aircraft's having carried out warning shots is totally unacceptable and extremely regrettable."" This first ""joint air patrol"" involving Russian and Chinese long-range aircraft in the Asia Pacific region, sends a powerful signal of the developing military relationship between Moscow and Beijing. This still falls short of a formal alliance but their joint exercises are larger and more sophisticated. In turn this is a reflection of the ever closer economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries who, though they still have points of tension, are drawing ever closer together. They broadly share a similar world view, hostile to Western liberal democracy, eager to promote an alternative model, protective of their own national sovereignty, and often willing to ride rough-shod over that of others. This poses a huge challenge for US strategy. The nightmare in Washington is an ever closer relationship between an assertive, but declining Russia, and a rising China, which looks set to overtake the US as a technological and economic power in the years ahead. An air defence identification zone (ADIZ) is an airspace which a country seeks to monitor on grounds of national security. Overseas aircraft should identify themselves before entering an air defence zone. An ADIZ usually extends well beyond national airspace to allow for sufficient warning of a potential threat. But ADIZs are not governed by international law and the self-defined boundaries can be disputed or overlap with other countries' claims, which may lead to violations. This is the case in the East China Sea region, where South Korea, China and Japan all have overlapping ADIZs. In this case, South Korea says Russia went beyond its ADIZ and into the territorial airspace surrounding the islands. But other nations do not recognise South Korea's claim of sovereignty.

Russian boxer Dadashev dies after injuries,"Dadashev had won all of his previous 13 fights Russian boxer Maxim Dadashev has died at the age of 28 following injuries suffered in his IBF light-welterweight fight against Subriel Matias. Dadashev wasreportedly,externalunable to walk to the dressing room after his bout was stopped by trainer Buddy McGirt at the end of the 11th round on Friday. He was hospitalised with bleeding on the brain and underwent emergency surgery but failed to recover. The Russian Boxing Federation,externalsays it has opened an investigation. Secretary general Umar Kremlev suggested there was ""some kind of violation"", adding in a statement: ""We lost Maxim Dadashev. He was our young prospect. ""We will fully support his family, including financially. We will complete the investigation into the circumstances surrounding this fight, we need to know the truth about what happened. ""This happens in any sport. I think some human factors intervened, there was some kind of violation."" USA-based Dadashev had won all of his previous 13 fights but had to absorb a barrage of punches from Puerto Rican Matias during the course of the fight in Maryland. McGirt had said afterwards he ""could not convince"" his fighter to stop, but opted to throw in the towel when he saw him ""getting hit with more and more clean shots as the fight went on"". The Russian Boxing Federation said that after the fight, Dadashev's condition worsened and doctors diagnosed a cerebral edema and a ""difficult"" surgery took place, but his heart stopped on Tuesday. Northern Ireland's former world champion Carl Frampton was among those to pay tribute, saying on Twitter: ""Saddened to hear about the passing of Maxim Dadashev. Deepest condolences to his friends and family. RIP."" British boxing promoter Eddie Hearn added: ""So terribly sad to hear the news of the passing of Maxim Dadashev. Rest in peace."" ESPN.com writer Steve Kim, who was ringside at the bout, spoke to BBC World News and said: ""Nobody thought that fight should've been stopped really any earlier than it was. ""McGirt was very much lauded for stopping the fight against the wishes of Dadashev after the 11th round. Unfortunately that was a very physical fight for him against Matias, who was strong and was consistently hitting him with hard shots but never really putting him away and it wasn't until the 11th that he started to bend physically. ""I've written extensively in the past, excoriated trainers for being braver than their fighters. I'll be honest I don't think you can second guess or even question the decision made from that corner on the night. ""The referee was Kenny Chevalier, a veteran referee, he's done many championship fights and he's quite prominent in that part of our country. ""Like with McGirt I don't think there was a dereliction of duty."" Is Potter the right fit for West Ham?

Is belief enough?,"Boris Johnson's political inheritance has all the makings of a disaster. He has no Commons majority. There is no mandate from the general public - remember this election has only been decided by Tory members. There are policy problems everywhere in sight - whether that's trying to solve the conundrums of Brexit with a reluctant EU and a divided party or trying to address some of the deep-seated problems at home. And just as among his fans there is genuine excitement that he will, at last, be in Number 10, there is scepticism and disbelief from the opposition parties, and double-sided concerns in his own party. Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM There is anxiety on one wing of the Tory party that he will pursue a rapid Brexit and cravenly, hang the consequences of what might be at risk. But in darker moments on the right of the Tory Party, there are suspicions that underneath the Brexit bluff there's a metropolitan wet, who could betray them. Their man for now, but a prime minister who needs to be strapped into place. For those who know him best though, the point about Boris Johnson is that he, frustratingly even to them, can be, maybe even wants to be more than one thing at the same time. They hope he could be a canvas on which others project their hopes and aspirations. A leader who can use his panache to manage all of those competing interests. A leader who will not be bowed by upsetting one side or another. An incoming prime minister who, in dramatic contrast to Theresa May, can communicate his will to the public and his party, his conviction to get this done. His plans for the Cabinet, to appoint a record number of women, a record number of ethnic minority MPs, and to promote the next generation, a contrast to the image held by some Conservatives who see him as the one to recreate perceived glories of the past. And his fans are often willing to accept whatever he actually says or does because the mistakes, or promises come from his lips. For them perhaps, the belief is in him, beyond actions he takes. Belief is a powerful commodity but it doesn't preserve a government on its own. For many of Mr Johnson's critics the jokes are old already. For those worried about Brexit, a rousing speech just doesn't solve it. To govern is not to make people feel good, it is to choose. And as soon as the decisions actually get made, Mr Johnson might find that like Theresa May he finds himself in stalemate. So sprinkle salt on vows made now about going to the country to ask all of us for his own mandate. Willing success is not the same as delivering it. Ultimately, Boris Johnson will have more than his party to convince.  Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM Boris Johnson: What's his track record?

Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has three priorities, to deliver Brexit, unite the country and beat Jeremy Corbyn Boris Johnson has been elected new Conservative leader in a ballot of party members and will become the next UK prime minister. He beat Jeremy Hunt comfortably, winning 92,153 votes to his rival's 46,656. The former London mayor takes over from Theresa May on Wednesday. In his victory speech, Mr Johnson promised he would ""deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn"". Speaking at the Queen Elizabeth II centre in London, he said: ""We are going to energise the country. ""We are going to get Brexit done on 31 October and take advantage of all the opportunities it will bring with a new spirit of can do. ""We are once again going to believe in ourselves, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self doubt and negativity."" Watch the moment the result was revealed Boris Johnson's battles What does the prime minister actually do? And what can he expect on his first day? Mr Johnson thanked his predecessor, saying it had been ""a privilege to serve in her cabinet"". He was Mrs May's foreign secretary until resigning over Brexit. The outgoing PM - who is standing down after a revolt by Conservative MPs over her Brexit policy - congratulated her successor, promising him her ""full support from the backbenches"".

He said he had ""total, unshakeable confidence in our country"" and that was a valuable quality at such a challenging time. Mr Hunt added: ""It was always going to be uphill for us because I was someone who voted Remain and I think lots of party members felt that this was a moment when you just had to have someone who voted for Brexit in the referendum. ""In retrospect, that was a hurdle we were never able to overcome."" Donald Trump told an event in Washington ""a really good man is going to be the prime minister of the UK now,"" and Mr Johnson would ""get it done"", referring to Brexit. The president added: ""They call him Britain Trump. That's a good thing."" Almost 160,000 Conservative members were eligible to vote in the contest and turnout was 87.4%. Mr Johnson's share of the vote - 66.4% - was slightly lower than that garnered by David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership election (67.6%). The former London mayor and ex-foreign secretary spoke to staff at Conservative Party HQ after his victory was announced. He was then given a rousing reception by Tory MPs at a meeting in Parliament, where he urged them to ""unite, unite, unite and win"". The BBC's Nick Eardley, who was outside the room, said such gatherings had been gloomy and downbeat for many months, but this one was full of laughter. One MP told our correspondent: ""The BoJo show is up and running."" Another said: ""The cloud has been lifted."" Mr Johnson will begin announcing his new cabinet on Wednesday, but it has already been confirmed that Mark Spencer, MP for Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, will become chief whip - the person responsible for enforcing party discipline in the Commons. A number of senior figures have already said they will not serve under Mr Johnson, though, citing their opposition to his stance on Brexit. He has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal exit will happen if a new agreement cannot be reached by then. Education Minister Anne Miltontweeted her resignation,externaljust half an hour before the leadership result was due to be revealed, insisting the UK ""must leave the EU in a responsible manner"". And International Development Secretary Rory Stewart confirmed he would be returning to the backbenches, where he would be spending more time ""serving Cumbria"" and ""walking"".

David Gauke, another vocal opponent of a no-deal Brexit,announced he was resigning,externalas justice secretary. They join the likes of Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan and Culture Minister Margot James who have all said they disagree too strongly with Mr Johnson's Brexit strategy to work closely with him. Boris Johnson will become our next prime minister. A sentence that might thrill you. A sentence that might horrify you. A sentence that 12 months ago even his most die-hard fans would have found hard to believe. But it's not a sentence, unusually maybe for politics, that won't bother you either way. Because whatever you think of Boris Johnson, he is a politician that is hard to ignore. With a personality, and perhaps an ego, of a scale that few of his colleagues can match. This is the man who even as a child wanted to be ""world king"". Now, he is the Tory king, and the Brexiteers are the court. Read Laura's blog here The EU Commission's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he was looking forward to working with Mr Johnson ""to facilitate the ratification of the withdrawal agreement and achieve an orderly Brexit"". The new Tory leader has previously said the agreement Mrs May reached with the EU was ""dead"", having been rejected three times by MPs. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit co-ordinator, said the parliament would hold an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday in response to Mr Johnson's election. What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? What will he mean for Northern Ireland? Watch his victory speech in full Jeremy Corbyn reacted to the result by tweeting that Mr Johnson had ""won the support of fewer than 100,000 unrepresentative Conservative Party members"". ""The people of our country should decide who becomes the prime minister in a general election,"" he added. Speaking to the BBC later, Mr Corbyn said Labour planned to table a motion of no confidence in Mr Johnson. Asked when that would be, he replied: ""It will be an interesting surprise for you all."" Wednesday 12:00 BST onwards:Theresa May takes part in her last Prime Minister's Questions. After lunch she will make a short farewell speech outside No. 10 before travelling to see the Queen to tender her resignation. Boris Johnson will then arrive for an audience at Buckingham Palace where he will be invited to form a government. After that he will make a speech in Downing Street before entering the building for the first time as prime minister. Later, he will begin announcing his most senior cabinet appointments, such as chancellor, home secretary and foreign secretary, and will make and take his first calls from other world leaders. Thursday:Mr Johnson is expected to make a statement to Parliament about his Brexit strategy and take questions from MPs. Parliament will break up for its summer recess later. The new PM will also continue announcing his new cabinet. Boris Johnson's family - father Stanley, sister Rachel and fellow Tory MP Jo - attended the announcement This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Boris Johnson needs to think âa bit more carefullyâ about his priorities Newly-elected Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Mr Johnson had ""shown time and time again that he isn't fit to be the prime minister of our country"". First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Johnson, but said she had ""profound concerns"" about him becoming prime minister. The new leader also received congratulations from Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose support has kept the Conservatives in government since the 2017 general election. She said the pact - known as a confidence and supply agreement - continued and would be reviewed over the coming weeks ""to explore the policy priorities of both parties"". Leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson, who backed Mr Hunt in the campaign, also sent her congratulations, adding that the new PM had ""an enormous task ahead of him"". In the often divisive Brexit world of ""them and us"" it's easy to forget that, beyond Brexit, EU leaders still see the UK as a close partner and ally. Today's messages of congratulation to Boris Johnson from across Europe were a timely reminder. Whatever happens with Brexit, France, Germany, Poland et al still very much hope to work closely with the UK on international issues like Russia sanctions, Iran, and human rights protection. But EU leaders' welcoming tone does not signal a willingness to accept whatever Prime Minister Johnson might demand in terms of changes to the Brexit deal. He's right when he says a no-deal Brexit is bad for Brussels, but he overestimates EU wiggle room. Amendments will only be forthcoming if EU leaders deem them workable and are convinced the new prime minister commands a majority in Parliament to get an agreement through once and for all.

Boris Johnson to form government as UK's new PM,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""You achieve nothing alone and so my final words are of sincere thanks"" Theresa May has delivered a farewell speech in Downing Street before tendering her resignation to the Queen. She wished new Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his government well, adding: ""Their successes will be our country's successes."" Earlier, Mrs May faced MPs' questions for the final time and looked visibly emotional as she left to applause. Mr Johnson will speak outside No 10 too, before announcing several senior cabinet appointments. He is expected to use the opportunity to increase the number of women in full cabinet positions and boost the representation of ethnic minorities. During his journey to Buckingham Palace to accept the Queen's invitation to form a government, Mr Johnson's car was briefly held up by protesters from Greenpeace, who formed a human chain across The Mall. LIVE: Latest updates as Johnson replaces May as PM Boris Johnson's battles What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Bouquets and brickbats: May's final PMQs Mrs May gave her final speech in Downing Street - her husband Philip alongside her - before heading to Buckingham Palace. She said serving as prime minister had been ""the greatest honour"" and thanked all those who had worked with her. ""This is a country of aspiration and opportunity, and I hope that every young girl who has seen a woman prime minister now knows there are no limits to what she can achieve."" Mr May was briefly interrupted by a protester shouting ""Stop Brexit!"" but responded by saying: ""I think the answer to that is - I think not."" Boris Johnson arrived at Buckingham Palace once Theresa May had resigned Climate protesters formed a chain in front of Mr Johnson's car A short time earlier, at her final PMQs, Mrs May said she would continue as a constituency MP and was ""looking forward to asking the questions"" in future. She said she was happy to hand over to a successor committed to delivering Brexit and creating ""a bright future for this country"". A number of MPs took the opportunity to praise her commitment to office and her achievements on issues like modern slavery, mental health and getting more women into politics. May's political career in three minutes... And six charts Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn acknowledged Mrs May's ""respect for public service"", but criticised her record on the economy, homelessness and Brexit. He asked whether she would consider joining him ""in opposing the reckless plans of her successor"". She, in reply, listed what she felt were her successes, including school improvements, more employment and greater home ownership. ""At its heart, politics isn't about exchanges across these despatch boxes, nor about eloquent speeches or media headlines,"" she said. ""It is about the difference we make every day to the lives of people up and down this country."" In a parting shot at Mr Corbyn, she added: ""As a party leader who has accepted when her time was up, perhaps the time is now for him to do the same."" This video can not be played As she left the chamber for the last time as prime minister, Theresa May was cheered by members across the House Former London mayor Mr Johnson won a decisive victory over Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in a ballot of Tory members - gaining a 66.4% total share of the vote. Conversations are said to be ""ongoing"" between Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson about the foreign secretary's next role. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says Mr Johnson's choice of his top team is critical in his efforts to bring the warring factions of his party together. Mr Johnson is resolute that his leadership rival should not stay on at the Foreign Office, but Mr Hunt is firm that he won't accept anything less than his current role - or becoming home secretary, chancellor or deputy prime minister - and considers other moves a demotion. Our political editor says it is a risky decision for the new PM - forcing Mr Hunt out would be a bad move in terms of uniting the party, but giving in to his refusal to budge is a challenge to his authority. This video can not be played Boris Johnson's victory speech Another key decision Mr Johnson faces is who will take over at the Treasury as chancellor. The incumbent,Philip Hammond, handed in his resignation to,externalMrs May, saying the new PM should be free to choose someone ""fully aligned"" with his views on Brexit. Those said to be in the frame to replace him include current Home Secretary Sajid Javid, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Liz Truss, Mr Hammond's deputy at the Treasury. Meanwhile, Dominic Cummings, the former chief of the Vote Leave campaign, is expected to become a senior adviser to the new prime minister. Allow Twitter content?

David Frost, a former ambassador and senior official at the Foreign Office, will be appointed as a key negotiator on Brexit. After his victory, Mr Johnson said his priorities were to deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Former Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his congratulations,externalto the new PM and wished him well for the ""great privilege and responsibility"" to come. Boris Johnson's political inheritance has all the makings of a disaster. He has no Commons majority. There is no mandate from the general public - remember this election has only been decided by Tory members. There are policy problems everywhere in sight, whether that's trying to solve the conundrums of Brexit with a reluctant EU and a divided party, or trying to address deep-seated problems at home. And just as among his fans there is genuine excitement that he will, at last, be in Number 10, there is scepticism and disbelief from the opposition parties, and double-sided concerns in his own party. Read Laura's full analysis here Sweeping changes are expected in the wider cabinet, with a number of other ministers, including Justice Secretary David Gauke and Development Secretary Rory Stewart, having said they cannot serve under Mr Johnson due to his determination to leave the EU, with or without a deal, on 31 October. Those tipped for promotion include Employment Minister Alok Sharma and Local Government Minister Rishi Sunak. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Is belief enough to sustain Johnson as PM? What does a prime minister actually do? A look at Mr Johnson's in-tray First job? Impress the cat Priti Patel could return to the cabinet less than two years after resigning as international development secretary over a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ms Patel said she did not want to ""speculate"" on a potential cabinet role, but added it was ""important that we have a government that reflects modern Britain"". And former Sports Minister Tracey Crouch, who quit last year in a dispute with the Treasury over fixed-odds betting terminals, could also be in line for a recall. A source close to Mr Johnson said: ""Boris will build a cabinet showcasing all the talents within the party that truly reflect modern Britain."" Meanwhile, Tory donor Sir Mick Davis has resigned as chief executive of the Conservative Party, saying the new leader should be able to choose his own team. In a letter, he urged fellow donors to get behind Boris Johnson, adding the new PM ""can only be effective if a strong and unified party stands behind him"". Mr Johnson will inherit a wafer-thin parliamentary majority and, like his predecessor, will continue to rely on the support of the Democratic Unionists of Northern Ireland to govern. Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have said they will oppose him over Brexit, although they have stopped short of threatening an immediate vote of no confidence. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said ""discussions are ongoing"" between Labour and potential Tory rebels to find out who might support such a vote. He told Radio 4's Today programme it was ""the nuclear option"" which should be ""used carefully"". Priti Patel (left) and Liz Truss (right) are among those tipped for new jobs This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""I know Nigel will work well with Boris"" Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said he isopen to an electoral pact with Mr Johnson- if the new Tory leader is genuine about taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Mr Farage said Mr Johnson would need to call an election if he wanted a no-deal Brexit, in order to ""change the arithmetic"" in the Commons. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who is part of Mr Johnson's transition team, said the incoming PM didn't want to see an early election. ""There is no way that we are going to have any kind of electoral pact with the Brexit Party and Nigel Farage,"" he told the Today programme. What the US makes of Boris Johnson US President Donald Trump, speaking to a right-wing youth organisation in Washington DC, said Mr Johnson and Mr Farage would do ""tremendous things"" together. A political strategist and adviser known for his bullish style, Mr Cummings is a long-time Eurosceptic. In 2004, he led the campaign against a North East regional assembly, and in 2007 went to work for Conservative MP Michael Gove, first in opposition and then while he served as education secretary. In 2015, Mr Cummings was appointed campaign director of Vote Leave and became a key architect of its messages, including ""take back control"" and the controversial ""Â£350m-a-week for the NHS"" pledge. Since the referendum, Mr Cummings has often been outspoken on the Brexit process, describing it in 2018 as having been ""irretrievably botched"" by the May government. Laura Kuenssberg said some Brexiteers would be pleased with his appointment, seeing it as a strong sign of Mr Johnson's commitment to a 31 October exit. However, she said there was a lot of very angry water under the bridge between him and Tory MPs on the ERG wing because he refused to allow many of them to be involved in Vote Leave. Earlier this year,Mr Cummings was found in contempt of Parliamentfor refusing to give evidence to a committee of MPs investigating ""fake news"". In return, he accused the committee of ""spreading errors and lies"".

Johnson's track record?,"Boris Johnson, the UK's new prime minister, was already one of the UK's most recognisable politicians. His high profile - built up as an MP, London mayor and foreign secretary - has often seen his achievements accompanied by controversy. As editor of the Spectator magazine and a Have I Got News For You contestant, Boris Johnson was already well known for his shambolic persona. In 2001, he became an MP,replacing Michael Heseltine,externalin the safe Conservative seat of Henley-on-Thames. Gay rights He was considered more liberal than many Tories. As a journalist, he hadquestioned the repeal of laws banning the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities,external. But as an MP, he changed tack and said the state should not interfere in people's lives. He also voted in favour of civil partnerships. Boris Johnson during one of his Have I Got News For You appearances, in 2004 Mr Johnson continued to attract controversy. In October 2004, then Conservative leader Michael Howardordered him to visit Liverpool to apologise,externalfor a Spectator article accusing its residents of wallowing in ""disproportionate"" grief after Ken Bigley - an engineer from the city - was kidnapped and killed in Iraq. And the following month, he was sacked as shadow arts minister, amid claims he hadmisled Mr Howard about reports of an affair with Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt.,external Political career 7 yearsMP for Henley (2001-2008) 8 yearsMayor of London (2008-2016) 4 yearsMP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (2015- 2 yearsForeign Secretary (2016-2018) Nevertheless, a year later, he was on the rise again - resigning from his Spectator post when new Tory leaderDavid Cameron made him shadow higher education minister,external. However, he continued to write for the Telegraph and had to make another apology - to a whole country - after helinked Papua New Guinea to ""cannibalism and chief-killing"",externalin a column. By 2007, the Henley MP had his sights set on one of the biggest jobs in UK politics. Taking over from Labour's Ken Livingstone in 2008, Boris Johnson remained London mayor until 2016. It is the longest continuous period of public office that he has held. He's often spoken of what he considers to be his biggest achievements during that period: on crime, housing and transport.

Crime The homicide rate in London - which includes murder and manslaughter - fell from 22 per million to 12 per million people during his time as mayor. However, it was also falling during his predecessor's second term. And in the first few years after Mr Johnson took over, knife crime rose by over 15% - although from 2012-13 onwards it started to fall. Mr Johnson had backed the police use of stop-and-search powers to tackle violent crime. And he said he would ensure police numbers would go up despite central government cuts. Home Office figures show police numbers in London rose slightly, from 31,460 to 32,125, between March 2008 and March 2016. Across England and Wales in that period the number of officers fell by 17,603. Housing There was an increase in the number of affordable homes built - 101,525 by the end of March 2016, of which the Greater London Authority contributed to 94,001. This was a rise compared with the two terms of Mr Livingstone, although the definition of affordable housing had changed in 2011 so the figures are not directly comparable. Transport He scrapped the so-called bendy buses- which he said were too big for narrow streets and encouraged fare-dodgers. In their place, he introduced a new version of the popular Routemaster London bus - a move that was criticised as a vanity project. There were complaints about non-opening windows and problems with the hybrid engines. They also cost considerably more than a normal bus. Do Boris Johnson's claims about his record as mayor of London add up? The transport legacy of Boris Johnson in London One of his most famous transport initiatives was the so-called ""Boris Bike"" cycle scheme, introduced in July 2010. Mr Johnson regularly promoted the hire bikes by riding them himself and the number of rentals reached more than 10.3 million during his last year as mayor. However, critics pointed to the Â£11m-a-year cost of keeping the bikes on the road. Others pointed out that plans for a bike hire scheme had been announced while Mr Livingstone had been mayor. Olympics As mayor, Mr Johnson became involved in overseeing arrangements for the 2012 Olympics, planning for which started after they were awarded to London in 2005. One of the most memorable moments was when he got stuck on a zip wire, while celebrating the UK's first gold medal win. The Olympics were widely seen as a success and there were claimsthat they had provided a major economic boost. But there were also questions raised about the Olympics' legacy, including criticism of the conversion of the Olympic Stadium into a football ground. In 2017, an independent review saidthe conversion had cost Â£323m - far more than the original estimate of Â£190m. Garden Bridge The latter part of his time as mayor sawa plan to build a garden bridge over the River Thamesas a memorial to Princess Diana. The pedestrian-only bridge, with trees and plants, which was first suggested by the actress Joanna Lumley in 1998, was to be funded by private and public money. But it was cancelled in 2017, after a review recommended the project be scrapped - Â£53m had already been spent on the project; Â£43m of which came from the public purse. Appointed foreign secretary in 2018 - after Boris Johnson's resignation Was health secretary for a record six years Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? Mr Johnson decided he wanted to return to Parliament before his term as mayor ended, in 2016. He won the seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in 2015. After resuming life as an MP, he declared his opposition to expanding nearby Heathrow airport, saying he would lie in front of the bulldozers. As London mayor, he had promoted an alternative scheme, for an island airport in the Thames estuary,an idea rejected on cost and environmental grounds. But Mr Johnson was noticeably absent when MPs subsequently voted on Heathrow expansion in June 2018, as he was on an official trip to Afghanistan. Mr Johnson had been appointed foreign secretary by the new prime minister, Theresa May, in 2016. He had also run in the Tory leadership campaign that yearbut dramatically pulled outafter Michael Gove's surprise decision to enter the race. The job as foreign secretary was seen as an acknowledgement of his role as a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU. However, there was also some surprise at the choice, with Lib Dem leader Tim Farron saying he would""spend more time apologising to nations he's offended""than working as foreign secretary. And there were the disparaging comments about other countries and their leaders - some of which were made before he got the job. They included a Limerick - which won a Â£1,000 award in 2016 - about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a goat. And he said the Libyan city of Sirte could be the new Dubai if""they... clear the dead bodies away"". Russian expulsions As foreign secretary, Mr Johnson supported a tough line against Russia,with the expulsion of its diplomats after the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal. Twenty-nine countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and EU states, joined the UK, expelling more than 140 Russian diplomats in a co-ordinated move. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran since 2016 Iran But in the case of British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, jailed in Iran, Mr Johnson had to apologise in Parliament. He had said she had been teaching journalists in Iran when she had been detained, contradicting her statement that she had been on holiday at the time. He later clarified that she had in fact been on holiday but has also said he does not believe his remarks made a difference to her plight - a claim rejected by her family. A few days after Mr Johnson made his remarks, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned before an Iranian judge, to face charges of engaging in propaganda against the regime. How Boris Johnson insulted the world Boris Johnson's most controversial foreign insults Saudi Arabia As foreign secretary,he also earned a rebuke from Downing Street, after comments emerged in which he had criticised close ally Saudi Arabia for engaging in proxy wars in the Middle East. Nevertheless, he continued to allow sales of UK arms to Saudi Arabia, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. In 2018, Mr Johnson also faced criticism after writing in the Daily Telegraph thatMuslim women wearing the burka ""looked like letterboxes"". By this stage, though, he had left the government, resigning in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plan. Boris Johnson was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum. He became well known for his attacks on the EU and for advocating the benefits of Brexit. He declared that he was ""pro-having cake and pro-eating it"". But it hadn't always been clear which side he would support. In fact, while mayor of London, he'd spoken of the benefits of being in the single market. And in an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2013,external, weighing up the pros and cons of being in the EU, he had said that leaving would not solve the UK's problems. However, he also made clear he supported plans to ask the British people to decide about EU membership. During the Brexit campaign, he came undersustained criticism from those in favour of Remain, for his claims about the benefits of leaving and what he called ""taking back control"". Â£350m claim Most controversial was a claim about how much money the UK sent to the EU. The Â£350m-a-week figure, which appeared on the side of a bus during the campaign,recently led to an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute him.Critics pointed out at the time that the figure was wrong as it did not take into account the UK's rebate, or indeed money subsequently spent in the UK. For his part, Mr Johnson dismissed warnings that leaving the EU could spark a recession,describing one such study as propaganda. And he has continued to advocate a harder form of Brexit, sharply criticising both the deal that Mrs May agreed and her whole approach to the negotiations with the EU. He described it asleading the UK into the ""status of a colony"", in his resignation letter, in July 2018. Mr Johnson has continued to insist that the UK can and should leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal.

John Pienaar: How did Boris Johnson get here?," by John Pienaar by John Pienaar I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002. After a few minutes of cajoling and gentle persuasion he relented and changed his mind. “OK, I’ll fight you,” said Johnson. “But you’ll have to promise not to break my nose.” I did, of course. Promise, I mean. Not break his nose. I had been recruited to take part in a televised bout of “celebrity boxing”, live on BBC Two. In the end, the British Boxing Board of Control had more sense than I and, for a fleeting moment, Johnson had at the time. The boxing authorities judged that a high-profile fight between two barely trained middle-aged amateurs might be “reckless and irresponsible”. The “fight” was cancelled. Johnson had pulled out by then, in any case. Not through any lack of “bottle”. Everything I have seen, heard or read about the UK’s new leader suggests no great fear of physical or, for that matter, political or social risk. He clearly likes the idea of himself as a bit of a battler, not one to retreat from a scrap. “Man or mouse?” he is fond of saying before some sudden boyish challenge to a friend or colleague - a game of “whiff-whaff” [ping-pong] on the table in his office, or a quick competitive sprint. In an interview with the Daily Mail recently, he gave his favourite quote as: “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.” Nor did I detect then, or since, any conventional instinct to protect his dignity. Just the opposite. We had invited Johnson precisely because he cared so little for that. But he did, I think, feel it might seem a little ridiculous, even for him, to risk his profile in such a way before a live audience of millions, even for charity. Incidentally, much later, as London Mayor, Johnson was said to have demonstrated his martial instincts byphysically battling in a meeting room with David Cameron, like two overgrown schoolboys, for possession of a Treasury note setting out the available funds for transport in London. Afterwards, as Andrew Gimson records in his biography of Johnson, both men claimed victory. We’ll never know the truth. It was, though, another glimpse into the deep rivalry underlying the outwardly friendly relationship between the pair. At an uncertain and unstable time for British politics, for the economy and for the country’s place in the world, Conservative Party members chose a leader who defies almost every norm. Any objective assessment of Johnson’s record, judgement and character throws up one perfectly legitimate doubt after another. Yet his ability to connect with people (though not everyone and not all the time), to make them feel good about themselves and about him, is simply unique in public life. Whether at a feel-good time of national optimism, or, as now, a time of bitter division and much pessimism, it has turned out to be a gift which helped carry him into Downing Street. Boris Johnson’s depth of character may be little trusted by his critics and by quite a few of his supporters too, but when Theresa May stepped down, he managed to make himself the leadership candidate most trusted by the deeply Eurosceptic Tory ""selectorate"". So why Boris Johnson? And who exactly is he? I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002. After a few minutes of cajoling and gentle persuasion he relented and changed his mind. “OK, I’ll fight you,” said Johnson. “But you’ll have to promise not to break my nose.” I did, of course. Promise, I mean. Not break his nose. I had been recruited to take part in a televised bout of “celebrity boxing”, live on BBC Two. In the end, the British Boxing Board of Control had more sense than I and, for a fleeting moment, Johnson had at the time. The boxing authorities judged that a high-profile fight between two barely trained middle-aged amateurs might be “reckless and irresponsible”. The “fight” was cancelled. Johnson had pulled out by then, in any case. Not through any lack of “bottle”. Everything I have seen, heard or read about the UK’s new leader suggests no great fear of physical or, for that matter, political or social risk. He clearly likes the idea of himself as a bit of a battler, not one to retreat from a scrap. “Man or mouse?”, he is fond of saying before some sudden boyish challenge to a friend or colleague - a game of “whiff-whaff” [ping-pong] on the table in his office, or a quick competitive sprint.

So why Boris Johnson? And who exactly is he? The first thing to note is that he is not actually Boris at all, despite the rare distinction in politics of being known universally by that single name. He was born Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson on 19 June 1964. He chose to be called Boris and his family, friends and eventually everyone else have amiably obliged him. For one so stereotypically English, his ancestry is surprisingly varied - a mixture of English Christians, Turkish Muslims and Eastern European Jews. His maternal great-grandfather was an Orthodox Lithuanian rabbi. His paternal great-grandfather was a Turkish political activist, Ali Kemal, who was apparently lynched after falling foul of the nationalists then in power. Boris, Sonia Purnell records in her biography, was the name of a Russian emigre friend of the family. Johnson was born in New York City, and spent his earliest days with father Stanley and mother Charlotte in a home opposite the famous Chelsea Hotel, hangout of many famous rock stars of the time. His father began a master’s degree in agricultural economics, and after what he has reportedly hinted to be an unsuccessful attempt to recruit him as a spy (undergoing “the most intensive training in clandestine techniques known to man”) he worked briefly for the World Bank in Washington DC, before he was sacked. Apparently, being perhaps something of a block off the old chip, he submitted a suggestion for a $100m loan to build three pyramids and a sphinx to help the Egyptian tourist effort. It was an April Fool joke. His employers were not amused.  Leader profiles: Jeremy Corbyn Jo Swinson Nicola Sturgeon Nigel Farage  Back in the UK, Stanley and Charlotte raised a family: a daughter, Rachel, who recently joined the Liberal Democrats before defecting to the then Independent Group as a candidate for the European Parliament (more successful as a journalist than as a politician); Leo who did well in finance, and Jo, who worked in Downing Street as a policy thinker under David Cameron, and became a respected minister under Cameron and Theresa May. The siblings were ferociously competitive. Stanley’s ambition was to raise a journalistic and political dynasty, and he did. Young Boris was at Eton, and the family living in Brussels, when his parents split. He doesn’t like to speak of that time, or its effect on him, but it was painful. Charlotte - a celebrated artist - subsequently suffered a serious mental breakdown and spent nine months as a patient in a psychiatric hospital. So Boris Johnson’s early life cannot be described as easy, or pain-free. His now famous amiable, bumbling persona - a close copy of his father’s - has sometimes been described as a defence mechanism, concealing a sharp brain and a fine but well-disguised instinct for personal advantage. At any rate, after a spell at Ashdown House boarding school, Johnson went to Eton with an academically prestigious King’s Scholarship. He became a contemporary of, among others, David Cameron - and a close friend to then Viscount Althorp (now Earl Spencer), brother to Princess Diana, and Darius Guppy who was later to be jailed for five years for fraud. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, King's Scholar at Eton Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, King's Scholar at Eton At Eton, AB Johnson became  “Boris” - rather posh, very English, somewhat eccentric and the deeply distinctive, deliberately dishevelled character we know now. He was also very clever - “brilliant” according to one teacher - and endowed with what has arguably become a strong sense of entitlement to both make up and play by his own rules. He was a formidable debater, and became adept at deflecting awkward questions with non-committal answers (as any journalist who has interviewed him can testify). The report from his housemaster makes interesting reading now. He wrote of Boris to his father: “I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception - one who should be free of the network of obligations which binds everyone else. Boris is pretty impressive when success can be achieved by pure intelligence, unaccompanied by hard work.” His character - clever, capable of achieving impressive results though always very much on his own terms - was forming. Future opponent Ken Livingstone wrote an attack on public schools while Johnson was a pupil. He wrote a reply in the school newspaper, recounted in Purnell’s biography, dismissing his future adversary’s arguments as “twaddle, utter bunkum, balderdash, tommyrot, piffle and fiddlesticks”. His distinctive vocabulary seemed to be forming too. Below: Boris Johnson during his 1986 term as Oxford Union president, with the Greek politician Melina Mercouri Below: Boris Johnson during his 1986 term as Oxford Union president, with the Greek politician Melina Mercouri He earned a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, with a roll-call of political and journalistic luminaries as contemporaries. Those at Oxford University at the time included David Cameron, William Hague, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt. Labour’s Miliband brothers, David and Ed, as well as Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper were there too. “What a sharp-elbowed thrusting and basically repellent lot we were,” was his own verdict, said, presumably, with amused irony. “Always bragging and shafting each other.

Boris Johnson, it is suggested, has never been much attached to hell-raising, though the Etonian network was undeniably useful in pursuit of his great ambition of becoming president of the Oxford Union - historically, at least, a stepping stone to the office of prime minister. Johnson met his first wife, Allegra Mostyn-Owen, at Oxford - another ambition. But he never attained the goal of a first-class degree in Classics, something friends say still rankles to this day.  He did, though, make connections which became more than useful in what was to be a journalistic and political career of dizzying ups and crashing, if temporary, setbacks. It has always proved hard to keep Boris Johnson down. In his run for the party leadership it was often said - by me among many others - that the only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson was Boris Johnson.

In his run for the party leadership it was often said - by me among many others - that the only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson was Boris Johnson. From the earliest days of his career, he nonetheless seemed determined to try. Boris Johnson the prime minister would, one imagines, hate being subject to the kind of reporting and analysis that Boris Johnson the fledgling journalist made his own particular trademark. As a trainee fresh out of Balliol College, he joined the Times newspaper under the editorship of the near legendary Charlie Wilson - a tough, Glaswegian out of the old school of Fleet Street broadsheet journalism. Johnson was found to have tried too hard to pep up a fairly innocuous story about the discovery of a palace of Edward II on the south bank of the Thames. His historical account was nonsensical, and an accompanying quote entirely made up. He wrote how the king would frolic at the palace with his sidekick Piers Gaveston. Only Gaveston had been executed years before the palace was built, and the made-up quote was attributed to an Oxford academic who was also his godfather, but nonetheless, not surprisingly, complained. Johnson was sacked. It might have been the end of his journalistic - and conceivably any other - career in any profession requiring trust. But it wasn’t. Daily Telegraph editor Max Hastings, who had met Johnson while he was hosting the great and the good at the Oxford Union, gave him a chance to redeem himself and he grabbed it with both hands. Soon, as the paper’s Europe correspondent in Brussels, Johnson made his name as a pioneer on what in 1989 became a new frontier of deeply Eurosceptic reporting. Much of the reporting at the time was done by correspondents who were arguably much more sympathetic to the culture of what was then called the European Economic Community. Johnson’s stories consistently made the front page, pleased readers who held the EEC’s “federalism” and interfering ways  in contempt - some of them, like Iain Duncan Smith, now prominent political supporters of the new regime set for Downing Street - and made his work popular to the point of becoming cult reading. His journalism artfully mixed fact with wild Eurosceptic fiction. There were tales about unlawfully curved bananas, wrongly sized condoms, and one about the European Commission headquarters Berlaymont building being about to be blown up with dynamite because it was found to contain asbestos. Often, the reports made you laugh out loud, which only added to their force. I remember running into him in Strasbourg, during a session of the European Parliament while I was a political reporter with the Independent. He was smirking at a name he’d invented for the leader of the Conservatives in the parliament, Sir Christopher Prout -  “Brussels-Prout”. He has a useful gift of somehow making you laugh even when his jokes are not especially good. But my former Independent colleagues, like other journos covering Europe, were not always so easily amused by their rival from the Telegraph. “He was fundamentally intellectually dishonest, in my view,” David Usborne told Andrew Gimson in an interview for his book. “He was serving his masters in a very skilful way but I never felt he believed... He was a highly intelligent man, much cleverer than I was, he could see all these nuances and subtleties, but he wasn’t conveying them in his writing. It was a cheap thrill - a stunt, and quite a dangerous stunt really.”  As you’d expect, Max Hastings, his then editor, took a slightly indulgent view of his talented protege. He is perhaps rather less tolerant in retrospect. “I don’t think we ever caught him out in anything he deserved to be sacked for, or to be brought home from Brussels,” he told me in an interview for the BBC’s Panorama. “Boris’s relationship with integrity and truth, and with the right moral standards has always been a bit uncertain to put it politely.” As we’ll see, not everyone has been inclined to “put it politely” when it comes to Johnson’s character and record. Max Hastings’ assessment of his former employee is striking. “All human relations are about who makes you feel good… more than any other politician in British life today he’s a genius. He is absolutely terrific at telling people what they want to hear and he does it with wit, with elegance, with style. “He’s got that quality that causes his believers to be prepared to overlook all the things people traditionally ask about. Is he truthful? Is he honest? Is he nice to his wife? None of that stuff matters.” But Hastings has argued for some time that Johnson is unfit for national office,writingof his “moral bankruptcy, rooted in a contempt for truth”. Some, including his biographer Sonia Purnell, have credited Boris Johnson’s Eurosceptic journalism in Brussels with creating the climate which nurtured anti-EEC feeling in the Tory Party and in doing so destroyed John Major’s administration. That, I think, is a bit of a stretch. Major’s government was exhausted after 18 years of Tory government, and battle-weary after the struggle which ended Margaret Thatcher’s premiership in 1990. The Conservatives were tottering in the face of Tony Blair and New Labour’s assault and, vulnerable to the country’s appetite for “change”, were kicked out in the truly crushing general election defeat of 1997. But as the Conservatives finally ran out of time, Boris Johnson was just getting started.

But as the Conservatives finally ran out of time, Boris Johnson was just getting started.  Johnson’s media career bore fruit, just as his efforts to cultivate his celebrity status blossomed, and his political efforts took root. He was a popular turn on the BBC’s Have I Got News For You, and he had quickly advanced to star columnist at the Telegraph, and editor of the Spectator soon afterwards. After an unsuccessful run at the impregnable Welsh Labour stronghold of Clwyd South in 1997, his high media profile helped him pluck the plum candidacy of Henley. He got into Parliament in 2001, succeeding Michael Heseltine, in his time a political super-heavyweight and aspirant premier himself, though obviously less successful in that ambition than Johnson. 2002: Presenting the BBC panel show Have I Got News For You 2002: Presenting the BBC panel show Have I Got News For You For a while, it all seemed to be going almost too well. And it was. Johnson - who was divorced in 1993 and later married the barrister Marina Wheeler - was given a shadow ministerial job by party leader Michael Howard. But he was sacked after lying about an affair with his Spectator colleague Petronella Wyatt. In an interview with the BBC’s Today programme this year, Howard suggested sacking Johnsonmight have been a mistake. But that moment of repentance came when Johnson was very much closer to the premiership he craved than Howard had ever been. At the time of his sacking, he was a mere junior arts spokesman. And it wasn’t Johnson’s only setback. Another had been, if anything, more humiliating. Marina Wheeler, Boris Johnson's second wife Marina Wheeler, Boris Johnson's second wife A leading article appeared in the Spectator in October 2004 after the awful murder of Ken Bigley while a hostage in Iraq. It described the “mawkish sentimentality” of the reaction. Bigley was a Liverpudlian, from a city still raw from the deaths of 96 fans in the Hillsborough football stadium tragedy of 1989. For Howard, a passionate fan of Liverpool Football Club, it was too much, and he ordered Johnson to go to the city to apologise. It became a grim media circus. Not the first to surround Boris Johnson. And not the last. He was constructing a reputation for gaffes and scrapes, but also having a way of somehow surviving them. That knack, as we have seen, has turned out to be very handy. The tabloid flurry over his relationship with Petronella Wyatt wasn’t the only one of its kind. Newspapers have other tales on file. Yet, as Max Hastings told me, moral disapproval never seems to have stuck, or, where it has, to have inflicted permanent political harm. Johnson himself often refused to answer interviewers’ questions about his private life during the Tory leadership campaign. They were not often asked. With Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party, 2006 With Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party, 2006 Go back to his past writings, however, and he has argued for a liberal approach to the private lives of public figures. In a piece for the Telegraph in January 1998, defending the then US President Bill Clinton, he posed the question: “Does anyone think a bunch of uniformly virtuous politicians would make the slightest difference? Of course they wouldn’t… the press wilfully muddles the issue, feeding on public prurience and jealousy.” Highs and lows have come and gone, including his two spells as Conservative Mayor of London. The then Conservative leader, his Eton and Oxford contemporary, David Cameron, was not at first keen on Johnson becoming candidate for City Hall. Would he be a liability? He was certainly a rival attraction. Lord Coe was preferred, but didn’t want the job. Some believe Cameron’s lack of enthusiasm helped convince Johnson to go for it. And the prospect of the Tory Party scoring a huge victory in the capital, against the odds, became attractive in Downing Street. Was his mayoralty a success? Depends who you ask. House building went up. Crime came down. “Boris Bikes” filled the streets. Critics say he inherited Ken Livingstone’s legacy, and that crime came down across the country. In the build-up and aftermath of the 2012 London Olympics, it is reasonable to argue Johnson’s role as a frontman outweighed his actual contribution to delivering the event itself. His leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, played a bigger role in the practicalities. Lord Coe did too. But as a frontman Johnson had no equal. Obviously, he never intended to get stuck half way down a zip-wire near the Olympic site. For someone else, it might have been disastrous. For Johnson it was a comedic triumph. No wonder David Cameron - who always perceived Johnson’s unique potential - described him as a man capable of “defying gravity”. Young and old, left and right, the crowds cheered, and that raises the question: “Who is the real Boris Johnson?” Was it the leader of the metropolitan, multicultural, liberal and Labour-leaning capital? Or is it the darling of the Brexit-loving, deep dyed Conservative, and more socially conservative, party members who have elected him to be theirs and the country’s leader? His critics -  and some of his friends - believe the answer to that question is that Boris Johnson is whoever he needs to be to advance politically. Another, slightly pseudo-psychoanalytical take is that he truly believes everything that he says or writes, at the moment that he says or writes it. That is barely a more flattering view. Yet another view is that Johnson is at heart a “one-nation” Conservative, socially liberal and personally kind (a master at Eton says he never witnessed Johnson uttering an unkind word), and optimistic in a way that is infectious. MPs who were former colleagues at City Hall speak highly of his abilities.Kit Malthouse, who was deputy mayor for policing, said Johnson had succeeded in “tackling poverty, cutting crime - particularly knife crime, building the homes people need and delivering a cleaner, greener city”.James Cleverly, who also worked with Johnson as a London Assembly member, said: “I know he can run a successful executive operation because I was part of the team who did that in London for eight years.” Both initially announced their intention to stand for the Conservative leadership before dropping out and backing Johnson. Before he took office in July, there had been much talk of Johnson being a“chairman of the board”.The idea was that as prime minister he would surround himself with talented people - in much the same way he did as mayor - rather than trying to micromanage. The questions about Boris Johnson's political judgement have been stacked higher by memories of his lead role in the campaign to leave the European Union, which won against all expectations, and later by two years as foreign secretary, his tenure distinguished chiefly by a succession of gaffes and diplomatic banana skins. To be fair, he wrote his rude poem about the president of Turkey and a goat before he became foreign secretary. He had less excuse for obliquely comparing the EU to the ambitions to dominate the continent exemplified by Napoleon and Hitler. His mistake in describing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - then already in custody in Iran - as teaching journalism in the country was more serious. He was simply wrong. The comments had “traumatic effects” for her, her husband later said, and were used to justify a second court case against her.

He didn’t read the brief. The only thing he worked at were the photo opportunities at foreign meetings… quite the most hopelessly irresponsible foreign secretary I’ve ever known from any party.”  For an alternative, vastly more friendly view, you might try Camilla Tominey in the Telegraph. Shehit backat all the “lazy caricatures”, and preferred to remember Johnson’s support as foreign secretary for girls’ education around the globe, as well as his backing for strong sanctions after the poison attack on the Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, which resulted in the expulsion of 100 Russian diplomats by the UK and allies including the US. She also drew attention to his habit of delegating tasks to trusted subordinates. Now, Camilla Tominey was, of course, a colleague of Johnson’s on the Telegraph, where he wrote a regular and highly prized, highly paid column. Ken Clarke is a known critic of Brexit. My guess is you may already be predisposed to agree with one side or the other. Either way, Boris Johnson was chosen to serve as foreign secretary not for his diplomatic skills, but because Theresa May wanted prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet jobs most closely tasked with delivering it. That plan didn’t work out particularly well for her. Brexit ground to a standstill. May resigned, having failed wretchedly to achieve a mission which, in truth, seemed all but impossible from the moment of her disastrous “victory” in the 2017 general election, and Boris Johnson’s rise to replace her is now pencilled into political history. He’ll be hoping it makes easy reading in time to come. Again, we’ll see. The story of Johnson’s role in the Leave campaign has been told too often to need much retelling here. There were the two newspaper columns he wrote, one for leaving and one against. The friends (or former friends) like Roland Rudd, the financial PR man who now chairs the People’s Vote campaign, who told me bitterly how Johnson pledged his devotion to the Remain side shortly before announcing the opposite. Sir Craig Oliver, then director of communications in Downing Street under David Cameron, testifies to a poetic text message from Johnson predicting Brexit would be crushed “like the toad beneath the harrow”, sent moments before he came out for the Leave side. According to who’s telling the tale, it’s damning evidence that Johnson was never a true Brexiteer with some saying that he joined what he hoped would be the losing side (though still the one most useful to his leadership ambitions) or that he was genuinely torn by doubt until the last moment. Does the accusation of dishonesty stick? Detractors point to the dubious slogan plastered on the side of the Leave campaign bus suggesting Brexit would free £350m a week for the NHS, and also the alarming suggestion that millions of Turks were waiting to enter the UK and swamp the health service almost overnight. The charge sheet of false or inflated campaign claims, with which Johnson became associated, is a long one. Of course, Brexiteers are no less vocal in condemning the Remain side’s hair-raising economic prophecies - Project Fear. You will doubtless have your own view. If Boris Johnson feels any regret - and I have never heard anything to suggest that he does - he has kept it to himself. A friend and close associate told me he is proud of what he achieved, and considers that he “owns” Brexit. Another friend, his close adviser at City Hall, Guto Harri (a former BBC colleague) told me: “He has to focus very narrowly on the Conservative grassroots now. But he will know that he will only succeed as prime minister if he broadens his focus and his appeal once again way beyond that. It’s something he did pull off as mayor and I just hope he can do that again.” Johnson may or may not “own” Brexit. He certainly owns the responsibility to deliver it, or to deliver something that works. His leadership will be unlike anything we’ve seen. But the consequences will be no joke. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Jeremy Hunt was a member of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford - this has now been changed. The questions about his political judgement have been stacked higher by memories of his lead role in the campaign to leave the European Union, which won against all expectations, and later by two years as foreign secretary, his tenure distinguished chiefly by a succession of gaffes and diplomatic banana skins. To be fair, he wrote his rude poem about the president of Turkey and a goat before he became foreign secretary. He had less excuse for obliquely comparing the EU to the ambitions to dominate the continent exemplified by Napoleon and Hitler. His mistake in describing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - then already in custody in Iran - as teaching journalism in the country was more serious. He was simply wrong. The comments had “traumatic effects” for her, her husband later said, and were used to justify a second court case against her.

Does a new UK PM mean a new Brexit plan in Brussels?,"In the often-divisive Brexit world of ""them and us"" it's easy to forget that, beyond Brexit, EU leaders still see the UK as a close partner and ally. Their messages of congratulation to Boris Johnson from across Europe on Tuesday - notably from French President Emmanuel Macron - are a timely reminder of that. Whatever happens with Brexit, France, Germany, Poland et al still very much hope to work closely with the UK on international issues like Russia sanctions, Iran and human rights protection. On the world stage the EU considers the UK one of the good guys. But EU leaders' welcoming tone - a diplomatic courtesy at the end of the day - should not be misconstrued when it comes to Brexit and a Boris Johnson premiership. EU invitations to the new prime minister to work with them ""constructively"" do not signal a willingness to accept whatever the new prime minister might demand in terms of changes to the Brexit deal. One influential EU figure put it to me that there were currently two schools of thought in the EU when it comes to Boris Johnson: Number 1: Those who believe that, once in office, he will water down his rhetoric. These EU optimists believe that, as a chief architect of Brexit, Mr Johnson is best placed to sell a compromise deal to parliament. They also hope, after so much time longing to be prime minister, that Boris Johnson ultimately won't want to risk his fledging premiership by going for a no-deal Brexit this autumn. School of Thought Number 2: Those who predict ""Varoufakis the sequel"". These EU pessimists predict ""lots of pointless meetings"" with Prime Minister Johnson - as they believe was the case with Greece's controversial finance minister at the height of the Greek debt crisis. They think the result will be a no-deal Brexit. First and foremost though, the EU is waiting to see which figures will have Boris Johnson's ear once he's in Downing Street. ""Only then can we begin to understand what Boris Johnson's Brexit strategy will be,"" one EU diplomat commented to me. ""Up till now, all we've heard are slogans."" Of course, the EU is already familiar with Mr Johnson's so-called nuclear strategy - letting the EU know that he is very serious about a no-deal Brexit. He knows EU leaders would far prefer a coordinated Brexit. He seems to believe that the credible threat of no deal will provoke a fundamental rethink in Brussels. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has three priorities, to deliver Brexit, unite the country and beat Jeremy Corbyn But the problem with the no-deal threat is that it goes both ways. EU leaders also think no-deal is better than a bad deal. For them. And they believe they are far better prepared. Boris Johnson is right. The EU has more wiggle room around the Brexit deal than it has so far wanted to signal, but also I think he overestimates EU flexibility. Europe's leaders will not want to sign up to compromises over Brexit that ultimately will hurt them. Amendments will only be forthcoming if EU leaders deem them workable and if they are convinced the new prime minister commands a majority in parliament to get the Brexit deal through once and for all. And while limited changes to the backstop guarantee for the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland might be conceivable - if Dublin is willing - the Boris Johnson notion of abandoning the backstop altogether is nigh on unthinkable for Brussels. EU leaders want to safeguard their single market from non-regulation smuggled goods. This is about more than Brexit, more than the Northern Ireland peace process. The integrity of the single market is the cornerstone of the EU's success as a trading bloc. EU leaders will not want to be seen to be abandoning Ireland either.
