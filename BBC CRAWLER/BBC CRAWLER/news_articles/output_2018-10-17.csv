Norway apologises to WW2 'German girls',"Many of the women were expelled from the country with their children Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg has issued an official government apology to Norwegian women who were mistreated over World War Two-era relationships with German soldiers. Norway, a neutral country, was invaded by Nazi forces in April 1940. Up to 50,000 Norwegian women are thought to have had intimate relationships with German soldiers. The Germans were also encouraged to have children with them by SS leader Heinrich Himmler. Himmler, one of the most powerful men under Adolf Hitler, favoured Norwegian women, hoping they could help promote the Nazi concept of an Aryan master race. Living hell of Norway's 'Nazi' children,external Nazi legacy found in Norwegian trees Many of the Norwegian-German children were born in the German-administered Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) maternity facilities set up from 1941 by the Nazis in the country. A swastika in the Norwegian capital Oslo following the Nazi takeover The women who had relationships with the soldiers became known by the nickname the ""German Girls"", and were targeted for reprisals in Norway when the war ended - standing accused of betraying the country. Punishments included being deprived of civil rights, detained or expelled from the country to Germany along with their children. ""Young Norwegian girls and women who had relations with German soldiers or were suspected of having them, were victims of undignified treatment,"" Ms Solberg said at an event to mark the 70th anniversary of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights on Wednesday. ""Our conclusion is that Norwegian authorities violated the rule fundamental principle that no citizen can be punished without trial or sentenced without law."" ""For many, this was just a teenage love, for some, the love of their lives with an enemy soldier or an innocent flirt that left its mark for the rest of their lives. ""Today, in the name of the government, I want to offer my apologies."" Lebensborn facilities were set up in Germany and Nazi-conquered countries The apology was based on a report about Norway's post-war actions published by the country's Centre for Holocaust and Minorities Studies. More than seven decades on from the war, not many of the women directly affected are likely to still be alive to hear it. ""A good apology can have a lot of power. An apology can mean that groups receive answers to their treatment,"" Guri Hjeltnes the head of the centre said. Reidar Gabler attended the event and told Norwegian media that the apology meant a lot to his family. His mother, Else Huth from Sarpsborg was just 22 in 1944 when she fell in love with a 25-year-old German soldier. Himmler diaries reveal Nazi horrors Himmler's daughter worked for German spy agency World War One footage brought to life ""The people directly affected are no longer with us... but this also touches their families and the children,"" said Mr Gabler. ""We just had to come. This is amazing,"" he said, after meeting Ms Solberg. Erna Solberg admitted Norwegian authorities had violated fundamental rights with their actions About 10-12,000 children are thought to have been born as a result of relationships between Norwegian women and German soldiers. Some of the children were also targeted for acts of revenge, given up to foster families or placed in institutions. In 2007 a group of children took Norway to the European Court of Human Rights, but their case was ruled inadmissible because of the amount of time that had passed since the offences occurred.

Finger length 'could be clue to sexuality',"Have you looked at the length of your index and ring fingers? Women whose left index and ring fingers are different lengths are more likely to be lesbians, a study suggests. Scientists measured the fingers of 18 pairs of female identical twins, where one was straight and the other gay. On average, the lesbians, but not the straight twins, had different sized index and ring fingers, typically a male trait, but only on the left hand. This may be the result of exposure to more testosterone in the womb, the University of Essex researchers said. The scientists also measured the fingers of 14 pairs of male identical twins, where one was straight and the other gay, but found no link. In women, typically the index (second) and ring (fourth) fingers are a similar length, while in men there is a larger difference between the two Both men and women were exposed to the ""male"" hormone, testosterone, in the womb - but some may be exposed more than others, the scientists said. Study author Dr Tuesday Watts, from the psychology department at Essex University, said:  ""Because identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, can differ in their sexual orientations, factors other than genetics must account for the differences. ""Research suggests that our sexuality is determined in the womb and is dependent on the amount of male hormone we are exposed to or the way our individual bodies react to that hormone, with those exposed to higher levels of testosterone being more likely to be bisexual or homosexual. ""Because of the link between hormone levels and difference in finger lengths, looking at someone's hands could provide a clue to their sexuality."" The findings are published in Archives of Sexual Behaviour.

Danny Dyer lives like a king for new series,"EastEnders actor Danny Dyer is going from the Queen Vic to living like a king for a new BBC history series. After finding out he wasrelated to royaltyin Who Do You Think You Are, Dyer is to experience how his ancestors lived for the show. That will see him eating sheep's tongue - like Viking forebear Rollo - and learning to hunt, like William the Conqueror, his 30x great-grandfather, as he explores 800 years of history. Dyer said it was a ""nutty"" experience. He had his family tree traced two years ago for the ancestry show and found out he also had links to Edward III and Thomas Cromwell. The new two-part series, Danny Dyer's Right Royal Family, will see him eat, dress and live like his regal antecedents. It seems Danny is a fan of dressing up Luckily for viewers, that means we get to see him wear an Elizabeth ruff when he hosts a sugar banquet of sweet treats for his family - his living family, rather than his ancestors - who all dress up for the occasion. Dyer, whose daughter Dani won Love Island this summer, also gets to wear 14th Century armour to fight like his 19x great-grandfather Henry Hotspur Percy - the knight who inspired a Shakespeare character of the same name. ""I'm still in shock at the fact that I'm related to such important people,"" he said. ""I've had a ball getting to know them. It was a nutty experience."" Dyer with wife Joanne Mas, left, daughter Dani and her boyfriend Jack Fincham A BBC spokeswoman said ""his journey is a retelling of 800 years of British history - which is all there in his extraordinary bloodline"". Other new factual shows announced for BBC One and Two include Lucy Worsley re-enacting the wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Brian Cox looking at the solar system in The Planets and Twinstitute, a health show using 30 pairs of identical twins to test our health theories.

Budget airline Cobalt suspends operations,"Low-cost airline Cobalt has cancelled all flights from midnight Wednesday according toa statement,externalon its website. The carrier, which has operated flights in and out of Cyprus since 2016 - including flying UK holiday-makers to the island - has suspended operations. Local media said Cobalt had failed to reach a deal with a potential new investor. The Cyprus Mail said the airline's main backer is China's Avic Joy Air. The airline's statement said future flights would not operate due to ""indefinite suspension of Cobalt's operations"", and advised passengers not to go to the airport. They should contact their credit card provider or travel agent instead, it added. It is not yet clear how many passengers have been affected, but nine flights had been scheduled to arrive and nine to depart from Larnaca airport on Thursday. It flew to 23 destinations in Europe - including Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester in the UK - as well as Russia and the Middle East. Passengers reacted with concern on Twitter.

Cypriot Transport Minister Vassiliki Anastassiadou said the government would pay for tickets to help travellers get back to where they started from, but stressed it would only cover return tickets. She said telephone numbers would be announced soon to help passengers stranded either in Cyprus or overseas. The fate of Cobalt's 200 staff is unclear. Last year, Cobalt said it had carried 740,000 passengers in its first 16 months of operation. By contrast, Europe's biggest airline Lufthansa carried about 130 million people last year. Before 2016, short-haul flights out of Cyprus were dominated by state-controlled Cyprus Airways. But it collapsed, which left room for the new operator.

Khan withdraws 'divisive' Wembley offer,"The FA has owned Wembley since 1999 having bought it from Wembley plc, a private firm which previously owned the stadium Fulham owner Shahid Khan has withdrawn his offer to buy Wembley Stadium from the Football Association after the plan became ""divisive"". Khan had offered Â£600m for the national stadium, with the FA retaining the Club Wembley hospitality rights, which it valued at Â£250m to Â£300m. The move was ""more divisive than expected"", said FA chief Martin Glenn. Khan has not ruled out making another bid in future if there is more support from FA Council members. The FA had said it would invest the proceeds of the sale into improving grassroots football facilities. Sports Minister Tracey Crouch told the BBC she was ""very disappointed"" by the decision, calling the offer ""a huge opportunity to boost funding into the development and maintenance of artificial and grass pitches up and down the country"". FA executives made a presentation to the FA Council last week about why they were backing the sale to Khan, and the 127 council members were scheduled to vote on the proposed sale on 24 October. But a senior FA source told BBC Sport that the board believed the odds were slightly against the purchase being backed, given the strong objections of some councillors to the home of English football being sold off. FA chief executive Glenn said Khan had believed his offer ""would be well received by all football stakeholders"". However, Glenn added: ""At a recent meeting with Mr Khan he expressed to us that, without stronger support from within the game, his offer is being seen as more divisive than it was anticipated to be and he has decided to withdraw his proposal. ""Wembley Stadium is an iconic venue that is revered around the world and it will continue to thrive under the ownership and direction of the FA."" This video can not be played May 2018: Shahid Khan - If you love English football, Wembley deal must go ahead Khan said he wanted ""to do right by everyone in a manner that strengthens the English game and brings people together, not divides them"". He added: ""Unfortunately, given where we are today, I've concluded that the outcome of a vote next week would be far from sufficient in expressing the broad support favoured by the FA chairman to sell Wembley Stadium. ""Until a time when it is evident there is an unmistakable directive from the FA to explore and close a sale, I am respectfully withdrawing my offer to purchase Wembley Stadium."" Khan, who also owns the NFL American football team the Jacksonville Jaguars, added: ""Our commitment to London would have been amplified and strengthened with the certainty of officially making Wembley Stadium an annual host to Jaguars or other NFL games."" The FA had pledged to keep showpiece events, such as most England internationals and the FA Cup final, at the stadium under a pre-agreed hire fee. The Football Foundation charity, which helps fund grassroots projects, said a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to improve facilities had been lost. ""Unfortunately, those who play the game as a sport, simply for the love of doing so and for the health benefits, are having to put up with a stock of community football facilities that is in a shameful state,"" it added. Other supporters, however, were concerned over the possibility of rising ticket prices for Wembley games, loss of control over the ground's future development and the stadium becoming the home of a new owner's club side, Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke said. ""More than 2,000 supporters took part in our consultation on the Wembley sale and we took that fan feedback directly to the FA Council last week. Only one in three fans thought the FA should sell to Khan while two-thirds of supporters were against selling the stadium under any circumstances,"" he added. FOR The FA said only one in three grassroots pitches are of adequate quality and it would invest in facilities. FA chief executive Martin Glenn:""This is an opportunity to unleash an unprecedented amount of investment into community football. Receiving an offer to sell Wembley Stadium is not a 'betrayal'. It is not selling the 'soul of the game'."" AGAINST Opponents had suggested selling an iconic national venue was a short-term plan which the FA would live to regret. Former England and Manchester United defender Gary Neville:""The FA feels to fund the grassroots programme, they have to sell a national asset - it's quite simply ridiculous. Don't sell Wembley when you can place a levy on agents' fees.""

EBay acts over Amazon 'seller recruitment',"EBay wants Amazon to stop trying to tempt sellers away from the auction site EBay has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the US retail giant of using illegal tactics to recruit sellers. It says Amazon representatives abused eBay's internal email system to contact sellers - a violation of the marketplace's policies. Amazon declined to comment on the case, which followsa letter from eBay demanding an end to the activity. It had previously said that it was investigating the claims. In the lawsuit filed in Santa Clara County, California, eBay says Amazon representatives created eBay accounts to solicit sellers, often sending messages within minutes of setting up their profiles. The activity dates back to at least 2015 and involved dozens of Amazon representatives, who each sent hundreds of emails, it says. EBay was alerted to the issue a few weeks ago by a seller and asked Amazon to stop. The lawsuit says the messages show Amazon was aware its practices violated eBay's use policies. It says Amazon's practices ""appear to be part of a larger pattern of aggressive, unscrupulous conduct"" by the Seattle company. EBay, which also owns the ticket resale site StubHub, is seeking monetary damages to be awarded at jury trial. The California company, which launched in 1995, was an online shopping pioneer, developing a platform to connect buyers to sellers. It now boasts more than 175 million active buyers, with sales of nearly $90bn via the platform last year, But its lustre has faded amid increased competition, especially as Amazon's dominance lures more merchants to its own platform. Last year, more than half of the items sold by Amazon came from third-party merchants. Amazon overall is estimated to account for about half of retail dollars spent online in the US.

No retrial for 'sex on plane' teacher,"Eleanor Wilson had faced four counts of sexual activity with a child under 18 while in a position of trust A former teacher who was accused of having sex with a 16-year-old pupil in a plane toilet will not face a retrial. Eleanor Wilson, 29, of Dursley, Gloucestershire, denied four counts of sexual activity with a child under 18 while in a position of trust. Earlier this month a jury at Bristol Crown Court was unable to reach a verdict and was discharged by Judge Peter Blair QC. The boy and the school concerned cannot be identified for legal reasons. The jury foreman informed the judge there was not a ""realistic prospect"" of reaching majority verdicts in any of the charges against Ms Wilson. Following the jury's dismissal on 10 October, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) asked for seven days to consider if it wished to seek a retrial. On Wednesday, a CPS spokesman confirmed there would be no further action taken. The BBC understands ""a number of factors"" were behind the decision not to pursue the case. Plastic pollution found on shipwrecks 'Dangerous' dahlias must go says council Giants creator to get freedom of city During the trial, it was alleged Ms Wilsonhad sex with the boy on the flight back from an overseas school trip in 2015- something she later describedas his ""fantasy"". She said the allegations sounded ""like a porn film"" and told police during interview that having sex with the boy was ""the last thing on my mind"", Bristol Crown Court had heard. Jurors were told she ""beckoned"" him into the toilet after they drank alcohol together on the overnight flight. Ms Wilson's defence barrister, Anna Midgley, suggested the claim was false because the plane would have been busy with other teachers checking on pupils and fellow passengers and crew walking about. The teenager claimed the pair continued a relationship after the school trip, during which she told him she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion. Within weeks of the school trip Ms Wilson was confronted by the school's head teacher after rumours of the affair had circulated, which she denied. At the same time, Ms Wilson discovered she was pregnant and went on to have an abortion. Prosecutors claimed the boy was the father, she insisted she had been pregnant by her boyfriend. Jurors were told the ""clandestine"" relationship was exposed months later when another pupil at the school tried to blackmail Ms Wilson into having sex with him and she went to the police. In July 2017 a teaching tribunal struck Ms Wilson off,externaland banned her from teaching indefinitely. It concluded that ""in view of the seriousness of the allegations... she shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach"". She now works as a civil servant.

'Zero hygiene' takeaways listed on Just Eat,"This video can not be played How restaurants with poor hygiene are still available on Just Eat Many takeaway shops in England with a zero rating for hygiene are among those listed on the Just Eat food ordering app, a BBC investigation has found. Half of outlets rated as zero by the Food Standards Agency in Manchester, Bristol and London appear on the app. A consumer rights campaigner has called for Just Eat to display the hygiene score alongside each entry. Just Eat said it took the issue ""very seriously"" and will trial the ratings on its Northern Ireland listings. The BBC investigation found: 20 out of the 31 takeaways rated zero in Birmingham are on Just Eat Nine of the 13 takeaways rated zero in Liverpool are listed there In Manchester, Bristol and London, half of the takeaways with a rating of zero are on the platform Local authorities are responsible for inspecting restaurants and takeaways. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland outlets are given a food hygiene rating ranging from zero, for ""in need of urgent improvement"", to five, for ""food hygiene is very good"". An inspector carries out her work in a kitchen in Ealing, West London ""It's absolutely filthy."" That's a pretty damning assessment handed out after Ealing Council's environmental health team carried out an inspection of a pub in west London - but operations manager Helen Statham believes she has good reason. During the visit, they found multiple food safety issues - including mice and rat droppings in a store room. Ms Statham added: ""There was no sanitiser, so they can't clean effectively. Food [was left] out at room temperature, very high-risk food like rice. And [there were] no records."" The pub has a zero hygiene rating - meaning it is in need of ""urgent improvement"". But that is not just an issue for those who eat at the pub. It also offers a takeaway service - with a listing on Just Eat. And on that app and website, it gets a four-star customer review rating - but the hygiene score is not disclosed. What happens next differs between the nations. Restaurants in Wales and Northern Ireland must display their rating prominently. In England, many outlets choose to do so, particularly if it shows a high score for hygiene, but it is not mandatory. Mouse droppings on washing up gloves at a takeaway in Walthamstow, east London, that was on Just Eat Scotland has a different system, with just three ratings - Pass, Improvement Required and Exempt Premises (which are given to premises such as newsagents or chemists that are checked but are not predominantly food businesses). Ratings are then displayed on the Food Standards Agency website. 'Scores on the doors' call on food hygiene Birmingham 'worst for food hygiene' Food safety: Five things to watch out for Just Eat, which describes itself as ""a world leader in online and mobile food ordering"", said it was ""actively working to raise standards"". It said the company offered free accredited food hygiene training to any restaurant that signed up to the platform. It added: ""Whenever any potential food safety issues are brought to our attention, our restaurant compliance team will review, investigate and liaise with the local authority."" The company pointed out that for each outlet, it already does include a link to the Food Standards Agency website, at the bottom of both the menu and the information page. Customers do then need to input the name and postcode of the restaurant on the FSA website to find the relevant hygiene rating. Cockroaches caught in a trap at a takeaway in York But consumer rights campaigner Chris Emmins says he believes this is not enough and wants Just Eat to display the hygiene rating for each restaurant on their individual entry. This is an idea that Just Eat says it is willing to try out, with a trial planned for Northern Ireland outlets, so it can ""test and learn what customers want"". Mr Chris Emmins believes Just Eat also needs to lead a more active change. ""There is a duty on all businesses to safeguard their customers, and it's no good saying you are just an agent,"" he said. ""If that was a standard traditional business, a supermarket or a travel agent, they would be hauled over the coals considerably for a failure for that sort of lack of due diligence."" Environmental Health took this picture of dead mice at a takeaway in Walthamstow, east London Ms Statham, from Ealing Council, added her frustration. ""Members of the public are of the view they are buying their food from that business, but I think at the same time there is a responsibility or a part to play by somewhere like Just Eat in order to help to improve those standards,"" she said. Just Eat entered the FTSE 100 last year and now employs more than 2,900 staff across 12 different countries. Food outlets pay to sign up to the platform, and, in return, Just Eat promotes the business and takes orders and payments - with the outlet charged a commission on each order. A rating appears alongside the listings, but this is generated by collated customer scores rather than decided by Just East itself.

US requests Khashoggi 'murder' tape,"This video can not be played President Trump said he wanted answers on the issue The US has asked Turkey for a recording said to provide strong evidence that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed at Istanbul's Saudi consulate. ""We have asked for it, if it exists,"" President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House. Mr Khashoggi has not been seen since entering the building on 2 October. Saudi Arabia denies killing him. Meanwhile, the Washington Post has publishedthe last column Mr Khashoggi wrote before his disappearance.,external In the column he talks about the importance of a free press in the Middle East. The newspaper's Global Opinions editor Karen Attiah said its release had been delayed in the hope that Mr Khashoggi would return safely. ""Now I have to accept: That is not going to happen. This is the last piece of his I will edit for The Post,"" she wrote. ""This column perfectly captures his commitment and passion for freedom in the Arab world. A freedom he apparently gave his life for."" Mr Khashoggi presented a strong criticism of the state of press freedoms in the Arab world: ""The Arab world is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power. ""The Arab world needs a modern version of the old transnational media so citizens can be informed about global events. More important, we need to provide a platform for Arab voices."" What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Firms defy pressure over Saudi conference He mentioned the case of his fellow Saudi writer, Saleh al-Shehi, who he said ""is now serving an unwarranted five-year prison sentence for supposed comments contrary to the Saudi establishment"". ""Such actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community,"" he wrote. ""Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence."" Saudi Arabia is one of Washington's closest allies and the Khashoggi disappearance is putting the administration in an awkward position. Confirming that the tape said to provide evidence of the killing had been requested, Mr Trump added: ""I'm not sure yet that it exists, probably does, possibly does."" Mr Trump said he expected a report from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who has just been to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The president said the truth would come out ""by the end of the week"". He rejected suggestions he was trying to provide cover for Saudi Arabia: ""No, not at all, I just want to find out what's happening."" Over the past few days, Mr Trump has raised the possibility of ""rogue killers"" being behind the journalist's disappearance. And he has cautioned against rushing to blame Saudi leaders, telling the Associated Press news agency thatthey were being treated as ""guilty until proven innocent"",external. Early on in their inquiry, Turkish investigators said they had evidence that Mr Khashoggi - a critic of Saudi leaders - was murdered. Reports in Turkish media give gruesome details of what are said to be his final minutes. A Turkish newspaper says the consul himself,Mohammed al-Otaibi, can be heard in the audio recording of Mr Khashoggi's death,external. The search of Saudi consular buildings continues Yeni Safak, which is close to the government, quotes him as telling alleged Saudi agents sent to Istanbul: ""Do this outside. You're going to get me in trouble."" Mr Otaibi flew back to Riyadh on Tuesday. On Wednesday and into Thursday, investigators spent almost nine hours searching the Saudi consul's residence, then moving on to the consulate itself about 200m (650ft) away, according to Reuters news agency. The team included prosecutors and forensics experts in white overalls. Police inside the Saudi consul's residence Several vehicles with Saudi diplomatic number plates were filmed by CCTV cameras moving from the consulate to the residence just less than two hours after Mr Khashoggi entered the consulate on the day he vanished. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Donald Trump and a world of disorder The consulate building was searched for the first time on Monday. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan On Tuesday, Mr Pompeo was in Riyadh for talks with Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who he said ""strongly denied"" any involvement in the journalist's disappearance. Mr Khashoggi is a US resident and columnist for the Washington Post newspaper who went into self-imposed exile last year after reportedly being warned by Saudi officials to stop criticising the crown prince's policies. He arrived at the consulate at 13:14 local time for an appointment to obtain paperwork so he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e. Saudi officials have insisted Mr Khashoggi left the consulate soon afterwards and came to no harm. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. But Turkish officials believe an assault and struggle took place in the building. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists They allege that Mr Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents who were pictured entering and leaving Turkey on CCTV footage released to media outlets. The New York Times reports that four of the 15 agents have links to Crown Prince Mohammed, while another is a senior figure in the country's interior ministry. On Tuesday, G7 foreign ministers called for Saudi Arabia to conduct a ""transparent"" investigation into the issue.

Gun attack at Crimea college kills 19,"Russia has said the attack was an act of ""mass murder"" At least 19 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in a shooting at a college in Russian-annexed Crimea. An 18-year-old student ran through the Kerch technical college firing at fellow pupils before killing himself, Russian investigators say. Witnesses have also spoken of at least one blast caused by an unidentified explosive. The motive is unclear. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in a move condemned by many Western powers. The annexation marked the start of a simmering conflict involving Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine that goes on to this day. There are contradictory reports about the chronology of Wednesday's attack. The alleged perpetrator, named Vladislav Roslyakov, is said to have run from room to room as he fired, starting in the area near the canteen. He then shot himself dead, Russia's investigative committee said. Photos later emerged in Russian media purportedly showing the body of the attacker in the college library. The investigative committee said initial examinations suggested all the victims died of gunshot wounds, but some reports speak of shrapnel injuries. This video can not be played Emergency crews respond to the attack At the same time, Russia's law enforcement sources are quoted by local media as saying that the attacker had detonated a bomb in the canteen before starting shooting. Soon after reports of a blast in the college, investigators released a statement saying an explosive device filled with ""metal objects"" had detonated in the dining area. Several witnesses maintain they heard one or more explosions. Investigators later said they found a second device among the personal possessions of the gunman and that it had been disarmed. BBC Russian has been speaking to witnesses, including Igor Zakharevsky, who was in the canteen when the gunman struck. ""I was at the epicentre of the first explosion, at the entrance, near the buffet,"" he said. ""I was in complete shock and one of my classmates started pulling me away. Then I heard several shots at intervals of two or three seconds. After a while there was another explosion."" A businessman near the college described hearing an explosion and seeing a large window shatter. Crimea profile Russia's Crimea bridge gets giant arch The incident was earlier described as a ""terrorist act"", but Russia's investigative committee has now reclassified it as ""mass murder"". President Vladimir Putin said the attack was a ""tragic event"" and expressed condolences to the victims' relatives. Three days of mourning in Crimea have been declared from Thursday. By Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Until now, if you had told people in Crimea there had been a mass school shooting, most would have thought you were talking about the United States. Now all that has changed. The shooting spree in the Kerch Polytechnic has left the peninsula, annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, in shock. But should it come as such a surprise?

There have been five attacks in schools in Russia this year where a number of children were injured. In Kerch, questions are already being asked: how did Vladislav Roslyakov manage to obtain a licence for a hunting weapon? And how was he able to launch such a deadly attack on his college? His precise motives remain unclear. But there are suggestions the fourth-year student had developed a hostile attitude to the college. Russia's RBC TV interviewed a friend who said Roslyakov ""hated the technical school very much"" and had vowed ""revenge"" on his teachers. National guard soldiers were deployed It was reported that the attacker had recently been given a weapons permit, but Crimea's ombudsman for the rights of the child, Irina Klyueva, later questioned this. ""As far as I understand, it was fake information, although it is not yet known exactly,"" she was quoted as saying by Russia's Gazeta.ru. Classmates also say the suspected attacker was very self-contained, hardly communicated with anyone, and had long ago stopped using social networks. A local official said most of the victims were students of the college, which is a vocational school for 850 teenagers. A major emergency response operation was launched as the victims were taken to hospitals. At least 40 people were injured. Four military planes were ready to evacuate the wounded and military hospital facilities were ready to accept victims if necessary, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said. The peninsula has been a major area of dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine, and many other countries, have never recognised its annexation four years ago. The Crimea issue and the presence of Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine continue to strain relations. Kerch is situated at the point where Russia built a bridge between the Crimea and Russia. In a reminder of how poor relations are between Russia and Ukraine, the speaker of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, suggested Kiev might have been behind the attack. ""The entire evil inflicted on the land of Crimea is coming from the official Ukrainian authorities"", he said.

Rocks ahead for May,"A Brexit-supporting member of the cabinet has a simple analogy to explain whether Theresa May's government can survive. The government will crash onto the rocks if it ends up with no deal on Brexit or indefinite membership of an EU customs union, this minister told me. ""So we need to find a place between those two extremes,"" the minister said. If the prime minister opted for membership of a customs union to avoid no deal, then the minister would resign from the cabinet. If Britain fell into no-deal, then there would be no government from which to resign. The comparison of Theresa May to the captain of a stricken ship trying to chart a course between the jagged rocks of no-deal and a customs union shows why the prime minister finds herself in such a politically perilous position. The waterway between the two sets of rocks is fiendishly narrow. As one comes into view - a customs union - the ship appears to lurch towards the no-deal rocks. Brexit talks hit 'real problem' over border DUP plan to vote against the Budget over Brexit red lines How could May get Brexit deal through MPs? The sharp dilemma became apparent when Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, told EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Sunday that the UK could not accept a proposal drawn up by UK and EU officials for the Northern Ireland backstop. This is the arrangement to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland if, by the end of a 20 month transition period following Brexit, the UK and the EU have failed to agree a satisfactory trade deal for the future. The EU reportedly moved over the last week, by saying that the UK as a whole could join this version of the customs union. Brexit-supporting members of the cabinet and others say this would have to have a guaranteed end date, a demand resisted by No 10 which says that is a deal breaker with the EU. In order to provide a definitive guarantee of no hard border in Northern Ireland, the EU stuck to its fundamental position. This states that the prime minister would have to agree that Northern Ireland would remain within an EU regulatory zone just in case the new proposals are not agreed. This is being dubbed the backstop to the backstop which would see checks down the Irish Sea. Theresa May is adamant that the UK as a whole must be treated as one customs territory, with no distinction for Northern Ireland. It appears that the prime minister may be willing to allow separate treatment for Northern Ireland for regulatory checks on agri-products and manufactured goods. Mrs May feels strongly about treating the UK as one customs territory, because she believes that anything else would effectively lead to the break up of the UK. The DUP is warning that it may no longer prop up her government if she gives too much ground. Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman,told me over the summer,externalthat there would be ""physical opposition"" by Unionists to additional barriers placed within the UK between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The current impasse, which means that no UK-EU talks are scheduled before the start of a Brussels summit on Wednesday, means that the rocks of no deal are now starting to hove into view. Supporters of a deal will be hoping that Northern Ireland will provide a positive analogy. Hopes of a deal appeared hopeless in the final days and then - with interventions from Bill Clinton but ill will still hanging in the air - they pulled off the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. But then talks can also fail - and fail dramatically. You can watchNewsnighton BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or onIplayer. Subscribe to the programme onYouTube,externalor follow them onTwitter,external.

"Kuenssberg: The good, the bad and the ugly","This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The good, the bad and the ugly - the story of this summit so far. Theresa May can claim something already. EU leaders have agreed that the negotiations can continue, officials can get back to the extremely difficult task of solving conundrums that have been preoccupying them for two years. For EU leaders to have said any less than that would have been a horror show for Number 10. But the bad? After listening to Theresa May and then talking amongst themselves after she left, her counterparts decided that there simply hasn't been enough progress to be able to reach anything like a deal. The prime minister did not turn up with ""new facts"" that could have changed the dynamic. Yes, the two sides have moved closer together on many of the sticking points in the last few weeks. But the division over Ireland is still plain and there is no way out of it yet. UK 'may consider longer Brexit transition' The ugly? Well a senior EU official revealed after the dinner that the prime minister told the others that she was ""ready"" to consider a longer implementation period after Brexit than is currently planned - essentially she'd think about both sides having longer to work out all the complexities of how the relationship between the EU and UK will work well after Brexit. To many people that will sound perfectly sensible. But to others, including many Tory MPs, it would mean the UK being trapped in the status quo until 2022. Please upgrade your browser And more to the point, potentially having to promise to pay the EU billions more, without quite knowing for what. Number 10 won't confirm the prime minister's comments. But the president of the European Parliament said on the record that it had been discussed. And sources at Downing Street repeatedly refused to rule it out. But there's one giant problem. It's hard to see how it could get through the House of Commons. One former Remainer MP told me ""it just wouldn't fly"". Iain Duncan Smith, the prominent Brexiteer, said ""why are we agreeing to extend for another year when we have nothing back in return"". Nick Boles, an influential former minister, wrote on Twitter, ""good luck with that"". Remember getting Brussels on board is one thing. Theresa May has a harder job at home. And if she is looking for big rebellions, staying tied to the EU for longer is one way of making that happen. 'Key issues remain' after Brexit talks What are the Brexit backstop options?

A battle for the union?,"The 310-mile long border separating Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and how it should look after Brexit has become a crucial issue With fewer than 200 days until the UK is due to leave the EU, the battle over Brexit is reaching dizzying heights of drama. But perhaps an unintended consequence of the debate is the growing battle over something else - the union. In particular, the sum of the UK and all its parts. With the Irish border the main sticking point in the talks, focus has turned to Northern Ireland's future. Listen to BBC Podlitical: Brexit, borders and backstops Reality Check: Red lines on Irish border May cannot recommend Brexit deal says DUP On Monday, the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the BBC that Brexit negotiations were ""turning into a battle for the union"". His party is at the heart ofthe disquiet over the so-called backstop(that's the insurance policy the EU wants, to ensure there's no hard Irish border if the UK and EU can't find another solution). The DUP's ""blood red"" line: No to anything that sees only Northern Ireland remaining aligned in some way to EU rules, and no to extra regulatory checks only in Northern Ireland. It fears anything that splits Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK could pose a range of problems, including precipitating the eventual break-up of the union. Alex Kane, a former director of communications for the Ulster Unionist Party, believes the pro-union argument would probably win a border poll if one was held, but he's critical of the DUP and unionism more widely for throwing out rhetoric - but not acting on it. DUP leader Arlene Foster met the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier last week - and has since said it appears more likely that Brexit will lead to a no deal outcome ""It's not enough to just say 'the battle for the union' is on,"" he says. ""You have to have a strategy, you have to be willing to engage. If you mention the phrase border poll to unionists, a lot of the time they dismiss it and say it won't happen."" But writer and former Labour special adviser, Kevin Meagher, says Brexit has been an ""accelerant"" in pushing forward the possibility of Irish reunification which he insists is almost an inevitability. ""Unionists find themselves riding two horses: standing true to what they believe in, but having to internalise that a united Ireland is a real prospect now,"" he says. The power to call a border poll rests with the Secretary of State Karen Bradley, who could do so at any time if it appears ""likely"" to her that a majority would vote in favour of it, butearlier this year she said the conditions had not been met. Kevin Meagher says Brexit makes it much more likely to happen, and that there are other contributing factors too: Lack of devolved government in NI for almost two years, due toa financial scandal over a green energy scheme Changing demographics in NI,which could see a Catholic majority by 2021 Liberalisation of Republic of Ireland onsocial issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion The prime minister has always insistedshe is a defender of the unionand that the ""precious bond"" between the UK's four nations is of great importance to her. Kevin Meagher thinks that when it comes to the final roll of the Brexit dice, Theresa May might have to upset her unionist allies. ""Some of those forces are alive already, given Scotland's previous independence vote. ""Brexit quickens the pace around these problems, but Theresa May's got to try and get the best deal, and by upsetting the DUP she can probably get a reasonable deal for rest of the UK."" Senior Scottish Conservatives David Mundell and Ruth Davidson have threatened to resign if Theresa May backs a deal that gives NI special arrangements It's not just the DUP that the prime minister risks upsetting. On Sunday, just as talks between EU and UK negotiators ground to a halt over the Irish border issue,senior Scottish Conservatives threatened mutinyif any Brexit deal included special arrangements for Northern Ireland. Their fear is that any new controls that separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK could fuel the case for Scottish independence - another potential fracture in the union. But where does Sinn FÃ©in - the largest nationalist party in Stormont and who also holds seats in the Irish Parliament - figure into all of this? The party's leadership have stressed that they want to see a border poll by 2022, although they acknowledgeit would be much more complicated in the context of a hard Brexit or 'no deal' scenario. The party's MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir said fighting against a hard Brexit is a bigger priority for Sinn FÃ©in right now, than achieving a united Ireland - but acknowledged Brexit had strengthened his party's argument for one. Alex Kane thinks the prospect of Irish unity is ""once in a lifetime"", arguing that Sinn FÃ©in knows it has an opportunity now that may not come around again for a very long time if it is not successful. And Kevin Meagher's view is that a united Ireland has moved from being an aspiration for nationalists to an ""evidence-based proposition"" now. ""Brexit is massively destabilising for the British state, it would be like taking a fillet to the UK,"" he says. ""A hard Brexit would be the worst of all worlds for unionism - with all roads ultimately leading to one point: a border poll."" While the Stormont parties may be at odds and internal spats within the Conservatives and Labour rage on, much of what happens next with the union rests on what Theresa May does next. But could she become the British prime minister who ends up breaking up the UK? Kevin Meagher says she's in an incredibly difficult position, adding: ""Trying to judge her place in history, I don't envy her, I don't think anybody does."" While in Alex Kane's view, the prime minister has a stark choice: ""A deal in the best interests of the UK or the interests of one party."" Mrs May does not have much time left to decide.

New row over Commons Brexit vote,"The decision on whether MPs approve or reject any Brexit deal must be ""unequivocal"", ministers have said. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the outcome of the ""meaningful vote"" due to take place in Parliament must be ""clear to the British public"". In a letter to MPs, he suggests they will have to choose between whatever deal is on the table and no deal - and no other options will be offered. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was an attempt to ""fix the vote"". And pro-European Conservative MPs also reacted with dismay, former education secretary Nicky Morgan saying it ""appears to be an attempt by the executive to frustrate our sovereign Parliament"" while Anna Soubry urged MPs ""to stand up to this outrage"". UK 'may consider longer Brexit transition' Kuenssberg: The good, the bad and the ugly for PM The former chancellor Kenneth Clarke told the BBC's Newsnight it was a ""silly tactic"" and Parliament would ""insist on using its proper authority"" to keep a variety of options open. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said this was a ""big fat row waiting to happen"". No 10 sources, she said, were insisting the Commons motion on any final Brexit deal would be amendable but ""what is not clear is whether amendments will be voted on before after the vote on the deal"".

Opponents of Brexit have long warned of a ""take it or leave it"" situation, in which they have to either accept the deal on the table or risk the UK leaving without an agreement. They say MPs should have alternative options if they think the deal is inadequate, such as sending ministers back to the negotiating table or giving the public the final say in another referendum. Parliament has been promised a vote on the outcome of the current Brexit negotiations ahead of the UK's scheduled departure on 29 March 2019. It is increasingly unclear when the vote will be, amid signs that, due to the current deadlock over Northern Ireland, any agreement might not be reached until the middle of December. EU leaders are currently meeting in Brussels to gauge progress. In response to a letter from Tory MP Charles Walker, who chairs the Commons Procedure Committee, Mr Raab indicated the vote should be a simple Yes-or-No verdict on whatever deal was brought back by Theresa May. ""Once the deal is presented to Parliament, the procedure through which it is voted upon must allow for an unequivocal decision and one which is clear to the British public,"" he wrote. ""Anything other than a straightforward approval of the deal will bring with it huge uncertainty for business, consumers and citizens."" Mr Walker had asked for clarification on what would happen if any resolution was passed by MPs with different amendments attached. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said MPs must be able to scrutinise and, where appropriate, change the text of any vote presented to Parliament. ""That is not a meaningful vote. Ministers cannot silence Parliament."" The government has said any agreement reached with the EU on the terms of the UK's withdrawal will have to be enshrined in new legislation. Sky News reported on Wednesday that the traditional Commons recess in February could be cancelled to allow MPs to sit longer and ensure the legislation is passed before Brexit day.

"ÃÂ£5,000 backpay for 180,000 benefit claimants","Tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits will receive backdated payments averaging Â£5,000 following government errors. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has revealed it is paying more than Â£1.5bn due to the mistakes. Some people have already received payouts of more than Â£10,000. The mistaken calculations were made when people were moved on to the main sickness benefit, the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The errors werefirst revealed by BBC News in November, but the scale of the underpayments has now emerged. 'I have no idea how it was worked out' Philip Stanton, 58, got a letter earlier this year about the backdated payments, followed by a cheque for Â£2,250 in July. ""You feel brilliant at first because when you're living on Â£73 a week, that's a heck of a lot of money - though of course it won't last forever,"" he told BBC News. ""But then you think, 'what if they hadn't found out? What else is there?'. I have no idea how it was worked out or even if it's the right amount."" Mr Stanton, who has been receiving sickness benefits ""on and off for 10 years"", has anxiety and depression as well as problems with his back. He said he was told his payment went back to 2014. ""A couple of my friends are in the same situation and one of them got more than me, which is why I thought I would query it,"" said Mr Stanton, from Northampton. ""But someone else hasn't heard anything. ""I'm very grateful to get the money, but with my dealings with them, I tend not to trust them."" He said he has asked how the payment was calculated and is waiting for a response. Assessors wrongly calculated the income of thousands of people during the process that resulted in people moving from incapacity benefit and severe disability allowance onto ESA. Most of the errors occurred between 2011 and 2014. In anewly published document,external, the DWP said: ""We estimate that around 180,000 people could be owed arrears payments, with around 105,000 estimated to be repaid during 2018-19 and 75,000 during 2019-20."" The government had previously said that all the backdated payments would be completed by April 2019. The DWP said that the backdated payments totalled Â£970m. It now also faced a larger bill for ongoing ESA awards, costing the department more than Â£700m extra until 2024-25, bringing the total cost to Â£1.67bn. Frank Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""It is welcome news that the government is finally making progress towards repaying people who have missed out on ESA. ""Its best estimate is that it owes claimants Â£970m - but the final bill could be even higher. The government must learn lessons from this appalling failure, as it faces the much bigger challenge of moving people onto Universal Credit."" The government has 400 people working on claims, with the priority on those who are terminally ill. Around 18,000 arrears payments have already been made totalling Â£120m. The average payment so far is about Â£7,000. Universal credit rollout delayed yet again ESA repayments: Terminally ill people are 'priority' The government's original decision to only backdate payments to 2014 was legally challenged by the Child Poverty Action Group. CPAG chief executive Alison Garnham said it was good news that 180,000 people would now receive backdated compensation, but said ""it should concern us all that [the DWP] so significantly underestimated the number of people affected"". She added: ""It should not have taken legal action to get vulnerable people the money they were entitled to from the outset to avoid hardship."" In a statement, the DWP said: ""Anyone affected by this historic error will receive all of the money they are entitled to. ""We have worked with charities and other disability organisations to make sure that we are providing the right support to all affected claimants and are hiring and allocating more staff to do that."" Labour introduced ESA in 2008, claiming the change would move a million people off sickness benefit and save the Treasury Â£7bn. The shift from incapacity benefits to ESA was then accelerated by the coalition government. The payments have come to light in a week when the government has faced severe criticism for its flagship welfare reform, Universal Credit. On Tuesday, BBC News revealed that ministers were further delaying the rollout of the system, which merges six benefits into one.

UK 'may consider longer Brexit transition',"This video can not be played Theresa May is asked who will be ""disappointed"" by the outcome of Brexit talks The EU says it is ready to extend the proposed length of the post-Brexit transition period if the UK wants. The current plan is for a transition period of 21 months to smooth the path from Brexit to the UK and EU's future permanent relationship. But with the two sides failing to reach a deal yet, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said this arrangement could be extended ""for a few months"", if needed. Some Brexit campaigners have reacted angrily to the suggestion. Mrs May said she was not proposing extending the transition, but that having the option to do so could help solve the current impasse over the Irish border. An EU source told the BBC there would have to be ""financial implications"" if the UK did extend the transition period. EU Council president Donald Tusk spoke to journalists at the end of a Brussels summit where there was no major breakthrough on the key issue of how to avoid new visible border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Laura Kuenssberg: May's Kafka-esque balancing act Row over Commons 'meaningful vote' Five things that happened at EU summit Varadkar on hard border violence fears France's Macron plays down UK visa fears He said that if ""the UK decided an extension of the transition period would be helpful to reach a deal, I am sure the leaders would be ready to consider this positively"". Mr Tusk declared himself in a ""much better mood"" than after the last summit, in Salzburg. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said extension of the transition period ""will probably happen"" saying it was a good idea because it would allow more time to draw up a long-term relationship between the UK and the EU. In her post-summit press conference, Mrs May said the idea of having the option to extend the transition period could be ""a further solution"" to the search for a ""backstop"" to ensure no hard border. ""What we are not doing, we are not standing here proposing an extension to the implementation period,"" she said. ""What we are doing is working to ensure that we have a solution to the backstop issue in Northern Ireland."" This video can not be played BBC Europe editor Katya Adler looks at how united the EU really is over Brexit Both sides are committed to resolving the outstanding issues as soon as possible, she said, adding there was a ""very real sense that people want that deal to be done"". Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said: ""A lot of things have been agreed but there are still big gaps both in terms of the shape of the future relationship and also the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland and the backstop."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and the transition period, which Mrs May prefers to call the implementation period, is designed to smooth the path to a future permanent relationship. During this transition period, which is due to finish on 31 December 2020, the UK's relationship with the EU will stay largely the same. The UK has signed up to the principle of agreeing an Irish border ""backstop"" - an insurance policy designed to prevent the need for customs checks - in case there is a gap between the transition period and the future permanent relationship coming into force. The problem is that the two sides have yet to agree what form the backstop will take, and how long it could last. Please upgrade your browser This video can not be played PM: Extension would be 'a matter of months' Nigel Dodds, of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - whose support the government needs in key votes - said extending the transition phase would cost the UK billions of pounds and not change the ""fundamental problem"" with the EU's backstop plan. This is because it involves Northern Ireland staying aligned to EU rules, which the DUP - and the UK government - says is unacceptable because it creates a new border in the Irish sea. Brexiteers are not impressed, with Conservative backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg telling Sky News it was ""a rather poor attempt at kicking the can down the road"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The Leave Means Leave campaign said a longer transition would give the EU ""zero incentive to negotiate anything and gives Brussels the power to force whatever they want on to the UK"". Downing Street, meanwhile, insisted there was no difference of opinion with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who said earlier that the prime minister ""has been very clear about when the implementation period will come to an end"" and ""this is about the rules within that implementation period"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Conservative minister Nick Boles described extending this period as as ""desperate last move"" and warned that Mrs May was losing the support of the Tory party. Brexit: All you need to know Another former minister, Remain-voting Nicky Morgan, said an extension would be ""unhelpful"" and would leave the UK in a ""Brexit holding pattern"". Asked earlier whether he would support a longer transition period, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The prime minister has got herself into this mess by failing to reach any meaningful agreements with the EU"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the cost of extending the transition period would have to be ""teased out"" during the negotiations.

Universal credit rollout delayed,"This video can not be played Holly Sargent has had to sell her possessions because of problems receiving universal credit Ministers have bowed to pressure and are planning to further delay the rollout of the flagship welfare reform, universal credit. The system - which will merge six benefits into one payment - has been beset with problems. Leaked documents seen by the BBC reveal plans to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to prevent claimants suffering hardship as they move onto it. The government said it always intended to introduce the benefit slowly. Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, Employment Minister Alok Sharma declined to comment on the leaked documents, and said the government would publish plans for the next stage of universal credit ""in due course"". He added that, by December 2018, universal credit would be available in all job centres for new benefits claimants. The switchover for existing benefit claimants to universal credit will be ""slow and measured"" and start in 2019 with ""no more than 10,000 people"" to ensure the system is working. MPs - including Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood - called for a halt in the roll-out of the reform. What is universal credit? Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told the Commons on Monday that she had been discussing details of universal credit with the chancellor - and details would be revealed in the Budget later this month. The system was supposed to be up and running by April 2017, but is now not expected to be fully operational until December 2023. The Local Government Association welcomed the delay, adding that some of the extra spending should be given to councils so they can provide a safety net to people ""struggling to cope"". It appears that big changes are going to be made in an attempt to reduce the negative impact on people being moved to universal credit. First off, plans have been drawn up to continue paying income support, employment and support allowance, and jobseeker's allowance for two weeks after a claim for universal credit has been made. A similar policy for housing benefit was introduced in last year's Budget, following evidence that some claimants were going into rent arrears. Secondly, there are to be changes to how deductions from a recipient's payment can be made. Claimants can ask for an advance to help them get by while waiting for their first proper universal credit payment - later the government takes deductions from their regular monthly income as pay back. Under the revised plans, the maximum amount that can be deducted will be reduced from 40% to 30% of their total award each month. Thirdly, more help is set to be given to the self-employed, after warnings they could be left in serious financial trouble because of incorrect assumptions by the Department for Work and Pensions about their earnings. Chancellor pressured over universal credit Benefits system 'takes women back to 1950s' Could a basic income replace universal credit? However, the documents highlight that the design of universal credit has already ruled out some concessions. Allowing claimants to receive child tax credits for a fortnight after they apply for the new benefit - which Ms McVey had asked officials to consider - has been ruled out. It would have needed two different systems - the DWP's and HMRC's - to work together to deliver the change, potentially creating additional problems. ""Not having a run-on for child tax credit will be presented as unfavourable treatment of lone parents, who many argue are the most in need of protection of the effects of the move to UC,"" the documents say. The documents seen by the BBC also make clear that the proposed concessions might not actually be achievable. An extract says: ""We can currently offer no assurance that ultimately these proposals will prove to be deliverable, can survive legal challenges where they can be delivered, and do not invite new political criticism by generating new policy issues."" This video can not be played Sir John Major warns the Conservatives over universal credit The government was intending to begin moving almost four million people onto universal credit from January 2019, initially in small batches. Larger scale movements were due to start next July. Now though, initial testing has been pushed back to next summer, and large-scale movement won't begin until November 2020 at the earliest. The leaked papers predict that overall, the latest delay will add an additional nine months to the final deadline for full implementation. The policy was first announced under the coalition government in 2010. It's supposed to simplify benefits for working-age people, replacing income support, jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit, and working tax credit. BBC Reality Check has broken all this down in more detail. Pressure has been mounting on the government for weeks to either delay or halt the next stage of the reform. Much criticism has centred on the time it takes for people applying for universal credit to receive their first payment - 35 days - with some claimants left struggling to pay their bills in that period. On Monday, independent MP Frank Field said the rollout of the system in his constituency of Birkenhead had driven some female claimants to sex work. One Universal Credit recipient, Naomi Krykawiak, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she first applied whilst pregnant, and had to wait around six weeks for the benefit to be accepted. ""It did definitely mean using food banks... it's something I had to do around eight times before the benefit was accepted."" This video can not be played Esther McVey on universal credit: Some will be worse off The Church of England said the fallout from the new benefit system was seen at its food banks across the country. More than 30 Anglican bishops have backed a campaign calling for the government to ""fix"" universal credit. Anger built further last week when Ms McVey said that ""some people will be worse off"" under the new system, amidclaims 3.2 million households,externalwill lose more than Â£2,000 year. The Times newspaper suggested she had told a cabinet meeting some families could lose up to Â£200 a month. Mrs McVey insisted, though, that the most vulnerable would be protected. A Department for Work and Pensions statement said it was taking a ""a slow and measured approach to managed migration [of the system]"" and wanted ""to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptations as we go"". ""We will publish full plans for the next stage of universal credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks."" Labour said the government needed to provide urgent answers about what was going on and what action would be taken ""to tackle the many flaws in the system"".

Rocks ahead for May's government,"A Brexit-supporting member of the cabinet has a simple analogy to explain whether Theresa May's government can survive. The government will crash onto the rocks if it ends up with no deal on Brexit or indefinite membership of an EU customs union, this minister told me. ""So we need to find a place between those two extremes,"" the minister said. If the prime minister opted for membership of a customs union to avoid no deal, then the minister would resign from the cabinet. If Britain fell into no-deal, then there would be no government from which to resign. The comparison of Theresa May to the captain of a stricken ship trying to chart a course between the jagged rocks of no-deal and a customs union shows why the prime minister finds herself in such a politically perilous position. The waterway between the two sets of rocks is fiendishly narrow. As one comes into view - a customs union - the ship appears to lurch towards the no-deal rocks. Brexit talks hit 'real problem' over border DUP plan to vote against the Budget over Brexit red lines How could May get Brexit deal through MPs? The sharp dilemma became apparent when Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, told EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Sunday that the UK could not accept a proposal drawn up by UK and EU officials for the Northern Ireland backstop. This is the arrangement to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland if, by the end of a 20 month transition period following Brexit, the UK and the EU have failed to agree a satisfactory trade deal for the future. The EU reportedly moved over the last week, by saying that the UK as a whole could join this version of the customs union. Brexit-supporting members of the cabinet and others say this would have to have a guaranteed end date, a demand resisted by No 10 which says that is a deal breaker with the EU. In order to provide a definitive guarantee of no hard border in Northern Ireland, the EU stuck to its fundamental position. This states that the prime minister would have to agree that Northern Ireland would remain within an EU regulatory zone just in case the new proposals are not agreed. This is being dubbed the backstop to the backstop which would see checks down the Irish Sea. Theresa May is adamant that the UK as a whole must be treated as one customs territory, with no distinction for Northern Ireland. It appears that the prime minister may be willing to allow separate treatment for Northern Ireland for regulatory checks on agri-products and manufactured goods. Mrs May feels strongly about treating the UK as one customs territory, because she believes that anything else would effectively lead to the break up of the UK. The DUP is warning that it may no longer prop up her government if she gives too much ground. Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman,told me over the summer,externalthat there would be ""physical opposition"" by Unionists to additional barriers placed within the UK between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The current impasse, which means that no UK-EU talks are scheduled before the start of a Brussels summit on Wednesday, means that the rocks of no deal are now starting to hove into view. Supporters of a deal will be hoping that Northern Ireland will provide a positive analogy. Hopes of a deal appeared hopeless in the final days and then - with interventions from Bill Clinton but ill will still hanging in the air - they pulled off the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. But then talks can also fail - and fail dramatically. You can watchNewsnighton BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or onIplayer. Subscribe to the programme onYouTube,externalor follow them onTwitter,external.

Terminally ill 'a priority',"Terminally ill people who were short-changed with benefit payments are to be the priority for reimbursement. The government says it is ""scaling up"" the team trying to identify underpayments, from 50 to 400 people. Mistakes were made when incapacity benefit claimants were moved on to employment and support allowance (ESA) between 2011 to 2014. The government said 300,000 cases were being reviewed, of which ""just under a quarter"" had been underpaid. Benefits claimants underpaid millions The BBC understands assessors wrongly calculated the income of about 75,000 claimants, which could cost up to Â£500m to put right. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said in a written statement: ""I can confirm that, based on departmental analysis, we will be prioritising any individuals whom we know from our systems to be terminally ill. Thereafter we will work through the cases identified as most likely to have been underpaid according to our systems. ""Once an individual is contacted, and the relevant information gathered, they can expect to receive appropriate payment within 12 weeks. I can also confirm that once contacted, individuals will be provided with a dedicated free phone number on which they can make contact with the department."" She added she was committed to ensuring ""that all cases are reviewed and paid by April 2019"". Mistakes began in 2011, when the government started moving benefits recipients on to ESA - which is paid to those with long-term chronic health conditions. ESA was introduced by the Labour government in 2008 to replace incapacity benefit. The department said it had become aware of the problem in December 2016 after the Office for National Statistics published fraud and error figures for the social security system. Frank Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Committee,has described itas a problem of ""historic proportions"" that ""wrongly impoverished"" many claimants.

May: Intensive work needed to get EU deal,"""Intensive"" work is needed to overcome differences on the Irish border and reach a Brexit deal, Theresa May says. Speaking in Brussels, where she hopes to convince her counterparts to back her plan, the UK prime minister said ""considerable progress"" had been made in recent weeks. She has held meetings with key figures before addressing leaders ahead of their dinner this evening. A senior EU official suggested Mrs May had offered ""nothing new"" of substance. ""There was a message of goodwill and readiness to reach an agreement, but I didn't perceive anything substantially new in terms of content,"" said Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Commons Brexit vote must be 'unequivocal' Ahead of the summit, Labour said the government was ""too weak and too divided"" to reach a deal. Earlier Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit at Prime Minister's Questions, with the PM rejecting the Labour leader's claim that her planned long-term relationship with the EU, known as the Chequers plan, was ""dead"". This plan for Brexit was agreed by the Cabinet at the prime ministerâs country residence, Chequers, in July 2018. It proposes tax or tariff-free trade with the EU, while leaving the UK free to pursue trade deals outside the EU. Under the plan, the UK would collect tariffs on the EUâs behalf for any goods entering the country but destined to be sent on to EU countries. Because EU tariffs had been collected, there would not need to be a separate border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But the UK would have to follow EU rules, âthe common rule bookâ, on things like food standards to avoid unnecessary border hold-ups. The plan also proposes ending the free movement of people, giving back the UK control over immigration rules. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson both resigned their posts over the Chequers plan because they believe it means the UK would still be too closely tied to the EU. Both sides say they want to reach a deal, but preparations are taking place for what happens if they cannot agree by the time the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. In a new publication, the French government says,externalBritons wanting to visit France, following a no-deal Brexit, could need a visa if they want to stay for three months or more. And those who were already living there could be treated as being in France illegally unless they have the necessary residence permits. A-Z of Brexit: The sequel Brexit: All you need to know It also said checks would need to be established on goods and people going to and from the UK as well as veterinary checks on animals and animal products. While the draft bill sets out the actions the government could take, it is not yet clear what the measures will be and the publication states any rules for expats could easily be adapted. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was still time to reach a ""good and sustainable Brexit deal"" but that her government was also preparing for no deal in areas like citizens' rights and customs. This video can not be played PMQs: Corbyn and May on post-Brexit Chequers trade deal In the negotiations, she added, there should be a ""significant difference between a membership of the EU and a partnership with the EU as a third country"". Wednesday's European Council meeting was meant to be the occasion when the remaining 27 EU member states gave the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU. Both sides want to get an agreement in place within the next few weeks to avoid the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March. But chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to say talks have failed to make the ""decisive progress"" the EU wanted to see before agreeing to a special summit. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said: ""I think what's more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there won't be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on. ""And I think that's sensible. What we don't want to do is create drama around the build-up to a new summit date and not actually have something to sign off on."" There is also speculation some EU leaders will suggest using a November summit for a no-deal planning session instead. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The worst-case scenario for Downing Street is that EU leaders are so fed up with the UK position and what they see as the lack of reality, that on Thursday, they formally say they will hold a no-deal summit in November. That would switch them on to a track that would be hard to get off once in motion. One EU source expressed disbelief that Theresa May thought she could turn up on Wednesday with nothing new. It was simply crazy, in their view, to suggest that the ball can be lobbed back into the EU court. The best case - and it seems right now unlikely - scenario is for the EU to say that there is a deal in reach, so let's get a date in the diary for the sign-off next month. What seems more likely is a holding position. EU leaders could give some kinds of vague noises that both sides still want to pursue negotiations, so that the talks can get going again. One Brussels source said that while it is ""time for choices"", they could give the prime minister space and time to build a majority at home for a deal. Read Laura's full blog Mrs May will address her fellow leaders on Wednesday evening before their dinner - before that she will hold one-on-one talks with European Council President Donald Tusk as well as Mr Juncker and Irish premiere Leo Varadkar. But she will leave before the meal where the EU leaders decide what to do next. Mr Tusk, president of the European Council, said on Tuesday he saw ""no grounds for optimism"" that the two sides could bridge their differences on the Irish border, but appealed for ""goodwill and determination"" to try and bring an agreement nearer. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the border between the UK and the EU when the UK leaves the EU. Both sides want to avoid that border having checkpoints or other physical infrastructure to carry out checks on goods, but they can't agree how that should be done. They are discussing a ""backstop"" - a position of last resort, to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. The EU's suggestion would see Northern Ireland remaining in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system, but Mrs May says that would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. She suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020. The EU also says any backstop plan should not have an end date - something Mrs May has previously insisted on, leading to the possibility of a ""backstop to the backstop"". The UK and EU negotiators have, separately, discussed extending the 21-month transition period by up to a year, to improve the chances of getting a full trade deal and reduce the chance of needing an Irish border backstop. Extending the transition period has never been ruled out by the UK government, but it is unlikely to be acceptable to Conservative Brexiteers. Downing Street has said they are not calling for an extension. Theresa May was greeted by EU Commission leader Jean-Claude Juncker when she arrived in Brussels On the eve of Wednesday's summit, former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major attacked Brexiteers, saying ""those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for."" ""They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer. That will never be forgotten - nor forgiven."" Sir John is among a host of former senior politicians, including Tony Blair, and ex-deputy prime ministers Lord Heseltine and Nick Clegg, stepping up calls for another referendum. They have written a series of articles in European newspapers backing a so-called People's Vote, with the option to remain in the EU. Sir John's remarks were met with barbed responses from Jacob Rees-Mogg and other Conservative Brexiteers who said he had compromised the UK's sovereignty by signing up to the Maastricht treaty in the early 1990s without consulting the people.

"Â£5,000 backpay for 180,000 benefit claimants","Tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits will receive backdated payments averaging Â£5,000 following government errors. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has revealed it is paying more than Â£1.5bn due to the mistakes. Some people have already received payouts of more than Â£10,000. The mistaken calculations were made when people were moved on to the main sickness benefit, the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The errors werefirst revealed by BBC News in November, but the scale of the underpayments has now emerged. 'I have no idea how it was worked out' Philip Stanton, 58, got a letter earlier this year about the backdated payments, followed by a cheque for Â£2,250 in July. ""You feel brilliant at first because when you're living on Â£73 a week, that's a heck of a lot of money - though of course it won't last forever,"" he told BBC News. ""But then you think, 'what if they hadn't found out? What else is there?'. I have no idea how it was worked out or even if it's the right amount."" Mr Stanton, who has been receiving sickness benefits ""on and off for 10 years"", has anxiety and depression as well as problems with his back. He said he was told his payment went back to 2014. ""A couple of my friends are in the same situation and one of them got more than me, which is why I thought I would query it,"" said Mr Stanton, from Northampton. ""But someone else hasn't heard anything. ""I'm very grateful to get the money, but with my dealings with them, I tend not to trust them."" He said he has asked how the payment was calculated and is waiting for a response. Assessors wrongly calculated the income of thousands of people during the process that resulted in people moving from incapacity benefit and severe disability allowance onto ESA. Most of the errors occurred between 2011 and 2014. In anewly published document,external, the DWP said: ""We estimate that around 180,000 people could be owed arrears payments, with around 105,000 estimated to be repaid during 2018-19 and 75,000 during 2019-20."" The government had previously said that all the backdated payments would be completed by April 2019. The DWP said that the backdated payments totalled Â£970m. It now also faced a larger bill for ongoing ESA awards, costing the department more than Â£700m extra until 2024-25, bringing the total cost to Â£1.67bn. Frank Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""It is welcome news that the government is finally making progress towards repaying people who have missed out on ESA. ""Its best estimate is that it owes claimants Â£970m - but the final bill could be even higher. The government must learn lessons from this appalling failure, as it faces the much bigger challenge of moving people onto Universal Credit."" The government has 400 people working on claims, with the priority on those who are terminally ill. Around 18,000 arrears payments have already been made totalling Â£120m. The average payment so far is about Â£7,000. Universal credit rollout delayed yet again ESA repayments: Terminally ill people are 'priority' The government's original decision to only backdate payments to 2014 was legally challenged by the Child Poverty Action Group. CPAG chief executive Alison Garnham said it was good news that 180,000 people would now receive backdated compensation, but said ""it should concern us all that [the DWP] so significantly underestimated the number of people affected"". She added: ""It should not have taken legal action to get vulnerable people the money they were entitled to from the outset to avoid hardship."" In a statement, the DWP said: ""Anyone affected by this historic error will receive all of the money they are entitled to. ""We have worked with charities and other disability organisations to make sure that we are providing the right support to all affected claimants and are hiring and allocating more staff to do that."" Labour introduced ESA in 2008, claiming the change would move a million people off sickness benefit and save the Treasury Â£7bn. The shift from incapacity benefits to ESA was then accelerated by the coalition government. The payments have come to light in a week when the government has faced severe criticism for its flagship welfare reform, Universal Credit. On Tuesday, BBC News revealed that ministers were further delaying the rollout of the system, which merges six benefits into one.

Turkish police search Saudi consul's home,"The investigation team included prosecutors and forensics experts in white overalls Turkish investigators have entered the residence of the Saudi consul in Istanbul to gather more evidence about the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi. Turkish officials suspect the Saudi journalist was killed during a visit to the nearby consulate on 2 October. The consul, Mohammed al-Otaibi, flew back to Riyadh on Tuesday. He denies knowing what happened to Mr Khashoggi. However, a Turkish newspaper saysMr Otaibi can be heard in purported audio recordings of Mr Khashoggi's death,external. Yeni Safak, which is close to the government, quotes him as telling alleged Saudi agents sent to Istanbul: ""Do this outside. You're going to get me in trouble.""

This video can not be played President Trump speaking in the Oval Office In Washington, President Trump says his administration has asked to hear the audio recording - ""if it exists"". ""I want to find out what happened, where was the fault,"" he told reporters. He also dismissed the idea he was ""giving cover"" to the Saudis - a key US ally. Mr Trump earlier cautioned against rushing to blame Saudi leaders, telling the Associated Press thatthey were being treated as ""guilty until proven innocent"",external. Earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the case with Turkey's president and foreign minister during a visit to Ankara. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the meeting was ""beneficial and fruitful"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan On Tuesday, Mr Pompeo travelled to Riyadh for talks with Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who he said ""strongly denied"" any involvement in the journalist's disappearance. Mr Khashoggi is a US resident and columnist for the Washington Post who went into self-imposed exile last year after reportedly being warned by Saudi officials to stop criticising the crown prince's policies. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Donald Trump and a world of disorder On Wednesday afternoon, Turkish investigators entered the Saudi consul's residence, about 200m (650ft) from the consulate, as part of the probe into Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. The team reportedly included prosecutors and forensics experts in white overalls. The search of the consul's residence was delayed by a day The search had been expected to take place on Tuesday, but it was delayed because the consul's family were still inside, Mr Cavusoglu said. They eventually left Turkey on a commercial flight on Tuesday afternoon. Several vehicles with Saudi diplomatic number plates were filmed by CCTV cameras moving from the consulate to the residence just under two hours after the journalist entered the consulate on 2 October. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Turkish investigators quoted by two news agencies said the search of the consulate itself earlier this week had yielded more evidence that Mr Khashoggi was killed there. Mr Khashoggi arrived at the consulate at 13:14 local time for an appointment to obtain paperwork so he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e. Saudi officials have insisted Mr Khashoggi left the consulate soon afterwards and came to no harm. But Turkish officials believe an assault and struggle took place in the building.

Where are house prices rising the fastest?,"Parts of Nottingham are popular among house-hunters House prices are rising the fastest in the East Midlands, increasing by 6.5% in the year to August, according to official statistics. Wales also showed a significant rise - up by 6.2% over the same period, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, a ""sustained slowdown"" in the south and east of England has pulled back house price growth across the UK. On average, the typical UK home has risen in value by 3.2% over the year.

Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC, said: ""The London market has been flat over this period with Brexit-related uncertainty undoubtedly affecting the confidence of buyers and sellers alike."" In Scotland, the average price increased by 4.1% over the year to Â£153,000. The average price in Northern Ireland rose by 4.4% to Â£133,000. A recent report by the UK's biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax, said that fewer homes had been on the market in 2018 than in any year of the past decade.

Animal prints help Asos profits roar,"Soaring sales of animal print clothing helped Asos post a Â£500m rise in sales last year. The online fashion retailer sold 1.3 million animal print garments across both menswear and womenswear, offering 2,000 options during the period. The firm reported revenue of Â£2.4bn for the year to 31 August, with profits jumping 28% to a better than expected Â£102m. Shares jumped 15% on the news but are still down by about 10% this year. Asos chief executive Nick Beighton said: ""The potential for our business is huge and we remain focussed on building Asos into the world's number one destination for fashion-loving twenty-somethings."" During its financial year, Asos said it added around 5,000 new items to its website every week, with about 87,000 products in stock at any point in time. Other popular trends included button through dresses, with more than half a million garments sold in varying fabrics and prints. Sales of plus size clothing climbed Sales of inclusive fit sizes - including petite, tall, maternity, plus-size, curve and wide - also jumped by 37%. Asos sales have risen more than a fifth in each of the past three years as consumers continue to buy more online. While the company has outperformed high street rivals such as Next or Marks and Spencer, investors get nervous when it misses its targets. Shares had dropped by a fifth since January before Wednesday's results and fell sharply in July when the retailer missed its third quarter targets. Asos shares rose Â£7.80 to Â£57.78 in afternoon trading, valuing the company at Â£4.2bn. The rise has erased some of this year's losses: the shares were above Â£68.64 in early January. Richard Hunter at Interactive Investor said: ""Of slight concern is the fact that Asos will need to maintain this breakneck speed of growth to continue justifying its lofty valuation, as evidenced in the July update when the shares were hit after slightly weaker than expected sales. ""However, its ongoing investment in the business and planned international further expansion means there is much to go for."" Greg Lawless at Shore Capital maintained its ""buy"" rating on the shares. ""We believe that Asos remains a structural winner, given the shift online by consumers, together with harnessing the global opportunity as the 'go-to' platform for online clothing,"" he said.

Mystery donor gives thousands to ill boy,"This video can not be played Mystery donor gives thousands to ill Shropshire boy A mystery donor has given Â£100,000 to an ill four-year-old boy to enable him to go to the US for potentially life-saving cancer treatment. The parents of Zac Oliver from Broseley, Shropshire, who has a rare strain of leukaemia, have been campaigning to raise Â£500,000. The donation, first reported in theDaily Mail,external, ensured the family reached its target. NHS England has been asked to comment on why Zac cannot be treated in the UK. Zac's mother Hannah Oliver-Willetts, 33, who is an occupational therapist, said she received a phone call out of the blue telling her ""not to worry"" and ""pack her bags"", reassuring her it was not a hoax. Hours later, the money appeared in their bank account. ""It takes a very special type of person to do that"", she said. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Zac was diagnosed withacute lymphoblastic leukaemiain May. Zac is believed to be the only child in the UK with the near-haploid strain of the disease He is believed to be the only child in the UK with the near-haploid strain of the disease, a condition that affects only one in 200 childhood leukaemia patients worldwide. He is not eligible to receive the type of treatment he needs in the UK because his condition does not currently meet criteria set by the NHS, his parents said. Doctors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia say its 17-week CAR T-cell therapy will give Zac a 60 to 80 per cent chance of survival, she added. Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show on Wednesday, Mrs Oliver-Willetts said: ""Hopefully we will come back with a cured little boy who will get his life back."" His parents managed to raise Â£400,000 in just a few weeks thanks to the donations of neighbours and friends in Shropshire. They ran a special event called ZacFest in Telford Town Park last weekend that is understood to have raised about Â£10,000. 'Dangerous' dahlias must go says council Giants creator to get freedom of city Ice cream vans attempt world record scoop X-Factor judge Simon Cowell also pledged to donate Â£50,000 to the appeal. Zac will now undergo chemotherapy at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford and will travel to the US after a week of recuperation at home. ""Everyone who saw a donation pot and threw a quid in, every child who emptied their money box... we can't thank everybody enough"", Mrs Oliver-Willets added.

Grand Theft Auto 'cheats' homes raided,"Grand Theft Auto lets players take on the role of criminals The publisher of video game Grand Theft Auto V has been granted the right to search the homes of five people accused of making cheat software. The court order allowed Rockstar Games and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, to search two properties in Melbourne, Australia,  for evidence related to a cheat known as Infamous. The Australian federal court has also frozen the assets of the five, who have not yet filed a defence. The cheat went offline six months ago. It allowed players who paid about $40 (Â£30) to manipulate the gaming environment, generate virtual currency and use a ""god mode"" feature that makes players invincible. Tech news site Motherboard said using the cheat software,external""undermines enjoyment for users playing fairly in online modes"". The cheat allowed gamers to alter the features and people in the fictional city of Los Santos Under the court order, the five people, named as Christopher Anderson, Cyrus Lesser, Sfinktah, Koroush Anderson and Koroush Jeddian, are prevented from creating or using game cheats.

Editor-in-chief Ernesto van der Sar told the BBC: ""The search and freezing order go beyond what I've ever seen in any cheating related cases. ""It shows that the copyright holders and the court take this issue rather seriously."" ""Many cheaters may believe that it's a relatively harmless activity - but they ruin the fun for legitimate players.

Network Rail said disruption was due to last for the rest of the day and warned that services could still be affected on Thursday morning.

'Zero hygiene' takeaways listed on Just EatOutlets rated zero by the Food Standards Agency are included among those listed on the food ordering app.UK,"This video can not be played How restaurants with poor hygiene are still available on Just Eat Many takeaway shops in England with a zero rating for hygiene are among those listed on the Just Eat food ordering app, a BBC investigation has found. Half of outlets rated as zero by the Food Standards Agency in Manchester, Bristol and London appear on the app. A consumer rights campaigner has called for Just Eat to display the hygiene score alongside each entry. Just Eat said it took the issue ""very seriously"" and will trial the ratings on its Northern Ireland listings. The BBC investigation found: 20 out of the 31 takeaways rated zero in Birmingham are on Just Eat Nine of the 13 takeaways rated zero in Liverpool are listed there In Manchester, Bristol and London, half of the takeaways with a rating of zero are on the platform Local authorities are responsible for inspecting restaurants and takeaways. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland outlets are given a food hygiene rating ranging from zero, for ""in need of urgent improvement"", to five, for ""food hygiene is very good"". An inspector carries out her work in a kitchen in Ealing, West London ""It's absolutely filthy."" That's a pretty damning assessment handed out after Ealing Council's environmental health team carried out an inspection of a pub in west London - but operations manager Helen Statham believes she has good reason. During the visit, they found multiple food safety issues - including mice and rat droppings in a store room. Ms Statham added: ""There was no sanitiser, so they can't clean effectively. Food [was left] out at room temperature, very high-risk food like rice. And [there were] no records."" The pub has a zero hygiene rating - meaning it is in need of ""urgent improvement"". But that is not just an issue for those who eat at the pub. It also offers a takeaway service - with a listing on Just Eat. And on that app and website, it gets a four-star customer review rating - but the hygiene score is not disclosed. What happens next differs between the nations. Restaurants in Wales and Northern Ireland must display their rating prominently. In England, many outlets choose to do so, particularly if it shows a high score for hygiene, but it is not mandatory. Mouse droppings on washing up gloves at a takeaway in Walthamstow, east London, that was on Just Eat Scotland has a different system, with just three ratings - Pass, Improvement Required and Exempt Premises (which are given to premises such as newsagents or chemists that are checked but are not predominantly food businesses). Ratings are then displayed on the Food Standards Agency website. 'Scores on the doors' call on food hygiene Birmingham 'worst for food hygiene' Food safety: Five things to watch out for Just Eat, which describes itself as ""a world leader in online and mobile food ordering"", said it was ""actively working to raise standards"". It said the company offered free accredited food hygiene training to any restaurant that signed up to the platform. It added: ""Whenever any potential food safety issues are brought to our attention, our restaurant compliance team will review, investigate and liaise with the local authority."" The company pointed out that for each outlet, it already does include a link to the Food Standards Agency website, at the bottom of both the menu and the information page. Customers do then need to input the name and postcode of the restaurant on the FSA website to find the relevant hygiene rating. Cockroaches caught in a trap at a takeaway in York But consumer rights campaigner Chris Emmins says he believes this is not enough and wants Just Eat to display the hygiene rating for each restaurant on their individual entry. This is an idea that Just Eat says it is willing to try out, with a trial planned for Northern Ireland outlets, so it can ""test and learn what customers want"". Mr Chris Emmins believes Just Eat also needs to lead a more active change. ""There is a duty on all businesses to safeguard their customers, and it's no good saying you are just an agent,"" he said. ""If that was a standard traditional business, a supermarket or a travel agent, they would be hauled over the coals considerably for a failure for that sort of lack of due diligence."" Environmental Health took this picture of dead mice at a takeaway in Walthamstow, east London Ms Statham, from Ealing Council, added her frustration. ""Members of the public are of the view they are buying their food from that business, but I think at the same time there is a responsibility or a part to play by somewhere like Just Eat in order to help to improve those standards,"" she said. Just Eat entered the FTSE 100 last year and now employs more than 2,900 staff across 12 different countries. Food outlets pay to sign up to the platform, and, in return, Just Eat promotes the business and takes orders and payments - with the outlet charged a commission on each order. A rating appears alongside the listings, but this is generated by collated customer scores rather than decided by Just East itself.

'Miracle' baby's heart stopped for 22 minutes,"Lacey spent four months in hospital after emergency surgery at five days old A premature baby whose heart stopped beating for 22 minutes has been called a ""miracle"" by doctors who treated her, as she celebrates her first birthday. Lacey Sherriff, who was born at 27 weeks weighing 1.4lb (635g), had two cardiac arrests during emergency surgery when she was five days old. Her parents prepared for the worst - but their daughter survived. Doctors at St George's Hospital, in London, say Lacey should develop and live a normal life. Lacey was born via emergency Caesarean section at St Peter's Hospital before being transferred to St George's five days later for urgent surgery to treat a severe bowel condition called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). During the operation, her heart stopped beating for 12 minutes before doctors managed to stabilise her. And then her heart stopped again - for another 10 minutes. Dr Thomas Breen, consultant anaesthetist at St George's who led the theatre and resuscitation team, said: ""The operation was going well but she deteriorated and we started to fear the worst - but we didn't give up."" He said he had never seen a case of a baby so young and so sick, who had essentially 'died', recovering with no signs of brain damage. Dr Breen said Lacey was ""clearly a fighter"" who had defied the odds to pull through. Lacey is celebrating her first birthday after a miraculous recovery during surgery Lacey's parents, Louise, 39, and Philip, 41, who live in Ashford, Middlesex, knew she was very unwell and her chances were slim. ""We didn't think she'd survive surgery and thought we'd be registering Lacey's birth and death certificates at the same time,"" Louise said. ""It was such a rollercoaster of emotions - first thinking we'd be going home as a family of four, to three, then back to four again."" Undergoing major surgery at such a young age carries major risks but without it, doctors say, Lacey had little chance of survival. After the surgery, her condition improved slowly each day but she needed further surgery at 13 days old to sort out problems with her stoma, which was fitted during the first operation. Lacey was finally discharged after 111 days in hospital, in February 2018. Mr Zahid Mukhtar, paediatric surgeon at the hospital, said: ""She'll continue to have follow-up appointments but she should develop and live a normal life, which is excellent news. Lacey was able to join her parents Philip and Louise, and her brother Alfie at home ""Happy first birthday, Lacey - the miracle baby."" Lacey underwent surgery to reverse the stoma last month, which was successful, allowing her to use her bowel normally. The family are now back at home in Ashford with Lacey and their five-year-old son, Alfie. Louise said the four months Lacey had been in hospital had been very difficult, involving a three-hour round trip to see her from home - but she had known she had been in safe hands. ""My daughter wouldn't be celebrating her first birthday if it wasn't for the staff at St George's. ""The care from the moment we arrived to when we left was phenomenal. I can't fault it.""

Student 'baked grandma's ashes in cookies',"Police are investigating reports that a US schoolgirl gave cookies containing her grandmother's ashes to classmates. She reportedly handed the baked goods to fellow students who were not aware of the contents.

The Da Vinci High School declined to comment on the story, but said those involved were ""remorseful"". The supposedly ash-laden sugar cookies were handed out to nine students, police said, but they were unsure of how many students were involved in distributing them.

Attack on Crimea college kills 17,"Russia has said the attack was an act of ""mass murder"" At least 19 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in a shooting at a college in Russian-annexed Crimea. An 18-year-old student ran through the Kerch technical college firing at fellow pupils before killing himself, Russian investigators say. Witnesses have also spoken of at least one blast caused by an unidentified explosive. The motive is unclear. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in a move condemned by many Western powers. The annexation marked the start of a simmering conflict involving Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine that goes on to this day. There are contradictory reports about the chronology of Wednesday's attack. The alleged perpetrator, named Vladislav Roslyakov, is said to have run from room to room as he fired, starting in the area near the canteen. He then shot himself dead, Russia's investigative committee said. Photos later emerged in Russian media purportedly showing the body of the attacker in the college library. The investigative committee said initial examinations suggested all the victims died of gunshot wounds, but some reports speak of shrapnel injuries. This video can not be played Emergency crews respond to the attack At the same time, Russia's law enforcement sources are quoted by local media as saying that the attacker had detonated a bomb in the canteen before starting shooting. Soon after reports of a blast in the college, investigators released a statement saying an explosive device filled with ""metal objects"" had detonated in the dining area. Several witnesses maintain they heard one or more explosions. Investigators later said they found a second device among the personal possessions of the gunman and that it had been disarmed. BBC Russian has been speaking to witnesses, including Igor Zakharevsky, who was in the canteen when the gunman struck. ""I was at the epicentre of the first explosion, at the entrance, near the buffet,"" he said. ""I was in complete shock and one of my classmates started pulling me away. Then I heard several shots at intervals of two or three seconds. After a while there was another explosion."" A businessman near the college described hearing an explosion and seeing a large window shatter. Crimea profile Russia's Crimea bridge gets giant arch The incident was earlier described as a ""terrorist act"", but Russia's investigative committee has now reclassified it as ""mass murder"". President Vladimir Putin said the attack was a ""tragic event"" and expressed condolences to the victims' relatives. Three days of mourning in Crimea have been declared from Thursday. By Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Until now, if you had told people in Crimea there had been a mass school shooting, most would have thought you were talking about the United States. Now all that has changed. The shooting spree in the Kerch Polytechnic has left the peninsula, annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, in shock. But should it come as such a surprise?

There have been five attacks in schools in Russia this year where a number of children were injured. In Kerch, questions are already being asked: how did Vladislav Roslyakov manage to obtain a licence for a hunting weapon? And how was he able to launch such a deadly attack on his college? His precise motives remain unclear. But there are suggestions the fourth-year student had developed a hostile attitude to the college. Russia's RBC TV interviewed a friend who said Roslyakov ""hated the technical school very much"" and had vowed ""revenge"" on his teachers. National guard soldiers were deployed It was reported that the attacker had recently been given a weapons permit, but Crimea's ombudsman for the rights of the child, Irina Klyueva, later questioned this. ""As far as I understand, it was fake information, although it is not yet known exactly,"" she was quoted as saying by Russia's Gazeta.ru. Classmates also say the suspected attacker was very self-contained, hardly communicated with anyone, and had long ago stopped using social networks. A local official said most of the victims were students of the college, which is a vocational school for 850 teenagers. A major emergency response operation was launched as the victims were taken to hospitals. At least 40 people were injured. Four military planes were ready to evacuate the wounded and military hospital facilities were ready to accept victims if necessary, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said. The peninsula has been a major area of dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine, and many other countries, have never recognised its annexation four years ago. The Crimea issue and the presence of Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine continue to strain relations. Kerch is situated at the point where Russia built a bridge between the Crimea and Russia. In a reminder of how poor relations are between Russia and Ukraine, the speaker of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, suggested Kiev might have been behind the attack. ""The entire evil inflicted on the land of Crimea is coming from the official Ukrainian authorities"", he said.

Fracking protesters freed on appeal,"The three men left prison hours after the ruling was handed down Three men jailed for a fracking site protest have been freed after judges ruled their sentences were ""excessive"". Simon Blevins, Richard Roberts and Rich Loizou became the first UK anti-fracking protesters to be sent to prison, after climbing lorries at Cuadrilla's Lancashire site. Court of Appeal judges ruled they should not have been jailed and imposed conditional discharges. The judgement was met by applause and singing from supporters in the court. A complaint against the original sentencing judge, the details of which are unknown, is being investigated. Speaking outside HMP Preston, shortly after his release, Loizou said the court's decision ""affirmed that when people peacefully break the law out of a moral obligation to prevent the expansion of fossil fuel industries, they should not be sent to prison"". Loizou's father said the time in prison would ""not change Rich's mind"" Blevins, 26, Loizou, 31, from Devon, and Roberts, 36, wereconvicted of public nuisance at Preston Crown Courtin September. The three defendants had climbed on lorries outside the fracking site in Preston New Road in July 2017, in a demonstration which lasted close to 100 hours. Blevins, from Sheffield, and Roberts, from London, were jailed for 16 months each and Loizou received a 15-month custodial term. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said an ""immediate custodial sentence in the case of these appellants was manifestly excessive"". ""In our judgment, the appropriate sentence which should have been imposed... was a community order with a significant requirement of unpaid work,"" he said. ""But these appellants have been in prison for six weeks. ""As a result, and only for that reason, we have concluded that the appropriate sentence now is a conditional discharge for two years."" This video can not be played About 200 people marched through Preston in support of the men on 6 October The judge did not change the sentence of Julian Brock, 47, from Torquay, who received a 12-month suspended term for his part in the protest after admitting public nuisance. He added the full reasons for the ruling would be published at a later date. A spokesman for the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office said it had received a complaint regarding Judge Robert Altham, which ""will be considered in accordance with the Judicial Conduct Rules 2014"". Fracking starts at landmark site What is fracking? Residents 'used for fracking experiment' Speaking after the hearing, Loizou's father Platon said the experience would ""not change Rich's mind"", adding: ""Richie and the rest of the boys... will continue to do this and continue to tell the whole world about what we are doing to ourselves."" Roberts's partner Michelle Easton said the families would catch the next train to Preston to ""go and pick our boys up"". ""It is still a conviction but it is within the rights that we have in this country - we don't lock up protesters who are peaceful,"" she said. A large group of the men's supporters gathered at the court before the hearing The men's appeal was supported by human rights organisation Liberty and environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth. Katie de Kauwe, the environmental group's lawyer, said the sentences had been ""disproportionate"" and Liberty's Emma Norton called the ruling a ""victory for human rights and civil liberties"". Kirsty Brimelow QC, who acted for the three men, said their legal teams would now consider whether to challenge their convictions on the basis of ""apparent bias"" by Judge Altham, who conducted the trial and sentenced the activists. Lord Burnett said during the hearing there was ""no evidence"" that the judge had any financial interest in fracking. Following the men's convictions, theDaily Mirror reported,externalJudge Altham had family links to the oil and gas industry. The judicial code of conduct states a judge's impartiality may be questioned if family members are ""politically active"" or have ""financial interest"" in the outcome of a case. A spokesman for the Judges' Council said there were ""longstanding principles, set out in case law, which guide how judges approach possible conflicts of interest"". ""They ensure that when hearing a case, a judge will be mindful of possible conflicts of interest and can draw relevant matters to the attention of parties in the case,"" he added.

May: My Brexit plan is not dead,"""Intensive"" work is needed to overcome differences on the Irish border and reach a Brexit deal, Theresa May says. Speaking in Brussels, where she hopes to convince her counterparts to back her plan, the UK prime minister said ""considerable progress"" had been made in recent weeks. She has held meetings with key figures before addressing leaders ahead of their dinner this evening. A senior EU official suggested Mrs May had offered ""nothing new"" of substance. ""There was a message of goodwill and readiness to reach an agreement, but I didn't perceive anything substantially new in terms of content,"" said Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Commons Brexit vote must be 'unequivocal' Ahead of the summit, Labour said the government was ""too weak and too divided"" to reach a deal. Earlier Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit at Prime Minister's Questions, with the PM rejecting the Labour leader's claim that her planned long-term relationship with the EU, known as the Chequers plan, was ""dead"". This plan for Brexit was agreed by the Cabinet at the prime ministerâs country residence, Chequers, in July 2018. It proposes tax or tariff-free trade with the EU, while leaving the UK free to pursue trade deals outside the EU. Under the plan, the UK would collect tariffs on the EUâs behalf for any goods entering the country but destined to be sent on to EU countries. Because EU tariffs had been collected, there would not need to be a separate border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But the UK would have to follow EU rules, âthe common rule bookâ, on things like food standards to avoid unnecessary border hold-ups. The plan also proposes ending the free movement of people, giving back the UK control over immigration rules. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson both resigned their posts over the Chequers plan because they believe it means the UK would still be too closely tied to the EU. Both sides say they want to reach a deal, but preparations are taking place for what happens if they cannot agree by the time the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. In a new publication, the French government says,externalBritons wanting to visit France, following a no-deal Brexit, could need a visa if they want to stay for three months or more. And those who were already living there could be treated as being in France illegally unless they have the necessary residence permits. A-Z of Brexit: The sequel Brexit: All you need to know It also said checks would need to be established on goods and people going to and from the UK as well as veterinary checks on animals and animal products. While the draft bill sets out the actions the government could take, it is not yet clear what the measures will be and the publication states any rules for expats could easily be adapted. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was still time to reach a ""good and sustainable Brexit deal"" but that her government was also preparing for no deal in areas like citizens' rights and customs. This video can not be played PMQs: Corbyn and May on post-Brexit Chequers trade deal In the negotiations, she added, there should be a ""significant difference between a membership of the EU and a partnership with the EU as a third country"". Wednesday's European Council meeting was meant to be the occasion when the remaining 27 EU member states gave the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU. Both sides want to get an agreement in place within the next few weeks to avoid the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March. But chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to say talks have failed to make the ""decisive progress"" the EU wanted to see before agreeing to a special summit. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said: ""I think what's more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there won't be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on. ""And I think that's sensible. What we don't want to do is create drama around the build-up to a new summit date and not actually have something to sign off on."" There is also speculation some EU leaders will suggest using a November summit for a no-deal planning session instead. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The worst-case scenario for Downing Street is that EU leaders are so fed up with the UK position and what they see as the lack of reality, that on Thursday, they formally say they will hold a no-deal summit in November. That would switch them on to a track that would be hard to get off once in motion. One EU source expressed disbelief that Theresa May thought she could turn up on Wednesday with nothing new. It was simply crazy, in their view, to suggest that the ball can be lobbed back into the EU court. The best case - and it seems right now unlikely - scenario is for the EU to say that there is a deal in reach, so let's get a date in the diary for the sign-off next month. What seems more likely is a holding position. EU leaders could give some kinds of vague noises that both sides still want to pursue negotiations, so that the talks can get going again. One Brussels source said that while it is ""time for choices"", they could give the prime minister space and time to build a majority at home for a deal. Read Laura's full blog Mrs May will address her fellow leaders on Wednesday evening before their dinner - before that she will hold one-on-one talks with European Council President Donald Tusk as well as Mr Juncker and Irish premiere Leo Varadkar. But she will leave before the meal where the EU leaders decide what to do next. Mr Tusk, president of the European Council, said on Tuesday he saw ""no grounds for optimism"" that the two sides could bridge their differences on the Irish border, but appealed for ""goodwill and determination"" to try and bring an agreement nearer. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the border between the UK and the EU when the UK leaves the EU. Both sides want to avoid that border having checkpoints or other physical infrastructure to carry out checks on goods, but they can't agree how that should be done. They are discussing a ""backstop"" - a position of last resort, to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. The EU's suggestion would see Northern Ireland remaining in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system, but Mrs May says that would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. She suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020. The EU also says any backstop plan should not have an end date - something Mrs May has previously insisted on, leading to the possibility of a ""backstop to the backstop"". The UK and EU negotiators have, separately, discussed extending the 21-month transition period by up to a year, to improve the chances of getting a full trade deal and reduce the chance of needing an Irish border backstop. Extending the transition period has never been ruled out by the UK government, but it is unlikely to be acceptable to Conservative Brexiteers. Downing Street has said they are not calling for an extension. Theresa May was greeted by EU Commission leader Jean-Claude Juncker when she arrived in Brussels On the eve of Wednesday's summit, former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major attacked Brexiteers, saying ""those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for."" ""They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer. That will never be forgotten - nor forgiven."" Sir John is among a host of former senior politicians, including Tony Blair, and ex-deputy prime ministers Lord Heseltine and Nick Clegg, stepping up calls for another referendum. They have written a series of articles in European newspapers backing a so-called People's Vote, with the option to remain in the EU. Sir John's remarks were met with barbed responses from Jacob Rees-Mogg and other Conservative Brexiteers who said he had compromised the UK's sovereignty by signing up to the Maastricht treaty in the early 1990s without consulting the people.

"Benefits errors trigger Â£5,000 refunds","Tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits will receive backdated payments averaging Â£5,000 following government errors. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has revealed it is paying more than Â£1.5bn due to the mistakes. Some people have already received payouts of more than Â£10,000. The mistaken calculations were made when people were moved on to the main sickness benefit, the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The errors werefirst revealed by BBC News in November, but the scale of the underpayments has now emerged. 'I have no idea how it was worked out' Philip Stanton, 58, got a letter earlier this year about the backdated payments, followed by a cheque for Â£2,250 in July. ""You feel brilliant at first because when you're living on Â£73 a week, that's a heck of a lot of money - though of course it won't last forever,"" he told BBC News. ""But then you think, 'what if they hadn't found out? What else is there?'. I have no idea how it was worked out or even if it's the right amount."" Mr Stanton, who has been receiving sickness benefits ""on and off for 10 years"", has anxiety and depression as well as problems with his back. He said he was told his payment went back to 2014. ""A couple of my friends are in the same situation and one of them got more than me, which is why I thought I would query it,"" said Mr Stanton, from Northampton. ""But someone else hasn't heard anything. ""I'm very grateful to get the money, but with my dealings with them, I tend not to trust them."" He said he has asked how the payment was calculated and is waiting for a response. Assessors wrongly calculated the income of thousands of people during the process that resulted in people moving from incapacity benefit and severe disability allowance onto ESA. Most of the errors occurred between 2011 and 2014. In anewly published document,external, the DWP said: ""We estimate that around 180,000 people could be owed arrears payments, with around 105,000 estimated to be repaid during 2018-19 and 75,000 during 2019-20."" The government had previously said that all the backdated payments would be completed by April 2019. The DWP said that the backdated payments totalled Â£970m. It now also faced a larger bill for ongoing ESA awards, costing the department more than Â£700m extra until 2024-25, bringing the total cost to Â£1.67bn. Frank Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""It is welcome news that the government is finally making progress towards repaying people who have missed out on ESA. ""Its best estimate is that it owes claimants Â£970m - but the final bill could be even higher. The government must learn lessons from this appalling failure, as it faces the much bigger challenge of moving people onto Universal Credit."" The government has 400 people working on claims, with the priority on those who are terminally ill. Around 18,000 arrears payments have already been made totalling Â£120m. The average payment so far is about Â£7,000. Universal credit rollout delayed yet again ESA repayments: Terminally ill people are 'priority' The government's original decision to only backdate payments to 2014 was legally challenged by the Child Poverty Action Group. CPAG chief executive Alison Garnham said it was good news that 180,000 people would now receive backdated compensation, but said ""it should concern us all that [the DWP] so significantly underestimated the number of people affected"". She added: ""It should not have taken legal action to get vulnerable people the money they were entitled to from the outset to avoid hardship."" In a statement, the DWP said: ""Anyone affected by this historic error will receive all of the money they are entitled to. ""We have worked with charities and other disability organisations to make sure that we are providing the right support to all affected claimants and are hiring and allocating more staff to do that."" Labour introduced ESA in 2008, claiming the change would move a million people off sickness benefit and save the Treasury Â£7bn. The shift from incapacity benefits to ESA was then accelerated by the coalition government. The payments have come to light in a week when the government has faced severe criticism for its flagship welfare reform, Universal Credit. On Tuesday, BBC News revealed that ministers were further delaying the rollout of the system, which merges six benefits into one.

Kuenssberg: The Brexit maze,"This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. As so often, the cabinet managed to agree on what they don't like - the EU's version of the backstop - but they had a harder time agreeing what they do all like. And even after more than two hours of talks, there is, as things stand, no ""fully formed"" UK proposal to get the Brexit talks going again. There is no miraculous solution that can show the EU that promising a customs union to the whole of the UK can have a time limit that fits with their principles. Donald Tusk has demanded new facts on Wednesday. But as Theresa May prepares to go to Brussels, there's no sign of them. And there is no deal on the table right now that would definitely get through Parliament. What to do then when there isn't agreement? Delay of course! 'Expectations low' as PM heads to Brussels No optimism for Brexit deal - EU's Tusk Brexit: All you need to know One insider says the government has no choice but to play it long, in the hope that the passage of time will concentrate minds. Indications from ministers are that the government is now realistically looking to the deal not being done (if it is) until December. (Meaningful vote with your Christmas turkey anyone?) One cabinet minister told me the PM was trying to manage expectations, telling colleagues today ""not to be downhearted"" if there was no summit in November. And there have been suggestions too for ages that the EU would be ready to offer an extension to the whole process. It's not clear, however, what facts more time would change. Remember a lot of smart people have been trying to find a way to answer all the conundrums for months and months and months. Officials on both sides thought they were moving towards a possible arrangement of paragraphs last week but the politics here meant it couldn't be done. And without new facts, will Theresa May be able to buy herself more time? The first call on that will be made in the next 48 hours by the EU. The worst case scenario for No 10 is that EU leaders are so fed up with the UK position and what they see as the lack of reality, that on Thursday they formally say they will hold a no-deal summit in November. That would switch them on to a track that would be hard to get off once in motion. One EU source expressed disbelief that Theresa May thought she could turn up on Wednesday with nothing new. It was simply crazy, in their view, to suggest that the ball can be lobbed back into the EU court. The best case, and it seems right now unlikely, dream scenario is for the EU to say that, after all, there is a deal in reach, so let's get a date in the diary for the sign-off next month. Please upgrade your browser What seems more likely is a holding position. EU leaders could give some kind of vague noises that both sides still want to pursue negotiations, so that the talks can get going again. One Brussels source said that while it is ""time for choices"", they could give the prime minister space and time to build a majority at home for  a deal. But her party might not. Even if the EU gives her another few weeks to keep going, another few weeks to find a solution, if this summit goes visibly badly, it is not clear that her backbenchers and the Democratic Unionists will back Theresa May to carry on. It's becoming increasingly common around Westminster to hear MPs say, ""I simply can't see a way through."" 'Key issues remain' after Brexit talks What are the Brexit backstop options?

Terminally ill 'priority for repayments',"Terminally ill people who were short-changed with benefit payments are to be the priority for reimbursement. The government says it is ""scaling up"" the team trying to identify underpayments, from 50 to 400 people. Mistakes were made when incapacity benefit claimants were moved on to employment and support allowance (ESA) between 2011 to 2014. The government said 300,000 cases were being reviewed, of which ""just under a quarter"" had been underpaid. Benefits claimants underpaid millions The BBC understands assessors wrongly calculated the income of about 75,000 claimants, which could cost up to Â£500m to put right. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said in a written statement: ""I can confirm that, based on departmental analysis, we will be prioritising any individuals whom we know from our systems to be terminally ill. Thereafter we will work through the cases identified as most likely to have been underpaid according to our systems. ""Once an individual is contacted, and the relevant information gathered, they can expect to receive appropriate payment within 12 weeks. I can also confirm that once contacted, individuals will be provided with a dedicated free phone number on which they can make contact with the department."" She added she was committed to ensuring ""that all cases are reviewed and paid by April 2019"". Mistakes began in 2011, when the government started moving benefits recipients on to ESA - which is paid to those with long-term chronic health conditions. ESA was introduced by the Labour government in 2008 to replace incapacity benefit. The department said it had become aware of the problem in December 2016 after the Office for National Statistics published fraud and error figures for the social security system. Frank Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Committee,has described itas a problem of ""historic proportions"" that ""wrongly impoverished"" many claimants.

May: My Brexit plan is not deadThe prime minister heads to Brussels with talks deadlocked over the Irish border.,"""Intensive"" work is needed to overcome differences on the Irish border and reach a Brexit deal, Theresa May says. Speaking in Brussels, where she hopes to convince her counterparts to back her plan, the UK prime minister said ""considerable progress"" had been made in recent weeks. She has held meetings with key figures before addressing leaders ahead of their dinner this evening. A senior EU official suggested Mrs May had offered ""nothing new"" of substance. ""There was a message of goodwill and readiness to reach an agreement, but I didn't perceive anything substantially new in terms of content,"" said Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Commons Brexit vote must be 'unequivocal' Ahead of the summit, Labour said the government was ""too weak and too divided"" to reach a deal. Earlier Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit at Prime Minister's Questions, with the PM rejecting the Labour leader's claim that her planned long-term relationship with the EU, known as the Chequers plan, was ""dead"". This plan for Brexit was agreed by the Cabinet at the prime ministerâs country residence, Chequers, in July 2018. It proposes tax or tariff-free trade with the EU, while leaving the UK free to pursue trade deals outside the EU. Under the plan, the UK would collect tariffs on the EUâs behalf for any goods entering the country but destined to be sent on to EU countries. Because EU tariffs had been collected, there would not need to be a separate border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But the UK would have to follow EU rules, âthe common rule bookâ, on things like food standards to avoid unnecessary border hold-ups. The plan also proposes ending the free movement of people, giving back the UK control over immigration rules. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson both resigned their posts over the Chequers plan because they believe it means the UK would still be too closely tied to the EU. Both sides say they want to reach a deal, but preparations are taking place for what happens if they cannot agree by the time the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. In a new publication, the French government says,externalBritons wanting to visit France, following a no-deal Brexit, could need a visa if they want to stay for three months or more. And those who were already living there could be treated as being in France illegally unless they have the necessary residence permits. A-Z of Brexit: The sequel Brexit: All you need to know It also said checks would need to be established on goods and people going to and from the UK as well as veterinary checks on animals and animal products. While the draft bill sets out the actions the government could take, it is not yet clear what the measures will be and the publication states any rules for expats could easily be adapted. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was still time to reach a ""good and sustainable Brexit deal"" but that her government was also preparing for no deal in areas like citizens' rights and customs. This video can not be played PMQs: Corbyn and May on post-Brexit Chequers trade deal In the negotiations, she added, there should be a ""significant difference between a membership of the EU and a partnership with the EU as a third country"". Wednesday's European Council meeting was meant to be the occasion when the remaining 27 EU member states gave the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU. Both sides want to get an agreement in place within the next few weeks to avoid the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March. But chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to say talks have failed to make the ""decisive progress"" the EU wanted to see before agreeing to a special summit. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said: ""I think what's more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there won't be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on. ""And I think that's sensible. What we don't want to do is create drama around the build-up to a new summit date and not actually have something to sign off on."" There is also speculation some EU leaders will suggest using a November summit for a no-deal planning session instead. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The worst-case scenario for Downing Street is that EU leaders are so fed up with the UK position and what they see as the lack of reality, that on Thursday, they formally say they will hold a no-deal summit in November. That would switch them on to a track that would be hard to get off once in motion. One EU source expressed disbelief that Theresa May thought she could turn up on Wednesday with nothing new.

What seems more likely is a holding position. EU leaders could give some kinds of vague noises that both sides still want to pursue negotiations, so that the talks can get going again. One Brussels source said that while it is ""time for choices"", they could give the prime minister space and time to build a majority at home for a deal. Read Laura's full blog Mrs May will address her fellow leaders on Wednesday evening before their dinner - before that she will hold one-on-one talks with European Council President Donald Tusk as well as Mr Juncker and Irish premiere Leo Varadkar. But she will leave before the meal where the EU leaders decide what to do next. Mr Tusk, president of the European Council, said on Tuesday he saw ""no grounds for optimism"" that the two sides could bridge their differences on the Irish border, but appealed for ""goodwill and determination"" to try and bring an agreement nearer. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the border between the UK and the EU when the UK leaves the EU. Both sides want to avoid that border having checkpoints or other physical infrastructure to carry out checks on goods, but they can't agree how that should be done. They are discussing a ""backstop"" - a position of last resort, to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. The EU's suggestion would see Northern Ireland remaining in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system, but Mrs May says that would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. She suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020. The EU also says any backstop plan should not have an end date - something Mrs May has previously insisted on, leading to the possibility of a ""backstop to the backstop"". The UK and EU negotiators have, separately, discussed extending the 21-month transition period by up to a year, to improve the chances of getting a full trade deal and reduce the chance of needing an Irish border backstop. Extending the transition period has never been ruled out by the UK government, but it is unlikely to be acceptable to Conservative Brexiteers. Downing Street has said they are not calling for an extension. Theresa May was greeted by EU Commission leader Jean-Claude Juncker when she arrived in Brussels On the eve of Wednesday's summit, former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major attacked Brexiteers, saying ""those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for."" ""They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer. That will never be forgotten - nor forgiven."" Sir John is among a host of former senior politicians, including Tony Blair, and ex-deputy prime ministers Lord Heseltine and Nick Clegg, stepping up calls for another referendum. They have written a series of articles in European newspapers backing a so-called People's Vote, with the option to remain in the EU. Sir John's remarks were met with barbed responses from Jacob Rees-Mogg and other Conservative Brexiteers who said he had compromised the UK's sovereignty by signing up to the Maastricht treaty in the early 1990s without consulting the people.

Woman kills herself after husband's 'death'The man is alleged to have faked his death for an insurance payout - but did not tell his wife.China,"A photo of the couple with their eyes blurred has circulated widely on Chinese social media A man in China whose wife killed herself and their two children after he allegedly faked his own death for an insurance payout has given himself up to police. The 34-year-old was presumed dead after a car he borrowed was found in a river, though his body was never recovered. He did not tell his wife his alleged plan and she believed he had died. She drowned herself and their children three weeks later, after posting a suicide note online. The man, who police said was surnamed He, turned himself in to police in Xinhua county in Hunan province last Friday. He has been detained on charges of insurance fraud and intentional damage to property, Xinhua police said in a statement on WeChat - a social media platform. 'Why we had to fake my murder' Ukraine reporter fake killer details plot The MP who faked his death In early September, Mr He bought an insurance plan worth one million yuan (Â£110,000; $145,000) without his wife's knowledge, police said. According to a report by state-run Voice of China radio, his wife was named as the beneficiary. On 19 September, Mr He used a borrowed vehicle to fake his own death in a car crash, police said. He was found to have loans of more than 100,000 yuan. On 11 October, the bodies of his 31-year-old wife, their four-year-old son and three-year-old daughter were found in a pond near their home, according to the Voice of China, which broadcast parts of the suicide note that had been posted on WeChat. Mr He turned himself in to police the next day. He had earlier posted a video online, which was later widely circulated, in which he was crying and saying he had borrowed money to pay for treatment for his three-year-old daughter, who suffered from epilepsy. The incident has been widely talked about across Chinese social media over the past week, sparking conversations about financial pressures and familial issues. The hashtag #ManFakesDeathLeadingtoWifesDeath been viewed almost 29 million times on microblogging site Weibo. Social media users have been unsympathetic towards Mr He's situation. Thousands on the popular Sina Weibo microblog have been discussing the case, with many saying they find his apology ""insincere"", writes BBC Monitoring's Kerry Allen. But others note the tragedy of the situation, with one saying that this is an instance of being ""something too unimaginable to think about"". Zhang Xinnian, a Beijing-based lawyer, says the causal relation between He's alleged fraud and Dai's suicide ""will be difficult to prove in court"", the Global Times reports.

Khan withdraws offer to buy Wembley,"The FA has owned Wembley since 1999 having bought it from Wembley plc, a private firm which previously owned the stadium Fulham owner Shahid Khan has withdrawn his offer to buy Wembley Stadium from the Football Association after the plan became ""divisive"". Khan had offered Â£600m for the national stadium, with the FA retaining the Club Wembley hospitality rights, which it valued at Â£250m to Â£300m. The move was ""more divisive than expected"", said FA chief Martin Glenn. Khan has not ruled out making another bid in future if there is more support from FA Council members. The FA had said it would invest the proceeds of the sale into improving grassroots football facilities. Sports Minister Tracey Crouch told the BBC she was ""very disappointed"" by the decision, calling the offer ""a huge opportunity to boost funding into the development and maintenance of artificial and grass pitches up and down the country"". FA executives made a presentation to the FA Council last week about why they were backing the sale to Khan, and the 127 council members were scheduled to vote on the proposed sale on 24 October. But a senior FA source told BBC Sport that the board believed the odds were slightly against the purchase being backed, given the strong objections of some councillors to the home of English football being sold off. FA chief executive Glenn said Khan had believed his offer ""would be well received by all football stakeholders"". However, Glenn added: ""At a recent meeting with Mr Khan he expressed to us that, without stronger support from within the game, his offer is being seen as more divisive than it was anticipated to be and he has decided to withdraw his proposal. ""Wembley Stadium is an iconic venue that is revered around the world and it will continue to thrive under the ownership and direction of the FA."" This video can not be played May 2018: Shahid Khan - If you love English football, Wembley deal must go ahead Khan said he wanted ""to do right by everyone in a manner that strengthens the English game and brings people together, not divides them"". He added: ""Unfortunately, given where we are today, I've concluded that the outcome of a vote next week would be far from sufficient in expressing the broad support favoured by the FA chairman to sell Wembley Stadium. ""Until a time when it is evident there is an unmistakable directive from the FA to explore and close a sale, I am respectfully withdrawing my offer to purchase Wembley Stadium."" Khan, who also owns the NFL American football team the Jacksonville Jaguars, added: ""Our commitment to London would have been amplified and strengthened with the certainty of officially making Wembley Stadium an annual host to Jaguars or other NFL games."" The FA had pledged to keep showpiece events, such as most England internationals and the FA Cup final, at the stadium under a pre-agreed hire fee. The Football Foundation charity, which helps fund grassroots projects, said a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to improve facilities had been lost. ""Unfortunately, those who play the game as a sport, simply for the love of doing so and for the health benefits, are having to put up with a stock of community football facilities that is in a shameful state,"" it added. Other supporters, however, were concerned over the possibility of rising ticket prices for Wembley games, loss of control over the ground's future development and the stadium becoming the home of a new owner's club side, Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke said. ""More than 2,000 supporters took part in our consultation on the Wembley sale and we took that fan feedback directly to the FA Council last week. Only one in three fans thought the FA should sell to Khan while two-thirds of supporters were against selling the stadium under any circumstances,"" he added. FOR The FA said only one in three grassroots pitches are of adequate quality and it would invest in facilities. FA chief executive Martin Glenn:""This is an opportunity to unleash an unprecedented amount of investment into community football. Receiving an offer to sell Wembley Stadium is not a 'betrayal'. It is not selling the 'soul of the game'."" AGAINST Opponents had suggested selling an iconic national venue was a short-term plan which the FA would live to regret. Former England and Manchester United defender Gary Neville:""The FA feels to fund the grassroots programme, they have to sell a national asset - it's quite simply ridiculous. Don't sell Wembley when you can place a levy on agents' fees.""

Son sues over mum's airing cupboard death,"Mary Isherwood was a keen golfer and played ""almost on a daily basis,"" her son said The son of a woman who died while trapped in a holiday home airing cupboard is suing the resort company. Elizabeth Isherwood, known as Mary,died while staying at Plas Talgarth Country Clubnear Pennal, Gwynedd, in September 2017. Her son Craig is seeking compensation from the holiday resort owners for negligence, saying ""this should never have happened"". Macdonald Resorts said it could not comment on the ""tragedy"". Mrs Isherwood, 60, from Wolverhampton, was staying alone in the family timeshare for the final time as they had agreed to sell it. It is believed she became trapped in the airing cupboard on the night she arrived or the morning after, when she was going to the toilet. Her body was found a week later. Family 'devastated' by mum's airing cupboard death This video can not be played Craig Isherwood said his mother ""was fit and healthy and had years of a very happy life ahead of her"" The internal doorknob disintegrated and Mrs Isherwood tried to break out of the cupboard using a piece of water pipe she had snapped off, an inquest heard. She was sprayed with water and subsequently died from hypothermia. A coroner recorded a conclusion of death by misadventure. Mr Isherwood, 33, said: ""My mother died in the most terrible circumstances you could imagine. ""Tragically, she had made a hole big enough to climb through, but did not realise her way out was only blocked by a picture screwed to the other side of the wall. ""The legal action is not about the compensation, because how can you put a value on a life? It is about the fact that this should never have happened. ""I just want the company to admit that they made a mistake in not checking the door properly and make sure that this cannot happen to anyone else."" Mary Isherwood served as a police officer before moving into teaching and a career in the Post Office Mr Isherwood is being represented by law firm FBC Manby Bowdler. Associate Adam Wilson said: ""This was a quite horrific tragedy. There is no amount of money which can compensate Mr Isherwood and his two children for the loss of a much-loved mother and grandmother. ""But we believe that this was a tragedy which could and should have been avoided."" A Macdonald Resorts spokesman said: ""This was clearly a tragedy for Ms Isherwood and her family and our condolences go out to them. ""Given the possibility of legal action, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.""

Attack on Crimea school kills 17,"Russia has said the attack was an act of ""mass murder"" At least 19 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in a shooting at a college in Russian-annexed Crimea. An 18-year-old student ran through the Kerch technical college firing at fellow pupils before killing himself, Russian investigators say. Witnesses have also spoken of at least one blast caused by an unidentified explosive. The motive is unclear. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in a move condemned by many Western powers. The annexation marked the start of a simmering conflict involving Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine that goes on to this day. There are contradictory reports about the chronology of Wednesday's attack. The alleged perpetrator, named Vladislav Roslyakov, is said to have run from room to room as he fired, starting in the area near the canteen. He then shot himself dead, Russia's investigative committee said. Photos later emerged in Russian media purportedly showing the body of the attacker in the college library. The investigative committee said initial examinations suggested all the victims died of gunshot wounds, but some reports speak of shrapnel injuries. This video can not be played Emergency crews respond to the attack At the same time, Russia's law enforcement sources are quoted by local media as saying that the attacker had detonated a bomb in the canteen before starting shooting. Soon after reports of a blast in the college, investigators released a statement saying an explosive device filled with ""metal objects"" had detonated in the dining area. Several witnesses maintain they heard one or more explosions. Investigators later said they found a second device among the personal possessions of the gunman and that it had been disarmed. BBC Russian has been speaking to witnesses, including Igor Zakharevsky, who was in the canteen when the gunman struck. ""I was at the epicentre of the first explosion, at the entrance, near the buffet,"" he said. ""I was in complete shock and one of my classmates started pulling me away. Then I heard several shots at intervals of two or three seconds. After a while there was another explosion."" A businessman near the college described hearing an explosion and seeing a large window shatter. Crimea profile Russia's Crimea bridge gets giant arch The incident was earlier described as a ""terrorist act"", but Russia's investigative committee has now reclassified it as ""mass murder"". President Vladimir Putin said the attack was a ""tragic event"" and expressed condolences to the victims' relatives. Three days of mourning in Crimea have been declared from Thursday. By Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Until now, if you had told people in Crimea there had been a mass school shooting, most would have thought you were talking about the United States. Now all that has changed. The shooting spree in the Kerch Polytechnic has left the peninsula, annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, in shock. But should it come as such a surprise?

There have been five attacks in schools in Russia this year where a number of children were injured. In Kerch, questions are already being asked: how did Vladislav Roslyakov manage to obtain a licence for a hunting weapon? And how was he able to launch such a deadly attack on his college? His precise motives remain unclear. But there are suggestions the fourth-year student had developed a hostile attitude to the college. Russia's RBC TV interviewed a friend who said Roslyakov ""hated the technical school very much"" and had vowed ""revenge"" on his teachers. National guard soldiers were deployed It was reported that the attacker had recently been given a weapons permit, but Crimea's ombudsman for the rights of the child, Irina Klyueva, later questioned this. ""As far as I understand, it was fake information, although it is not yet known exactly,"" she was quoted as saying by Russia's Gazeta.ru. Classmates also say the suspected attacker was very self-contained, hardly communicated with anyone, and had long ago stopped using social networks. A local official said most of the victims were students of the college, which is a vocational school for 850 teenagers. A major emergency response operation was launched as the victims were taken to hospitals. At least 40 people were injured. Four military planes were ready to evacuate the wounded and military hospital facilities were ready to accept victims if necessary, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said. The peninsula has been a major area of dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine, and many other countries, have never recognised its annexation four years ago. The Crimea issue and the presence of Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine continue to strain relations. Kerch is situated at the point where Russia built a bridge between the Crimea and Russia. In a reminder of how poor relations are between Russia and Ukraine, the speaker of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, suggested Kiev might have been behind the attack. ""The entire evil inflicted on the land of Crimea is coming from the official Ukrainian authorities"", he said.

Prince Harry gets his beard rubbed,"This video can not be played Prince Harry was meeting children with his wife, the Duchess of Sussex Protocol was well and truly flouted on the latest leg of the royal tour when a five-year-old boy touched Prince Harry's beard. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are touring Australia and New Zealand after announcing they're expecting a baby. Five-year-old Luke Vincent was apparently mesmerised by the duke's facial hair because his ""favourite person in the world is Santa Claus"". Luke's teacher said he ""didn't give [Harry] any choice"" in the matter. The royal couple were touring Dubbo, in New South Wales, where they met volunteers from the Royal Flying Doctor Service and unveiled a new plane to mark 90 years of the organisation. During a tour of the city they also visited Buninyong Public School where they met Luke. School principal Anne Van Darrel said: ""He got a hug from Meghan and then Harry bent down to speak to him and Luke didn't give him any choice. ""Luke's favourite person in the world is Santa Claus, who has a beard. So he rubbed Harry's beard."" The Duchess of Sussex showed off her culinary skills and generosity by baking some banana bread for tea on the Woodley family farm outside Dubbo. Allow Twitter content?

The Daily Mail Australia reported that the ""royal recipe contained chocolate chips and a bit of ginger"". Emily Carroll, a member of the Woodley family, said she spoke to the duchess about her pregnancy. ""Meghan told me that she's feeling pretty good so far, which is great, and that she's running on adrenaline."" The duke and duchess discussed the drought, which has been affecting the region, with the Woodleys. ""They understood how we have been forced to sell so much stock, all of our breeding ewes, and how prices for grain have gone through the roof,"" Scott Woodley said. However, the heavens opened during the royal visit, pelting the crowds with heavy rain and hail. This video can not be played Ironically, the royal couple had gone to the region to discuss drought Prince Harry battled the elements to thank the hundreds of residents for ""welcoming me and my wife so warmly, and wet today"". Meghan tried to protect him from the worst of the rain with an umbrella, to no avail. He said being in Dubbo ""brings back memories of 2003, when I spent time jackarooing [working] on a small 16,000 hectare property"" in Queensland. Read more about the Australian drought. On Wednesday the duchess wore a less formal ensemble of Outlander jeans, J Crew boots, and a shirt by Maison Kitsune. She also wore a checked blazer from her friend Serena Williams's fashion label.

LiveMPs debate Universal Credit motion2 minutes ago2 minutes ago MP bids to introduce new form of pension schemeMP bids to introduce new form of pension scheme4 minutes ago Two more interesting questions from PMQsTwo more interesting questions from PMQs10 minutes ago Labour MP: Abused employee treated 'like the problem'Labour MP: Abused employee treated 'like the problem',"This morning: MPs questioned environment ministers Followed by: Urgent question on sickness benefit underpayments Exchanges over 'meaningful' Brexit vote for MPs dominate business statement Later: Debates on supermarket supply chains and World Menopause Day House of Lords debated cyber security and music education Sophie Morris, Robbie Hawkins and Ryan Brown ESA Underpayments Statement Repeat House of LordsParliament Peers are now responding to the repeated statement on ESA underpayments, which is being read by Work and Pensions Minister Baroness Buscome. Itemerged yesterdaythat tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits will receive backdated payments averaging Â£5,000 following government errors. In response to Labour spokesperson Baroness Sherlock's questions regarding compensation, Baroness Buscome says it is important to ""make clear"" that ""no one saw a cash reduction when they transferred to ESA, this is about extra money they may have been entitled to"". ""The key lesson we're learning is that it's a mistake to try to prepopulate information without being in touch with claimants,"" she adds. Following this, the Lords adjourn. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Black of Brentwood sums up the debate, telling peers he fears that ""the government is in denial, which is extremely sad"". Lord Black says the government ""must listen to the facts, and what is really going on the ground, and then act"". Peers are now hearing the repeat of an urgent question in the Commons earlier about sickness benefit underpayments. Debate on Music Education in Schools Education Minister Lord Agnew says music is a statutory part of the national curriculum, so all students in school aged 5 to 14 ""must study the subject"". He says between 2016 and 2020 the government is providing Â£300m for 120 music education hubs so all students can learn a musical instrument. He adds that a plan setting out the priorities for music education will be revealed by ministers ""in the coming months"". He denies that the English Baccalaureate is responsible for forcing music ""out of the curriculum"", and says the number of pupils taking music qualifications has been ""stable since 2010"". The debate on World Menopause Day comes to an end, and with it our coverage from the House of Commons for today. The day began with questions to environment ministers, followed by an urgent question on underpayments to tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits. It wasannounced yesterdaythat the government will now pay Â£1.5bn in back payments to correct errors made when people were moved onto Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Pensions Minister Sarah Newton prompted shouts from the opposition benches when she claimed ""good housekeeping"" at her department had led to the problem being spotted. Then Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom revealed the Offensive Weapons Bill will return to the Commons on Monday, during her business statement to MPs. She also responded to a series of concerns raised by MPs regarding a ""meaningful vote"" on the final Brexit deal. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour education spokesman Lord Watson of Invergowrie says it is ""inevitable"" that schools will have to cut back on teaching music, as the money given to local authorities is ""continuously cut"". He says the government is ""in denial about the declining number of students taking Music GCSE year on year"". The English Baccalaureate is ""detrimental"" to arts subjects, he says, and the government's claim that there is no less emphasis on the arts ""does not stack up"". He says ""too many schools lack the time, resources and expertise"" to deliver sufficient music education, and the government ""must support these schools"". Lord Watson says Labour would introduce an arts pupil premium to ensure arts facilities in state schools match those in the private sector. He asks whether ministers ""are content to music to remain for the wealthy"", as he says this is ""what is currently happening"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Lord Storey says although music is part of the national curriculum, fewer schools follow it because they have turned into academies. This means there is ""no real pressure on schools to teach music"", he adds. He blames this on ""a combination of austerity, narrowing of the curriculum and a focus on exam results rather than the quality of education experience"". He says the school where he was a headteacher in a deprived part of Liverpool had a full-time music teacher, which was ""life changing for those pupils"". ""Every child must have a rich education,"" he says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour peer Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall says says she agrees with all statements that have been raised in this debate. She says the government has been ""too restrictive"" in trying to implement a ""good standard of education"". She argues that the English Baccalaureate accountability measures ""are too narrow"". Universities in the Russell Group ""have given the impression to schools that arts subjects are not strong enough subjects for getting into university"", she says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Tory peer Lord Borwick says technology is expanding the possibilities of music teaching, pointing out that the quality of listening technology for iPhones and iPads is ""improving rapidly."" This will lead to mobile teaching and ""inevitably lead to the reduction in cost"", he says. ""What an inspiring future is coming our way. I'm much more optimistic"", he adds. New software needs to be developed for this, he says, suggesting it is important students are taught ""the skills for the future"", and this opens up music for those who lack ability or aptitude. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Responding to the debate, Communities Minister Nigel Adams says the ""inconsistent levels of awareness"" about the menopause reflects ""a history of stigma"". He says he agrees that it is important that education about the menopause is improved. With an ageing workforce, he adds that positive action by employers will benefit productivity and retention. ""One in four women in the workplace are going through or have gone through the menopause"", he adds. He concludes that it is essential that all employers and healthcare professionals are ""fully informed"" about providing treatment and support. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat Lord Wallace of Saltaire says having fewer music teacher vacancies is not something to celebrate. ""That's because there are fewer posts to appoint teachers to"", he adds. ""To neglect this dimension of education in order to cut taxes and public spending, would be as irrational as cutting spending on the police whilst claiming to support the principles of private property."" Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative Lord Lexden, who is president of the Independent Schools Association, says music is ""one of the great strengths of the independent sector of education"". ""I draw attention to this state of affairs, not in any spirit of self congratulations,"" he says, but to point out that independent schools can assist state schools with resources. He says state and private schools are collaborating to a ""greater extent than ever before"" on music education, with independent schools being ""actively encouraged"" to share resources. But he says ""success will only be achieved when state and independent schools come together by their own free will"". World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow women and equalities minister Carolyn Harris welcomes every man in the chamber to the ""sisterhood"". She tells MPs that ""for too long the menopause has been...the punchline of a joke that is actually anything but funny"". Many women, she adds, are ""completely unprepared for this phase of their lives"". She calls for education for girls and boys on the menopause. She asks if the Department for Education would consider extending sexual health education guidance. Carolyn Harris also criticises the limited training given to doctors on the menopause, and its misdiagnosis as depression. She concludes by calling for a mandatory menopause policy within workplaces. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Marion Fellows jokes her daughter ""frequently accuses her of oversharing"" but adds: ""I've been there, I've done that, I've got the T-shirt"" She says she started early and the menopause felt like it went on for a long time. Ms Fellows says the menopause can have a psychological and physical impact on women and it is vital health professionals ""take them seriously"". The MP also says that it is ""not uncommon"" for women to experience sexual dysfunction during the menopause that can affect their relationships, self-confidence and mental health. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament The Earl of Clancarty, a crossbench peer, says the future of music and other arts is at stake, adding that it is ""getting a little frustrating, having to quote back to the department its own figures"". ""Music should not become the preserve of the rich,"" he says, but suggests this is the way things are going. He criticises the restrictions on accessibility to art subjects, with many schools only letting students study one arts subject, and 70% of secondary school music teachers being forced to also teach other subjects, which he calls ""a nonsense"". World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Rachel Maclean calls the menopause ""one of the last taboos"". She tells MPs she is menopausal herself, and suffers from debilitating headaches. ""There is so much ignorance out there"", she says, adding that the menopause is ""not just hot flushes and night sweats"". ""This is not a women's issue"" she says, but ""a society issue"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative peer and chairman of the English Schools Orchestra Lord Lingfield says the fact that fewer children are receiving education in playing musical instruments is ""a worrying trend"". He says the 800 secondary schools which still have orchestras should be praised, but more needs to be done to ensure the idea is ""encouraged in all schools"". ""There needs to be a national plan for music education,"" he says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour peer Lord Lipsey, who chairs a parliamentary group on classical music, says music graduates ""are very hard sought"" by employers, even outside of musical occupations. The discipline requires ""a tremendous amount of skill and focus"", he says. However, he adds that the value of music education has been ""overshadowed"" by a ""streamlined focus"" on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Clement Jones says the Music GCSE should be available in all schools, and the arts must not become the ""preserve of students at private schools"". ""We cannot afford to lose music education from schools, and the government must ensure we protect the teaching of music by taking the focus off of the English Baccalaureate,"" he says. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament The debate on supermarket supply chains comes to a close, and MPs begin their second backbench business debate of the afternoon, on World Menopause Day. Opening the debate, Labour MP Martin Whitfield says recent research found half of working women found work difficult due to the menopause, with 10% giving up work altogether. ""The menopause is an occupational health issue that rests on the desks of managers, male managers as well as female managers"", he says. He concludes by asking men to ""take up the challenge"" of discussing the menopause with those close to them at home and the workplace, so women do not ""suffer in silence"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Opening the debate, Lord Black of Brentwood says musical education is ""dying a rapid death"" and has become ""only an option for the privileged"". The gap in provision between state and private schools is ""shameful"", he adds. There has been a 40% decrease in the number of students taking A-Level Music in the last eight years, he says, adding that much of the blame ""must be placed on the English Baccalaureate"". The qualification, he tells peers, ""has harmed all creative arts subjects"". ""Music is not an add-on, it is not a past time, it is not a nice-to-have, it is an important grounding to our society and is as important as maths and physics,"" he says. Exploitation in Supermarket Supply Chains Debate House of CommonsParliament Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins says the government is determined to end modern slavery ""in our communities and in the global economy"". She adds that since the ""landmark""  Modern Slavery Act, there have been more convictions and arrests every year, with 950 currently live. Ms Atkins adds that this year the government will invest at least Â£61m towards end modern slavery in the UK and abroad. ""No production line, however how far reaching, should ever involve the exploitation of human beings"", she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

Bomb kills 13 in Crimea college - Russia,"Russia has said the attack was an act of ""mass murder"" At least 19 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in a shooting at a college in Russian-annexed Crimea. An 18-year-old student ran through the Kerch technical college firing at fellow pupils before killing himself, Russian investigators say. Witnesses have also spoken of at least one blast caused by an unidentified explosive. The motive is unclear. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in a move condemned by many Western powers. The annexation marked the start of a simmering conflict involving Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine that goes on to this day. There are contradictory reports about the chronology of Wednesday's attack. The alleged perpetrator, named Vladislav Roslyakov, is said to have run from room to room as he fired, starting in the area near the canteen. He then shot himself dead, Russia's investigative committee said. Photos later emerged in Russian media purportedly showing the body of the attacker in the college library. The investigative committee said initial examinations suggested all the victims died of gunshot wounds, but some reports speak of shrapnel injuries. This video can not be played Emergency crews respond to the attack At the same time, Russia's law enforcement sources are quoted by local media as saying that the attacker had detonated a bomb in the canteen before starting shooting. Soon after reports of a blast in the college, investigators released a statement saying an explosive device filled with ""metal objects"" had detonated in the dining area. Several witnesses maintain they heard one or more explosions. Investigators later said they found a second device among the personal possessions of the gunman and that it had been disarmed. BBC Russian has been speaking to witnesses, including Igor Zakharevsky, who was in the canteen when the gunman struck. ""I was at the epicentre of the first explosion, at the entrance, near the buffet,"" he said. ""I was in complete shock and one of my classmates started pulling me away. Then I heard several shots at intervals of two or three seconds. After a while there was another explosion."" A businessman near the college described hearing an explosion and seeing a large window shatter. Crimea profile Russia's Crimea bridge gets giant arch The incident was earlier described as a ""terrorist act"", but Russia's investigative committee has now reclassified it as ""mass murder"". President Vladimir Putin said the attack was a ""tragic event"" and expressed condolences to the victims' relatives. Three days of mourning in Crimea have been declared from Thursday. By Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Until now, if you had told people in Crimea there had been a mass school shooting, most would have thought you were talking about the United States. Now all that has changed. The shooting spree in the Kerch Polytechnic has left the peninsula, annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, in shock. But should it come as such a surprise?

There have been five attacks in schools in Russia this year where a number of children were injured. In Kerch, questions are already being asked: how did Vladislav Roslyakov manage to obtain a licence for a hunting weapon? And how was he able to launch such a deadly attack on his college? His precise motives remain unclear. But there are suggestions the fourth-year student had developed a hostile attitude to the college. Russia's RBC TV interviewed a friend who said Roslyakov ""hated the technical school very much"" and had vowed ""revenge"" on his teachers. National guard soldiers were deployed It was reported that the attacker had recently been given a weapons permit, but Crimea's ombudsman for the rights of the child, Irina Klyueva, later questioned this. ""As far as I understand, it was fake information, although it is not yet known exactly,"" she was quoted as saying by Russia's Gazeta.ru. Classmates also say the suspected attacker was very self-contained, hardly communicated with anyone, and had long ago stopped using social networks. A local official said most of the victims were students of the college, which is a vocational school for 850 teenagers. A major emergency response operation was launched as the victims were taken to hospitals. At least 40 people were injured. Four military planes were ready to evacuate the wounded and military hospital facilities were ready to accept victims if necessary, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said. The peninsula has been a major area of dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine, and many other countries, have never recognised its annexation four years ago. The Crimea issue and the presence of Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine continue to strain relations. Kerch is situated at the point where Russia built a bridge between the Crimea and Russia. In a reminder of how poor relations are between Russia and Ukraine, the speaker of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, suggested Kiev might have been behind the attack. ""The entire evil inflicted on the land of Crimea is coming from the official Ukrainian authorities"", he said.

Student 'baked grandma's ashes in cookies'A student handed the sugar cookies to unaware students at her California high school.US & Canada,"Police are investigating reports that a US schoolgirl gave cookies containing her grandmother's ashes to classmates.

Error saw man's BMW seized and crushed,"A man had his car seized and destroyed while he was in hospital after ""maladministration"" by a council. After having surgery, the car owner discovered Flintshire council had incorrectly classified his BMW 323 as abandoned and had it crushed. An ombudsman report said there was no evidence the council tried to identify the owner, while the man whose car it was called it ""utter ineptitude"". The council must pay him Â£2,750 for his car and the time taken to resolve this. Steve Jones, chief officer for streetscene and transportation at Flintshire Council, said it accepted the recommendations in the ombudsman's report and would act on them. The owner of the BMW, referred to as Mr G, paid Â£14,000 for the British racing green car in 2004 and spent Â£2,500 on a new engine and braking system. In November 2016, he went into Wrexham Maelor Hospital for ankle surgery and when he returned to his flat in Flintshire three days later, his car had vanished from his parking space. It had been declared off the road and was parked outside the registered address. Crushed cars fall off lorry on to M1 Â£4m worth of luxury cars destroyed The oddest items found in untaxed cars After reporting his missing vehicle to police, officers investigated and discovered what had happened to his car. A council officer claimed a search of the DVLA's vehicle database did not identify the vehicle's registered keeper, but the ombudsman's report said there was no evidence of such a search being logged. The authority was also unable to provide evidence it had issued a statutory notice informing the landowner of its intention to remove the vehicle. Mr G said after the council's insurers refused to pay out on his claim, the authority ""shut up shop and denied responsibility"". He also said he had about Â£2,000 worth of tools in the boot. ""I was utterly horrified and so confused because I couldn't understand why they took away a vehicle that was registered to me at my address,"" he added. Public Services Ombudsman for Wales Nick Bennett said: ""This is as classic a case of maladministration as I have witnessed in four years of office."" Mr Jones added: ""Officers have conducted a full review of the processes for dealing with abandoned vehicles, and measures are now in place to prevent re-occurrence.""

Crimea profile Russia's Crimea bridge gets giant arch The incident was earlier described as a ""terrorist act"", but Russia's investigative committee has now reclassified it as ""mass murder"". President Vladimir Putin said the attack was a ""tragic event"" and expressed condolences to the victims' relatives. Three days of mourning in Crimea have been declared from Thursday. By Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Until now, if you had told people in Crimea there had been a mass school shooting, most would have thought you were talking about the United States. Now all that has changed. The shooting spree in the Kerch Polytechnic has left the peninsula, annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, in shock. But should it come as such a surprise?

There have been five attacks in schools in Russia this year where a number of children were injured. In Kerch, questions are already being asked: how did Vladislav Roslyakov manage to obtain a licence for a hunting weapon? And how was he able to launch such a deadly attack on his college? His precise motives remain unclear. But there are suggestions the fourth-year student had developed a hostile attitude to the college. Russia's RBC TV interviewed a friend who said Roslyakov ""hated the technical school very much"" and had vowed ""revenge"" on his teachers. National guard soldiers were deployed It was reported that the attacker had recently been given a weapons permit, but Crimea's ombudsman for the rights of the child, Irina Klyueva, later questioned this. ""As far as I understand, it was fake information, although it is not yet known exactly,"" she was quoted as saying by Russia's Gazeta.ru. Classmates also say the suspected attacker was very self-contained, hardly communicated with anyone, and had long ago stopped using social networks. A local official said most of the victims were students of the college, which is a vocational school for 850 teenagers. A major emergency response operation was launched as the victims were taken to hospitals. At least 40 people were injured. Four military planes were ready to evacuate the wounded and military hospital facilities were ready to accept victims if necessary, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said. The peninsula has been a major area of dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine, and many other countries, have never recognised its annexation four years ago. The Crimea issue and the presence of Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine continue to strain relations. Kerch is situated at the point where Russia built a bridge between the Crimea and Russia. In a reminder of how poor relations are between Russia and Ukraine, the speaker of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, suggested Kiev might have been behind the attack. ""The entire evil inflicted on the land of Crimea is coming from the official Ukrainian authorities"", he said.

Cheaper food drives UK inflation lower,"The UK inflation rate fell more than expected in September after hitting a six-month high in August. The Office for National Statistics said the fall to 2.4%, down from 2.7%, was largely driven by lower prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks. The Consumer Prices Index figure surprised economists who had been expecting inflation to fall to 2.6%. The result is expected to ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the near future. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""With inflation in line with the Bank of England's forecast, and measures of domestically generated cost pressures, such as core inflation and services inflation falling back, this reduces any pressure on the MPC to act again before it can assess the likely impact of the Brexit negotiations."" However, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Unless services inflation strengthens markedly over the next six months, CPI inflation will undershoot the [Bank of England's] 2% target."" He argued that further falls in food prices and a cap on standard variable tariffs for gas and electricity would keep a lid on inflation. September's fall in inflation comes a day after figures showed that wages were rising by 3.1% - the fastest pace in nearly a decade - easing pressure on consumer spending power. September's inflation figure is important as it will be used to set state pensions, which are expected to rise by about Â£4.25 a week. It will also be used to determine business rates for the coming year, with the British Retail Consortium forecasting a Â£180m increase in retailers' costs. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Food was the main downward pull on inflation as last year's September price rises failed to reappear, while ferry prices dropped after their surprisingly high summer peak. ""However, it wasn't all one-way traffic with energy suppliers pushing up their prices."" The ONS said food prices, particularly of meat and chocolate, represented the biggest drag on September's inflation rate. The price of cultural services, which includes theatre tickets, fell 2.5% while the cost of games, toys and hobbies rose just 1.6%, compared with a 4.4% rise in September last year. However, the ONS said transport prices were up 5.5% compared with September 2017, partly due to higher fuel costs. Electricity prices soared by 9.3%, the highest September figure since 2011. Chocolate prices have fallen In August the Bank of England raised interest rates for only the second time in a decade, following a recovery in economic growth. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the inflation figure would ease the pressure on the Monetary Policy Committee to make further hikes. ""However, the relatively strong wage data released yesterday is likely to keep the Bank of England vigilant to any further signs of increasing inflationary pressures,"" she said. Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, said: ""On balance we expect the central bank to maintain its current monetary policy stance until there is greater clarity over the circumstances of the UK's withdrawal from the EU."" Businesses warned the CPI figure, used to set business rates, would push up costs for struggling high street retailers. A slowdown in consumer spending and rising overheads have led to numerous store closures across the UK over the last 12 months. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: ""These [inflation] figures confirm that the retail industry ... will face yet another eye-watering rise in business rates next April. ""Ministers need to act to address this Â£180m increase in retailers' already unsustainable business rates bill, along with other public policy burdens which retailers are struggling to absorb the cost of."" By Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter The full state pension is set to rise by about Â£4.25 a week to Â£168.60 in April, with confirmation expected in the Budget later this month. This is the equivalent of Â£8,767 a year. However, most pensioners get the older basic state pension, which is likely to rise by Â£3.25 a week to Â£129.20. They may get a Pension Credit top-up. The triple-lock system means that the state pension rises in line with inflation, earnings or 2.5% - whichever is the highest. The benchmark for inflation is the Consumer Prices Index inflation figure for September, which was 2.4%. However, the rise in earnings of 2.6% (based on earnings growth including bonuses in July) is higher. There has been some debate over the future of the triple-lock and its sustainability, particularly during the public sector pay cap and a time of low average wage growth. However, the government has said it would keep the triple-lock for the rest of this parliament. Some other benefits, unaffected by a cap, such as bereavement benefits, carers' allowance, disability benefits, and maternity and paternity allowances, are set to rise in April in line with the latest inflation figure. There is a freeze on most working-age benefits, such as jobseeker's allowance and income support. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that, without the freeze, more than 10 million households would have been an average of Â£150 a year better off in 2019-20. NHS workers, teachers and police staff will see their pension contributions up-rated based partly on these latest figures.

Love Island breast enlargement ad banned,"An ad for breast enlargement at a cosmetic surgery clinic shown during ITV's Love Island has been banned by the advertising watchdog. The ad for MYA, shown in May, June and July, depicted young women posing, dancing and laughing around a swimming pool, on a beach and on a boat. Its voiceover said: ""These girls had breast enlargements with MYA and all feel amazing."" There were 17 complainants, including one from the Mental Health Foundation. The foundation said it felt the ad exploited young women's insecurities about their bodies, trivialised breast enhancement surgery and portrayed it as aspirational. It challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and harmful. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) agreed and said the ad, which was broadcast on ITV and in its catch-up service, must not be shown again. It has also banned a Spotify adwhich mimicked a horror film for ""unjustifiably"" distressing children. Love Island: Ofcom receives 650 complaints Young 'out of love with their own bodies' Does cosmetic surgery really make people feel better? MYA Cosmetic Surgery had told the ASA it believed the ad did not make any direct claims about the positive impact of surgery and did not show a better time in social events as a result of surgery. It pointed out the on-screen text stating ""No surgical procedure is without risk. 18+"" and ""Any decision to have cosmetic surgery should not be undertaken lightly. Allow plenty of time to reflect before going ahead with a procedure"" was prominent and stressed the seriousness of the procedure and the need to take plenty of time to reflect before proceeding. That text is in small type and only appears in the final 10 seconds of the 30 second ad. However, the ASA said it considered the ad went beyond presenting the lifestyle of women who had breast enlargement in a positive light. The watchdog said it implied that the women were only able to enjoy the aspirational lifestyle shown, and to be happy with their bodies, because they had undergone that surgery. The advert had previously been criticised by the chief executive of NHS England, who said the images were ""playing into a set of pressures around body image"", leading to young people needing mental health services. Speaking to the BBC in July, ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall said that airing an advert ""may not have been quite right,"" but added that ""we are highly regulated and haven't actually done anything wrong."" This video can not be played In July Carolyn McCall, ITV's chief executive, defended showing the ad during Love Island Isabella Goldie, director at the Mental Health Foundation, described the ASA's decision as a watershed moment: ""We believe that concern around body image is one of the root causes of mental ill health in young people. Our research shows that almost half  of young people aged 18-24 have felt so stressed by body image and appearance that they have felt overwhelmed or unable to cope. ""Implying that people can only enjoy body confidence and an aspirational lifestyle by undergoing cosmetic surgery is dangerous and unacceptable. All of us, including commercial organisations, have a role to play in strengthening our young people's resilience."" The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has called for a full ban on advertising for plastic surgery. Should Love Island surgery ads be banned?

Canada legalises sale and use of cannabis,"Nikki Rose (centre) and Ian Power (right) were the first people in Canada to buy legal cannabis The first recreational cannabis to be legally bought in Canada was purchased at midnight on Wednesday (02:30 GMT) on the eastern island of Newfoundland amid queues of hundreds of people. Canada has become the second country after Uruguay to legalise possession and use of recreational cannabis. Medical marijuana has been legal in the country since 2001. But concerns remain, including about the readiness for police forces to tackle drug impaired driving. Information has been sent to 15m households about the new laws and there are public awareness campaigns. As it happened: First day of legal Canadian pot Who wins and who loses under new law Ian Power, from the town of St John's began queuing at 20:00 local time so he could ""make history"". Newfoundland is half an hour ahead of the next province to the west. ""It's been my dream to be the first person to buy the first legal gram of cannabis in Canada, and here I finally am,"" he said. Canadian provinces and municipalities have been preparing for months for the end of cannabis prohibition. They are responsible for setting out where cannabis can be bought and consumed. This has created a patchwork of more or less restrictive legislation across the country. Customers queued outside Tweed in St John's in Newfoundland as midnight approached There remain unanswered questions on some key issues around how legal cannabis will work in Canada. A number of analysts are predicting a shortage of recreational marijuana in the first year of legalisation as production and licensing continues to ramp up to meet demand. And the marketplace itself is still in its infancy. This video can not be played As Canada makes cannabis legal, what happens to those with past convictions for possession? Ontario, Canada's most populous province, will only begin opening retail stores next spring, though residents will be able to order cannabis online. British Columbia, one of the provinces with the highest rates of cannabis use, will only have one legal store open on Wednesday. Canada cannabis legalisation: 'We know the world is watching' Canada legalises recreational cannabis use Until retail locations are more widely available, some unlicensed cannabis retailers, which have flourished in the years since the law was first proposed, may stay open. It is unclear if police will crack down on them immediately, or if they will turn a blind eye. Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Vancouver Legal pot has been an inescapable topic for months in Canada, as governments and companies prepared in earnest for 17 October. That day is finally here, and Canadians will learn just how much - or how little - the new framework will change the country. But this is not just a domestic affair. With global trends shifting away from a strict prohibition of cannabis, the world will be watching this national experiment in drug liberalisation. A measure of success - whether legalisation will be a win for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ahead of the 2019 federal election - will depend on whether it meets his stated goals: restricting access of the drug to youth - who are among the heaviest users in Canada - reducing the burden of cannabis laws on the justice system, and undercutting the illicit market for the drug. And if the outcomes are positive, other countries might just be more willing to follow suit. Legalisation fulfils a 2015 campaign promise by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the leader of the governing Liberal Party. The prime minister has argued that Canada's nearly century-old laws criminalising use of the drug have been ineffective, given that Canadians are still among the world's heaviest users. Legalising cannabis: What you need to know The cops joining the marijuana business He said the new law is designed to keep drugs out of the hands of minors and profits out of the hands of criminals. The federal government also predicts it will raise $400m a year in tax revenues on the sale of cannabis. Cannabis possession first became a crime in Canada in 1923 but medical use has been legal since 2001. Canada follows in the footsteps of Uruguay, which became the first country in the world to legalise the sale of cannabis for recreational use in 2013. A number of US states have also voted to end prohibition. Medical marijuana is also gaining ground in many European countries. Portugal and the Netherlands have decriminalised the drug. South Africa's highest court legalised the use of cannabis by adults in private places in September, though the sale of the drug remains a crime. In April, Zimbabwe became the second country in Africa, after Lesotho, to legalise the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Reality Check: Has cannabis legalisation in some US states led to more users? Nine US states have legalised recreational marijuana use while many more allow its use on medical grounds. Adults will be able buy cannabis oil, seeds and plants and dried cannabis from licensed producers and retailers and to possess up to 30 grams (one ounce) of dried cannabis in public, or its equivalent. Edibles, or cannabis-infused foods, will not be immediately available for purchase but will be within a year of the bill coming into force. The delay is meant to give the government time to set out regulations specific to those products. This video can not be played The legalisation of cannabis could have a huge impact on Canada's economy It will be illegal to possess more than 30 grams in public, grow more than four plants per household and to buy from an unlicensed dealer. Penalties for some infraction will be severe. Someone caught selling the drug to a minor could be jailed for up to 14 years. Some critics say the penalties are too harsh and not proportional to similar laws like those around selling alcohol to minors. Unauthorised dispensaries have cropped up in cities across Canada in the run-up to legalisation On Monday, the Canadian Medical Association Journal published an editorial calling legalisation ""a national, uncontrolled experiment in which the profits of cannabis producers and tax revenues are squarely pitched against the health of Canadians"". There are also still some legal wrinkles to be worked out. Canada has brought in new drug impaired driving offences, but doubts remain about the reliability of screening technology and the potential for drugged driving cases to clog up the courts. Federal statistics indicate that about half of all cannabis users do not believe their driving is impaired after taking marijuana. On Wednesday, government officials announced they will present legislation intended to fast-track pardon applications of people who have been convicted of possession under 30g (one ounce). There are currently some 500,000 Canadians with existing criminal records for possession. The change in national drug policy has also created headaches with the US, where the drug remains federally a controlled substance. On Tuesday, the US Customs Border Protection Agency said border guards will have ""broad latitude"" to determine who is admissible to the country. Border guards may ask Canadians if they smoke cannabis, and deny them entry if they believe they intend to do so in the US. Canada has also been rolling out signs at all airports and border crossings to warn travellers that crossing international borders with the drug remains illegal.

Expectations low as PM heads to Brussels,"""Intensive"" work is needed to overcome differences on the Irish border and reach a Brexit deal, Theresa May says. Speaking in Brussels, where she hopes to convince her counterparts to back her plan, the UK prime minister said ""considerable progress"" had been made in recent weeks. She has held meetings with key figures before addressing leaders ahead of their dinner this evening. A senior EU official suggested Mrs May had offered ""nothing new"" of substance. ""There was a message of goodwill and readiness to reach an agreement, but I didn't perceive anything substantially new in terms of content,"" said Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Commons Brexit vote must be 'unequivocal' Ahead of the summit, Labour said the government was ""too weak and too divided"" to reach a deal. Earlier Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit at Prime Minister's Questions, with the PM rejecting the Labour leader's claim that her planned long-term relationship with the EU, known as the Chequers plan, was ""dead"". This plan for Brexit was agreed by the Cabinet at the prime ministerâs country residence, Chequers, in July 2018. It proposes tax or tariff-free trade with the EU, while leaving the UK free to pursue trade deals outside the EU. Under the plan, the UK would collect tariffs on the EUâs behalf for any goods entering the country but destined to be sent on to EU countries. Because EU tariffs had been collected, there would not need to be a separate border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But the UK would have to follow EU rules, âthe common rule bookâ, on things like food standards to avoid unnecessary border hold-ups. The plan also proposes ending the free movement of people, giving back the UK control over immigration rules. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson both resigned their posts over the Chequers plan because they believe it means the UK would still be too closely tied to the EU. Both sides say they want to reach a deal, but preparations are taking place for what happens if they cannot agree by the time the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. In a new publication, the French government says,externalBritons wanting to visit France, following a no-deal Brexit, could need a visa if they want to stay for three months or more. And those who were already living there could be treated as being in France illegally unless they have the necessary residence permits. A-Z of Brexit: The sequel Brexit: All you need to know It also said checks would need to be established on goods and people going to and from the UK as well as veterinary checks on animals and animal products. While the draft bill sets out the actions the government could take, it is not yet clear what the measures will be and the publication states any rules for expats could easily be adapted. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was still time to reach a ""good and sustainable Brexit deal"" but that her government was also preparing for no deal in areas like citizens' rights and customs. This video can not be played PMQs: Corbyn and May on post-Brexit Chequers trade deal In the negotiations, she added, there should be a ""significant difference between a membership of the EU and a partnership with the EU as a third country"". Wednesday's European Council meeting was meant to be the occasion when the remaining 27 EU member states gave the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU. Both sides want to get an agreement in place within the next few weeks to avoid the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March. But chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to say talks have failed to make the ""decisive progress"" the EU wanted to see before agreeing to a special summit. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said: ""I think what's more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there won't be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on. ""And I think that's sensible. What we don't want to do is create drama around the build-up to a new summit date and not actually have something to sign off on."" There is also speculation some EU leaders will suggest using a November summit for a no-deal planning session instead. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The worst-case scenario for Downing Street is that EU leaders are so fed up with the UK position and what they see as the lack of reality, that on Thursday, they formally say they will hold a no-deal summit in November. That would switch them on to a track that would be hard to get off once in motion. One EU source expressed disbelief that Theresa May thought she could turn up on Wednesday with nothing new. It was simply crazy, in their view, to suggest that the ball can be lobbed back into the EU court. The best case - and it seems right now unlikely - scenario is for the EU to say that there is a deal in reach, so let's get a date in the diary for the sign-off next month. What seems more likely is a holding position. EU leaders could give some kinds of vague noises that both sides still want to pursue negotiations, so that the talks can get going again. One Brussels source said that while it is ""time for choices"", they could give the prime minister space and time to build a majority at home for a deal. Read Laura's full blog Mrs May will address her fellow leaders on Wednesday evening before their dinner - before that she will hold one-on-one talks with European Council President Donald Tusk as well as Mr Juncker and Irish premiere Leo Varadkar. But she will leave before the meal where the EU leaders decide what to do next. Mr Tusk, president of the European Council, said on Tuesday he saw ""no grounds for optimism"" that the two sides could bridge their differences on the Irish border, but appealed for ""goodwill and determination"" to try and bring an agreement nearer. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the border between the UK and the EU when the UK leaves the EU. Both sides want to avoid that border having checkpoints or other physical infrastructure to carry out checks on goods, but they can't agree how that should be done. They are discussing a ""backstop"" - a position of last resort, to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. The EU's suggestion would see Northern Ireland remaining in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system, but Mrs May says that would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. She suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020. The EU also says any backstop plan should not have an end date - something Mrs May has previously insisted on, leading to the possibility of a ""backstop to the backstop"". The UK and EU negotiators have, separately, discussed extending the 21-month transition period by up to a year, to improve the chances of getting a full trade deal and reduce the chance of needing an Irish border backstop. Extending the transition period has never been ruled out by the UK government, but it is unlikely to be acceptable to Conservative Brexiteers. Downing Street has said they are not calling for an extension. Theresa May was greeted by EU Commission leader Jean-Claude Juncker when she arrived in Brussels On the eve of Wednesday's summit, former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major attacked Brexiteers, saying ""those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for."" ""They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer. That will never be forgotten - nor forgiven."" Sir John is among a host of former senior politicians, including Tony Blair, and ex-deputy prime ministers Lord Heseltine and Nick Clegg, stepping up calls for another referendum. They have written a series of articles in European newspapers backing a so-called People's Vote, with the option to remain in the EU. Sir John's remarks were met with barbed responses from Jacob Rees-Mogg and other Conservative Brexiteers who said he had compromised the UK's sovereignty by signing up to the Maastricht treaty in the early 1990s without consulting the people.

'We know the world is watchingÃ¢ÂÂ,"For many Canadians, the idea of legal cannabis once seemed a pipe dream. But from 17 October, Canada will become the first G7 country to give recreational cannabis the green light. It's following a trail first blazed by Uruguay in 2013. ""It's becoming a serious industry,"" says one entrepreneur. Supporters say legalisation will bring new medical advances and help stamp out drug-related crime. But some critics argue that long-term use can harm people's health. Others worry about how it will be policed. So who are some of the so-called ""ganjapreneurs"" riding this new legal high? Vinay Tolia ran his own hedge fund before becoming chief executive of Flowr this year. He co-founded the cannabis producer with Tom Flow, an industry veteran who sold his last firm, MedReleaf, for more than $2.5bn (Â£1.9bn). Vinay says getting into the legal cannabis industry is ""the right thing to do from a social level"". ""You can objectively see that the drug policies have been a failure,"" he says. ""And why not study it? There are tonnes of medicinal benefits waiting to be discovered that are going to be hugely beneficial to a lot of people."" Flowr runs an 84,000-sq ft facility in British Columbia where it grows plants under highly controlled conditions. By managing humidity, airflow and other factors in a sterilised setting more akin to a pharmaceutical lab, Flowr says it can mass produce cannabis that's of a consistent, high quality. ""There is a lot of painstaking care in making the right plant,"" says Vinay. ""[Cannabis] is very sensitive. You can have the same strains in two different rooms with a slightly different temperature and get completely different chemical compositions."" Flowr has also teamed up with gardening industry giant Scotts Miracle-Gro, opening a research facility to study pot genetics and how the plant can affect users. Many of Canada's larger firms are aiming for rapid industrial-scale turnover, but Kelly Coulter has other plans. ""My farm is going to be small and slow,"" she says. ""I'm going to be like one of those vineyards in Italy who sell out because they have the best grape, and then we rest in the winter."" This year, she's leased two acres of land in British Columbia and plans to start an outdoor growing operation called Slo Farms. ""We've got the only Mediterranean climate in Canada, which is ideal for growing cannabis, and all food."" Kelly used to own an organic farm and says marijuana cultivation felt like a natural career transition. ""Most people care where their food comes from,"" she says. ""Right now we're seeing industrialised agriculture becoming exposed to consumer critique, the same will happen to cannabis."" Slo Farms will be an all-female business, and Kelly says licences for small-scale production will help more women to break into the industry. ""The big licences, those are really expensive operations and women don't always have access to that kind of money. ""We know the world is watching,"" adds Kelly. ""We hope other countries will see what's happened here and replicate it."" Ron Throgmartin admits he is ""not a marijuana smoker"", but as a businessman he sees an opportunity in commercial cannabis real estate. He ran his own property firm for 20 years and is now chief executive of Diego Pellicer. The firm develops and leases property for marijuana businesses and has just opened its second US retail outlet with the help of designer Jill Savini, former creative director of the original Apple store. Ron says he plans to expand into Canada, but he's ""cautious"" and sees more earning potential in the larger, neighbouring US market. ""At one point the US will federally legalise cannabis and when that happens, Canada will become an afterthought."" He also believes legalisation will eventually concentrate industry control into the hands of larger, probably tobacco corporations. ""Their model's dying so if they don't find something to transition to they'll be in trouble."" So unlike other firms, Ron says he's in no rush to have weed legalised in the US at a national level. ""[I would like] more time for Diego Pellicer to become a bigger company so we can be a candidate for acquisition from bigger corporations who we can't compete with. ""I'm always thinking about tomorrow and next year."" Sean Roby runs Bud and Breakfast, a self-styled ""AirBnB of cannabis"". The accommodation-sharing platform lets travellers search for ""420-friendly"" accommodation around the world. ""We get rid of the awkward factor,'' jokes Sean. The website has nearly 100 properties registered in Canada. He says around 30 have signed up in the last week alone, with more Canadians hoping to cash in when legalisation comes into force later this month. Bud and Breakfast also runs dedicated resorts in Denver, Hawaii, Uruguay and Jamaica where guests can enjoy cannabis yoga classes, ""puff and paint"" lessons and other eye-catching pursuits. Sean founded the firm four years ago after organising wine tours and adventure holidays in California and Hawaii for his family business. He says it's ""akin to wine tourism"", but many people come to his resort to help with severe medical conditions too. ""Cannabis is much safer than alcohol as well,"" argues Sean. ""I think it can obviously slow down productivity if you use it too much but if you use it in a vacation setting as an experience, it can be a nice thing to relax and watch the world go by, to escape the grind, which is what we all like to do.""

Itemerged yesterdaythat tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits will receive backdated payments averaging Â£5,000 following government errors. In response to Labour spokesperson Baroness Sherlock's questions regarding compensation, Baroness Buscome says it is important to ""make clear"" that ""no one saw a cash reduction when they transferred to ESA, this is about extra money they may have been entitled to"". ""The key lesson we're learning is that it's a mistake to try to prepopulate information without being in touch with claimants,"" she adds. Following this, the Lords adjourn. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Black of Brentwood sums up the debate, telling peers he fears that ""the government is in denial, which is extremely sad"". Lord Black says the government ""must listen to the facts, and what is really going on the ground, and then act"". Peers are now hearing the repeat of an urgent question in the Commons earlier about sickness benefit underpayments. Debate on Music Education in Schools Education Minister Lord Agnew says music is a statutory part of the national curriculum, so all students in school aged 5 to 14 ""must study the subject"". He says between 2016 and 2020 the government is providing Â£300m for 120 music education hubs so all students can learn a musical instrument. He adds that a plan setting out the priorities for music education will be revealed by ministers ""in the coming months"". He denies that the English Baccalaureate is responsible for forcing music ""out of the curriculum"", and says the number of pupils taking music qualifications has been ""stable since 2010"". The debate on World Menopause Day comes to an end, and with it our coverage from the House of Commons for today. The day began with questions to environment ministers, followed by an urgent question on underpayments to tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits. It wasannounced yesterdaythat the government will now pay Â£1.5bn in back payments to correct errors made when people were moved onto Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Pensions Minister Sarah Newton prompted shouts from the opposition benches when she claimed ""good housekeeping"" at her department had led to the problem being spotted. Then Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom revealed the Offensive Weapons Bill will return to the Commons on Monday, during her business statement to MPs. She also responded to a series of concerns raised by MPs regarding a ""meaningful vote"" on the final Brexit deal. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour education spokesman Lord Watson of Invergowrie says it is ""inevitable"" that schools will have to cut back on teaching music, as the money given to local authorities is ""continuously cut"". He says the government is ""in denial about the declining number of students taking Music GCSE year on year"". The English Baccalaureate is ""detrimental"" to arts subjects, he says, and the government's claim that there is no less emphasis on the arts ""does not stack up"". He says ""too many schools lack the time, resources and expertise"" to deliver sufficient music education, and the government ""must support these schools"". Lord Watson says Labour would introduce an arts pupil premium to ensure arts facilities in state schools match those in the private sector. He asks whether ministers ""are content to music to remain for the wealthy"", as he says this is ""what is currently happening"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Lord Storey says although music is part of the national curriculum, fewer schools follow it because they have turned into academies. This means there is ""no real pressure on schools to teach music"", he adds. He blames this on ""a combination of austerity, narrowing of the curriculum and a focus on exam results rather than the quality of education experience"". He says the school where he was a headteacher in a deprived part of Liverpool had a full-time music teacher, which was ""life changing for those pupils"". ""Every child must have a rich education,"" he says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour peer Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall says says she agrees with all statements that have been raised in this debate. She says the government has been ""too restrictive"" in trying to implement a ""good standard of education"". She argues that the English Baccalaureate accountability measures ""are too narrow"". Universities in the Russell Group ""have given the impression to schools that arts subjects are not strong enough subjects for getting into university"", she says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Tory peer Lord Borwick says technology is expanding the possibilities of music teaching, pointing out that the quality of listening technology for iPhones and iPads is ""improving rapidly."" This will lead to mobile teaching and ""inevitably lead to the reduction in cost"", he says. ""What an inspiring future is coming our way. I'm much more optimistic"", he adds. New software needs to be developed for this, he says, suggesting it is important students are taught ""the skills for the future"", and this opens up music for those who lack ability or aptitude. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Responding to the debate, Communities Minister Nigel Adams says the ""inconsistent levels of awareness"" about the menopause reflects ""a history of stigma"". He says he agrees that it is important that education about the menopause is improved. With an ageing workforce, he adds that positive action by employers will benefit productivity and retention. ""One in four women in the workplace are going through or have gone through the menopause"", he adds. He concludes that it is essential that all employers and healthcare professionals are ""fully informed"" about providing treatment and support. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat Lord Wallace of Saltaire says having fewer music teacher vacancies is not something to celebrate. ""That's because there are fewer posts to appoint teachers to"", he adds. ""To neglect this dimension of education in order to cut taxes and public spending, would be as irrational as cutting spending on the police whilst claiming to support the principles of private property."" Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative Lord Lexden, who is president of the Independent Schools Association, says music is ""one of the great strengths of the independent sector of education"". ""I draw attention to this state of affairs, not in any spirit of self congratulations,"" he says, but to point out that independent schools can assist state schools with resources. He says state and private schools are collaborating to a ""greater extent than ever before"" on music education, with independent schools being ""actively encouraged"" to share resources. But he says ""success will only be achieved when state and independent schools come together by their own free will"". World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow women and equalities minister Carolyn Harris welcomes every man in the chamber to the ""sisterhood"". She tells MPs that ""for too long the menopause has been...the punchline of a joke that is actually anything but funny"". Many women, she adds, are ""completely unprepared for this phase of their lives"". She calls for education for girls and boys on the menopause. She asks if the Department for Education would consider extending sexual health education guidance. Carolyn Harris also criticises the limited training given to doctors on the menopause, and its misdiagnosis as depression. She concludes by calling for a mandatory menopause policy within workplaces. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Marion Fellows jokes her daughter ""frequently accuses her of oversharing"" but adds: ""I've been there, I've done that, I've got the T-shirt"" She says she started early and the menopause felt like it went on for a long time. Ms Fellows says the menopause can have a psychological and physical impact on women and it is vital health professionals ""take them seriously"". The MP also says that it is ""not uncommon"" for women to experience sexual dysfunction during the menopause that can affect their relationships, self-confidence and mental health. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament The Earl of Clancarty, a crossbench peer, says the future of music and other arts is at stake, adding that it is ""getting a little frustrating, having to quote back to the department its own figures"". ""Music should not become the preserve of the rich,"" he says, but suggests this is the way things are going. He criticises the restrictions on accessibility to art subjects, with many schools only letting students study one arts subject, and 70% of secondary school music teachers being forced to also teach other subjects, which he calls ""a nonsense"". World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Rachel Maclean calls the menopause ""one of the last taboos"". She tells MPs she is menopausal herself, and suffers from debilitating headaches. ""There is so much ignorance out there"", she says, adding that the menopause is ""not just hot flushes and night sweats"". ""This is not a women's issue"" she says, but ""a society issue"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative peer and chairman of the English Schools Orchestra Lord Lingfield says the fact that fewer children are receiving education in playing musical instruments is ""a worrying trend"". He says the 800 secondary schools which still have orchestras should be praised, but more needs to be done to ensure the idea is ""encouraged in all schools"". ""There needs to be a national plan for music education,"" he says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour peer Lord Lipsey, who chairs a parliamentary group on classical music, says music graduates ""are very hard sought"" by employers, even outside of musical occupations. The discipline requires ""a tremendous amount of skill and focus"", he says. However, he adds that the value of music education has been ""overshadowed"" by a ""streamlined focus"" on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Clement Jones says the Music GCSE should be available in all schools, and the arts must not become the ""preserve of students at private schools"". ""We cannot afford to lose music education from schools, and the government must ensure we protect the teaching of music by taking the focus off of the English Baccalaureate,"" he says. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament The debate on supermarket supply chains comes to a close, and MPs begin their second backbench business debate of the afternoon, on World Menopause Day. Opening the debate, Labour MP Martin Whitfield says recent research found half of working women found work difficult due to the menopause, with 10% giving up work altogether. ""The menopause is an occupational health issue that rests on the desks of managers, male managers as well as female managers"", he says. He concludes by asking men to ""take up the challenge"" of discussing the menopause with those close to them at home and the workplace, so women do not ""suffer in silence"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Opening the debate, Lord Black of Brentwood says musical education is ""dying a rapid death"" and has become ""only an option for the privileged"". The gap in provision between state and private schools is ""shameful"", he adds. There has been a 40% decrease in the number of students taking A-Level Music in the last eight years, he says, adding that much of the blame ""must be placed on the English Baccalaureate"". The qualification, he tells peers, ""has harmed all creative arts subjects"". ""Music is not an add-on, it is not a past time, it is not a nice-to-have, it is an important grounding to our society and is as important as maths and physics,"" he says. Exploitation in Supermarket Supply Chains Debate House of CommonsParliament Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins says the government is determined to end modern slavery ""in our communities and in the global economy"". She adds that since the ""landmark""  Modern Slavery Act, there have been more convictions and arrests every year, with 950 currently live. Ms Atkins adds that this year the government will invest at least Â£61m towards end modern slavery in the UK and abroad. ""No production line, however how far reaching, should ever involve the exploitation of human beings"", she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Why children should be wary of live-streamingOne in 10 children have been asked to remove their clothes over online video chats, says the NSPCC.UK","A surge in the use of video chats and live-streaming among children is leaving them vulnerable to abuse, the NSPCC has warned, calling for a social network regulator to be introduced. A survey of 40,000 children aged seven to 16 found a quarter had used the services. On video chats, 10% had been asked to remove their clothes. The NSPCC says groomers can record the abuse and use it to blackmail victims. The home secretary has ""demanded""tech giants take online abuse seriously. One child, ""Ben"", tried to take his own life after being blackmailed for sexual images shared between six men. It began when he was tricked into thinking he was speaking to a female friend-of-a-friend. Three weeks later, the person revealed himself to be a man, and - blackmailing him and threatening to kill his parents - coerced Ben into sending sexual images and performing sex acts live over video chat. ""This man had spent weeks pretending to be a girl and finding out information about every part of his life,"" Ben's father told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""He knew who his family were - nans, brothers, sisters. ""He knew what school Ben went to. Everything. They find out everything to use this information to manipulate you."" The images and videos sent by Ben to the man were then shared with five other men, who bombarded Ben with further demands. ""He just felt helpless and didn't know what to do,"" his father said. ""He was a different child but we didn't know why."" After two years of meeting these demands, Ben attempted to take his own life - leading the abuse to be uncovered. The main perpetrator was later jailed for four-and-a-half years. The family says the effect has been devastating. ""You don't see it coming,"" his father said. ""And when it does, your world falls apart and it's so hard to get that back to how you were - to a really close, loving [family], doing everything together. ""He won't go out, he doesn't play sport anymore. He's not the child he was."" Some 19% of primary school children surveyed had live-streamed The NSPCC survey - the first of its kind - suggests use of video chats and live-streaming among children has risen rapidly. Some 29% of secondary school children have broadcast themselves online according to the findings - almost three times a previous estimate, by Ofcom, that suggested one in 10 children aged 12 to 15 had live-streamed. The charity said the rise was likely to be down to the introduction of live-streaming capabilities on some of the biggest social media platforms. The NSPCC said it was now calling on the government to create an independent regulator to force social networks into introducing measures that make children safer. Of the children surveyed who had video-chatted with someone they had not met, one in 10 had been asked to get undressed. Some 19% of primary school children surveyed had live-streamed, with 8% of those saying that another person live-streaming was semi-naked at the time. One girl, aged 10-11, told the charity: ""My friend was doing a live-stream and an adult man was asking for her to video request him, so she did and he showed his private parts."" Another girl, aged 11-12, said while on video chat ""this man was pulling, touching, and showing his privates"". Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, said the popularity of live-streaming meant children were ""being pressured into going along with situations that make them feel uncomfortable. ""What's really disturbing is that groomers can then screenshot or record live-streamed abuse, and use it to blackmail the child or share it with others."" In September, Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned he would ""not be afraid to take action"" against tech giants if they did not help to tackle child sexual abuse online. Mr Javid said he was ""demanding"" companies take ""more measures"" - or face new legislation. He added that some sites were refusing to take online abuse seriously - and highlighted live-streaming of child abuse as a growing problem. Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News channel in the UKand on iPlayer afterwards.

Top US diplomat in Turkey over Saudi writer,"The investigation team included prosecutors and forensics experts in white overalls Turkish investigators have entered the residence of the Saudi consul in Istanbul to gather more evidence about the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi. Turkish officials suspect the Saudi journalist was killed during a visit to the nearby consulate on 2 October. The consul, Mohammed al-Otaibi, flew back to Riyadh on Tuesday. He denies knowing what happened to Mr Khashoggi. However, a Turkish newspaper saysMr Otaibi can be heard in purported audio recordings of Mr Khashoggi's death,external. Yeni Safak, which is close to the government, quotes him as telling alleged Saudi agents sent to Istanbul: ""Do this outside. You're going to get me in trouble."" Gruesome details said to be of Mr Khashoggi's last moments have emerged in a range of media outlets. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? This video can not be played President Trump speaking in the Oval Office In Washington, President Trump says his administration has asked to hear the audio recording - ""if it exists"". ""I want to find out what happened, where was the fault,"" he told reporters. He also dismissed the idea he was ""giving cover"" to the Saudis - a key US ally. Mr Trump earlier cautioned against rushing to blame Saudi leaders, telling the Associated Press thatthey were being treated as ""guilty until proven innocent"",external. Earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the case with Turkey's president and foreign minister during a visit to Ankara. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the meeting was ""beneficial and fruitful"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan On Tuesday, Mr Pompeo travelled to Riyadh for talks with Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who he said ""strongly denied"" any involvement in the journalist's disappearance. Mr Khashoggi is a US resident and columnist for the Washington Post who went into self-imposed exile last year after reportedly being warned by Saudi officials to stop criticising the crown prince's policies. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Donald Trump and a world of disorder On Wednesday afternoon, Turkish investigators entered the Saudi consul's residence, about 200m (650ft) from the consulate, as part of the probe into Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. The team reportedly included prosecutors and forensics experts in white overalls. The search of the consul's residence was delayed by a day The search had been expected to take place on Tuesday, but it was delayed because the consul's family were still inside, Mr Cavusoglu said. They eventually left Turkey on a commercial flight on Tuesday afternoon. Several vehicles with Saudi diplomatic number plates were filmed by CCTV cameras moving from the consulate to the residence just under two hours after the journalist entered the consulate on 2 October. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Turkish investigators quoted by two news agencies said the search of the consulate itself earlier this week had yielded more evidence that Mr Khashoggi was killed there. Mr Khashoggi arrived at the consulate at 13:14 local time for an appointment to obtain paperwork so he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e. Saudi officials have insisted Mr Khashoggi left the consulate soon afterwards and came to no harm. But Turkish officials believe an assault and struggle took place in the building. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists They allege that Mr Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents who were pictured entering and leaving Turkey on CCTV footage released to media outlets. The New York Times reports that four of the 15 agents have links to Crown Prince Mohammed, while another is a senior figure in the country's interior ministry. On Tuesday, G7 foreign ministers called for Saudi Arabia to conduct a ""transparent"" investigation into the issue.

The images and videos sent by Ben to the man were then shared with five other men, who bombarded Ben with further demands. ""He just felt helpless and didn't know what to do,"" his father said. ""He was a different child but we didn't know why."" After two years of meeting these demands, Ben attempted to take his own life - leading the abuse to be uncovered. The main perpetrator was later jailed for four-and-a-half years. The family says the effect has been devastating. ""You don't see it coming,"" his father said. ""And when it does, your world falls apart and it's so hard to get that back to how you were - to a really close, loving [family], doing everything together. ""He won't go out, he doesn't play sport anymore. He's not the child he was."" Some 19% of primary school children surveyed had live-streamed The NSPCC survey - the first of its kind - suggests use of video chats and live-streaming among children has risen rapidly. Some 29% of secondary school children have broadcast themselves online according to the findings - almost three times a previous estimate, by Ofcom, that suggested one in 10 children aged 12 to 15 had live-streamed. The charity said the rise was likely to be down to the introduction of live-streaming capabilities on some of the biggest social media platforms. The NSPCC said it was now calling on the government to create an independent regulator to force social networks into introducing measures that make children safer. Of the children surveyed who had video-chatted with someone they had not met, one in 10 had been asked to get undressed. Some 19% of primary school children surveyed had live-streamed, with 8% of those saying that another person live-streaming was semi-naked at the time. One girl, aged 10-11, told the charity: ""My friend was doing a live-stream and an adult man was asking for her to video request him, so she did and he showed his private parts."" Another girl, aged 11-12, said while on video chat ""this man was pulling, touching, and showing his privates"". Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, said the popularity of live-streaming meant children were ""being pressured into going along with situations that make them feel uncomfortable. ""What's really disturbing is that groomers can then screenshot or record live-streamed abuse, and use it to blackmail the child or share it with others."" In September, Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned he would ""not be afraid to take action"" against tech giants if they did not help to tackle child sexual abuse online. Mr Javid said he was ""demanding"" companies take ""more measures"" - or face new legislation. He added that some sites were refusing to take online abuse seriously - and highlighted live-streaming of child abuse as a growing problem.

Edinburgh residents consulted on tourist tax,"A citywide consultation on plans to introduce a ""tourist tax"" to Edinburgh has begun. The City of Edinburgh Council has suggested that the levy could raise Â£11m a year, to be spent on growing tourism and managing its impact. It proposes charging either 2% or Â£2 per room, per night, to all guests in all forms of accommodation. Now it wants to hear the views of the tourism sector, businesses, investors, visitors and residents in the capital. The tax - or ""transient visitor levy"" (TVL) - would be charged all year round but it would be capped at seven nights. Could Edinburgh be next for a tourist tax? What Airbnb really does to a neighbourhood The council wants to know what people think of the scheme - and what they think the income should be spent on. An online consultation will last for eight weeks, while industry representatives, investors and residents will be invited to a series of workshops. Council officers have also offered to attend board meetings, membership meetings and one-to-ones with people in the tourism industry. Opponents to the scheme have previously criticised the plans and claim there has been no ""meaningful engagement"" with the tourism industry. Earlier this month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told leaders of the Scottish Tourism Alliance that she wanted a ""national discussion and conversation"" on the issue. Council leader Adam McVey said he wrote to the Scottish government to welcome the move. He said: ""The first minister's announcement was welcome in that their work will provide a national context for our proposals, adding to the detailed engagement we have already carried out as well as the citywide public consultation we are embarking upon today. ""We have always acknowledged the need for legislation in taking this forward but we as a council have also maintained the need to develop our own plans to make sure it's not just any TVL but the right TVL for Edinburgh, taking account of our local circumstances. ""Our plans have been developed through engagement with the industry and we see this consultation, alongside the Scottish government's, as a way of further co-producing a scheme that works best for the city and our stakeholders. ""We are very much listening to everyone involved around what they believe is a fair, simple and workable policy.""

'Teach children how to avoid dog bites',"More needs be done to teach children how to stay safe around dogs and to reduce the risk of avoidable injuries. That's the view of MPs who want animal behavioural experts and charities to come up with a canine childhood education plan for schools and parents. They also want a review into causes of ""dog aggression"" and training courses for owners whose pets misbehave. Some charities want dog safety to be on the national curriculum but ministers say there are no plans to add it. The cross-party Commons Environment Committee said it was shocking that children under nine were statistically more likely than any other age group to end up in hospital after being bitten and to suffer serious, often life-changing, injuries. Despite this, schools are not required to use ""readily available"" teaching materials on dog safety, and provision around the UK is patchy. Information given to new parents did not currently include specific advice about keeping their family safe around pets. The Dangerous Dogs Act 25 years on MPs to examine Dangerous Dogs Act Dog attacks on postal workers 'appalling' This needed to change, the committee said, urging ministers to support an expert study into the most effective education measures and to make sure they were implemented consistently. At the same time, it said there needed to be a greater emphasis on responsible ownership through campaigns highlighting good and bad behaviour. The committee said the evidence showed ""human factors played a prominent role prior to the majority of dog attacks and any systematic attempt to reduce the number of incidents needs to place a greater emphasis on education"". The report cites NHS data showing the number of hospitalisations as a result of dog bites went up from 4,110 in 2005 to 7,461 in 2017. Among the committee's other recommendations are: An end to the ban on transferring animals of banned breeds to new owners where they are deemed to be safe An independent review into the reasons for dog aggression and attacks Mandatory dog awareness courses for owners involved in low to mid-level offences, similar to remedial courses for speeding drivers Dog control notices targeting anti-social behaviour at early stage A new single piece of dog control legislation giving councils and other bodies new enforcement powers The committee said there were a range of views on how best to educate reckless dog owners. It pointed out that licensing was opposed by several leading charities, including Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, as it was likely to be seen as a tax on owners. Never go near dogs they don't know and only pat or play with a dog if they have asked the owner Never leave young children unsupervised with any dog Don't let them tease their dog or play too roughly with it Don't go near or disturb a dog that is sleeping, eating, ill or injured Source:The Dogs Trust,external Neil Parish, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the much-criticised 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act was ""riddled with inconsistencies"". It was a ""death sentence"", he said, for many good-natured animals that needed a home and posed little threat to humans but faced being destroyed because of breed-specific restrictions. ""All dogs can be dangerous and we can't ban all dogs that might one day bite someone,"" he said. ""Evidence from across the world shows that the government should focus instead on encouraging responsible ownership, improving education and ensuring offenders face robust penalties.""

Pompeo in Turkey over missing Saudi writer,"The investigation team included prosecutors and forensics experts in white overalls Turkish investigators have entered the residence of the Saudi consul in Istanbul to gather more evidence about the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi. Turkish officials suspect the Saudi journalist was killed during a visit to the nearby consulate on 2 October. The consul, Mohammed al-Otaibi, flew back to Riyadh on Tuesday. He denies knowing what happened to Mr Khashoggi. However, a Turkish newspaper saysMr Otaibi can be heard in purported audio recordings of Mr Khashoggi's death,external. Yeni Safak, which is close to the government, quotes him as telling alleged Saudi agents sent to Istanbul: ""Do this outside. You're going to get me in trouble."" Gruesome details said to be of Mr Khashoggi's last moments have emerged in a range of media outlets. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? This video can not be played President Trump speaking in the Oval Office In Washington, President Trump says his administration has asked to hear the audio recording - ""if it exists"". ""I want to find out what happened, where was the fault,"" he told reporters. He also dismissed the idea he was ""giving cover"" to the Saudis - a key US ally. Mr Trump earlier cautioned against rushing to blame Saudi leaders, telling the Associated Press thatthey were being treated as ""guilty until proven innocent"",external. Earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the case with Turkey's president and foreign minister during a visit to Ankara. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the meeting was ""beneficial and fruitful"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan On Tuesday, Mr Pompeo travelled to Riyadh for talks with Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who he said ""strongly denied"" any involvement in the journalist's disappearance. Mr Khashoggi is a US resident and columnist for the Washington Post who went into self-imposed exile last year after reportedly being warned by Saudi officials to stop criticising the crown prince's policies. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Donald Trump and a world of disorder On Wednesday afternoon, Turkish investigators entered the Saudi consul's residence, about 200m (650ft) from the consulate, as part of the probe into Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. The team reportedly included prosecutors and forensics experts in white overalls. The search of the consul's residence was delayed by a day The search had been expected to take place on Tuesday, but it was delayed because the consul's family were still inside, Mr Cavusoglu said. They eventually left Turkey on a commercial flight on Tuesday afternoon. Several vehicles with Saudi diplomatic number plates were filmed by CCTV cameras moving from the consulate to the residence just under two hours after the journalist entered the consulate on 2 October. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Turkish investigators quoted by two news agencies said the search of the consulate itself earlier this week had yielded more evidence that Mr Khashoggi was killed there. Mr Khashoggi arrived at the consulate at 13:14 local time for an appointment to obtain paperwork so he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e. Saudi officials have insisted Mr Khashoggi left the consulate soon afterwards and came to no harm. But Turkish officials believe an assault and struggle took place in the building. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists They allege that Mr Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents who were pictured entering and leaving Turkey on CCTV footage released to media outlets. The New York Times reports that four of the 15 agents have links to Crown Prince Mohammed, while another is a senior figure in the country's interior ministry. On Tuesday, G7 foreign ministers called for Saudi Arabia to conduct a ""transparent"" investigation into the issue.

UK cannabis debate,"The government has said it will review the medicinal use of cannabis The government has said itwill review the use of medicinal cannabis, although recreational usage will still be illegal. Cannabis is the most widely-used illegal drug in Britain, according todrugs advice service Frank,external. It comes from the cannabis plant and contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which affects the mind and mood. Cannabis comes from the cannabis plant The THC can give users a ""chilled out"" feeling but it can also cause hallucinations and make people feel paranoid and panicked. It is normally smoked but can also be eaten and comes in three main forms: Hash - a lump of resin Marijuana - the dried leaves and flowering parts of the female plant Oil - a thick honey-like substance Cannabis is aclass B drug,externalmeaning it it is illegal to possess. Anyone found with the drug could be imprisoned for up to five years while supplying it can be punished with a 14-year jail sentence or an unlimited fine. Supplying cannabis can lead to a 14-year jail term or unlimited fine The penalty depends on the amount of the drug, the person's criminal history and other aggravating or mitigating factors. Police can also issue a warning or an on-the-spot fine of Â£90 to someone found with cannabis. Alternatively, officers could issue a cannabis warning which goes on a person's record but is not revealed by a standard criminal records check. Of the 16,101 convictions for cannabis possession in the UK in 2016, 292 were jailed. The legality of recreational use is not up for debate, the government has said. Cannabis also contains cannabidiol (CBD) which scientists are investigating as a medical treatment. CBD-based treatments have shown some promising results for reducing seizures in children with severe epilepsies. Medical trials have largely focused on pharmacological preparations, but some parents of children with epilepsy have been buying oils containing CBD and THC. The mother of 12-year-old Billy Caldwell has reignited the debate about legalising the drug after saying it helps calm her son's seizures caused by severe epilepsy. Charlotte Caldwell, from County Tyrone, had been to Canada to buy her son cannabis oil but it was confiscated upon her return to the UK. The Home Office then returned the drug to Ms Caldwell and her son, who had been admitted to hospital,under a special 20-day licence. This video can not be played Cannabis oil row: Mother calls for drug to be legalised There is currently little scientific evidence on the safety and effectiveness of these oils as a treatment for epilepsy, although they do contain the same active ingredients. Meanwhile, Sativex, a cannabis-based spray, has been able to be legally prescribed since 2006. It is licensed to treat muscle stiffness and spasms in people with multiple sclerosis and although it is available throughout the UK, only in Wales can it be got for free on the NHS. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy. Regular recreational cannabis use increases the risk of developing a psychotic illness, such as schizophrenia,according to the NHS,external. This risk is higher if it is used by teenagers and younger people as the drug interferes with development of the still-growing brain. Long-term use can also affect the ability to learn and concentrate. Recreational cannabis is often smoked Effects of using the drug can include a feeling of happiness and relaxation but it can also make users feel sick, faint and sleepy and cause memory loss. About 10% of regular users of cannabis become addicted to the drug, the NHS said. Withdrawal symptoms can include mood swings, restlessness and difficulty sleeping. In recent years, various stronger types of cannabis, grown for their higher concentration of the main active ingredient THC have invaded the street market. It's argued that cannabis with high levels of THC can lead to people developing psychiatric issues. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, there is sufficient evidence to show that people who use cannabis, particularly at a younger age, such as around the age of 15, have a higher than average risk of developing a psychotic illness, including schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The two-part government review will be looking at how cannabis-based treatments will work. Firstly, it will make recommendations on which cannabis-based medicines might offer real medical and therapeutic benefits to patients. In the second part, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs will consider whether changes should be made to the classification of these products after assessing ""the balance of harms and public health needs"". More than 25,000 peoplesigned a recent petition,externalcalling on the government to legalise cannabis for both recreational and medicinal uses. The petition's founders said banning the drug failed to reduce its use and it was ""hypocritical"" of the government to allow the sale of alcohol and tobacco but not cannabis. They also said selling the drug in licensed shops would limit the access of young people to cannabis and also regulate the THC level. The campaigners said cannabis has ""shown promise"" in reducing seizures and ""is far safer"" than other painkillers. It has also been argued that licensing and selling cannabiscould net up to Â£3.5bn for the government,external. Campaigners want cannabis legalised in the UK The government said fully-tested medicinal cannabis products can already be licensed for sale in the UK, such as Sativex, and it is open to further applications. Former Conservative leader Lord Hague has called for a ""decisive change"" in the law on cannabis saying ""any war"" against the drug had been ""irreversibly lost"". Writingin the Daily Telegraph,external, he said said the case of Billy Caldwell was an ""illuminating moment"" which revealed government policy to be ""inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date"". In response,the government said,externalit had ""no intention"" of reviewing cannabis' classification. It said: ""There is strong scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can be detrimental to people's mental and physical health."" It added that any debate about the medicinal benefits of cannabis-based medicines did not extend to illicit possession. Many other countries, including much of the US, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, have legalised the use of medicinal cannabis. On Monday, Canada's House of Commonsvoted to legalise recreational cannabis.,external Uruguay legalised the recreational use of cannabis in 2013 with people allowed to grow up to six plants at home for personal use. In Spain, it is legal to use cannabis in private places and cultivate plants for personal use. Canada's House of Commons has just voted to legalise cannabis Cannabis use in the Netherlands is technically illegal but possession of up to 5g (0.2oz) for personal use is decriminalised, although police can confiscate the drug. Use is accepted at certain coffee shops. Recreational use is also decriminalised in several other countries, including Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica and Luxembourg.

'We know the world is watchingâ,"For many Canadians, the idea of legal cannabis once seemed a pipe dream. But from 17 October, Canada will become the first G7 country to give recreational cannabis the green light. It's following a trail first blazed by Uruguay in 2013. ""It's becoming a serious industry,"" says one entrepreneur. Supporters say legalisation will bring new medical advances and help stamp out drug-related crime. But some critics argue that long-term use can harm people's health. Others worry about how it will be policed. So who are some of the so-called ""ganjapreneurs"" riding this new legal high? Vinay Tolia ran his own hedge fund before becoming chief executive of Flowr this year. He co-founded the cannabis producer with Tom Flow, an industry veteran who sold his last firm, MedReleaf, for more than $2.5bn (Â£1.9bn). Vinay says getting into the legal cannabis industry is ""the right thing to do from a social level"". ""You can objectively see that the drug policies have been a failure,"" he says. ""And why not study it? There are tonnes of medicinal benefits waiting to be discovered that are going to be hugely beneficial to a lot of people."" Flowr runs an 84,000-sq ft facility in British Columbia where it grows plants under highly controlled conditions. By managing humidity, airflow and other factors in a sterilised setting more akin to a pharmaceutical lab, Flowr says it can mass produce cannabis that's of a consistent, high quality. ""There is a lot of painstaking care in making the right plant,"" says Vinay. ""[Cannabis] is very sensitive. You can have the same strains in two different rooms with a slightly different temperature and get completely different chemical compositions."" Flowr has also teamed up with gardening industry giant Scotts Miracle-Gro, opening a research facility to study pot genetics and how the plant can affect users. Many of Canada's larger firms are aiming for rapid industrial-scale turnover, but Kelly Coulter has other plans. ""My farm is going to be small and slow,"" she says. ""I'm going to be like one of those vineyards in Italy who sell out because they have the best grape, and then we rest in the winter."" This year, she's leased two acres of land in British Columbia and plans to start an outdoor growing operation called Slo Farms. ""We've got the only Mediterranean climate in Canada, which is ideal for growing cannabis, and all food."" Kelly used to own an organic farm and says marijuana cultivation felt like a natural career transition. ""Most people care where their food comes from,"" she says. ""Right now we're seeing industrialised agriculture becoming exposed to consumer critique, the same will happen to cannabis."" Slo Farms will be an all-female business, and Kelly says licences for small-scale production will help more women to break into the industry. ""The big licences, those are really expensive operations and women don't always have access to that kind of money. ""We know the world is watching,"" adds Kelly. ""We hope other countries will see what's happened here and replicate it."" Ron Throgmartin admits he is ""not a marijuana smoker"", but as a businessman he sees an opportunity in commercial cannabis real estate. He ran his own property firm for 20 years and is now chief executive of Diego Pellicer. The firm develops and leases property for marijuana businesses and has just opened its second US retail outlet with the help of designer Jill Savini, former creative director of the original Apple store. Ron says he plans to expand into Canada, but he's ""cautious"" and sees more earning potential in the larger, neighbouring US market. ""At one point the US will federally legalise cannabis and when that happens, Canada will become an afterthought."" He also believes legalisation will eventually concentrate industry control into the hands of larger, probably tobacco corporations. ""Their model's dying so if they don't find something to transition to they'll be in trouble."" So unlike other firms, Ron says he's in no rush to have weed legalised in the US at a national level. ""[I would like] more time for Diego Pellicer to become a bigger company so we can be a candidate for acquisition from bigger corporations who we can't compete with. ""I'm always thinking about tomorrow and next year."" Sean Roby runs Bud and Breakfast, a self-styled ""AirBnB of cannabis"". The accommodation-sharing platform lets travellers search for ""420-friendly"" accommodation around the world. ""We get rid of the awkward factor,'' jokes Sean. The website has nearly 100 properties registered in Canada. He says around 30 have signed up in the last week alone, with more Canadians hoping to cash in when legalisation comes into force later this month. Bud and Breakfast also runs dedicated resorts in Denver, Hawaii, Uruguay and Jamaica where guests can enjoy cannabis yoga classes, ""puff and paint"" lessons and other eye-catching pursuits. Sean founded the firm four years ago after organising wine tours and adventure holidays in California and Hawaii for his family business. He says it's ""akin to wine tourism"", but many people come to his resort to help with severe medical conditions too. ""Cannabis is much safer than alcohol as well,"" argues Sean. ""I think it can obviously slow down productivity if you use it too much but if you use it in a vacation setting as an experience, it can be a nice thing to relax and watch the world go by, to escape the grind, which is what we all like to do.""

Self-lubricating condom 'success',"Scientists say they have found a way to make self-lubricating latex condoms that become slippery on contact. It is thanks to a special, durable coating that should last throughout intercourse, says the team, backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They hope it will make condoms more appealing to use and thereby prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well as unwanted pregnancies. Without enough lubrication, sex can be painful and condoms may split or slip. When used correctly, condoms are a highly effective contraceptive, but not everyone likes them. They are often already lubricated to make them easier to use, but sometimes this might not be enough for comfort. People can add lubricant, but this can be messy and may need several applications, interrupting sex. Almost half of under-25s never use a condom with a new partner Emerging sex disease could become next superbug Contraception: Which is most effective? Researchers say the self-lubricating condom, which becomes really slippery once it comes into contact with body fluid, should get round this. It could withstand intercourse involving at least 1,000 thrusts without losing its slipperiness,the Royal Society Open Science journal reports.,external According to the researchers, intercourse typically lasts half that time, but some sessions are longer. When tested for comparison, regular condoms coated with a shop-bought, water-based liquid lubricant were more slippery initially, but became less so after around 600 thrusts. A group of volunteers were also asked to touch and rate both condoms, in terms of slip and slide. Most of the 33 men and women rated the self-lubricating one more highly. Researcher Prof Mark Grinstaff, from Boston University, said: ""It feels a bit slimy when you handle it dry, but in the presence of water or natural fluids it becomes really slick. You only need a little bit of fluid to activate it."" The researchers say more tests are needed to compare how well the self-lubricating condom performs against other brands of condoms in real-life settings. Clinical trials with couples could begin early next year, says Prof Grinstaff. A spin-off company from the university is now planning to develop a product for the commercial market, subject to regulatory approval. Dr Nicola Irwin, from Queen's University, Belfast, is an expert in healthcare materials and technology. She said similar ""hydrophilic"" coatings have been used in urinary catheters to improve comfort. ""These coated catheters are, in general, associated with a greater degree of user acceptability than the alterative uncoated and gel-lubricated devices. This user preference is mainly due to the reduced levels of discomfort upon insertion, together with the ease of handling and convenience of 'ready-to-use' hydrophilic-coated catheters. ""It may be expected that the newly developed hydrophilic-coated condoms could afford similar benefits, but we need more trials."" Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong, Australia, have been working on making a self-lubricating condom out of toughhydrogels,externalrather than latex or rubber, that feel more like real skin. Oil-based products, including some hand creams, can damage latex condoms so it's important to avoid them. Use silicone or water-based lubricants instead Never re-use a condom Be careful how you store condoms because they can easily get damaged, especially if they've been kept in a wallet, pocket, or bag Check the expiry date When you put a condom on, it's important to squeeze the tip, to get rid of any air. If you don't, the condom is likely to break Bekki Burbidge, from the sexual health charity FPA, said: ""We welcome new innovations to encourage condom use. Condoms are the only method of contraception that also help to protect against STIs, so it's important that people feel confident and comfortable using them. ""Lubrication can make sex more comfortable and enjoyable so we encourage people to try out different water-based lubricants as well as different sizes, shapes and textures of condoms to find out what suits them and enhances their sexual pleasure.""

Briton in record attempt has bike stolen,"Charlie Condell has ridden through 17 countries so far A British teenager who is trying to become the youngest person to cycle solo around the world has had his bike stolen in Australia. Charlie Condell, 18, has already ridden through Europe and Asia since embarking on an eight-month journey in July. However he woke up in a hostel in Townsville, Queensland, on Tuesday to discover his bike was missing. Mr Condell, from Bristol, said his passport, camping gear and other cycling equipment had also been taken. He is already more than 100 days into his attempt to cycle unassisted through 21 countries around the world - an 18,000-mile (30,000km) journey. Of losing his bike, he said: ""You can never quite believe it - I thought maybe someone had moved it at first. ""But then I came to the sinking realisation that it was gone and I just had on my shirt and my board shorts and one bag."" The teenager said he had customised his bike for the ride He said he had cycled through 17 countries before arriving in Townsville, riding up to 125 miles per day and flying between continents. He estimated that at least Â£4,000 ($5,200) in equipment had been stolen, forcing a delay in his plans. Despite the setback, he said he hoped to complete his trip by March - his original goal. British man Tom Davies is believed to hold the recordfor being the youngest person to cycle around the world unassisted. He was 19 when he completed his six-month journey in 2015. ""This has been the first thing that's caused me to stop properly,"" Mr Condell told the BBC, adding that he had also lost some equipment in India. But he said locals had offered him clothes, accommodation and replacement bikes. Mr Condell during a leg in Jaipur, India ""It's not going to stop me - once I get another bike, I'll be off again,"" Mr Condell said. He added that he would remain a fan of Australia - ""although it's a bit too hot"". Mr Condell, who finished school earlier this year, had originally planned to ride only around Europe during summer. However, he was inspired to take on his world attempt after realising that he could achieve the distance. The man who wanted to clean up the world Around the globe in seven years... on a bike His next destinations are New Zealand and North America, after which he plans to fly back to Europe to complete his ride in March. Before setting off, he wrote on his website: ""There will, of course, be many challenges, ranging from the heat of Death Valley [in the US] to the humidity of India, but I hope to overcome them all and record the whole experience.""

Woman kills self after husband fakes death,"A photo of the couple with their eyes blurred has circulated widely on Chinese social media A man in China whose wife killed herself and their two children after he allegedly faked his own death for an insurance payout has given himself up to police. The 34-year-old was presumed dead after a car he borrowed was found in a river, though his body was never recovered. He did not tell his wife his alleged plan and she believed he had died. She drowned herself and their children three weeks later, after posting a suicide note online. The man, who police said was surnamed He, turned himself in to police in Xinhua county in Hunan province last Friday. He has been detained on charges of insurance fraud and intentional damage to property, Xinhua police said in a statement on WeChat - a social media platform. 'Why we had to fake my murder' Ukraine reporter fake killer details plot The MP who faked his death In early September, Mr He bought an insurance plan worth one million yuan (Â£110,000; $145,000) without his wife's knowledge, police said. According to a report by state-run Voice of China radio, his wife was named as the beneficiary. On 19 September, Mr He used a borrowed vehicle to fake his own death in a car crash, police said. He was found to have loans of more than 100,000 yuan. On 11 October, the bodies of his 31-year-old wife, their four-year-old son and three-year-old daughter were found in a pond near their home, according to the Voice of China, which broadcast parts of the suicide note that had been posted on WeChat. Mr He turned himself in to police the next day. He had earlier posted a video online, which was later widely circulated, in which he was crying and saying he had borrowed money to pay for treatment for his three-year-old daughter, who suffered from epilepsy. The incident has been widely talked about across Chinese social media over the past week, sparking conversations about financial pressures and familial issues. The hashtag #ManFakesDeathLeadingtoWifesDeath been viewed almost 29 million times on microblogging site Weibo. Social media users have been unsympathetic towards Mr He's situation. Thousands on the popular Sina Weibo microblog have been discussing the case, with many saying they find his apology ""insincere"", writes BBC Monitoring's Kerry Allen. But others note the tragedy of the situation, with one saying that this is an instance of being ""something too unimaginable to think about"". Zhang Xinnian, a Beijing-based lawyer, says the causal relation between He's alleged fraud and Dai's suicide ""will be difficult to prove in court"", the Global Times reports.

Children 'at risk over live-streaming surge',"A surge in the use of video chats and live-streaming among children is leaving them vulnerable to abuse, the NSPCC has warned, calling for a social network regulator to be introduced. A survey of 40,000 children aged seven to 16 found a quarter had used the services. On video chats, 10% had been asked to remove their clothes. The NSPCC says groomers can record the abuse and use it to blackmail victims. The home secretary has ""demanded""tech giants take online abuse seriously. One child, ""Ben"", tried to take his own life after being blackmailed for sexual images shared between six men. It began when he was tricked into thinking he was speaking to a female friend-of-a-friend. Three weeks later, the person revealed himself to be a man, and - blackmailing him and threatening to kill his parents - coerced Ben into sending sexual images and performing sex acts live over video chat. ""This man had spent weeks pretending to be a girl and finding out information about every part of his life,"" Ben's father told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""He knew who his family were - nans, brothers, sisters. ""He knew what school Ben went to. Everything. They find out everything to use this information to manipulate you."" The images and videos sent by Ben to the man were then shared with five other men, who bombarded Ben with further demands. ""He just felt helpless and didn't know what to do,"" his father said. ""He was a different child but we didn't know why."" After two years of meeting these demands, Ben attempted to take his own life - leading the abuse to be uncovered. The main perpetrator was later jailed for four-and-a-half years. The family says the effect has been devastating. ""You don't see it coming,"" his father said. ""And when it does, your world falls apart and it's so hard to get that back to how you were - to a really close, loving [family], doing everything together. ""He won't go out, he doesn't play sport anymore. He's not the child he was."" Some 19% of primary school children surveyed had live-streamed The NSPCC survey - the first of its kind - suggests use of video chats and live-streaming among children has risen rapidly. Some 29% of secondary school children have broadcast themselves online according to the findings - almost three times a previous estimate, by Ofcom, that suggested one in 10 children aged 12 to 15 had live-streamed. The charity said the rise was likely to be down to the introduction of live-streaming capabilities on some of the biggest social media platforms. The NSPCC said it was now calling on the government to create an independent regulator to force social networks into introducing measures that make children safer. Of the children surveyed who had video-chatted with someone they had not met, one in 10 had been asked to get undressed. Some 19% of primary school children surveyed had live-streamed, with 8% of those saying that another person live-streaming was semi-naked at the time. One girl, aged 10-11, told the charity: ""My friend was doing a live-stream and an adult man was asking for her to video request him, so she did and he showed his private parts."" Another girl, aged 11-12, said while on video chat ""this man was pulling, touching, and showing his privates"". Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, said the popularity of live-streaming meant children were ""being pressured into going along with situations that make them feel uncomfortable. ""What's really disturbing is that groomers can then screenshot or record live-streamed abuse, and use it to blackmail the child or share it with others."" In September, Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned he would ""not be afraid to take action"" against tech giants if they did not help to tackle child sexual abuse online. Mr Javid said he was ""demanding"" companies take ""more measures"" - or face new legislation. He added that some sites were refusing to take online abuse seriously - and highlighted live-streaming of child abuse as a growing problem. Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News channel in the UKand on iPlayer afterwards.

'The government doesn't care about our ambitions',"These six young people are ambitious and determined. They are an aspiring teacher, a future social worker, a would-be accountant, a budding cardiologist, a wannabe pilot and a veterinary surgeon of tomorrow. But they fear their dreams, and those of young people like them, may be thwarted by further education funding pressures. They are all students at New City College in east London, which is closing the doors to its six campuses on Wednesday so staff can join a march against the cuts. The aspirations of these students are as high as the office blocks of the international banks that provide the backdrop to the Poplar campus where they are based. Rasheda is studying childcare but eventually wants to become a teacher. On hearing of the continuing cuts to further education, she says: ""It makes me feel like the government doesn't care about our education and ambitions."" The 17-year-old came to England from Bangladesh at the age of 11. She says she wants to give something back to society in return for her education. Yara, who is 18 and studying science, says: ""Young people are the future of our country. ""These are the people the government should focus on. ""One day we are going to be productive, we are going to make the country go ahead."" Nahid wants to be a social worker and Rasheda hopes to be a teacher She adds shyly: ""My ambition is to become an airline pilot. ""There are of course barriers to me achieving this ambition."" She says sometimes people laugh when she tells them. ""I say 'Why not? I dreamt it'."" But currently these young people are scrabbling for text books in the college library and struggling to cover the cost of photocopying. They can't afford to buy the books for themselves. Omaema, another scientist and aspiring vet, says she would like to be able to take her core course text book home once in a while. ""So I can study and feel more confident. At the moment we share them with our classmates and borrow books in the library."" Gerry McDonald, the group principal at the college, says although FE has never been the best-funded part of the education system, ""enough is enough"". Rabby wants to be an accountant ""We just want to be treated fairly."" He explains that schools are able to offer higher rates to pay the teachers who are in demand. ""It's a sector that operates on very thin margins. ""If you aggregated all the budgets of the 260 colleges in England they would be operating in deficit,"" he explains. Representatives from further education colleges across England are joining the march in central London to highlight the funding issues. A rally, featuring speeches from college principals and students, will fill Parliament Square. This is being followed by a lobby of MPs. The march comes after Commons Education Committee chairman Robert Halfon wrote to Chancellor Philip Hammond to highlight the stark disparity between funding for pre and post-16 education. He urged the government to ""look very carefully"" at the core level of funding for FE ahead of the Budget and Spending Review. In the letter, he said: ""It cannot be right that a funding 'dip' exists for students between the ages of 16 and 18, only to rise again in higher education."" The letter adds that ""successive governments have failed to give further education the recognition it deserves for the role it pays in our national productivity puzzle"". Apprenticeships and skills minister Anne Milton said: ""I am aware of the funding pressures in further education which is why we are conducting an assessment of education funding and the sustainability of the sector."" But Shakira Martin, NUS President, asked how students could be supported when when college ""budgets have been cut, and cut and cut again"" And ""when colleges have been forced to merge into big, impersonal institutions and when nearly a third of our staff positions have been lost since 2010."" The amount of cash spent on pupils drops significantly once they turn 16 This is despite the fact that A-levels and other post-16 qualifications are the access route to higher education and better jobs The Association of Colleges says that from 2009 to 2019, college funding has fallen by about 30% Fewer hours of teaching and support for young people A drastic reduction in the number of learning opportunities for adults The value of staff pay falling by more than 25% since 2009 College teachers earning Â£7,000 less on average than school teachers recruit and retain more specialist teachers and support staff effectively implement technical education reforms maintain academic standards support all students to develop literacy and numeracy skills It believes colleges have a vital role to play in ensuring people have the right skills to get on in life It is investing nearly Â£7bn this year to make sure there is a place for every 16 to 19-year-old in education, training, or on an apprenticeship It has protected the base level of funding for 16 to 19-year-olds until 2020 It has announced extra support for its key priorities College finances face double whammy Association of Colleges National Union of Students #LoveOurColleges Week Get Involved Department for Education New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Major disruption at Paddington station,"Trains were unable to run between London Paddington and Slough or Heathrow Airport Rail passengers are facing major disruption after a test train damaged power cables near one of London's busiest stations. Services between Paddington and Slough started running at midday, after 500m of overhead cables were ""severely"" damaged during a Hitachi train test run on Tuesday night. Trains between Paddington and Heathrow Airport have also begun to operate. However, travellers are likely to be affected all day, Network Rail said. The disruption,externalhas affected passengers as far as south-west Wales, Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance, Great Western Railway (GWR) said. Trains between Reading and Paddington have started running, but Dan Panes from GWR warned ""disruption will last for most of today [at the] very least"". See more news from London Heathrow Express services got under way at about 12:30 BST.

Cable damage was caused at about 19:30 on Tuesday as a high-speed class 802 Hitachi train was being tested between London and Bristol. Network Rail said disruption was caused by ""500m of extensive damage caused to overhead power lines in the Hanwell area"". A Hitachi spokesperson said that ""after years of successful testing on the route"" it was holding ""a full and thorough investigation"" to identify the cause of the damage. The company said the train had not yet been handed over to GWR but was due to enter service on its Devon and Cornwall route. Great Western Railway said ""disruption will last for most of today [at the] very least"" The fault comes weeks after hundreds of passengers were stranded for six hours in September whena similar train built by Hitachi for GWR broke down just north of Exeter. GWR said the incidents were unrelated. It added: ""Owing to the extent of the damage, no trains are expected to be able to operate between London Paddington and Hayes & Harlington in either direction for much of Wednesday.""

They are all students at New City College in east London, which is closing the doors to its six campuses on Wednesday so staff can join a march against the cuts. The aspirations of these students are as high as the office blocks of the international banks that provide the backdrop to the Poplar campus where they are based. Rasheda is studying childcare but eventually wants to become a teacher. On hearing of the continuing cuts to further education, she says: ""It makes me feel like the government doesn't care about our education and ambitions."" The 17-year-old came to England from Bangladesh at the age of 11. She says she wants to give something back to society in return for her education. Yara, who is 18 and studying science, says: ""Young people are the future of our country. ""These are the people the government should focus on. ""One day we are going to be productive, we are going to make the country go ahead."" Nahid wants to be a social worker and Rasheda hopes to be a teacher She adds shyly: ""My ambition is to become an airline pilot. ""There are of course barriers to me achieving this ambition."" She says sometimes people laugh when she tells them. ""I say 'Why not? I dreamt it'."" But currently these young people are scrabbling for text books in the college library and struggling to cover the cost of photocopying. They can't afford to buy the books for themselves. Omaema, another scientist and aspiring vet, says she would like to be able to take her core course text book home once in a while. ""So I can study and feel more confident. At the moment we share them with our classmates and borrow books in the library."" Gerry McDonald, the group principal at the college, says although FE has never been the best-funded part of the education system, ""enough is enough"". Rabby wants to be an accountant ""We just want to be treated fairly."" He explains that schools are able to offer higher rates to pay the teachers who are in demand. ""It's a sector that operates on very thin margins. ""If you aggregated all the budgets of the 260 colleges in England they would be operating in deficit,"" he explains. Representatives from further education colleges across England are joining the march in central London to highlight the funding issues. A rally, featuring speeches from college principals and students, will fill Parliament Square. This is being followed by a lobby of MPs. The march comes after Commons Education Committee chairman Robert Halfon wrote to Chancellor Philip Hammond to highlight the stark disparity between funding for pre and post-16 education. He urged the government to ""look very carefully"" at the core level of funding for FE ahead of the Budget and Spending Review. In the letter, he said: ""It cannot be right that a funding 'dip' exists for students between the ages of 16 and 18, only to rise again in higher education."" The letter adds that ""successive governments have failed to give further education the recognition it deserves for the role it pays in our national productivity puzzle"". Apprenticeships and skills minister Anne Milton said: ""I am aware of the funding pressures in further education which is why we are conducting an assessment of education funding and the sustainability of the sector."" But Shakira Martin, NUS President, asked how students could be supported when when college ""budgets have been cut, and cut and cut again"" And ""when colleges have been forced to merge into big, impersonal institutions and when nearly a third of our staff positions have been lost since 2010."" The amount of cash spent on pupils drops significantly once they turn 16 This is despite the fact that A-levels and other post-16 qualifications are the access route to higher education and better jobs The Association of Colleges says that from 2009 to 2019, college funding has fallen by about 30% Fewer hours of teaching and support for young people A drastic reduction in the number of learning opportunities for adults The value of staff pay falling by more than 25% since 2009 College teachers earning Â£7,000 less on average than school teachers recruit and retain more specialist teachers and support staff effectively implement technical education reforms maintain academic standards support all students to develop literacy and numeracy skills It believes colleges have a vital role to play in ensuring people have the right skills to get on in life It is investing nearly Â£7bn this year to make sure there is a place for every 16 to 19-year-old in education, training, or on an apprenticeship It has protected the base level of funding for 16 to 19-year-olds until 2020 It has announced extra support for its key priorities College finances face double whammy Association of Colleges National Union of Students #LoveOurColleges Week Get Involved Department for Education New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Gazing monkeys photo wins top prizeTwo snub-nosed monkeys sitting on a stone is the top shot at Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2018.Science & Environment,"Two snub-nosed monkeys are pictured resting on a stone and staring intently into the distance. What are they looking at, and what are they thinking? It turns out they are watching a big barney between members of their troop. This image of apparent serenity versus commotion is the overall winner of the2018 Wildlife Photographer of the Year,externalcompetition, announced at a gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum. The picture was taken by Marsel van Oosten in China's Qinling Mountains. The Dutchman had to follow the troop for many days to understand the animals' dynamics and predict their behaviour. His goal was to show in one shot the beautiful hair on a male snub-nosed monkey's back, and the creature's blue face. Marsel's perseverance eventually paid off with this exquisite composition that includes a smaller female behind. The photographer told BBC News he was ""shocked and honoured"" to receive the award. ""I am happy that it is with this particular image because it is an endangered species and one that very few people even know exists and it is important that we realise that there are a lot of species on this planet that are under threat. ""It is not only rhinos, tigers and polar bears; and these kind of species deserve a lot more attention and all the protection they can get."" The image is not showy or shocking as WPY winners sometimes are. But there is something enthralling there that pulls you in, says Roz Kidman Cox, the chair of the competition's judges. ""As we were going through the entries, we just kept coming back to this one,"" she recalls. ""It's almost like a stage set. I think what makes it are the colours and the lighting. ""These monkeys normally feed in the trees, but somehow Marsel's managed to catch them on the ground, and he's carefully thrown a very gentle flash on to the scene to illuminate that amazing fur."" The junior winner this year is Skye Meaker from South Africa for his picture of a dozy leopard in Botswana's Mashatu Game Reserve. The animal is well known and goes by the name of Mathoja, which in the Bantu language means ""the one that walks with a limp"". The leopard broke a leg as a juvenile. It survives but has to fight hard because unlike other big cats it cannot pull dead prey into the trees to eat it, says Skye. That means eating on the ground where hyenas are always trying to pinch a kill. ""We waited several hours to get this shot. I wanted Mathoja's eyes to be open, and just for a couple of minutes that's what happened. Mathoja looked straight at us."" As well as his grand title, 16-year-old Skye wins the 15-17 Years Old category. He has a big future, believes Kidman Cox: ""I've had enough of leopards on a log; it's a cliche. But Skye has something different here. I think again it's to do with the light; the dappled green in the background. And then there's the expression on the leopard's face."" Here are some other section winners: 10 Years And Under category -This shot is taken by another youngster, Arshdeep Singh. He won his section for this photo taken just outside Kapurthala, a city in the Indian state of Punjab. He says: ""I saw the owls fly in the tube and I told my dad. He said that's not possible, but he stopped the car. We had to wait 20 or 30 minutes until they came out again, and then I took the picture."" Animals In Their Environment category- Cristobal Serrano from Spain took this shot of crabeater seals resting on an ice floe off the Antarctic Peninsula. The seals have a close relationship with the sea-ice because it is the habitat that provides shelter and food (algae) for krill, tiny crustaceans. And it is the krill that are the main food source for the seals. Behaviour: Invertebrates category- Georgina Steytler took this picture of mud-dauber wasps in Walyormouring Nature Reserve in Western Australia by getting down to their level. In the mud. ""I just got down in it with a long lens, taking shot after shot. I wanted to get one of the wasps carrying a mud ball, and to get two was incredible. It's luck but you have to be in the right place at the right time with the right equipment."" The wasps use the balls to build nest chambers where they lay eggs on the paralysed bodies of spiders. Underwater category- This is a flying fish captured in the lens of American photographer Michael Patrick O'Neill. It was taken during a night dive off Florida's Palm Beach. These fish are very timid during the day but at night are easier to approach. Michael tried various camera and light settings to get this other worldly impression of the animal. Wildlife Photojournalism category- This shocking image of a street monkey was taken by Joan de la Malla on the island of Java, Indonesia.  It is a macaque that has been forced to wear a clown's mask. ""It is painful and the macaque has its hand up to try to remove it,"" says Joan. The Spanish photographer has been working with animal welfare groups to try to get this type of street performance shut down. In the last couple of weeks, this has happened; and this particular animal, known as Timbul, is heading back to the wild. Wildlife Photographer Portfolio category- Javier Aznar GonzÃ¡lez de Rueda, another Spanish photographer, entered a series of images, with this one featuring the Alchisme treehopper. The picture, taken in the El JardÃ­n de los SueÃ±os reserve in Ecuador, shows a mother guarding her nymphs. A treehopper will lay her eggs on the underside of a nightshade leaf and then cover them with a thin secretion. Once the eggs hatch, they develop through five nymphal stages, differing in size, colour and ornamentation. Behaviour, Amphibians and Reptiles category- A Hellbender salamander holds a northern water snake in its jaws in this photo taken in Tennessee's Tellico River. David Herasimtschuk says the snake eventually managed to escape after wrestling with North America's largest aquatic salamander. Earth's Environments category- The top of a high dune on Namibia's desert Skeleton Coast, where mounds of wind-sculpted sand merge with crashing Atlantic waves. Look closer and you will see the fog that often forms in this region of Africa. As the fog drifts inland it delivers life-sustaining moisture to plants and insects. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type in world photography. Started in 1964, the competition is now organised by London's Natural History Museum. An exhibition of the best images opens at the South Kensington institution on Friday. Next year's competition starts taking entries from Monday.

"'Teach children how to avoid dog bites'Parents and schools need expert guidance, MPs say, as they call for a review into ""dog aggression"".UK Politics","More needs be done to teach children how to stay safe around dogs and to reduce the risk of avoidable injuries. That's the view of MPs who want animal behavioural experts and charities to come up with a canine childhood education plan for schools and parents. They also want a review into causes of ""dog aggression"" and training courses for owners whose pets misbehave. Some charities want dog safety to be on the national curriculum but ministers say there are no plans to add it. The cross-party Commons Environment Committee said it was shocking that children under nine were statistically more likely than any other age group to end up in hospital after being bitten and to suffer serious, often life-changing, injuries. Despite this, schools are not required to use ""readily available"" teaching materials on dog safety, and provision around the UK is patchy. Information given to new parents did not currently include specific advice about keeping their family safe around pets. The Dangerous Dogs Act 25 years on MPs to examine Dangerous Dogs Act Dog attacks on postal workers 'appalling' This needed to change, the committee said, urging ministers to support an expert study into the most effective education measures and to make sure they were implemented consistently. At the same time, it said there needed to be a greater emphasis on responsible ownership through campaigns highlighting good and bad behaviour. The committee said the evidence showed ""human factors played a prominent role prior to the majority of dog attacks and any systematic attempt to reduce the number of incidents needs to place a greater emphasis on education"". The report cites NHS data showing the number of hospitalisations as a result of dog bites went up from 4,110 in 2005 to 7,461 in 2017. Among the committee's other recommendations are: An end to the ban on transferring animals of banned breeds to new owners where they are deemed to be safe An independent review into the reasons for dog aggression and attacks Mandatory dog awareness courses for owners involved in low to mid-level offences, similar to remedial courses for speeding drivers Dog control notices targeting anti-social behaviour at early stage A new single piece of dog control legislation giving councils and other bodies new enforcement powers The committee said there were a range of views on how best to educate reckless dog owners. It pointed out that licensing was opposed by several leading charities, including Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, as it was likely to be seen as a tax on owners. Never go near dogs they don't know and only pat or play with a dog if they have asked the owner Never leave young children unsupervised with any dog Don't let them tease their dog or play too roughly with it Don't go near or disturb a dog that is sleeping, eating, ill or injured Source:The Dogs Trust,external Neil Parish, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the much-criticised 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act was ""riddled with inconsistencies"". It was a ""death sentence"", he said, for many good-natured animals that needed a home and posed little threat to humans but faced being destroyed because of breed-specific restrictions. ""All dogs can be dangerous and we can't ban all dogs that might one day bite someone,"" he said. ""Evidence from across the world shows that the government should focus instead on encouraging responsible ownership, improving education and ensuring offenders face robust penalties.""

Son sues over mum's airing cupboard deathMary Isherwood was trapped while staying in a holiday home and not found for a week.Wales,"Mary Isherwood was a keen golfer and played ""almost on a daily basis,"" her son said The son of a woman who died while trapped in a holiday home airing cupboard is suing the resort company. Elizabeth Isherwood, known as Mary,died while staying at Plas Talgarth Country Clubnear Pennal, Gwynedd, in September 2017. Her son Craig is seeking compensation from the holiday resort owners for negligence, saying ""this should never have happened"". Macdonald Resorts said it could not comment on the ""tragedy"". Mrs Isherwood, 60, from Wolverhampton, was staying alone in the family timeshare for the final time as they had agreed to sell it. It is believed she became trapped in the airing cupboard on the night she arrived or the morning after, when she was going to the toilet. Her body was found a week later. Family 'devastated' by mum's airing cupboard death This video can not be played Craig Isherwood said his mother ""was fit and healthy and had years of a very happy life ahead of her"" The internal doorknob disintegrated and Mrs Isherwood tried to break out of the cupboard using a piece of water pipe she had snapped off, an inquest heard. She was sprayed with water and subsequently died from hypothermia. A coroner recorded a conclusion of death by misadventure. Mr Isherwood, 33, said: ""My mother died in the most terrible circumstances you could imagine. ""Tragically, she had made a hole big enough to climb through, but did not realise her way out was only blocked by a picture screwed to the other side of the wall. ""The legal action is not about the compensation, because how can you put a value on a life? It is about the fact that this should never have happened. ""I just want the company to admit that they made a mistake in not checking the door properly and make sure that this cannot happen to anyone else."" Mary Isherwood served as a police officer before moving into teaching and a career in the Post Office Mr Isherwood is being represented by law firm FBC Manby Bowdler. Associate Adam Wilson said: ""This was a quite horrific tragedy. There is no amount of money which can compensate Mr Isherwood and his two children for the loss of a much-loved mother and grandmother. ""But we believe that this was a tragedy which could and should have been avoided."" A Macdonald Resorts spokesman said: ""This was clearly a tragedy for Ms Isherwood and her family and our condolences go out to them.

"Briton in record attempt has bike stolenCharlie Condell, 18, was robbed in Australia - more than 100 days into a round-the-world ride.Australia","Charlie Condell has ridden through 17 countries so far A British teenager who is trying to become the youngest person to cycle solo around the world has had his bike stolen in Australia. Charlie Condell, 18, has already ridden through Europe and Asia since embarking on an eight-month journey in July. However he woke up in a hostel in Townsville, Queensland, on Tuesday to discover his bike was missing. Mr Condell, from Bristol, said his passport, camping gear and other cycling equipment had also been taken. He is already more than 100 days into his attempt to cycle unassisted through 21 countries around the world - an 18,000-mile (30,000km) journey. Of losing his bike, he said: ""You can never quite believe it - I thought maybe someone had moved it at first. ""But then I came to the sinking realisation that it was gone and I just had on my shirt and my board shorts and one bag."" The teenager said he had customised his bike for the ride He said he had cycled through 17 countries before arriving in Townsville, riding up to 125 miles per day and flying between continents. He estimated that at least Â£4,000 ($5,200) in equipment had been stolen, forcing a delay in his plans. Despite the setback, he said he hoped to complete his trip by March - his original goal. British man Tom Davies is believed to hold the recordfor being the youngest person to cycle around the world unassisted. He was 19 when he completed his six-month journey in 2015. ""This has been the first thing that's caused me to stop properly,"" Mr Condell told the BBC, adding that he had also lost some equipment in India. But he said locals had offered him clothes, accommodation and replacement bikes. Mr Condell during a leg in Jaipur, India ""It's not going to stop me - once I get another bike, I'll be off again,"" Mr Condell said. He added that he would remain a fan of Australia - ""although it's a bit too hot"". Mr Condell, who finished school earlier this year, had originally planned to ride only around Europe during summer. However, he was inspired to take on his world attempt after realising that he could achieve the distance. The man who wanted to clean up the world Around the globe in seven years... on a bike His next destinations are New Zealand and North America, after which he plans to fly back to Europe to complete his ride in March. Before setting off, he wrote on his website: ""There will, of course, be many challenges, ranging from the heat of Death Valley [in the US] to the humidity of India, but I hope to overcome them all and record the whole experience.""

Blind Brit climbs Europe's highest mountain,"This video can not be played Watch Jack reach the summit of Mount Elbrus A 23-year-old is thought to have become the first blind British man to reach the summit of Europe's highest mountain. Jack Garner faced winds of more than 50mph, -37C wind chill and a longer stay than usual on Mount Elbrus due to extreme weather conditions. In 2007, at the age of 11, Jack, from Scunthorpe, lost his sight over the course of a few months due to a genetic condition. It was ""traumatic"", he says, but he was a sporty boy and challenges helped him cope, so he set his sights on Elbrus - all 5,642m of it. Jack, aged 6 in this photo, lost his sight when he was 11 Jack got involved seriously in mountaineering in 2015. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro over a six-day trip. Then in 2016 he took part in an 11-day Everest base camp trek. Eventually, in 2018, he decided to take on Mount Elbrus. ""My parents were concerned when I told them what I was going to do,"" he said. Elbrus is known to be a particularly technical and challenging climb, but Jack has always been a thrill seeker - completing sky dives and bungee jumps to raise money for charity - so he was undaunted. He reached the summit with four other climbers and two guides from the company Adventure Peaks. In total, he spent eight exhausting days on the mountain. ""It was my first time walking on snow and ice. It took a bit of getting used to,"" he said. He learned the basics from guide Paul Etheridge - how to use crampons as well as an ice axe. Jack said he formed close friendships with his other team members He needed to follow Paul very closely up the mountain and they found a method which worked for them. Paul held the rope taut at all times so Jack knew there was always the same distance of two metres between them. ""Paul coiled the rope around his hand,"" Jack said. ""I had to be careful not to walk too close to him because I didn't want my crampons to dig into his heels."" Jack said when they got to a high altitude he found it difficult to communicate with Paul. Even though they were walking a lot slower, he felt his heart rate increase and, as a result, he was more breathless. How did he feel when he reached the summit? ""It's the best feeling there is."" 'I'm no victim' - Strictly star's girlfriend Under-25s 'turning their backs on booze' WATCH: The Russian village home to Novichok suspect Stu Peacock, from Adventure Peaks, told the BBC: ""We think he is the first blind British person to successfully reach the summit. ""It's a fantastic achievement, in challenging conditions, at this colder time of year. ""As one of the strongest members of the team, Jack is certainly capable of going on to bigger climbs if he chooses to."" Straddling the Russia-Georgia border and bulging above the Caucasus Ridge, Elbrus is a daunting prospect. It is nearly 1,000m higher than any of the peaks around it, and glaciers chew at its edges. There is a chairlift to 3,800m, where most climbs begin. However, Jack started his climb at 2,000m. A short distance above the chairlift is Camp 11; from here it is usually aneight-hour push to the summit. Jack completed the climb in less than six hours. Paul describes him as an ""understated young man who doesn't give himself enough credit"". Jack and Paul reach the summit of Europe's highest mountain Paul said he had contacted Guinness World Records who confirmed there was currently no record of a blind British climber ascending Elbrus, so Jack looks to be the first. He and his group were the first summiteers that day, beating Russian and Korean teams. ""Jack and I summited at 10:05,"" said Paul, ""before any other parties on the mountain. ""This was an amazing feat by any person, but Jack is fully blind. ""Since the age of 11 Jack endured and fought against all odds.""

Netflix adds more subscribers than expected,"Emma Stone stars in the Netflix drama Maniac Netflix added seven million new customers in the three months to September, bringing its global total to more than 137 million. The stronger than expected growth - a record for the third quarter - sent shares up 11% in after-hours trading. The surge came as Netflix premiered a record amount of original programming, including new seasons of Orange Is The New Black and BoJack Horseman. Netflix is among the first of the major US tech firms to report its results. Investors were looking for signs of a rebound at the company after anunusually weak second quarter, which had fanned worries about the online streaming firm's future. Netflix faces increased competition from traditional media companies and giants such as Amazon and its costs have been growing as it spends more on its own material. How Netflix went from pioneer to powerhouse Sky brings Netflix on board The firm plans to spend as much as $8bn on content this year, with more than a quarter devoted to original programming. Analysts estimate that it added about 676 hours of original programming in the US in the most recent quarter - 135% more than in the same period last year. Netflix's The Crown received 13 Emmy nominations this year Netflix said the investments were critical to the firm's growth. ""We recognise we are making huge cash investments in content, and we want to assure our investors that we have the same high confidence in the underlying economics as our cash investments in the past,"" it said in a letter to investors. Subscriber growth is key to keeping up with the investments. Netflix had expected to add about five million members in the quarter. The actual total included about one million new subscribers in the US and almost 5.9 million abroad. Revenue in the quarter increased 34% year-on-year to nearly $4bn, while profits more than tripled to $403m. Shares have surged more than two-thirds this year and closed on Tuesday at $346.40 in New York, valuing the company at almost $154bn. George Salmon, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, called it a ""strong set of results"". ""Heavy investment in content means free cash flow is still negative, but after a disappointing second quarter this release was all about subscriber growth,"" he said.

"US plans trade deals with Japan, UK, EU","The US has said it intends to negotiate three separate trade agreements with Japan, the UK and the EU. It could take several months before the negotiations begin, it said. The move is part of US President Donald Trump's efforts to reshape trade policies to support his ""America First"" agenda. It comes as the US has been fighting a trade war with China, the world's second largest economy. ""We will continue to expand U.S. trade and investment by negotiating trade agreements with Japan, the EU and the United Kingdom,""US trade representative Robert Lighthizer said.,external ""We are committed to concluding these negotiations with timely and substantive results for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses."" 'America First' tariffs: What will Trump's policy do? US and Canada agree new trade deal 'Dangerous undercurrents' in global economy The US plans to start negotiations with Japan, the world's third largest economy, ""as soon as practicable, but no earlier than 90 days from the date of this notice,"" Mr Lighthizer wrote in a letter to Congress. Negotiations with the United Kingdom will start ""as soon as it is ready"" after it leaves the European Union in March 2019, he said. The aim is ""to address both tariff and non-tariff barriers"" and to achieve free, fair and reciprocal trade"" Mr Lighthizer said. Mr Trump's preference for bilateral deals over multilateral ones is part of a more protectionist trade policy he has carried out since taking office in 2016. He pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal early in his administration and hasrenegotiated a trade deal between the US, Canada and Mexico. Mr Trump's trade war with China continues to escalate,with companies already feeling the pinchandexperts warning it will harm global growth. US-China trade war: What has happened so far? How China is fighting back in the trade war The UK, which is seeking to broaden its trading partners as it heads towards Brexit, welcomed the news. ""The UK welcomes the US Administration's confirmation that it intends to begin negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with the UK once we have left the EU,"" a government spokesperson said. While the UK is not able to negotiate trade agreements until it formally leaves the EU, a US-UK working group launched in 2017 has been preparing the ground for a potential future trade agreement.

Novel set in Troubles wins Man Booker Prize,"This video can not be played The moment Anna Burns wins the Man Booker prize Anna Burns has been named the winner of this year's Man Booker Prize - becoming the first author from Northern Ireland to triumph. Milkman, set in an unnamed city in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, is a coming-of-age story about a young girl's affair with a married man. Burns, who told the BBC she was ""stunned"" to win, will receive Â£50,000 in prize money. The judges said Milkman was ""simply marvellous"". They highlighted the ""distinctive and consistently realised voice of the funny, resilient, astute, plain-spoken, first-person protagonist"". Speaking onRadio 4's Today programmeon Wednesday, Burns said the Â£50,000 prize would be life-changing. ""I'll pay my debts,"" she said. ""It will make a huge monetary difference and I will become solvent and live on what's left. ""Writers don't earn a lot of money so that's a huge gift that's been given to me,"" she went on. Milkman beat competition from Everything Under by Daisy Johnson - who, at 27, was the youngest nominee in Man Booker history. The other nominees were The Long Take by Robin Robertson, Washington Black by Esi Edugyan, The Mars Room by Rachel Kushner, and The Overstory by Richard Powers. The Duchess of Cornwall presented Burns with the trophy Milkman is the fourth novel to be written by Burns, who was born in Belfast in 1962. Her debut, No Bones, was published in 2001, and followed by Little Constructions six years later. Her most recent work prior to Milkman was Mostly Hero - a novella published in 2014. Speaking to BBC News, Kwame Anthony Appiah, the chairman of the judges, said: ""One of the wonderful things about [Milkman] is the texture of the language. ""It's written in this amazing voice of this woman who is living in a divided society. ""She's being harassed by a man who is sexually interested in her, and he's taking advantage of divisions in the society to use the power he has, because of those divisions, to go after her."" Man Booker 2018: The nominees in full Burns opted not to give names to her characters in the novel. Wven her narrator refers to herself as ""Middle Sister"". Speaking after her win, Burns told BBC News: ""The book just didn't work with names. ""There's a lack of safety of being straightforward in the book and declaring who you are. But really, if I put in names it lost power, it lost atmosphere."" Asked how her real-life experience informed her writing, Burns said: ""I was brought up in Belfast and that did have a huge influence on the book, writing about an entire society affected by long-term violence, living under intense pressure, and how that becomes normality."" The nominees were made up of three British authors, two Americans and one Canadian Writing in the Guardian,external, Claire Kilroy said: ""The narrator of Milkman disrupts the status quo not through being political, heroic or violently opposed, but because she is original, funny, disarmingly oblique and unique: different. ""The same can be said of this book."" In his five-star review in the Daily Telegraph,external, Cal Revely-Calder described the novel as ""viciously funny"". ""The pace of Milkman is leisurely at best, because its narrator experiences the plot as an entirely unwelcome event,"" he added. The New Statesman's Catherine Taylor,externalsaid every character in the novel ""crackles with intellectual verve and droll verbosity"". ""While Milkman is a work of timely universality, it is also a distinctly Irish novel. A darkly mirthful satire with a twist of Beckettian melancholy and an anarchic touch of Swift."" ""The novel is an unusual and beguiling piece of prose,""wrote Alison Garden in The Irish Times,external. ""Burns's novel also makes a searing commentary on the conservative political climate of 2018 and the domestic debris that decades of conflict have left in their wake."" Kwame Anthony Appiah praised ""the texture of the language"" in Milkman Kwame Anthony Appiah added that Milkman's lead character was ""an extremely interesting voice"". He said: ""She's witty, and the way you hear her voice in your head - I think you've never heard a voice like it before, it's completely new."" Asked whether he accepts Milkman is a challenging read, Appiah replied it was ""enormously rewarding"" provided readers persist with it. ""It is true that because of the flow of the language and the length of the sentences and the fact that some of the language is unfamiliar, that it is not a light read. ""It's challenging in the way a walk up Snowdon is challenging - it's definitely worth it because the view is terrific when you get to the top.""

Cuts 'hit older teens hardest',"Sixth forms and colleges prepare teenagers for crucial exams but they are often the focus of cuts, says the IFS Older teenagers have been the biggest losers as spending on sixth forms and further education has been ""continually squeezed"" for 25 years, says a report. Spending on 16 to 18-year-olds has faced cuts too often while education spending overall has risen, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. However, government plans mean schools as a whole face ""real-terms cuts for the first time in 20 years"", it adds. Ministers say they will protect further education until 2019-20 in cash terms. According to the IFS, the last 30 years as a whole have seen increased spending per pupil for most age groups, and particularly for nursery age children. But spending on 16 to 18 education has been ""a notable exception"". The authors warn that spending cuts in the pipeline for the coming years ""present a challenge to continuing to provide high-quality education at every stage"", but spending on further education will fall the most. The report says government plans will mean that: In schools - per pupil spending will fall 6.5% by 2019-20 on 2015-16 levels In further education - per pupil spending will fall 13% by 2019-20 on 2010-11 levels Early years spending will increase by 38% in real-terms by 2020 - though the amount per pupil will still be only about half that in primary schools. ""There is a strong case for the increased spending on early years education,"" said report author Luke Sibieta, an IFS associate director. ""The rationale for focusing cuts on 16 to 18-year-olds and in further education is much less obvious. ""The actions, as opposed to the rhetoric, of both Labour and Conservative governments suggest that they are agreed this is a low priority area for spending. ""Why they think that is unclear."" The report highlights how back in 1990 spending per pupil in further education colleges was 45% higher than in secondary schools. But by 2019-20 it will be 10% lower. Colleges also provide vocational training for young people hoping for technical careers This is because spending in further education and sixth forms has grown more slowly than school spending during periods of expansion and has been less well protected from recent cuts, say the authors. For schools, the challenge will be coping with the real-terms funding cuts at the same time as substantial reforms to the way funding is allocated under the government's planned National Funding Formula, they add. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said the continued failure to protect the 16 to 18 budget was ""not acceptable"" and urged the government to review how money was divided between age groups. ""The biggest losers, of course, are 16 to 18-year-olds who miss out on the breadth, depth and support that they deserve as they make the daunting journey from childhood into adulthood. ""Colleges are on the front line of this under-investment and yet are critical to delivering the solutions. With the likely skills gaps created by Brexit we simply cannot afford to have this part of education underfunded,"" said Mr Hughes. A Department for Education spokesman said it was ""transforming"" post-16 education and investing Â£7bn to ensure there was a place in education or training for every 16 to 19-year-old who wanted one. ""As a result we have the lowest proportion of young people not in education, employment or training since consistent records began in 1994."" Most schools face cuts, say unions Schools face cuts of Â£3bn, says watchdog Further education 'funding crisis' fear Per pupil spending 'to fall by 8%' Institute For Fiscal Studies - IFS Association of Colleges Department for Education - GOV.UK Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Trump threatens Honduras aid over migrants,"Some estimates say there could be as many as 3,000 in the group President Donald Trump has threatened to cut financial aid to Honduras over a large group of migrants heading towards the US border. In a Tweet posted on Tuesday, Mr Trump said the country's president was told funds would be cut ""immediately"" if the group was not stopped and returned. Honduras has a long history of poverty and corruption. It also has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The group of at least 1,500 migrants grew rapidly in size over the weekend. Mr Trump later also warned Honduras's neighbours, Guatemala and El Salvador, that their governments could face their funds being cut if they allowed the migrants to pass through their countries on their way north. About 160 people originally set off on Friday from San Pedro Sula, a notorious Honduran crime hotspot. They pushed across the border into Guatemala on Monday, despite a heavy police presence and government order attempting to block their route. Allow Twitter content?

Shortly after Mr Trump's tweet, it was reported that Bartolo Fuentes, one of the caravan's organisers and a former Honduran legislator, had been detained by Guatemalan authorities to be deported back to Honduras. This is the second time Mr Trump has threatened Honduras's aid over migrants, in April saying it was ""in play"" over another group. The US sent more than $175m (Â£130m) to the country in 2016 and 2017,,externalaccording to the US Agency for International Development. Officials in Mexico and the US have been monitoring the migrants, who have formed what is known as ""a caravan"", over the past few days, and issuing warnings about their rights to enter their countries. Last week, Vice President Mike Pence urged Central American countries to do more to prevent mass migration. The group was held at the border by Guatemalan police on Monday for several hours ""Tell your people: don't put your families at risk by taking the dangerous journey north to attempt to enter the United States illegally,"" Mr Pence said. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Honduras foreign ministry urged its citizens against joining the caravan, dismissing it as a political ploy to "" to disrupt the governability, stability and peace of our countries"". Honduras, which has a population of about nine million, has endemic problems with gang violence, drug wars and corruption. According to the World Bank,more than 60% of the population lives in poverty,external, with one in five people living in extreme poverty. The country is led byPresident Juan Orlando Hernandez - who was re-elected in November 2017 in a contested votewhich led to election violence and protests. Jari Dixon, a Honduran politician, Tweeted on Monday (in Spanish),externalthat the caravan was not ""seeking the American dream"" but ""fleeing the Honduras nightmare"". Honduras country profile Honduras migrants lose US protected status Keilin Umana, a pregnant 21 year old in the caravan, told the Associated Press that she had left Honduras because she and her unborn child had been threatened with death at home. This video can not be played ""Why I joined Central America's brutal MS-13 gang"" Another woman, 24-year-old Andrea Fernandez, who is travelling with three children under seven, told Reuters she could not find work and feared for her family's safety. ""We're going to drop in on Donald Trump. He has to take us in,"" she told the news agency. Earlier this year it was announced thatthousands of migrants from Honduras are to lose their temporary protected status within the US by 2020. What is temporary protected status? The group has told the media they are hoping to seek refuge in Mexico or the US. Mexico's migration institute said in a statement on Monday that march participants would have to qualify under immigration rules individually in order to pass through the country. ""The law does not provide for any permission to enter the country without meeting the requirements, and then go on to a third country,"" the government agency said. But the governor of Chiapas state, in southern Mexico, said he would ""respect human rights"".Governor Manuel Velasco tweeted [in Spanish] that seven hostels were being prepared to receive the migrants,externaland help those in need of medical attention and assistance. US officials are also monitoring the group. On Sunday the US embassy in Honduras said it was ""seriously concerned"" about the caravan travelling north with ""false promises of entering the US"". Another large migrant caravan travelling through Mexico earlier this year largely broke up before it could reach the border.. There is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they say they fear violence in their home countries. Mr Trump'sAttorney-General Jeff Sessions says the ""credible fear"" asylum rule has been exploited in the past, and announced in June that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence would no longer generally qualify under it. In recent weeks, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have been accused of deliberately restricting access to ports of entry along the border. This video can not be played Long watch: Eleven years old and locked up The ""Turn-back Policy"" is currently subject to a lawsuit from the Southern Poverty Law Center,external, which accuses immigration officials of unlawfully delaying access to the asylum process. US migration: the bigger picture explained Inside the chaotic effort to reunite families The president has been vocal about wanting to reduce migration on the country's southern border, and has overseen a range of ""zero-tolerance"" measures tightening rules since he took office. Changes to the way detention rules were implemented saw thousands of migrant children detained and separated from their parents earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation. Mr Trump backed down and signed an order that ended the separation policy in June, but hundreds of children are reported to be still separated from their families.

End of prince's honeymoon?,"Has it really been less than 18 months since Air Force One touched down in Riyadh to a red carpet welcome? When President Trump chose Saudi Arabia for his first overseas presidential visit in May last year most Saudis were delighted. They hadn't much cared for his predecessor, Barack Obama. He was never that interested in the Middle East, they reckoned, and his legacy nuclear deal with Iran was a bad one in their eyes. But Donald Trump was a man they could do business with. He lifted the Obama-era curbs on weapons sales for the war in Yemen, he refrained from lecturing them on human rights and he seemed happy for his son-in-law Jared Kushner to forge an exceptionally close working relationship with Saudi Arabia's all powerful Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Saudi Arabia country profile Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince A return visit by MBS as he is known, to the White House, the Pentagon and Hollywood ensued. MBS was similarly welcomed in London, despite anti-war protests that his prosecution of the conflict in Yemen was fuelling a humanitarian tragedy there. Journalist Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance has brought criticism of the Saudi Crown Prince (L) At home in Saudi Arabia, Western diplomats hailed MBS's modernising reforms as the long overdue breath of fresh air the country needed. He lifted the ban on women driving, reintroduced public entertainment and curbed the power of the unpopular religious police. What we know about Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists Trump suggests 'rogue killers' to blame At the same time he announced staggeringly ambitious plans to wean the country off its dependence on oil income by building a $500 billion futuristic city in the desert. Saudi Arabia under MBS was going places and this time last year the world beat a path to his door, flocking to attend his inaugural Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. Happier times. A cameraman takes a break during the inaugural presidential visit by Donald Trump A lot has changed. The warning signs that MBS may not be quite the liberal reformer the West had hoped for came when he arbitrarily locked up dozens of princes and business figures last year in a luxury hotel, accusing them of corruption. He briefly detained Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri, allegedly forcing him to resign. He also ordered the arrest of anyone who dared to question his reform agenda, even with just a simple tweet. But it was the deeply suspicious disappearance inside the Saudi consulate on 2 October of his most prominent critic, Jamal Khashoggi, that has caused even his close ally Donald Trump to talk of ""severe punishment"" if Saudi government guilt is proven. We can retaliate in kind, came the Saudi response on Sunday, reminding the world of their decisive role in the oil market. This video can not be played President Trump said he had discussed the disappearance of the journalist with the Saudi king Encouraged by the state-controlled media, many Saudis have rallied round their leadership. There is even a popular rumour that what happened in Istanbul is all a plot by Qatar and Turkey to discredit the blameless Saudi kingdom. But privately, others are now questioning whether the 33-year old prince, the man once hailed as a visionary saviour of Saudi Arabia, has gone too far. He has pitched his country into a costly and seemingly unwinnable war in Yemen. He is embroiled in a damaging dispute with neighbouring Qatar, he has quarrelled with Canada over human rights and he has locked up dozens for peaceful protest while alienating many in royal and business circles. More conservative Saudis may well be hankering for quieter times. Saudi Crown Prince: Five things to know.

More firms pull out of conference,"HSBC's John Flint (left), Diane Greene of Google (centre) and Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse are among those to withdraw from next week's event The chief executives of three big banks have become the latest bosses to pull out of a conference in Saudi Arabia. HSBC's John Flint, Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse and Bill Winters of Standard Chartered will not be going. Diane Greene, who runs Google's cloud division, Mastercard's Ajay Banga and JP Morgan'sJamie Dimonhave also all pulled out of the event in Riyadh. It follows tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia over the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance. A critic of the government, Mr Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, vanished on 2 October after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Authorities there believe he was killed in the building by Saudi agents, an accusation that the Saudi authorities have dismissed as ""lies"". Pressure grows on Saudis over writer Jamal Khashoggi: What we know so far Who is Jamal Khashoggi? HSBC and Credit Suisse were two of the event's eight strategic partners. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, Ford chairman Bill Ford and Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi are among others who will now not be attending the Future Investment Initiative event in Riyadh. Britain and the US are also considering boycotting the event,while others distancing themselves includeSir Richard Branson, who has halted talks over a $1bn (Â£756m) Saudi investment in Virgin space firms. An introduction to the conference on its official website says it ""will immerse thousands of delegates from all over the world in a rich agenda"". The event is in its second year and more than 150 speakers from some 140 organisations were due to attend, but at least 15 have so far withdrawn. A page with a list of confirmed speakers has been deleted from the website for the conference, which runs from 23 to 25 October. George Atta, global smart city leader at Ernst Young; Siemens chief executive Joe Kaesar; Mohmood Khan, vice-chairman of PepsiCo; and US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin are among delegates still planning to attend.

Should students' ethnicity matter?,"Harvard is at the centre of competing visions of what is meant by ""fair"" admissions Harvard University this year turned down more than 95% of those who applied. But what is a ""fair"" system for deciding who should be rejected and who should be the lucky few to get a place? What should the successful 5% look like? Should it just be those with the highest academic credentials? Or would it be fairer to ensure a more diverse ethnic and social mix? The admissions policy of the flagship US university is facing a legal challenge, which began this week in Boston, with accusations of racial bias against Asian-Americans. And it's a dispute that will be watched carefully by many other over-subscribed universities around the world. In the UK, top universities such as Oxford have been criticised for recruiting too few ethnic minority students. But the legal challenge against Harvard shows how this argument can become more complex - because a majority of students in this autumn's intake are from ethnic minorities. The accusation is that Harvard is limiting places for Asian-Americans to allow entry for other minorities About 52% of new undergraduates are from ethnic minorities, with the biggest number being Asian Americans: 15% black 12% Hispanic 2% Native American or Native Hawaiian 23% Asian American But the complainants say if entry was decided on grades alone, the proportion of Asian-American students would be even higher - and the admissions system makes it easier for black, Hispanic and white students to get a place. The court case has been seen as reflecting a wider push-back against ""affirmative action"" Asian-Americans are about 6% of the US population, so they are the most over-represented ethnic group in Harvard. But the complainants say there is an informal system of ""racial balancing"" to cap any further increase in their numbers. They claim that more subjective parts of the entry process, such as assessing an applicant's personality, are used to mark down Asian-Americans. Under the banner of Students for Fair Admissions, they are calling for race to be removed as a factor in admissions, saying that the ethnicity of applicants should not ""either help or harm"" chances of entry. Harvard strongly denies any accusation of unfairness. It says that race is ""one factor among many"" and the proportion of places gained by Asian-American students has risen by more than a quarter since 2010. The university has defended the impartiality of what it calls a ""race conscious"" system, as it sifts through 42,000 applications to make about 2,000 offers. An undergraduate, Sally Chen, expected to give testimony, will argue that universities need to take race into account to understand someone's experiences - and it's a policy that helps ""open the door to all students of colour"". But the case raises bigger questions of what is fair in ultra-competitive university admissions. Elite universities are not only about academic high achievement. Seen as a launch pad for careers in business, politics or the professions, they have become gatekeepers for social advancement. This has put pressure on them to be at the same time both academically exclusive and socially inclusive. As a result, many university entry systems look at a range of social factors, as well as academic ability. In the UK, this is often known rather evasively as ""contextual admissions"". In the US, the most controversial aspect of admissions has often been ethnicity. Since the civil rights movement in the 1960s, there have been calls for ""affirmative action"", supporting wider university access for ethnic minority students. Harvard has always defended its right to consider race as part of an all-round view of candidates. But this latest claim is not about the type of historical attempts by minorities to stake a claim in white dominated institutions. Instead, it is a minority group claiming that some applicants are unfairly losing out on places because of the efforts to maintain diversity among other minorities. This courtroom battle is being seen as part of a wider cultural struggle about race and identity in the US. While other universities - and some Asian-American campaigners - are lining up to support Harvard, their opponents are protesting with banners supporting President Trump. All sides will be watching to see if the legal and political ground is moving. Harvard argues that it has seen off repeated legal challenges to its admissions policy over the decades and that the right to consider an applicant's race has been upheld in successive rulings. This court case, heard without a jury, is widely expected to have its findings challenged at appeal. If it comes before the Supreme Court, the balance has shifted and Brett Kavanaugh's appointment could have a further significance for another divisive issue.

No optimism for Brexit deal - EU's Tusk,"Donald Tusk has poured cold water on hopes of a Brexit breakthrough at Wednesday's EU summit, saying the Irish border was still a sticking point. The European Council president said he had ""no grounds for optimism"" it would be solved at the summit. And he called on Theresa May to come up with ""concrete proposals"" to break the ""impasse"". The prime minister told her cabinet a deal was within reach if the government ""stand together and stand firm"". Asked if she would be coming forward with ""concrete proposals"" at the summit, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister set out her position yesterday (Monday). She looks forward to a face-to-face discussion with him tomorrow. ""There are many areas where we have made progress. More progress is needed on the backstop."" Katya Adler: Berlin's view of the Brexit breakdown DUP threat over Brexit backstop deal Q&A: The Irish border backstop Your guide to Brexit jargon The ""backstop"" is a fall back plan for avoiding a hard border in Ireland if the two sides can't strike a trade deal in time - but they can't agree on how long it should last and what form it should take. No new proposals are expected to be tabled or discussed this week and discussions are likely to continue at official level only. Mrs May had already put forward a ""workable solution"", Downing Street said. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Mr Tusk said: ""As I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides. ""However, for a breakthrough to take place besides goodwill we need new facts. ""Tomorrow (Wednesday), I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse."" This video can not be played Theresa May's Brexit update statement: ""The terms of our exit are now clear."" He urged Mrs May to present ""something creative enough"" to break the deadlock. He said EU leaders would discuss how to step up preparations for a ""no-deal scenario"", but stressed that did not mean they were not also making ""every effort to reach the best agreement possible for all sides"". Both sides in Brexit talks were hoping that a deal on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, including the Irish border question, would be agreed by mid-November in time for it to be ratified by EU members and for MPs at Westminster to vote on it. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? The UK and the EU had hoped that enough progress would be made at Wednesday's EU council meeting to call a special summit in November to finalise the terms of the UK's exit. Asked if the November summit would still go ahead, Mr Tusk said: ""It's for the leaders to decide whether we need an extraordinary summit in November or not. ""Logistically, we are ready, but we need the feeling that we are close to a real breakthrough. The clock is ticking."" Downing Street said Mrs May has told cabinet ministers not to be ""downhearted"" if the European Council does not set a date for a November summit, amid growing expectation in government that any final agreement may be pushed back to December. The prime minister told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning she could not agree to any deal with the EU which created a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - or one which locked the UK into a customs union with the EU indefinitely. She says this would be the consequence of the proposals currently on the table from the EU. The cabinet had discussed a ""mechanism"" that would avoid an indefinite customs union if a full trade deal cannot be agreed by the end of the 21-month transition period that is due to kick in after the UK leaves on 29 March - the so-called ""backstop"" plan. But it was ""not a decision-making cabinet"", Downing Street said. However, the EU is considering a proposal for a UK-wide temporary customs arrangement, Mrs May's spokesman added.

The prime minister told ministers progress had been made in Brexit talks on the ""future framework"" for trade and although there would be challenging moments ahead a deal with Brussels was within reach, Downing Street said. ""I am convinced that if we as a government stand together and stand firm we will achieve this,"" she said. Mrs May used Tuesday's cabinet to rally support for her position among senior ministers, amid reports eight of them had met on Monday to discuss their concerns about it. Downing Street said none of the eight - Dominic Raab, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, Chris Grayling, Liz Truss, Andrea Leadsom and Geoffrey Cox - had threatened to quit at Tuesday's cabinet meeting and it was clear that she had strong support. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who is travelling to Luxembourg to brief EU leaders ahead of Wednesday's summit, said he hoped a deal with Britain was possible ""in the coming weeks"". ""We are still not there. ""There are still several issues which remain unresolved, including that of Ireland, and therefore what I understand is that more time is required to find this comprehensive deal and to reach this decisive progress which we need in order to finalise these negotiations on the orderly exit of the United Kingdom.""

'Expectations low' as PM heads to Brussels,"""Intensive"" work is needed to overcome differences on the Irish border and reach a Brexit deal, Theresa May says. Speaking in Brussels, where she hopes to convince her counterparts to back her plan, the UK prime minister said ""considerable progress"" had been made in recent weeks. She has held meetings with key figures before addressing leaders ahead of their dinner this evening. A senior EU official suggested Mrs May had offered ""nothing new"" of substance. ""There was a message of goodwill and readiness to reach an agreement, but I didn't perceive anything substantially new in terms of content,"" said Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Commons Brexit vote must be 'unequivocal' Ahead of the summit, Labour said the government was ""too weak and too divided"" to reach a deal. Earlier Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit at Prime Minister's Questions, with the PM rejecting the Labour leader's claim that her planned long-term relationship with the EU, known as the Chequers plan, was ""dead"". This plan for Brexit was agreed by the Cabinet at the prime ministerâs country residence, Chequers, in July 2018. It proposes tax or tariff-free trade with the EU, while leaving the UK free to pursue trade deals outside the EU. Under the plan, the UK would collect tariffs on the EUâs behalf for any goods entering the country but destined to be sent on to EU countries. Because EU tariffs had been collected, there would not need to be a separate border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But the UK would have to follow EU rules, âthe common rule bookâ, on things like food standards to avoid unnecessary border hold-ups. The plan also proposes ending the free movement of people, giving back the UK control over immigration rules. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson both resigned their posts over the Chequers plan because they believe it means the UK would still be too closely tied to the EU. Both sides say they want to reach a deal, but preparations are taking place for what happens if they cannot agree by the time the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. In a new publication, the French government says,externalBritons wanting to visit France, following a no-deal Brexit, could need a visa if they want to stay for three months or more. And those who were already living there could be treated as being in France illegally unless they have the necessary residence permits. A-Z of Brexit: The sequel Brexit: All you need to know It also said checks would need to be established on goods and people going to and from the UK as well as veterinary checks on animals and animal products. While the draft bill sets out the actions the government could take, it is not yet clear what the measures will be and the publication states any rules for expats could easily be adapted. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was still time to reach a ""good and sustainable Brexit deal"" but that her government was also preparing for no deal in areas like citizens' rights and customs. This video can not be played PMQs: Corbyn and May on post-Brexit Chequers trade deal In the negotiations, she added, there should be a ""significant difference between a membership of the EU and a partnership with the EU as a third country"". Wednesday's European Council meeting was meant to be the occasion when the remaining 27 EU member states gave the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU. Both sides want to get an agreement in place within the next few weeks to avoid the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March. But chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to say talks have failed to make the ""decisive progress"" the EU wanted to see before agreeing to a special summit. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said: ""I think what's more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there won't be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on. ""And I think that's sensible. What we don't want to do is create drama around the build-up to a new summit date and not actually have something to sign off on."" There is also speculation some EU leaders will suggest using a November summit for a no-deal planning session instead. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The worst-case scenario for Downing Street is that EU leaders are so fed up with the UK position and what they see as the lack of reality, that on Thursday, they formally say they will hold a no-deal summit in November. That would switch them on to a track that would be hard to get off once in motion. One EU source expressed disbelief that Theresa May thought she could turn up on Wednesday with nothing new. It was simply crazy, in their view, to suggest that the ball can be lobbed back into the EU court. The best case - and it seems right now unlikely - scenario is for the EU to say that there is a deal in reach, so let's get a date in the diary for the sign-off next month. What seems more likely is a holding position. EU leaders could give some kinds of vague noises that both sides still want to pursue negotiations, so that the talks can get going again. One Brussels source said that while it is ""time for choices"", they could give the prime minister space and time to build a majority at home for a deal. Read Laura's full blog Mrs May will address her fellow leaders on Wednesday evening before their dinner - before that she will hold one-on-one talks with European Council President Donald Tusk as well as Mr Juncker and Irish premiere Leo Varadkar. But she will leave before the meal where the EU leaders decide what to do next. Mr Tusk, president of the European Council, said on Tuesday he saw ""no grounds for optimism"" that the two sides could bridge their differences on the Irish border, but appealed for ""goodwill and determination"" to try and bring an agreement nearer. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the border between the UK and the EU when the UK leaves the EU. Both sides want to avoid that border having checkpoints or other physical infrastructure to carry out checks on goods, but they can't agree how that should be done. They are discussing a ""backstop"" - a position of last resort, to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. The EU's suggestion would see Northern Ireland remaining in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system, but Mrs May says that would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. She suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020. The EU also says any backstop plan should not have an end date - something Mrs May has previously insisted on, leading to the possibility of a ""backstop to the backstop"". The UK and EU negotiators have, separately, discussed extending the 21-month transition period by up to a year, to improve the chances of getting a full trade deal and reduce the chance of needing an Irish border backstop. Extending the transition period has never been ruled out by the UK government, but it is unlikely to be acceptable to Conservative Brexiteers. Downing Street has said they are not calling for an extension. Theresa May was greeted by EU Commission leader Jean-Claude Juncker when she arrived in Brussels On the eve of Wednesday's summit, former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major attacked Brexiteers, saying ""those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for."" ""They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer. That will never be forgotten - nor forgiven."" Sir John is among a host of former senior politicians, including Tony Blair, and ex-deputy prime ministers Lord Heseltine and Nick Clegg, stepping up calls for another referendum. They have written a series of articles in European newspapers backing a so-called People's Vote, with the option to remain in the EU. Sir John's remarks were met with barbed responses from Jacob Rees-Mogg and other Conservative Brexiteers who said he had compromised the UK's sovereignty by signing up to the Maastricht treaty in the early 1990s without consulting the people.

Elsewhere, while some of Mrs May's MPs have urged her not to pay any money to the EU unless a deal is struck, Chancellor Philip Hammond - who backed Remain - is understood to have told the cabinet the UK could face a big bill at the end of any transition period even if no deal is reached.

Woman jailed for 'frenzied' murder bid,"Lisa Savage and Sarah Hayton were aboard the Gloucester to Cardiff train when the attack happened on April 15 A ""dangerous"" woman serving a life sentence has been jailed again for trying to kill her friend on a train. Lisa Savage, 42, was on probation when she attacked Sarah Hayton, shouting ""go to sleep little girl"" and leaving her needing 87 stitches. On her arrest in a park in Chepstow, Savage told police: ""I'm a psycho killer"". She will serve a minimum of eight years and four months after admitting attempted murder and having a blade. Judge Eleri Rees said Savage poses ""a high risk of harm to the public"" and the attack was ""frenzied and sustained"". Savage planned to confront her mother in Aberdare with two knives Savage had 13 previous convictions for 67 offences, including 15 of violence, Newport Crown Court heard. In 2000, she was handed a life sentence and jailed for a minimum of three years for slashing an ex-partner across his face and mouth. She had been released from prison on licence for that offence when she attacked Miss Hayton on April 15. Savage, who was carrying two knives, planned to confront her mother in Aberdare, south Wales, after receiving a text saying she wanted nothing to do with her. Prosecutor Anna Midgley said: ""Miss Hayton explains that the attack... began when she said she no longer wanted to go to Aberdare to confront the defendant's mother. ""The defendant's reaction was to begin raging and to take out a knife which she had packed and to stab Miss Hayton repeatedly."" Lisa Savage's victim 'believed she was going to die' CCTV footage showed Savage repeatedly stabbing Miss Hayton, before prising open the train door to escape. Train passengers in the carriage were ""extremely frightened"", staff had locked themselves in the cabin for safety and the victim ""believed she was going to die"", said Miss Midgley. A train guard spotted Miss Hayton crawling and covered in blood at Chepstow station and alerted police, who later found Savage in a park. Det Ch Insp Jaci Thomas from British Transport Police said: ""This was a shocking and vicious attack, and I am pleased we have been able to bring Lisa Savage to justice.""

Should universities consider ethnicity in admissions?,"Harvard is at the centre of competing visions of what is meant by ""fair"" admissions Harvard University this year turned down more than 95% of those who applied. But what is a ""fair"" system for deciding who should be rejected and who should be the lucky few to get a place? What should the successful 5% look like? Should it just be those with the highest academic credentials? Or would it be fairer to ensure a more diverse ethnic and social mix? The admissions policy of the flagship US university is facing a legal challenge, which began this week in Boston, with accusations of racial bias against Asian-Americans. And it's a dispute that will be watched carefully by many other over-subscribed universities around the world. In the UK, top universities such as Oxford have been criticised for recruiting too few ethnic minority students. But the legal challenge against Harvard shows how this argument can become more complex - because a majority of students in this autumn's intake are from ethnic minorities. The accusation is that Harvard is limiting places for Asian-Americans to allow entry for other minorities About 52% of new undergraduates are from ethnic minorities, with the biggest number being Asian Americans: 15% black 12% Hispanic 2% Native American or Native Hawaiian 23% Asian American But the complainants say if entry was decided on grades alone, the proportion of Asian-American students would be even higher - and the admissions system makes it easier for black, Hispanic and white students to get a place. The court case has been seen as reflecting a wider push-back against ""affirmative action"" Asian-Americans are about 6% of the US population, so they are the most over-represented ethnic group in Harvard.

Under the banner of Students for Fair Admissions, they are calling for race to be removed as a factor in admissions, saying that the ethnicity of applicants should not ""either help or harm"" chances of entry. Harvard strongly denies any accusation of unfairness. It says that race is ""one factor among many"" and the proportion of places gained by Asian-American students has risen by more than a quarter since 2010. The university has defended the impartiality of what it calls a ""race conscious"" system, as it sifts through 42,000 applications to make about 2,000 offers.

"Trump threatens Honduras aid over migrantsA group of at least 1,500 migrants is currently in Guatemala, heading north toward the US border.US & Canada","Some estimates say there could be as many as 3,000 in the group President Donald Trump has threatened to cut financial aid to Honduras over a large group of migrants heading towards the US border. In a Tweet posted on Tuesday, Mr Trump said the country's president was told funds would be cut ""immediately"" if the group was not stopped and returned. Honduras has a long history of poverty and corruption. It also has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The group of at least 1,500 migrants grew rapidly in size over the weekend. Mr Trump later also warned Honduras's neighbours, Guatemala and El Salvador, that their governments could face their funds being cut if they allowed the migrants to pass through their countries on their way north. About 160 people originally set off on Friday from San Pedro Sula, a notorious Honduran crime hotspot. They pushed across the border into Guatemala on Monday, despite a heavy police presence and government order attempting to block their route. Allow Twitter content?

Shortly after Mr Trump's tweet, it was reported that Bartolo Fuentes, one of the caravan's organisers and a former Honduran legislator, had been detained by Guatemalan authorities to be deported back to Honduras. This is the second time Mr Trump has threatened Honduras's aid over migrants, in April saying it was ""in play"" over another group. The US sent more than $175m (Â£130m) to the country in 2016 and 2017,,externalaccording to the US Agency for International Development. Officials in Mexico and the US have been monitoring the migrants, who have formed what is known as ""a caravan"", over the past few days, and issuing warnings about their rights to enter their countries. Last week, Vice President Mike Pence urged Central American countries to do more to prevent mass migration. The group was held at the border by Guatemalan police on Monday for several hours ""Tell your people: don't put your families at risk by taking the dangerous journey north to attempt to enter the United States illegally,"" Mr Pence said. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Honduras foreign ministry urged its citizens against joining the caravan, dismissing it as a political ploy to "" to disrupt the governability, stability and peace of our countries"". Honduras, which has a population of about nine million, has endemic problems with gang violence, drug wars and corruption. According to the World Bank,more than 60% of the population lives in poverty,external, with one in five people living in extreme poverty. The country is led byPresident Juan Orlando Hernandez - who was re-elected in November 2017 in a contested votewhich led to election violence and protests. Jari Dixon, a Honduran politician, Tweeted on Monday (in Spanish),externalthat the caravan was not ""seeking the American dream"" but ""fleeing the Honduras nightmare"". Honduras country profile Honduras migrants lose US protected status Keilin Umana, a pregnant 21 year old in the caravan, told the Associated Press that she had left Honduras because she and her unborn child had been threatened with death at home. This video can not be played ""Why I joined Central America's brutal MS-13 gang"" Another woman, 24-year-old Andrea Fernandez, who is travelling with three children under seven, told Reuters she could not find work and feared for her family's safety. ""We're going to drop in on Donald Trump. He has to take us in,"" she told the news agency. Earlier this year it was announced thatthousands of migrants from Honduras are to lose their temporary protected status within the US by 2020. What is temporary protected status? The group has told the media they are hoping to seek refuge in Mexico or the US. Mexico's migration institute said in a statement on Monday that march participants would have to qualify under immigration rules individually in order to pass through the country. ""The law does not provide for any permission to enter the country without meeting the requirements, and then go on to a third country,"" the government agency said. But the governor of Chiapas state, in southern Mexico, said he would ""respect human rights"".Governor Manuel Velasco tweeted [in Spanish] that seven hostels were being prepared to receive the migrants,externaland help those in need of medical attention and assistance. US officials are also monitoring the group. On Sunday the US embassy in Honduras said it was ""seriously concerned"" about the caravan travelling north with ""false promises of entering the US"". Another large migrant caravan travelling through Mexico earlier this year largely broke up before it could reach the border.. There is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they say they fear violence in their home countries. Mr Trump'sAttorney-General Jeff Sessions says the ""credible fear"" asylum rule has been exploited in the past, and announced in June that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence would no longer generally qualify under it. In recent weeks, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have been accused of deliberately restricting access to ports of entry along the border. This video can not be played Long watch: Eleven years old and locked up The ""Turn-back Policy"" is currently subject to a lawsuit from the Southern Poverty Law Center,external, which accuses immigration officials of unlawfully delaying access to the asylum process. US migration: the bigger picture explained Inside the chaotic effort to reunite families The president has been vocal about wanting to reduce migration on the country's southern border, and has overseen a range of ""zero-tolerance"" measures tightening rules since he took office. Changes to the way detention rules were implemented saw thousands of migrant children detained and separated from their parents earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation. Mr Trump backed down and signed an order that ended the separation policy in June, but hundreds of children are reported to be still separated from their families.

Governor C L Otter said he requested Mr Fischer's resignation as he failed ""to exercise good judgment"". The governor said in a press release: ""I have high expectations and standards for every appointee in state government. Every member of my administration is expected to exercise good judgment. Commissioner Fischer did not."" Warning: Some viewers may find the images below upsetting. In September, Mr Fischer emailed his colleagues various photos of himself posing with his kills in Namibia. This hunting trip was reportedly legal. Hunter criticised for dead giraffe pose How the internet descended on the man who killed Cecil the lion 'I hunt wild animals because I love them' Among the images were photos of Mr Fischer smiling above a family of dead baboons, a giraffe, an antelope and a leopard. Mr Fischer reportedly sent this image to co-workers while bragging about his hunting exploits Local media report that Mr Fischer bragged about his hunts in the email, saying his wife wanted to get ""a feel"" of Africa, ""so I shot a whole family of baboons. I think she got the idea real quick"". With the photo of the leopard, he reportedly wrote: ""I shot a leopard. Super cool, super lucky."" After the email made the rounds, several former fish-and-game commissioners began calling for Mr Fischer to resign. According to the Idaho Statesman,external, which broke the story, ex-commissioner Fred Trevey said in an email to Mr Fischer: ""I'm sure what you did was legal, however, legal does not make it right."" ""Sportsmanlike behaviour is the centre pin to maintaining hunting as a socially acceptable activity,"" Mr Trevey said, adding that Mr Fischer's actions dismayed and disappointed him. Another ex-commissioner told the newspaper that killing a whole family of animals was ""revolting"". In his resignation letter, sent to the governor's office, Mr Fischer apologised to his fellow hunters and anglers. Mr Fischer reportedly said of this image: ""I shot a leopard. Super cool, super lucky."" ""I recently made some poor judgments that resulted in sharing photos of a hunt which did not display an appropriate level of sportsmanship and respect for the animals I harvested,"" he wrote,CBS News reported,external. ""While these actions were out of character for me, I fully accept responsibility."" Fish-and-game officials are appointed by the governor and are unpaid positions. Mr Fischer would have been in the role until June 2022. The governor's office said the process of finding his replacement has begun. The uproar around Mr Fischer's photos is the latest backlash against US trophy hunters.
