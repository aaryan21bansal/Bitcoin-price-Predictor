Taliban members and local residents were among the victims of the attack, province spokesman Attaullah Khogyani told the BBC, adding that 54 people were wounded. What's life like under the Taliban? Militants 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' Who are the Taliban? The Islamic State group, which is active in the area, said it carried out the attack. In a TV address Mr Ghani said the government was ready for ""comprehensive negotiations"" with the Taliban. ""All those issues and demands that have been put forth we are ready to discuss them at the peace talks,"" he said.

The unprecedented development has raised hopes of permanent peace in the war ravaged country.

However Islamabad accuses Kabul of harbouring Islamist insurgents who have carried out several violent attacks inside Pakistan in the past.

The Taliban announced the three-day halt to hostilities earlier this month, days after a unilateral ceasefire lasting until Wednesday was ordered by the government. It is the Taliban's first ceasefire since the government they ran was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion. A militant hugs a member of the Afghan police in Kunduz ""It was the most peaceful Eid.

Taxi ploughs into pedestrians in Moscow,"The car came to a halt after hitting a lamppost At least eight pedestrians, including some Mexican World Cup fans, were injured after a taxi mounted a crowded pavement in central Moscow. CCTV footage posted on social media showed the car veer out of a queue of stationary traffic and accelerate into pedestrians before coming to a halt. The driver then fled, pursued by several passers-by. Moscow police said the driver was a 28-year-old national of Kyrgyzstan who had been taken into custody. They released a video of the man being questioned in which he says he had been at the wheel for more than 20 hours when the crash happened and had pressed the accelerator by mistake. ""I wanted to brake, I wanted to let someone through,"" he says, while visibly upset. ""I switched off for a second and hit the accelerator.... then I saw the people."" He said he fled because he thought the crowd of people ""were going to kill"" him. But one witness, who was across the road at the time of the crash, said it did not appear to be accidental. ""I have the feeling that he did it deliberately because he was in the traffic jam with the cars going really slowly,"" said Viktoria Geranovich, ""How could he lose control of the wheel, push the gas and drive into the crowds?"" She said ""mostly girls"" were knocked down, but people rushed to help and the ambulance arrived quickly. ""Thank god everything went well. It's scary that this happened in the very centre."" An unidentified official said of the injured: ""Seven of them are in a satisfactory condition and one woman is in a moderate condition."" The incident happened not far from the Kremlin and Red Square, an area packed with tourists. Russia is currently hosting the World Cup, and promised ""unprecedented"" security measuresin all cities hosting the games.

Ronaldo's superhuman match in pictures,"Ronaldo's hat-trick against Spain has been hailed as one of the all-time great World Cup performances. Here, in pictures, is how the Portuguese star's game unfolded. Shortly after kick off he was brought down as he ran into the penalty area, winning a penalty... ... which he fired into the right-hand side of the goal, giving Portugal the lead. During a display of supreme efficiency, the 33-year-old chose when to get involved and when to conserve his strength for the vital moments to come. Later in the first half he defeats Spanish goalkeeper David De Gea again with a shot that squeezes under his body. A sliding celebration follows before he is mobbed by teammates. The match was billed as a clash between two titans usually seen playing on the same side for Real Madrid. But there was no animosity between Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos, with the latter on one occasion helping him to his feet. In the 88th minute a free kick to Portugal. Ronaldo curls it around and over the defensive wall and into the top corner for the equaliser... ... before roaring out his emotion... ... and again giving his trademark celebration, sweeping his hands down and out to the sides. After the final whistle there is delight as he embraces Spain goalkeeper De Gea, whom he had beaten three times. Giants of the global game hailed a superhuman performance. Legendary former Italian captain Franco Baresi was speechless. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sturgeon: Art school fire 'heartbreaking',"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows scale of the Glasgow School of Art fire Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has described the fire which gutted Glasgow's world-renowned School of Art as ""heartbreaking"". Flames ripped through the celebrated Mackintosh building after it caught fire at about 23:20 on Friday. The blaze spread to nearby buildings, including the Campus nightclub and O2 ABC music venue, but no-one was reported injured. Firefighters said it was ""too early"" to comment on the cause. 'I assumed the art school fire was a social media blip', by Pauline McLean BBC Scotland arts correspondent Ms Sturgeon said: ""The fire has been a devastating blaze, much worse than the one that took hold of the Mackintosh building four years ago. ""The damage is severe and extensive. My heart goes out to everybody associated with the art school."" The art school building was under reconstruction from the first fire in 2014 The art school and a neighbouring building were devastated in the fire The Mackintosh library, which was recognised as being one of the finest examples of art nouveau in the world, was destroyed inthe blaze that ripped through the building in May 2014. The A-listed building, considered to be Charles Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece, was being restored in a project estimated to cost up to Â£35m and was due to reopen next year. The story of the fire and its aftermath Scotland reacts to Glasgow art school fire The world's love of Glasgow School of Art Shock at Glasgow art school fire In Pictures: Glasgow School of Art fire  The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Peter Heath said the fire damage was ""exceptionally significant"". He said it was likely that all the restoration work carried out since the last fire had been destroyed. That work was being carried out byKier Construction which had been awarded the multi-million poundrestoration contract. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Glasgow fire is heartbreaking A statement from the company said that while the investigation about the fire was ongoing it would be ""inappropriate to comment further"". It added: ""Kier has been working with the Glasgow School of Art since 2016 on the restoration of the Mackintosh building and so we share the devastation felt by the School and the wider public at this time."" This video can not be played City in shock after art school ravaged by fire during multi-million pound restoration. The Glasgow School of Art fire - the second major blaze at the internationally-renowned building in the past four years - has created headlines around the world. For the people of Glasgow, it has come as a great, sad shock. I first arrived on the scene on Saturday morning and walked along Sauchiehall Street, an area of the city synonymous with a good night out. Pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, music venues, and the scene of yet another devastating blaze. The words I heard as I walked around the police cordon time and time again were ""so sad"". Sad that the School of Art has been gutted again. Sad that one of Glasgow's gems, from my amateur eye, looks like it may never recover. Read more of Graham's account from the scene. Area manager David Young said about 50 firefighters were continuing to extinguish a few pockets of fire but it was a ""very difficult job"". But he would not speculate on where or how the fire started. Mr Young said: ""Colleagues who were at the fire four years ago said it was less devastating than it is now. ""Damage is from one end of the building to the other. The roof is damaged and the floors. The building is in a poor state."" Mr Young said the fire was well-developed when firefighters arrived late on Friday evening. Crews were brought in from as far away as Perth and West Lothian to tackle the blaze, but forensic experts have not yet been able to access the building because it is not safe. After seeing the fire-damaged building for herself, Nicola Sturgeon described it as ""just a shell"". But she said the Scottish government stood ""ready to provide any support"" in the wake of the blaze. At the height of the fire, hoses ran down to the River Clyde which provided a key source of water Firefighters had to deal with fresh plumes of smoke during the afternoon A statement from the school of art described the fire as ""devastating"". It added: ""The Glasgow School of Art's immediate focus is on our students, and on the continuing operation of the GSA to ensure minimum disruption to students and staff. ""The GSA and all of its buildings will remain closed for the next week, and we will provide updates as and when information is available."" How Glasgow earned its reputation as the 'Tinderbox City' Timeline: The art school's devastating years Fire crews have been concentrating efforts on all four sides of the buildings, from Dalhousie Street to Sauchiehall Street and into Renfrew Street. Nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution. There are not thought to have been any injuries. At its height, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene. Firefighters used water from the River Clyde to tackle the blaze,resulting in a number of road closures in the area. Insp Catherine McNally, of Police Scotland, praised the response of both the public and nearby licensed premises which were asked to evacuate. Ben, an eyewitness, told the BBC the latest fire looked ""much worse"" than the previous one. ""This is a blaze, the building is just going up like a tinderbox. It's quite shocking,"" he said. How do you recreate a masterpiece like the Mackintosh Library? Mackintosh and the rooms that inspired Europe Art school restoration brought to life Connor Neil, 22, said people were being evacuated from their homes and there was a ""big orange light"" which could be seen from streets away. The building was undergoing restoration works after the previous fire in 2014 One Twitter user posted a video of the O2's roof appearing to collapse as firefighters sprayed water onto the building from an aerial platform.

Large crowds gathered and looked on as firefighters tackled the blaze Comedian Billy Connolly was among the crowd of onlookers in the area earlier on Saturday. And Travis singer Fran Healy tweeted: ""I cannot believe @GSofA is on fire again. So so sad."" The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer. It has been described as ""a working art school as well as a work of art"", and has an A-list rating from Historic Scotland. In recent years, the school has produced many of the UK's leading contemporary artists such as Douglas Gordon, Alison Watt, David Shrigley, and three recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009 and Martin Boyce in 2011. Other former students include actors Robbie Coltrane and Peter Capaldi, and artist Peter Howson. Thefire in 2014, caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam, destroyed the building's library, which was recognised as being one of the finest examples of art nouveau in the world. The fire ripped through the newly-restored building on Friday night The fire could be seen throughout Glasgow city centre Stuart Robertson, the director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, said the second fire was ""unbelievable"". ""It is like deja vu from four years ago,"" he said. ""Last weekend was a joyous occasion, we were celebrating Mackintosh's 150th birthday and the rebirth of the Willow Tea Rooms in Sauchiehall Street, the Hill House in Helensburgh is about to have major restoration and we were looking forward to the reopening of this building after four years since the last fire."" Mr Robertson said he had been in the building a few weeks ago to look at how the restoration was progressing. He said the famous ""hen-run"" had been restored, work on the library was well under way and the studios ""looked amazing"". ""This is like a nightmare,"" he said. ""I can't put into words how heartbroken I feel."" Prime Minister Teresa May tweeted: ""I'm saddened to hear of the fire overnight in the iconic Mackintosh building. ""We stand ready to support the Scottish government in restoration efforts."" Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney described the building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, as ""the most architecturally important building in Glasgow"". The Labour politician said the restoration effort had suffered a ""horrific setback"" which he hoped would be overcome. ""We cannot lose this building,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

NHS gets Â£20bn 'birthday present',"This video can not be played Mrs May said the extra funding amounted to billions of pounds a year extra for the NHS The NHS in England is to get an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023 as a 70th ""birthday present"", Theresa May says. It means the Â£114bn budget will rise by an average of 3.4% annually - but that is still less than the 3.7% average rise the NHS has had since 1948. The prime minister said this would be funded partly by a ""Brexit dividend"", but also hinted at tax rises. Labour said the government had failed to fund the NHS properly and was relying on a ""hypothetical"" windfall. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour's taxation plans meant his party could match the Conservatives' spending plans and ""will go further"". In her BBC interview, Mrs May did not spell out how the Â£20bn a year would be funded but said: ""As a country we will be contributing more, a bit more, but also we will have that sum of money that is available from the European Union."" But Commons Health and Social Care Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston described the idea of a Brexit dividend as ""tosh"". The Conservative MP accused the government of using ""populist arguments rather than evidence"". And the director of economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS),Paul Johnson, has tweeted to say ""there is no Brexit dividend"",external. NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The five-year funding settlement covers just front-line budgets overseen by NHS England. About a 10th of the overall health budget is held by other bodies for things such as training and healthy lifestyle programmes, including stop smoking services and obesity prevention programmes. The BBC understands these will be protected, but beyond that it is unclear what will happen to them. The 2015 spending review - the last time a five-year settlement was announced - saw these budgets cut to help pay for an Â£8bn increase in NHS England's budget. 2019-20 - 3.6% 2020 - 21 - 3.6% 2021-22 - 3.1% 2022-23 - 3.1% 2023-24 - 3.4% All figures are above inflation The announcement means extra money will also be made available for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mrs May acknowledged that pressure had been growing on the NHS, which was founded 70 years ago, and said her formal announcement on Monday would be about ""securing its future"". ""We're going to ensure there's a 10-year plan for the NHS,"" she said. ""That will be a plan for world-class health care - more doctors, more nurses. It means extra money - significantly more money going into the NHS."" This video can not be played Ashworth: Labour will 'go further' on NHS spending than the Conservatives Mr Ashworth told the BBC's Sunday Politics that Labour's tax plans meant it would be able to spend more but added the exact percentage of how much it could increase spending by would have to wait until the chancellor presented his own spending plans. And shadow chancellor John McDonnell dismissed the government announcement as a ""publicity stunt"", adding: ""Can you imagine if I came forward with this? There'd be accusations of magic money trees. This is a magic money forest that's come out this morning."" Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said the government's settlement was the ""minimum"" that was needed. ""After almost a decade of austerity, the NHS has a lot of catching up to do."" By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent Step back from the big figures and the arguments about Brexit and there is something significant in Theresa May's announcement. A Conservative prime minister promising more money for public services, with the implication that taxes could go up to pay for it. Because when Mrs May talks about ""contributing more as a country"" that is what she means. You'll struggle to find a politician arguing against a boost for the NHS, but there might just be one or two Tories privately questioning whether this portrays them as a tax-and-spend party. Support for the NHS is such a big political prize that Mrs May appears willing to go against traditional Conservative low-tax instincts. The government clearly feels the detail on funding is for another day. There will be difficult decisions ahead - but the prime minister appears to be saying ""trust me"". Mr Hopson also pointed out that the government needed to work out what it was going to do about social care run by councils. Ministers have promised the system, covering care homes and help at home, will be reformed soon to ensure there is better access to services. And Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents healthcare organisations, said the announcement ""isn't a bonanza by any means"" and that it fell short of the of the 4% extra-a-year figure an independent report had suggested was needed. However, he added: ""It's a lot better than we've been used to over the last few years."" And Ian Dalton, head of regulator NHS Improvement, said the settlement was good news for the NHS and would ""enable the dedicated staff in our NHS to go on improving the care we can offer the patients"". In her BBC interview, Mrs May said the funding boost was partly coming from a ""Brexit dividend"". ""Some people may remember seeing a figure on the side of a bus a while back of Â£350m a week in cash,"" she said. The PM references the controversial Â£350m a week claim seen on a bus used during the EU referendum campaign ""I can tell you that what I'm announcing will mean that in 2023-24 there will be about Â£600m a week, more in cash, going into the NHS. ""That will be through the Brexit dividend. The fact that we're no longer sending vast amounts of money every year to the EU once we leave the EU."" But she also conceded that ""as a country"" we will need to contribute more. She did not spell out that would require tax rises, although a recent report by the IFS said they would be needed because it was hard to imagine the money could be found from economic growth or raiding other areas of government spending. And Mr Johnson said the government had accepted Brexit would weaken the public finances and the financial settlement with the EU plus commitments to replace EU funding ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years. Does the Brexit dividend actually exist? There has been a lot of speculation that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt - supported by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens - had been pushing for close to 4% a year extra. This was the figure many in the health service had said was needed to get services back on track and to improve waiting times. Reports have suggested the Treasury were initially offering less than 3%. So the 3.4% average appears to be a compromise between the two camps - and is close to the 3.7% average increase the NHS has seen if you look back over the past 70 years. So what will this mean? The final picture is somewhat clouded by the lack of clarity about what will happen to the wider health budget. However, talk to those working for the health service and they say this was the ""bare minimum"" that was needed to keep services going. They say tough choices will still be needed and that the public should not expect a dramatic increase in performance - targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations are all being missed.

10 charts showing why NHS is in trouble,"This month hospitals have reported huge pressures, with A&Es over-crowded, a lack of beds and queues of ambulances stacked up outside unable to hand over their patients. It was a similar story last winter. The NHS, it seems, is always facing unrelenting pressure. But why is this when funding is rising? The sheer scale of the health service can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world. So it should come as no surprise that this vast enterprise absorbs eye-watering amounts of money. Last year in excess of Â£140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every Â£1 spent on services goes on health. Even during years of deep austerity in the UK, extra money has been found for the health service - Â£8bn more this parliament in England alone. Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams. The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack. Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital. Which local services are under threat? Upfront charges for foreign patients When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving, 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours. But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year. The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering below the 90% mark in recent weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more. But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two. The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much. As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at Â£20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this. Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending. Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse. But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give. Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was considerably higher. As you can see the period between 2010 and 2015 saw the tightest financial settlement. The following two years were a little more generous, but that average is likely to drop a little over the rest of the parliament under current spending plans. So ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got. Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population. But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders. But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC last year is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up. Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do. But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts. Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all. There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare. The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s. But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community. The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult. The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by over 40% in 13 years. Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition. There are attempts to change this by placing more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less. But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state. However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years for which we have data, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at Â£70 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. Ministers in England have promised the system will change. New plans are due to be published by the summer of 2018. But, as yet, no part of the UK has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done? Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils?  Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other? Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention? But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do.

"'It's a great, sad shock'","The Glasgow School of Art fire - the second major blaze at the internationally-renowned building in the past four years - has created headlines around the world. For the people of Glasgow, it has come as a great, sad shock. I first arrived on the scene on Saturday morning and walked along Sauchiehall Street, an area of the city synonymous with a good night out. Pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, music venues, and the scene of yet another devastating blaze. The words I heard as I walked around the police cordon time and time again were ""so sad"". Sad that the School of Art has been gutted again. Sad that one of Glasgow's gems, from my amateur eye, looks like it may never recover. People stopped in the streets, standing in the heavy rain, and looked at the building as smoke still billowed into the street filling the air with an acrid taste. Stephen Burke is masters painting student at the School of Art Stephen Burke, a masters painting student at the School of Art who is originally from Dublin, was one of those looking on. ""When I first came to Glasgow, you could almost see that people from the GSA had post traumatic stress from the previous fire,"" he said. ""To see something like this only four or five years later is really tragic. ""The amount of money, time, work that has went into the renovation - and for this to happen - is madness."" Another Glasgow School of Art student Catherine McCartney stood under a tree to shelter from the rain. She stared at the smouldering building in front of her with sadness etched all over her face. Catherine was at School of Art when it caught fire four years ago. She graduated from the GSA yesterday from her architecture course, and was celebrating with friends in the nearby CCA when she first heard about last night's blaze. ""All the restoration work was fantastic, and it has all gone again,"" she said. ""It's really, really sad. My friends and I were in complete disbelief."" As the day went on, the media assembled at Douglas Street at its junction with Bath Street, with the smoke of the fire billowing into the air in the background providing good pictures for TV cameramen and photographers. Many camera phones were out, as people Tweeted, Facebooked and Instagrammed the scene. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the fire service, and Glasgow City council leader Susan Aitken were among those to speak. The efforts of the emergency services were praised, and the fact there were no casualties was highlighted. Members of the public also stopped here to take in another sad day for the city. Tony Waterston, from Bishopbriggs, was one of them. ""To see it happen to such an important landmark in the city is just really shocking,"" he said. ""It is part of the culture of Glasgow. There is a lot of good Glasgow culture, this is one that will be lost now."" Civil servant Pip Bolam moved to Glasgow when the first Glasgow School of Art fire happened. She recently visited the Kelvingrove Art Gallery to see the exhibition on Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the man behind the School of Art design. This month marks the 150th anniversary of his birth. ""To see it all happen again is tragic,"" she said. ""They had made so much progress to get it back to how it was. ""You would think it would never happen again. I would love it for it to be able to recover. It is very, very sad for Glasgow."" Of course, the School of Art was not the only building affected. The future of the O2 ABC, a very popular venue in the city, and the Campus pub and club are also in question. Meanwhile, the nearby Pavilion Theatre is still recovering from a major fire at the neighbouring Victoria's nightclub in March. Glasgow -dubbed the Tinderbox city decades agofor the regularity of serious blazes - is once again counting the cost. Questions remain. How did it happen?

'I assumed the art school fire was a social media blip', by Pauline McLean BBC Scotland arts correspondent Ms Sturgeon said: ""The fire has been a devastating blaze, much worse than the one that took hold of the Mackintosh building four years ago. ""The damage is severe and extensive. My heart goes out to everybody associated with the art school.""

Area manager David Young said about 50 firefighters were continuing to extinguish a few pockets of fire but it was a ""very difficult job"". But he would not speculate on where or how the fire started. Mr Young said: ""Colleagues who were at the fire four years ago said it was less devastating than it is now. ""Damage is from one end of the building to the other. The roof is damaged and the floors. The building is in a poor state."" Mr Young said the fire was well-developed when firefighters arrived late on Friday evening. Crews were brought in from as far away as Perth and West Lothian to tackle the blaze, but forensic experts have not yet been able to access the building because it is not safe. After seeing the fire-damaged building for herself, Nicola Sturgeon described it as ""just a shell"". But she said the Scottish government stood ""ready to provide any support"" in the wake of the blaze. At the height of the fire, hoses ran down to the River Clyde which provided a key source of water Firefighters had to deal with fresh plumes of smoke during the afternoon A statement from the school of art described the fire as ""devastating"". It added: ""The Glasgow School of Art's immediate focus is on our students, and on the continuing operation of the GSA to ensure minimum disruption to students and staff. ""The GSA and all of its buildings will remain closed for the next week, and we will provide updates as and when information is available."" How Glasgow earned its reputation as the 'Tinderbox City' Timeline: The art school's devastating years Fire crews have been concentrating efforts on all four sides of the buildings, from Dalhousie Street to Sauchiehall Street and into Renfrew Street. Nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution. There are not thought to have been any injuries. At its height, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene. Firefighters used water from the River Clyde to tackle the blaze,resulting in a number of road closures in the area. Insp Catherine McNally, of Police Scotland, praised the response of both the public and nearby licensed premises which were asked to evacuate.

Large crowds gathered and looked on as firefighters tackled the blaze Comedian Billy Connolly was among the crowd of onlookers in the area earlier on Saturday. And Travis singer Fran Healy tweeted: ""I cannot believe @GSofA is on fire again. So so sad."" The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer. It has been described as ""a working art school as well as a work of art"", and has an A-list rating from Historic Scotland. In recent years, the school has produced many of the UK's leading contemporary artists such as Douglas Gordon, Alison Watt, David Shrigley, and three recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009 and Martin Boyce in 2011. Other former students include actors Robbie Coltrane and Peter Capaldi, and artist Peter Howson. Thefire in 2014, caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam, destroyed the building's library, which was recognised as being one of the finest examples of art nouveau in the world. The fire ripped through the newly-restored building on Friday night The fire could be seen throughout Glasgow city centre Stuart Robertson, the director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, said the second fire was ""unbelievable"". ""It is like deja vu from four years ago,"" he said. ""Last weekend was a joyous occasion, we were celebrating Mackintosh's 150th birthday and the rebirth of the Willow Tea Rooms in Sauchiehall Street, the Hill House in Helensburgh is about to have major restoration and we were looking forward to the reopening of this building after four years since the last fire."" Mr Robertson said he had been in the building a few weeks ago to look at how the restoration was progressing. He said the famous ""hen-run"" had been restored, work on the library was well under way and the studios ""looked amazing"". ""This is like a nightmare,"" he said. ""I can't put into words how heartbroken I feel."" Prime Minister Teresa May tweeted: ""I'm saddened to hear of the fire overnight in the iconic Mackintosh building. ""We stand ready to support the Scottish government in restoration efforts."" Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney described the building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, as ""the most architecturally important building in Glasgow"". The Labour politician said the restoration effort had suffered a ""horrific setback"" which he hoped would be overcome. ""We cannot lose this building,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

France 'to take in some' Aquarius migrants,"The migrants rescued by the Aquarius have spent a week in rough seas, many suffering seasickness, while their fate is decided Spain says it has accepted an offer from France to take in some of the 630 migrants rescued by the Aquarius ship off Libya and turned away by Italy. The Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said the French government would work together with Spain to handle the arrival of the migrants. They are scheduled to dock in Valencia on Sunday. Madrid said that those migrants who expressed a wish to go to France would be allowed to do so. The fate of the ship caused a diplomatic row between Italy and France, with French President Emmanuel Macron accusing Italy of ""irresponsibility"" for turning it away. Italy, meanwhile, under its tough-talking new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, says it is unfair that countries on the frontline of the EU have had to carry most of the burden of handling the migrant influx.

Salvini urges end to Sicily 'refugee camp' Separately, the Spanish coast guard said it had rescued 933 migrants and found four bodies in the Mediterranean on Friday and Saturday, reported Reuters news agency. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has adopted a migrant-friendly stance since taking up his post two weeks ago. The migrants aboard the Aquarius spent 20 hours in overcrowded rubber dinghies before being rescued by the Aquarius off the Libyan coast. They have since spent a week aboard the rescue ship in rough seas - with many aboard suffering seasickness. The migrants will be met by a team of 2,300 people, primarily health workers, when the Aquarius docks on Sunday, Efe news agency reports. They will then be given a choice as to whether to go on to France if it is established that they have a claim to asylum, Efe quoted the French foreign minister as saying. This video can not be played On board the Aquarius, passengers rest in cramped conditions Migration reform is likely to be a key topic at a meeting of EU leaders later this month, as many countries continue to grapple with the political fallout caused by an influx of migrants in recent years. Italy's populist coalition- and in particular its interior minister, the right-wing League party leader Matteo Salvini - has taken a hard-line approach to immigration, resulting in the diplomatic row over the fate of the Aquarius.

Ex-France Telecom execs tried over suicides,"Didier Lombard denies his reforms led staff to take their own lives The former chief executive of France Telecom and six other managers are to stand trial over a spate of suicides among their staff in the late 2000s. Prosecutors have long claimed they presided over a culture of harassment at the firm that led at least 19 employees to kill themselves. They are accused of ""moral harassment"". Ex-boss Didier Lombard and his fellow defendants deny their tough restructuring measures in 2006 were to blame for the subsequent loss of life. The push for greater efficiency came two years after the company was privatised. Mr Lombard was trying to cut 22,000 jobs and retrain at least 10,000 workers. ""I'll get them out one way or another, through the window or through the door,"" he was quoted as telling senior managers in 2007. Some were transferred away from their families or left behind when offices were moved, or assigned demeaning jobs. From 2008 onwards, at least 19 members of staff took their own lives, 12 attempted suicide and eight others suffered from depression and related illnesses. Among the cases documented: In 2009, a woman aged 32 took her own life at work in Paris A woman tried to kill herself in the eastern city of Metz on learning that she was about to be transferred for the third time in a year A man was found dead at home, after apparently writing a letter blaming his job In 2011 a worker aged 57 tried to kill himselfas he arrived at work near Bordeaux Mr Lombard has accepted the restructuring upset employees but rejected the idea that it led to people taking their own lives. France Telecom became Orange in 2013. ""As it has always said, Orange rejects the accusations and will make its case during the public hearing which will be scheduled in the coming months,"" an Orange spokesman said in response to news of the trial. If found guilty the defendants could face two years in prison and 30,000 euros ($35,000) in fines.

Reaction to fire in iconic building,"Glaswegians are coming to terms with the fact that one of their most famous buildings has, once again, been ravaged by a fire. Glasgow MP Alison Thewliss said she was ""devastated"" adding the Glasgow School of Art was ""part of the fabric of the city"". University researcher Maria Papanatsiou, who lives round the corner from the building, spoke of her shock and sadness. Maria has lived in the area since 2013. ""I've watched as the restoration went up, and now it's come down,"" she says. She was sitting in her living room when, through her window, she saw flames coming from the art school. ""I went down to the street and was there for at least two hours,"" she said. Maria was not the only one - others had come to watch, including clubbers who had been evacuated from nearby buildings. ""Everyone was very sad,"" she says, ""One guy was even crying."" This video can not be played Tako Taal: I've never seen a fire this large before Artist Tako Taal was having a drink with friends in the school student union bar when the fire broke out. ""We saw people coming in and out saying there was a small fire,"" she said. ""You could smell smoke coming in. There were already two firemen on the scene and we were moved away really quickly. ""Everyone was confused and shocked.  I've never seen a fire this large before."" ""The firefighters were really great,"" she added. Comedian Susan Calman described the scenes as ""horrific"" In the wake of the fire, famous alumni and Glaswegians expressed their heartbreak at the fire and the damage to the Glasgow School of Art. Comedian and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Susan Calman said: ""Thinking of staff, students, alumni  and the wonderful emergency services who, as always, fought to save such a treasure. Just awful."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Artist and TV presenter Lachlan Goudie said he was ""horrified"" by the ravaging of the building describing it as ""a terrible bereavement"". ""This building was part of Glasgow's soul, a visual expression of Scottish creativity at its peak,"" he said. ""To see it devastated once was horrendous, to see it assaulted by the flames a second time is gut wrenching."" TV presenter Lachlan Goudie said the building was 'part of Glasgow's soul' Louise Rowley studied at the school and was travelling back to the city for the first time since graduating. During her time there she worked as a tour guide for the building. ""The whole building is overwhelming,"" she says. ""The hen-run is a beautiful glass room at the back of the building, uniting the east and west wings, somewhere to get inspiration. ""It's so well thought-about and so inspirational."" Ms Thewliss said she was ""absolutely devastated"" by the news describing the building as ""part of the fabric of the city."" ""It is something we hold very dear,"" she added. She said a lot of skill and talent had gone in to the restoration work. ""It's a real blow to see the damage done last night,"" she said. She also sent out a plea for any support that could be given. Mr Mundell said the UK government was ""committed to ensuring this iconic building will be restored if it can be"". He said the way Glaswegians felt about the Glasgow School of Art was equivalent to how Londoners felts about Big Ben.

Probe into Auschwitz row rappers dropped,"Kollegah and Farid Bang later visited Auschwitz Two German rappers will not be prosecuted after an outcry over lyrics about Auschwitz and the Holocaust. Critics attacked Kollegah and Farid Bang for comparing their muscular bodies with those of Auschwitz inmates, and suggesting a new Holocaust. But prosecutors said the artistic freedom was guaranteed by the constitution. The gangsta rap lyrics, while offensive, did not amount to Holocaust denial or inciting violence, they said. DÃ¼sseldorf prosecutor's office spokesman Ralf HerrenbrÃ¼ck told German media that while the genre might be vulgar, misogynistic and homophobic, it would not be possible to bring charges. The controversy surrounding the duo centres on two lines in their latest album JBG3 (Young, brutal, good looking 3). One track includes the words:""My body is more defined than those of Auschwitz inmates."" Another has the lyric: ""I'm doing another Holocaust, coming with the Molotov."" The decision by Germany's music industry (BVMI) to hand the rappers the Echo prize in the hip-hop/urban category led to immediate condemnation from artists across the country. Music prize scrapped in Auschwitz rap row The Holocaust: Who are the missing million? Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed The Holocaust year by year The response prompted the industry to scrap the Echo awards completely as a damaged brand. The Auschwitz memorial in southern Poland includes the site of the barracks, gas chambers and other buildings at the Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps, where an estimated 1.1 million people were murdered by the Nazis during the German occupation in World War Two. Most of those killed were European Jews.

Sinn FÃ©in vote to change abortion policy,"Sinn FÃ©in delegates have voted to change the party's position on abortion at a conference in Belfast. Members comprehensively backed a leadership motion stating that women should have access to abortions within ""a limited gestational period"". The party can now support a law due to be brought before the Irish parliament, which is expected to allow abortions within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. More than 20 Sinn FÃ©in branches had called for a free conscience vote. The decision comes shortly after a referendum in the Republic of Ireland removed a constitutional amendment which effectively outlawed abortion. Previously Sinn FÃ©in had backed making terminations available in circumstances like fatal foetal abnormality, rape or sexual abuse. However, the party will now back a policy put forward by the Sinn FÃ©in leadership that is broadly in line with the new Irish law, which is expected to make abortion available to women within the first 12 weeks of their pregnancies. Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill opened the debate and told delegates: ""No-one is saying members can't have a conscience and you're entitled to have your viewpoint respected, but there is a difference between personal views and our role as legislators."" However, the few speakers supportive of a conscience vote said that by not allowing members to have a free vote, SF was effectively going to create a ""cold house"" for those members who take a different view on abortion. Sinn FÃ©in voted to change party policy at a conference in Belfast Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland, meaning that it is the only region of the UK or Ireland where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health. Abortions in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormalities are not automatically legally permitted to be carried out. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning government since the collapse of power-sharing between Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP in January 2017. The issue of abortion in Northern Ireland has been debated in the House of Commons, but Downing Street says it should be dealt with by Stormont once devolution is restored. On the day of the referendum result in Dublin, Mrs O'Neill and party president Mary Lou McDonald held up a sign stating that the ""north is next"". The vote in the Republic is expected to pave the way for unrestricted access to abortion during the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy. This has been a defining conference for Sinn FÃ©in. The first conference without Gerry Adams at the helm, the focus was very much on the party's priorities under the new leadership of Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill. Both women had already openly advocated relaxing the party's policy on abortion - today their base appeared to echo that. A long queue of people lined up to speak, and of all the delegates who took to the podium to express their views, only a handful supported giving members a conscience vote. The decision to back the leadership on this issue is a significant one. Out of the five main Stormont parties (bar the DUP who are staunchly opposed to abortion), Sinn FÃ©in is now the only one that will not allow its members a conscience vote on abortion. Ending the debate, the party's MEP Martina Anderson said there was ""absolutely no space"" for a conscience clause. But will some of Sinn FÃ©in's members feel there is no longer a space for them in the party because of today's vote? Time will tell. At the conference on Saturday, the party's leadership had backed a motion stating that women should have access to abortions within a ""a limited gestational period"". The motion by the party leadership did not specify the 12-week period, but refers to making abortions available through a GP-led service ""without specific indication for a limited gestational period"". Mrs O'Neill denied that this gives the Sinn FÃ©in leadership a blank cheque to eventually back abortion in line with the 24-week period provided by the UK's 1967 Act, arguing it allowed the party flexibility in case legislation brought before the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) eventually reduces the time limit to 10 weeks. Protesters at the Sinn FÃ©in ard fheis A former Mayor of Limavady, Anne Brolly, and her husband, Francie, who was previously elected to the Stormont Assembly, both resigned from the party over the issue. Two Sinn FÃ©in TDs (members of the Irish parliament), Peadar TÃ³ibÃ­n and Carol Nolan, have been suspended in recent years for voting against party policy. With the exception of the DUP - which opposes any change to Northern Ireland's law - the other main parties, Alliance, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists all allow a freedom of conscience approach amongst its members.

Boy falls down 80ft coastal blowhole,"It is believed the 16-year-old had been celebrating the end of exams with friends A 16-year-old boy was rescued after falling down an 80ft (24m) blowhole in Cornwall. Rescuers were lowered into the hole at Trevone, near Padstow at about 01:00 BST and the boy was airlifted to hospital. Newquay Coastguard Rescue Team said it was a ""complex cliff rescue"". The teenager's injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. The rescue team said it was thought he had been celebrating the end of exams. Coastguards have described the cliff rescue as ""complex"" There have been calls in the past for safety signs and fencing near the blowholes on Cornwall's north coastafter a 56-year-old man fell over the edge of one in April. A blowhole is a vertical fault in a cliff that is widened after exposure to strong waves - creating water pressure that can escape up through the hole. The best-known blowhole at Trevone is the Round Hole, which is formed by a collapsed sea cave and can be seen on a sloping field above the east side of the beach. The Round Hole at Trevone is north Cornwall's best-known blowhole Coastguards initially thought this was the location of the emergency, but they discovered it was actually in between Harlyn and Trevone across the bay.

Arson arrests after club and church fire,"This video can not be played Bethel Community Church is a Grade-II listed building Two people have been arrested on suspicion of arson following a huge fire which gutted a 130-year-old church and a former nightclub. The Grade-II listed Bethel Community Church on Stow Hill in Newport was destroyedafter the fire spread from a derelict nightclub next door. About 95 firefighters and police officers were at the scene on Friday and crews finally put the blaze out on Saturday evening. No-one is thought to have been hurt. A 43-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman from Newport remain in custody. Gwent Police is appealing for witnesses and has asked for help in identifying people who were inside the derelict club at about 18:00 BST on Friday. It has also emerged that concerns about the state of the former nightclub, which closed in 2010, had been raised with officials days before the blaze. Newport Conservatives said they emailed the local council on 7 June calling for the former Zanzibar and Heights 2000 club to be inspected due to ""fear this could collapse or end up going up in flames."" Newport council has been asked to comment. Church members will meet to pray in Stow Hill car park at 10:30 on Sunday The local authority carried out an ""enforcement inspection"", but the local Tory group want an investigation into why the council did not carry out a ""full site inspection"" - as they claim officers did not enter the building. Newport Conservative activist Michael Enea said he emailed the council after worried residents contacted him. They came following an online video showing people walking around the derelict building, which was full of debris and loose wires. ""There were quite a few concerns about the state of the building,"" he added. ""The roof had totally collapsed and caved in, the building was totally derelict."" Allow Twitter content?

Relentless Ronaldo lights up World Cup,"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Portugal 3-3 Spain - watch all six goals in under a minute ""The night was about Cristiano. He is relentless in his pursuit of greatness. What he is doing on the world stage is ridiculous."" Match of the Day pundit Rio Ferdinand said he ""couldn't breathe"" as former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick, including an 88th-minute equaliser, as Portugaldrew 3-3 with Spainin a classic World Cup encounter. Ronaldo, as he so often does, had the last word in a match full of drama, as Spain came within minutes of securing a happy ending to a turbulent week in which they sacked their manager a day before the start of the tournament. So just how good was this Ronaldo display? Well, his was the star turn in a match that is sure to be remembered for years to come. ""I'm going to get a flight back tomorrow because I won't see a better game,"" joked former England winger Chris Waddle. Watch highlights from Sochi thriller Ronaldo rescues Portugal in classic Who beat Ronaldo to be named man of the match? It took just over three minutes for Portugal's captain to make his mark on the game in Sochi, drawing Nacho into a foul in the area and converting the penalty with trademark cool. Diego Costa equalised brilliantly but Ronaldo struck a second time, David de Gea's uncharacteristic fumble into the net a gift to the Real Madrid man. Costa scored again to make it 2-2 before Nacho made amends with a sublime strike to put Spain 3-2 up. But then came that free-kick... This video can not be played Ronaldo scores 'sensational' free-kick to complete hat-trick Standing over the ball as De Gea set his wall and with just two minutes remaining, there was no doubt it would be Ronaldo who would take the set piece. And yet history suggested a team-mate - any team-mate - might have been better placed.. This, remarkably, was Ronaldo's first goal from a direct free-kick in 45 attempts at major championships. ""One or two will ask why I said at half-time Ronaldo needs to work on free-kicks. Well it's because it took him 45 attempts, but he did it,"" said former England captain Alan Shearer. ""It's a brilliant free-kick and it is technically so difficult to do,"" added former England midfielder Danny Murphy. ""He went over and around the wall and it had all sorts of bend and dip on it."" Speaking on Russia Today, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho offered a reminder that Ronaldo's free-kick record has worsened since his days at Old Trafford and early years at Real, but added that ""this one was the critical one"". ""There are players for some matches, there are players for every match and there are players for special matches. The players for special matches are the ones,"" the Portuguese added. This video can not be played World Cup Catch-Up: Ronaldo the showman lights up biggest stage Lionel Messi is another ofthoseones. Ronaldo's pursuit of greatness has been inextricably linked with that of the Argentina forward, whostarts his campaign against Iceland on Saturday. ""A little sub-plot to it is now the pressure is mounted on Messi's shoulders after watching Cristiano here,"" said Ferdinand. ""He'll deliver,"" came the reply from Cesc Fabregas on Match of the Day. Fabregas, of course, played with Messi at Barcelona between 2011 and 2014. Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin said Ronaldo would have ""hated"" the discussions before the tournament about whether this will be Messi's World Cup. ""Cristiano has raised the bar so Iceland could be in trouble,"" he added. This was Ronaldo's 51st hat-trick for club and country, a ""personal best"" according to the man himself. It comprised his 82nd, 83rd and 84th international goals, putting him joint-second on the all-time list alongside Hungary legend Ferenc Puskas, now trailing only Iran's Ali Daei on 109. Will he surpass that mark? Or is it a case of when? Ronaldo also became the first man in history to score in eight consecutive major tournaments with his early penalty against Spain. Where will that streak end? ""Cristiano is the best in the world and I hope in Qatar once again he is going to score in a World Cup,"" said Portugal coach Fernando Santos, feeling his side's 33-year-old talisman can extend his international career until 2022. Despite the brilliance of his performance, Ronaldo was quick to try to make his team the focus at the full-time whistle. ""The most important thing is to highlight what the team has done,"" said Ronaldo. ""The game was about to end and we managed to equalise so we are happy. ""We are not the favourites so we will try to do our best. The team is doing very well and we are going to do well for sure."" Portugal's next Group B game is against Morocco on Wednesday at 13:00 BST, while Spain face Iran at 19:00, no doubt happy to see the back of Ronaldo, for now at least. ""When you are playing a player like Ronaldo these things can happen,"" said Spain coach Fernando Hierro. ""It is extremely fortunate for whichever team has him, but I certainly would not change him for any of the players in my squad."" Ronaldo's hat-trick is likely to become one of the most memorable World Cup moments and this match one of the best in the competition's history. ""It was one of the best World Cup games I've seen - especially in a group stage. It augurs well for the rest of the World Cup,"" said Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker. But where does Ronaldo's performance rank? Here are some of the best individual displays in World Cup history... Oleg Salenko - Russia 6-1 Cameroon (USA 1994) -Salenko remains the first and only player to score five goals in a single World Cup game. It was enough for him to earn a share of the Golden Boot, even though Russia went out in the first round. This video can not be played Archive: Salenko bags five Sandor Kocsis - Hungary 8-3 West Germany (Switzerland 1954) -Kocsis followed a hat-trick against South Korea with four in Hungary's group-stage demolition of West Germany. The great Hungarian side seemed destined to be world champions, only to be stunned by the Germans in the final. Zinedine Zidane - France 3-0 Brazil (France 1998)- Zidane bossed the 1998 final, taking France to the world title on home soil. He scored twice and dismantled defending champions Brazil. Eusebio - Portugal 5-3 North Korea (England 1966)- North Korea were heading for perhaps the biggest shock of all time when they led Portugal 3-0. Enter Eusebio, who scored four unanswered goals, including two from the spot. Sir Geoff Hurst - England 4-2 West Germany (England 1966)- To this day still the only hat-trick in a World Cup final, one that carried England to the greatest day in their footballing history and earned Hurst a knighthood. This video can not be played 50 Great World Cup moments: England win the World Cup - 1966 A young Portugal fan with a poster of his hero Correio da Manha (Portugal): ""It is not enough to call him king. This Ronaldo of Russia reaches the dimension of God. A giant among small creatures fearful of their gifts, powers and moods. This game with Spain puts Ronaldo on the highest altar of this global religion. Ronaldo achieved immortality."" Diario de Noticias (Portugal):Like Eusebio against North Korea in 1966, Pele against France in 1958 or Maradona against England in 1986, CR7's display against Spain in the 2018 World Cup will be for eternity."" Publico (Spain):""Spain has talent but does not have the best in the world. Without a doubt, Spain is a better team than the Portuguese team collectively and individually. But there is no Cristiano Ronaldo. And that made all the difference in this match."" El Mundo (Spain):""Spain survives Cristiano Ronaldo.

Thai king takes control of crown assets,"Maha Vajiralongkorn became king in December 2016 Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been granted full, personal ownership of royal assets thought to be worth at least $30bn (Â£22bn). The Crown Property Bureau, which controlled the royal fortune on behalf of the monarchy, said it transferred ownership of the assets following a change in the law last year. It means taxes are liable on royal assets for the first time. Maha Vajiralongkorn, 65, became king in December 2016. He succeeded his much-revered father King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was the world's longest-reigning monarch when he died in October 2016. Thailand has strict lese majeste laws, which ban criticism of the monarchy. The laws have also shielded the royal family from public view and scrutiny. Profile: King Maha Vajiralongkorn Thailand's lese-majeste law explained The Crown Property Bureau said in a statement it was required ""to return whatever asset of the Crown property previously under its charge,external, to His Majesty so that His Majesty may take decisions on all matters pertaining to their charge and management at his discretion"". The assets include shares in various companies. The statement went on to say: ""His Majesty made the decision to make the 'Crown Property Assets' be subject to the same duties and taxation as would assets belonging to any other citizen"". It also pledged to ensure the management of assets would be ""transparent and open to scrutiny"". The Crown Property Bureau (CPB) has been managing royal assets since it was established in 1938 and, until now, has been run by at least four royally-appointed directors and included the minister of finance. The extent of the CPB's wealth is not known. In 2012, Forbes magazine estimated its value in property and other investments came to more than $30bn. Stock exchange data in March showed the king acquired a nearly $150m stake in Siam Cement Group Pcl and, in October, shares worth over $500m in Siam Commercial Bank were transferred to the king, Reuters news agency reports. Before becoming king, Maha Vajiralongkorn is reported to have spent a lot of time abroad and his colourful lifestyle occasionally made headlines in foreign media. Observers say he has worked hard to improve his profile in recent years, which is important as the king is traditionally seen as a guiding force in Thai politics.

Review: Frida Kahlo - Making Her Self Up Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ,"If you're anything like me, I bet I know what you do with those few fleeting moments of spare time you have (between watching episodes of Love Island or World Cup matches). You reach deep into your bookcase and pull out your much-thumbed 1990 edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art & Artists. Because why wouldn't you? It's a terrific read, packed with expertly abridged biographies of Old Masters and pithy explanations for arcane techniques like encaustic painting (a favourite of Jasper Johns). No wonder we keep going back to it. But, like all things, it is not faultless. There is one surprising and glaring omission. Open it up at page 239, look under K, and you will discover there is no entry for Frida Kahlo beyond the words: ""see RIVERA, DIEGO"". Frida Kahlo with her husband, Diego Rivera, circa 1945 Rivera, who was Kahlo's husband, is afforded a lengthy entry in which he is described as a""â¦most celebrated figure"" and ""leading artist"", who made art ""glorifying the history and people of the country [Mexico]â¦"". It is not until you reach the bits-and-pieces information right at the end that we learn, ""He had numerous love affairs and was three times married, his second wife being a painter, Frida Kahlo (1907-54)."" Not ""the"" painter, or ""fellow artist"", but simply a glib dismissal as ""painter"". Given Kahlo's current status as one of the most famous and revered artists of the 20th Century, it seems like the most extraordinary oversight. And so it is, but it is also instructive. We learn at least three things about the art establishment from the omission: The tendency by (predominately male) art historians to erase female artists from the accepted canon. Frida Kahlo has only relatively recently been anointed by establishment curators in Europe. The art world's limitless talent for post-hoc myth making. The idea that any reputable art history directory would omit Frida Kahlo today is laughable. Indeed, the current edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art & Artists boasts a reasonably lengthy entry under her name. But, once again, it is revealing. The Rivera entry begins with his art credentials: ""Mexican painter, the most celebrated figure inâ¦fresco painting that is Mexico's most distinctive contribution to modern art."" Whereas Kahlo's entry begins: ""Mexican painter. In 1929, when she was still at school, she suffered appalling injuries in a traffic accident, leaving her a permanent semi-invalid, often in severe pain."" It is her personal story, the bolstering of her myth that is deemed the most important thing to say about her, not the nature or style of the paintings she produced, which is surely the reason for the entry in the first place. Self-Portrait as a Tehuana, 1943 So, here we are, more than 60 years after her death aged 47, totally fixated by the cult of Kahlo: a packaged personality that all but obscures what we should really care about, which is her work. The exhibition at the V&A is a typical case in point. To their credit, the curators are not trying to hide the fact that they are selling a show based on the artist's iconic image rather than her paintings, by giving it the title: Frida Kahlo, Making Herself Up. To be honest, my heart sank when I was told the premise of the show was to look at how she constructed her personality and why. Here we go again, yet more myth making. Couldn't we examine how she made her work and why instead? Wouldn't that be more interesting? But as I walked around the show, the vast majority of which is made up of objects that were locked away in the bathroom of her house in Mexico for half a century (more myth making), it became increasingly apparent that in Kahlo's case there is no separation between art and artist: they are one and the same. Frida Kahlo endured multiple operations, and had to wear orthopaedic corsets, including this one made of plaster, which she painted and decorated It turns out the show isn't a hackneyed hagiography at all, but a revelation. From the early family photograph in which an androgynous-looking Frida is wearing a three-piece suit, to the image of her sitting on a Manhattan rooftop dressed in her spectacular Mexican clothes and smoking a cigarette, it becomes crystal clear that from her late teens onwards, Frida Kahlo was essentially a performance artist. Frida on the roof-deck in New York, 1946 The image we have of her, the public image she developed (even when pictured in ""private""), the Frida on show here, is as much an artwork by her as one of her paintings. The traditional Mexican clothes she wore, the indigenous jewellery she collected, the photographs for which she posed, the monobrow, the moustache, her attitude: every detail was meticulously considered and curated by the artist to communicate to us her ideas, ideals, and feelings. Self-portrait with Necklace, 1933 There is clearly also a performative aspect to her paintings; in so much as she is usually the main protagonist acting out the picture's narrative. The sense of her using her body as a canvas is most explicit in the way she decorated the plaster corsets and prosthetic leg on display in a gallery full of her medicines and medical equipment. One of the most intricate objects in the collection is Frida Kahlo's prosthetic leg with leather boot, and silk appliquÃ© with embroidered Chinese motifs, 1953 And so the more this exhibition seeks to unmask the 'real' Frida the further she disappears behind her defiant faÃ§ade. By the time you emerge from the theatrical last room of dresses and shoes, you know for sure that you have absolutely no idea who the real Frida Kahlo was. You only know what she wanted to show: what pain looks like, what Mexico looks like, what gender looks like; what love looks like. It is her agenda, not ours. We can mythologise her all we like, but to do so is to miss the point. As this exhibition makes abundantly clear, maybe not entirely intentionally, Frida Kahlo only ever revealed one thing to us: art - in all her guises.

Glasgow mourns damage to 'city's fabric',"Glaswegians are coming to terms with the fact that one of their most famous buildings has, once again, been ravaged by a fire. Glasgow MP Alison Thewliss said she was ""devastated"" adding the Glasgow School of Art was ""part of the fabric of the city"". University researcher Maria Papanatsiou, who lives round the corner from the building, spoke of her shock and sadness. Maria has lived in the area since 2013. ""I've watched as the restoration went up, and now it's come down,"" she says. She was sitting in her living room when, through her window, she saw flames coming from the art school. ""I went down to the street and was there for at least two hours,"" she said. Maria was not the only one - others had come to watch, including clubbers who had been evacuated from nearby buildings. ""Everyone was very sad,"" she says, ""One guy was even crying."" This video can not be played Tako Taal: I've never seen a fire this large before Artist Tako Taal was having a drink with friends in the school student union bar when the fire broke out. ""We saw people coming in and out saying there was a small fire,"" she said. ""You could smell smoke coming in. There were already two firemen on the scene and we were moved away really quickly. ""Everyone was confused and shocked.  I've never seen a fire this large before."" ""The firefighters were really great,"" she added. Comedian Susan Calman described the scenes as ""horrific"" In the wake of the fire, famous alumni and Glaswegians expressed their heartbreak at the fire and the damage to the Glasgow School of Art. Comedian and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Susan Calman said: ""Thinking of staff, students, alumni  and the wonderful emergency services who, as always, fought to save such a treasure. Just awful."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Artist and TV presenter Lachlan Goudie said he was ""horrified"" by the ravaging of the building describing it as ""a terrible bereavement"". ""This building was part of Glasgow's soul, a visual expression of Scottish creativity at its peak,"" he said. ""To see it devastated once was horrendous, to see it assaulted by the flames a second time is gut wrenching."" TV presenter Lachlan Goudie said the building was 'part of Glasgow's soul' Louise Rowley studied at the school and was travelling back to the city for the first time since graduating. During her time there she worked as a tour guide for the building. ""The whole building is overwhelming,"" she says. ""The hen-run is a beautiful glass room at the back of the building, uniting the east and west wings, somewhere to get inspiration. ""It's so well thought-about and so inspirational."" Ms Thewliss said she was ""absolutely devastated"" by the news describing the building as ""part of the fabric of the city."" ""It is something we hold very dear,"" she added. She said a lot of skill and talent had gone in to the restoration work. ""It's a real blow to see the damage done last night,"" she said. She also sent out a plea for any support that could be given. Mr Mundell said the UK government was ""committed to ensuring this iconic building will be restored if it can be"". He said the way Glaswegians felt about the Glasgow School of Art was equivalent to how Londoners felts about Big Ben.

"Taliban and Afghan forces embrace at EidThe unprecedented ceasefire could lead to a longer peace, President Ghani says.Asia","This video can not be played Tears, hugs and selfies as Afghan troops and Taliban mark a truce for Eid Afghanistan has extended its unilateral ceasefire with the Taliban following an initial truce observed by both sides over the Eid festival period. President Ashraf Ghani appealed to the militants to follow the government's lead and enter peace talks. In extraordinary scenes, militants have been embracing security force members and taking selfies with citizens. However 25 people died in a suicide attack on one gathering of Taliban and government officials in Nangarhar. Taliban members and local residents were among the victims of the attack, province spokesman Attaullah Khogyani told the BBC, adding that 54 people were wounded. What's life like under the Taliban? Militants 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' Who are the Taliban? The Islamic State group, which is active in the area, said it carried out the attack. In a TV address Mr Ghani said the government was ready for ""comprehensive negotiations"" with the Taliban. ""All those issues and demands that have been put forth we are ready to discuss them at the peace talks,"" he said. The past day - where Taliban and government forces and officials mingled during Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan - ""proved that we are all for peace"", Mr Ghani said.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said peace talks would have to include a discussion on the role of ""international actors and forces"". ""The US stands ready to work with parties to reach a peace agreement and political settlement that brings a permanent end to this war,"" he said. Earlier this month the Taliban denied that they were in secret talks with the Afghan government. Mr Ghani has also confirmed the death of the commander of the Pakistani Taliban, Maulana Fazlullah, in a US drone strike in Afghanistan on Thursday. By Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News For many Afghans these are extraordinary scenes. The two sides were fighting each other just a few days ago. The unprecedented development has raised hopes of permanent peace in the war ravaged country. Afghans took selfies with the militants in Kabul Neighbouring Pakistan is considered key in starting the peace process as many Afghan Taliban leaders are believed to be living inside the country. However Islamabad accuses Kabul of harbouring Islamist insurgents who have carried out several violent attacks inside Pakistan in the past. But the reported killing in Afghanistan of Mullah Fazlullah, one of Pakistan's most wanted militants, could address some of Islamabad's security concerns. The Taliban announced the three-day halt to hostilities earlier this month, days after a unilateral ceasefire lasting until Wednesday was ordered by the government. It is the Taliban's first ceasefire since the government they ran was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion. A militant hugs a member of the Afghan police in Kunduz ""It was the most peaceful Eid. For the first time we felt safe. It is hard to describe the joy,"" said Qais Liwal, a student in Zabul in southern Afghanistan. Taliban and government officials performed joint Eid prayers in mosques during the truce, Mr Ghani said. Celebrating Eid around the world Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan In February Mr Ghani offered peace talks ""without preconditions"" and recognition of the Taliban as a legitimate political group if they respected the rule of law. Tens of thousands of Afghans have been killed since the US-led invasion drove the Taliban from power in 2001. In Pakistan, Interim Prime Minister Nasir-ul Mulk has said thekilling of the Pakistani Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullahin a US drone strike was a significant development in the fight against terrorism. It follows a phone call from Mr Ghani confirming the militant's death. Mullah Fazlullah (centre) is shown in a video released by the Pakistan Taliban The phone call is seen as an attempt to gain Pakistan's confidence and boost co-operation in Afghanistan's fight against militants, many of whose leaders live in Pakistan. The ruthless 'radio mullah' Meeting Mullah Fazlullah Fazlullah was linked to a number of attacks including a school massacre in Peshawar in 2014 that killed more than 150 people. He also ordered the attempted murder of schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head on a school bus aged 15.

Church gutted as fire spreads from club,"This video can not be played Bethel Community Church is a Grade-II listed building Two people have been arrested on suspicion of arson following a huge fire which gutted a 130-year-old church and a former nightclub. The Grade-II listed Bethel Community Church on Stow Hill in Newport was destroyedafter the fire spread from a derelict nightclub next door. About 95 firefighters and police officers were at the scene on Friday and crews finally put the blaze out on Saturday evening. No-one is thought to have been hurt. A 43-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman from Newport remain in custody. Gwent Police is appealing for witnesses and has asked for help in identifying people who were inside the derelict club at about 18:00 BST on Friday. It has also emerged that concerns about the state of the former nightclub, which closed in 2010, had been raised with officials days before the blaze. Newport Conservatives said they emailed the local council on 7 June calling for the former Zanzibar and Heights 2000 club to be inspected due to ""fear this could collapse or end up going up in flames."" Newport council has been asked to comment. Church members will meet to pray in Stow Hill car park at 10:30 on Sunday The local authority carried out an ""enforcement inspection"", but the local Tory group want an investigation into why the council did not carry out a ""full site inspection"" - as they claim officers did not enter the building. Newport Conservative activist Michael Enea said he emailed the council after worried residents contacted him. They came following an online video showing people walking around the derelict building, which was full of debris and loose wires. ""There were quite a few concerns about the state of the building,"" he added. ""The roof had totally collapsed and caved in, the building was totally derelict."" Allow Twitter content?

Newport council said the majority of residents will be able to return to their homes by Saturday evening. However, people living in two properties next to the church will stay in temporary accommodation for another night.

Harvard 'biased against Asian-Americans',"Harvard is one of the world's most prestigious universities Harvard University is discriminating against Asian-American applicants, a non-profit group suing the flagship US academic institution has claimed. Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) said Harvard preferred white, black and Hispanic applicants, some less qualified than Asian-American ones. It said Harvard consistently ranked Asian-American applicants lowest on personal traits such as likeability. Harvard denied this, saying admission rates for Asian-Americans had grown. Asian-Americans currently make up 22.2% of students admitted to Harvard,according to the university website.,external African-Americans constitute 14.6%, Hispanic or Latino 11.6%, Native American or Pacific Islander 2.5%. A category of all others, mainly white students, is just under 50%. 10 things about Harvard graduates: Liberals, virgins and iPhones In Friday's court motion in Boston,the group said evidence showed that Harvard ""engages in racial balancing, uses race as far more than a 'plus' factor, and has no interest in exploring race-neutral alternatives"".,external The ""plus factor"" refers to US court rulings regarding affirmative action to help minority applicants get into college. ""What Harvard will not admit is that race is not only an important factor, it is the dominant consideration in admitting Hispanics and African-Americans,"" the SFFA said. ""An Asian-American applicant with 25% chance of admission, for example, would have a 35% chance if he were white, 75% if he were Hispanic, and 95% chance if he were African-American."" The SFFA did not provide a breakdown for female applicants. It also claimed that Harvard had come to the same conclusions in its own research in 2013 - but had buried the report. The university denied the allegations, saying the SFFA's analysis was flawed in a number of ways and therefore misleading. ""Thorough and comprehensive analysis of the data and evidence makes clear that Harvard College does not discriminate against applicants from any group, including Asian-Americans, whose rate of admission has grown 29% over the last decade,"" Harvard said in a statement, the New York Times reports. This is the latest development in an ongoing judicial battle between the SFFA and Harvard which began in 2014. In 2016,the US Supreme Court rejected a challenge to affirmative action. The judges denied the challenge of a white woman, who believed she was rejected by the University of Texas due to her race. Affirmative action, or ""positive discrimination"", can continue to be used by public universities when considering minority students, the court said.

Hastings Pier sold to Eastbourne hotelier,"Local campaigners had raised more than Â£430,000 to keep the pier from private hands Hastings Pier has been sold to the owner of Eastbourne Pier despite a campaign to keep it owned locally. Hastings Pier Charity which ran the award-winning Grade II-listed structureentered administration last November. Eastbourne hotelier Sheikh Abid Gulzar said he was ""thrilled"" to have signed a deal to buy Hastings Pier on Friday. However, local campaigners who had been trying to raise money to buy the pier themselves said they were ""sad"" and ""disappointed"" with the decision. The pier, which originally opened in 1872, was rebuilt following a devastating fire in 2010. Mr Gulzar, who bought Eastbourne Pier in 2015, said: ""I want to assure everyone that I will be putting my heart and soul into Hastings Pier, just as I have done at Eastbourne. ""I will work with the town's people and the council to make Hastings Pier a success which everyone in the town will feel proud of."" Mr Gulzar attracted criticism locally after banning dogs, fishing and picnics from Eastbourne Pier after he took it over. The Friends of Hastings Pier raised more than Â£430,000 to buy the pier from administrators but had said they needed more time to reach the Â£500,000. Allow Twitter content?

""We did meet some of the other bidders, and their plans were exciting - we are disappointed that they weren't given the time they asked for to develop them, as they could have had a major transformational effect on the town."" A charity rebuilt the pier but went into administration in November 2017 The pier, which originally opened in 1872, was rebuilt thanks to Heritage Lottery Funding following a devastating fire in 2010.

Major fire devastates Glasgow School of Art,"This video can not be played Fire engulfs Glasgow School of Art. Glasgow's world-renowned School of Art has been gutted by another huge blaze, four years after part of the building was destroyed by fire. Flames ripped through the celebrated Mackintosh building after it caught fire at about 23:20 on Friday. The blaze spread to nearby buildings, including the Campus nightclub and O2 ABC music venue, which suffered ""extensive damage"". The renovated Mackintosh library had been due to reopen next year. It was destroyed inthe blaze that ripped through the building in May 2014. It was being restored in a project estimated to cost up to Â£35m. Follow the latest on the devastating blaze Scotland reacts to Glasgow art school fire The world's love of Glasgow School of Art Shock at Glasgow art school fire In Pictures: Glasgow School of Art fire The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Peter Heath said the fire damage was ""exceptionally significant"". He said it was likely that all the restoration work carried out since the last fire had been destroyed. About 50 firefighters were still tackling Friday's blaze with nine fire engines and four-high reach appliances at the scene. A spokesman said the blaze had now been largely contained, however, a few pockets of fire remained. The art school building has been devastated by the fire The Art School building and those around it are devastated as a result of the fire How the buildings, including the restoration work of the Art School, looked before the fire Unlike four years ago, art students were not using the now fire-ravaged building for their degree work. An exhibition by graduating students took place at the nearby McLellan Galleries and the school of art's Reid Building. A statement from the school of art described the fire as ""devastating"". It added: ""The Glasgow School of Art's immediate focus is on our students, and on the continuing operation of the GSA to ensure minimum disruption to students and staff. ""The GSA and all of its buildings will remain closed for the next week, and we will provide updates as and when information is available."" Fire crews are concentrating efforts on all four sides of the buildings, from Dalhousie Street to Sauchiehall Street and into Renfrew Street. Nearby homes have been evacuated as a precaution. There are not thought to have been any injuries. At its height, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene. SFRS area manager David Young said: ""The fire has now largely been contained but this remains a protracted incident and our efforts very much continue at this stage to extinguish the fire and ensure the community is protected. ""There will be disruption around Dalhousie Street, Sauchiehall Street and Renfrew Street and I would advise the public to avoid these areas at this present time. Firefighters sent to the scene had been faced with ""an extremely challenging and complex incident"", Deputy Chief Officer Iain Bushell said earlier. All floors of the building were affected. Firefighters used water from the River Clyde to tackle the blaze,resulting in a number of road closures in the area. Insp Catherine McNally, of Police Scotland, praised the response of both the public and nearby licensed premises which were asked to evacuate. Parts of Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street look normal for a Saturday morning. The rain falls heavily on top of chip boxes, the remnants providing breakfast for many a hungry bird. But the presence of fire engines, police officers, bewildered passers-by and an acrid smell of smoke in the air indicate this is far from normal. Smoke still billows from the Glasgow School of Art, the Campus nightclub and the O2 ABC venue, with all the streets around the area closed. Once again, the people of Glasgow are watching on as one of its most famous buildings is on fire. Once again, the words ""so sad"" are heard on every corner. Ben, an eyewitness, told the BBC the latest fire looked ""much worse"" than the previous one. ""This is a blaze, the building is just going up like a tinderbox. It's quite shocking,"" he said. How do you recreate a masterpiece like the Mackintosh Library? Mackintosh and the rooms that inspired Europe Art school restoration brought to life This video can not be played Glasgow School of Art 'extensively damaged' Aileen Clarke, BBC Scotland Water is still being pumped onto Glasgow School of art this morning, though firefighters now say they have contained the blaze which has so extensively ravaged the Mackintosh building there may still be pockets of fire flaring up. The operation on the ABC building next door they still describe as active firefighting, the fire spread to the roof of that building though it's smoke more than flames visible from the street, now. Deputy assistant chief fire officer Peter Heath says there is damage to every part of the Mackintosh building, and the fire had such a grip of the building when they arrived here just after 23:15 last night, that they don't know where it started let alone how. Initial impressions are that it seems unlikely that any of the restoration work carried out since fire ripped through the building four years ago, will have survived this latest blaze. Connor Neil, 22, said people were being evacuated from their homes and there was a ""big orange light"" which could be seen from streets away. The building was undergoing restoration works after the previous fire in 2014 One Twitter user posted a video of the O2's roof appearing to collapse as firefighters sprayed water onto the building from an aerial platform.

Sturgeon: Art school fire is heartbreaking,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows scale of the Glasgow School of Art fire Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has described the fire which gutted Glasgow's world-renowned School of Art as ""heartbreaking"". Flames ripped through the celebrated Mackintosh building after it caught fire at about 23:20 on Friday. The blaze spread to nearby buildings, including the Campus nightclub and O2 ABC music venue, but no-one was reported injured. Firefighters said it was ""too early"" to comment on the cause. 'I assumed the art school fire was a social media blip', by Pauline McLean BBC Scotland arts correspondent Ms Sturgeon said: ""The fire has been a devastating blaze, much worse than the one that took hold of the Mackintosh building four years ago. ""The damage is severe and extensive. My heart goes out to everybody associated with the art school."" The art school building was under reconstruction from the first fire in 2014 The art school and a neighbouring building were devastated in the fire The Mackintosh library, which was recognised as being one of the finest examples of art nouveau in the world, was destroyed inthe blaze that ripped through the building in May 2014. The A-listed building, considered to be Charles Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece, was being restored in a project estimated to cost up to Â£35m and was due to reopen next year. The story of the fire and its aftermath Scotland reacts to Glasgow art school fire The world's love of Glasgow School of Art Shock at Glasgow art school fire In Pictures: Glasgow School of Art fire  The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Peter Heath said the fire damage was ""exceptionally significant"". He said it was likely that all the restoration work carried out since the last fire had been destroyed. That work was being carried out byKier Construction which had been awarded the multi-million poundrestoration contract. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Glasgow fire is heartbreaking A statement from the company said that while the investigation about the fire was ongoing it would be ""inappropriate to comment further"". It added: ""Kier has been working with the Glasgow School of Art since 2016 on the restoration of the Mackintosh building and so we share the devastation felt by the School and the wider public at this time."" This video can not be played City in shock after art school ravaged by fire during multi-million pound restoration. The Glasgow School of Art fire - the second major blaze at the internationally-renowned building in the past four years - has created headlines around the world. For the people of Glasgow, it has come as a great, sad shock. I first arrived on the scene on Saturday morning and walked along Sauchiehall Street, an area of the city synonymous with a good night out. Pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, music venues, and the scene of yet another devastating blaze. The words I heard as I walked around the police cordon time and time again were ""so sad"". Sad that the School of Art has been gutted again. Sad that one of Glasgow's gems, from my amateur eye, looks like it may never recover. Read more of Graham's account from the scene. Area manager David Young said about 50 firefighters were continuing to extinguish a few pockets of fire but it was a ""very difficult job"". But he would not speculate on where or how the fire started. Mr Young said: ""Colleagues who were at the fire four years ago said it was less devastating than it is now. ""Damage is from one end of the building to the other. The roof is damaged and the floors. The building is in a poor state."" Mr Young said the fire was well-developed when firefighters arrived late on Friday evening. Crews were brought in from as far away as Perth and West Lothian to tackle the blaze, but forensic experts have not yet been able to access the building because it is not safe. After seeing the fire-damaged building for herself, Nicola Sturgeon described it as ""just a shell"". But she said the Scottish government stood ""ready to provide any support"" in the wake of the blaze. At the height of the fire, hoses ran down to the River Clyde which provided a key source of water Firefighters had to deal with fresh plumes of smoke during the afternoon A statement from the school of art described the fire as ""devastating"". It added: ""The Glasgow School of Art's immediate focus is on our students, and on the continuing operation of the GSA to ensure minimum disruption to students and staff. ""The GSA and all of its buildings will remain closed for the next week, and we will provide updates as and when information is available."" How Glasgow earned its reputation as the 'Tinderbox City' Timeline: The art school's devastating years Fire crews have been concentrating efforts on all four sides of the buildings, from Dalhousie Street to Sauchiehall Street and into Renfrew Street. Nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution. There are not thought to have been any injuries. At its height, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene. Firefighters used water from the River Clyde to tackle the blaze,resulting in a number of road closures in the area. Insp Catherine McNally, of Police Scotland, praised the response of both the public and nearby licensed premises which were asked to evacuate. Ben, an eyewitness, told the BBC the latest fire looked ""much worse"" than the previous one. ""This is a blaze, the building is just going up like a tinderbox. It's quite shocking,"" he said.

"DUP living in fools' paradise, says O'Neill","Michelle O'Neill was making her first speech to an ard fheis (conference) since becoming party vice-president. Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president Michelle O'Neill has launched a strong attack on the DUP, claiming the party is ""living in a fool's paradise"". Ms O'Neill was making her first speech to an ard fheis (party conference) since taking up the role. She said the DUP puts its ""self-serving pact with the Tory party at Westminster before people's interests here"". She added they ""blindly prop up Theresa May who is preoccupied with negotiating with her cabinet rather than the EU"". The DUP and Conservatives agreed a""supply and confidence"" arrangement,externalfollowing the general election in June last year. Mark Devenport on a 'curate's egg' of a deal May and DUP deal:  What you need to know Speaking on Friday night, Mrs O'Neill said: ""Britain is divided. But in Ireland, we are united. The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Williamson of the Conservative Party signed the deal in Downing Street ""We will not be collateral damage as a result of the reckless Tory/DUP Brexit agenda. There will be no border in Ireland."" As part of the DUP/Tory deal, the DUP guarantees that its 10 MPs will vote with the government on the Queen's Speech, the Budget, and legislation relating to Brexit and national security. The deal includedan extra Â£1bn in public spending for Northern Ireland. Analysis: Gareth Gordon, BBC News NI political correspondent The party's new vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, got her biggest cheer of the night when she said: ""Surely you agree it is time for a woman taoiseach to lead the next [Irish] government? ""And surely you know that woman is Mary Lou McDonald?"" Sinn FÃ©in is not in government in the Republic of Ireland. But its President, Mary Lou McDonald, has made it clear she wants it to be. Michelle O'Neill's second biggest cheer came when she attacked the DUP, the party Sinn FÃ©in would be in government with in Northern Ireland, if only they could agree. She told delegates in Belfast's Waterfront Hall: ""The DUP do not speak for the people of the north."" The main business of this weekend will be to safely chart a way through a subject which has caused Sinn FÃ©in difficulties - as it has all parties - abortion. Following the recent referendum in the Republic of Ireland, the leadership has backed a motion that says abortion should be available to women within ""a limited gestational period"". Butmore than 20 branches have tabled another motion, arguing that all party members should be allowed to speak and vote about abortion according to their consciences, a policy which has been adopted by some other parties, including the SDLP. After 34 years of Gerry Adams as president, Saturday will be the first ard fheis for the party's new leader Mary Lou McDonald. The focus will turn to the party's policy on abortion following the recent referendum in the Republic of Ireland. Tory-DUP deal's impact on power-sharing Analysis: Where will the money go?

Hastings Pier sold to Eastbourne hotelierA campaign to keep the pier in community ownership failed to raise enough money in time.Sussex,"Local campaigners had raised more than Â£430,000 to keep the pier from private hands Hastings Pier has been sold to the owner of Eastbourne Pier despite a campaign to keep it owned locally. Hastings Pier Charity which ran the award-winning Grade II-listed structureentered administration last November. Eastbourne hotelier Sheikh Abid Gulzar said he was ""thrilled"" to have signed a deal to buy Hastings Pier on Friday. However, local campaigners who had been trying to raise money to buy the pier themselves said they were ""sad"" and ""disappointed"" with the decision. The pier, which originally opened in 1872, was rebuilt following a devastating fire in 2010. Mr Gulzar, who bought Eastbourne Pier in 2015, said: ""I want to assure everyone that I will be putting my heart and soul into Hastings Pier, just as I have done at Eastbourne. ""I will work with the town's people and the council to make Hastings Pier a success which everyone in the town will feel proud of."" Mr Gulzar attracted criticism locally after banning dogs, fishing and picnics from Eastbourne Pier after he took it over. The Friends of Hastings Pier raised more than Â£430,000 to buy the pier from administrators but had said they needed more time to reach the Â£500,000. Allow Twitter content?

Administrators Smith and Williamson said there had been a ""significant number"" of expressions of interest ""in this beloved asset"" and there had been ""a number of concrete offers"". Adam Stephens, from the company, said: ""Mr Gulzar demonstrated the best immediate financial capability as well as the operational capacity and experience, including from running Eastbourne Pier.""

""We did meet some of the other bidders, and their plans were exciting - we are disappointed that they weren't given the time they asked for to develop them, as they could have had a major transformational effect on the town."" A charity rebuilt the pier but went into administration in November 2017 The pier, which originally opened in 1872, was rebuilt thanks to Heritage Lottery Funding following a devastating fire in 2010.

"Boy could die unless given cannabis oil, says mum","Billy Caldwell, 12, has severe epilepsy A severely epileptic boy suffered two more seizures overnight, his mother who wants to continue treating her son with cannabis oil has said. Charlotte Caldwell, from County Tyrone, said she was ""full of hope"" that a solution would be found. Her son Billy Caldwell, 12, began using cannabis oil in 2016 to control his seizures but his most recent supply was confiscated at Heathrow Airport. According to MP Ãrfhlaith Begley, the Home Office has now released the oil. In a tweet, the Sinn FÃ©in MP said: ""I'm delighted to say that I have just spoken with Charlotte to tell her that I have received official confirmation that Billy is going to receive his medication and it is on its way."" The Home Office had earlier said it was in contact with Billy's medical team. In a statement to reporters on Saturday, Ms Caldwell, said she was ""overwhelmed"" by the professionalism and expertise of doctors at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where Billy is being treated. She said: ""The hospital staff, Billy's team and the Home Office are all working together. I'm confident we will find a solution. I'm praying for a miracle."" According to Mrs Caldwell, when Billy uses the oil as his anti-epileptic medication, his ""life-threatening"" seizures are dramatically reduced. Billy was admitted to hospital in London on Friday Billy, from Castlederg, started the treatment in 2016 in the US, where medical marijuana is legal. In 2017, he was prescribed the medication on the NHS. But in May this year,his GP was told he could no longer do so. At the time the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said cannabis had not yet been licensed in the UK as a medicine. Last Monday, Ms Caldwell tried to bring a six-month supply of the oil - to treat up to 100 seizures a day - into the UK from Canada but the substance wasconfiscated by officials at Heathrow airport. His family said he was taken to hospital when his seizures ""intensified"" in recent days. The Home Office said it was in contact with Billy Caldwell's medical team to ""carefully consider"" options. A spokeswoman said it was ""deeply sympathetic to the extremely difficult situation that Billy and his family are in"". Billy Caldwell cannabis oil plea denied Reality Check: Does UK export the most legal cannabis? Most UK cannabis 'super strength skunk' Ms Caldwell previously said the situation was ""beyond cruelty"". She said: ""We've now reached the point where Billy is too ill to travel to get his medication, but his medication is stored minutes away from where we're now living in London. ""Despite the best and honest efforts of the NHS, frontline doctors are fighting Billy's condition with both hands tied behind their back because the only medication that will be effective is the cannabis oil [with a banned component]."" She said doctors in Canada and Northern Ireland who were familiar with Billy's case have described her son's situation as life-threatening. ""The medicinal cannabis that he's had access to the last 19 months had been doing an amazing incredible job at controlling his seizures, so this sort of has thrown me a wee bit,"" she added. ""Medicinal cannabis for Billy was his anti-epileptic medication."" On Friday, she said Billy had had ""back-to-back seizures"". ""On his medication, which included the vital but banned THC component, he was seizure-free for more than 300 days,"" she said. ""If Billy dies, which is looking increasingly possible, then the Home Office, and (minister) Nick Hurd, will be held completely accountable."" Billy's family later said he could now only be treated with hospital-administered medication because doctors said it was too dangerous to treat him with ""rescue meds"" at home. Cannabis oil is not licensed in the UK as a medicine A Home Office statement said it was ""deeply sympathetic to the extremely difficult situation that Billy and his family are in"". ""Billy is in the care of medical professionals who are best placed to assess the care and treatment that he requires,"" it said. ""The Home Office is contacting Billy's medical team. If the team treating Billy advise a particular course of urgent action, the Home Office will carefully consider what options are available to help facilitate that advice."" CBD and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant. A cannabis-based drug called Sativex has been licensed in the UK to treat MS. It contains THC and CBD. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. MS patients prescribed Sativex, who resupply it to other people, also face prosecution. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy.

Over 40s health check to include dementia advice,"People over 40 in England will be given advice on dementia as part of their free NHS health check. Guidance on how to reduce the risk of dementia will be given to patients at GP surgeries and through community health programmes. Public Health England (PHE) said up to one-third of dementia cases could be improved through lifestyle choices. But its says 28% of people have no awareness of risk factors and only 2% know what they can do to reduce them. The planned roll-out follows a small pilot conducted by PHE, with the help of Alzheimer's Research UK and the Alzheimer's Society, which led to both charities calling for it to become mandatory. Recommended every five years for those aged 40 to 74 Tests include height, weight, blood, and blood pressure Takes 20 to 30 minutes Read more (NHS),external The current health check in England focuses on reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. But the public body says the advice for dementia is much the same, adding: ""What's good for the heart is good for the brain."" Maintaining a social life, keeping mentally and physically active, and stopping smoking are all recommended by healthcare professionals as ways of reducing the risk. Dementia risk linked to some medicines The foods that might help with dementia The people with dementia staging their debut plays More than 14 million people - 91% of those eligible - have been offered an NHS health check over the past five years, but fewer than 50% - or seven million - have had one. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE, said the check ""could add years to your life"". Minister for Public Health, Steve Brine, added: ""Early detection and prevention are vital to the health of our nation and our programmes in this area are among the most ambitious in the world. ""Our aim is to keep everyone as healthy as possible, for as long as possible."" A survey by British Social Attitudes showed 52% of adults in the UK named dementia as one of their top three health worries. The NHS in Wales does not offer the checks, but has a separate scheme called ""add to your life"" - which targets groups at risk of disease, rather than by age. It did launch a new dementia strategy earlier this year, however, focusing on early diagnosis at GP level. Scotland also has a national dementia strategy focusing on early diagnosis and offering all patients diagnosed with the condition a minimum of a year of ""high-quality post-diagnostic support."" PHE estimates more than 850,000 people are living with dementia across the UK. Alcohol and dementia: What's the truth?

The world's love of Glasgow School of Art,"The full north facade of Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art, taken before the 2014 fire When Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art building was first unveiled in 1899, the half-finished building was deeply unpopular but Glasgow and the world grew to appreciate its architectural genius. These days Charles Rennie Mackintosh's most famous architectural creation has come to be widely loved and cherished. Charles Rennie Mackintosh was lauded in Europe but struggled in Britain And there was a national and international outpouring of grief when it was first devastated by fire in 2014 and its magnificent library completely destroyed. In Pictures: Glasgow School of Art fire Follow the latest on the devastating blaze A massive restoration project was undertaken, with the library painstakingly recreated in very detail. It would appear all that work has been destroyed and Mackintosh's masterpiece has again been consumed by fire. Abstract view of front door and Directors Balcony, Mackintosh It would have been hard to predict such affection for this building when it was first shown to the public on a rainy day in the last month of the 19th Century. Over in the west of Glasgow, the new Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery, by London architects Simpson and  Allen, was taking shape. It was grand, frothy and pleasingly symmetrical. First floor corridor on the east side of Mackintosh Building between Mackintosh Museum and Mackintosh Room. Completed 1897-1899 In contrast, the new Glasgow School of Art, at the back of Sauchiehall Street in the city centre, was having a more troubled birth. The art school's maverick director, Fra Newbery, had chosen 31-year-old Mackintosh as the architect, despite him not being a partner in his firm and having only designed a couple of previous buildings. The railings outside Glasgow School of Art, featuring a sequence of Japanese-influenced symbols on stalks Newbery knew Mackintosh because he was a former pupil at the art school. Mackintosh had been a member of a group of radical students who dubbed themselves The Immortals. Along with his friend James Herbert MacNair and the sisters Margaret and Frances Macdonald, they created innovative and, at times,  controversial graphics and decorative art designs which formed the distinctive ""Glasgow Style"". A detail from the Glasgow School of Art's Mackintosh room Newbery wanted to bring some of this style into his new art school building but the original budget only covered half of the plans and it was opened half-finished. It was deeply unpopular, seeming to lack symmetry or logic. Mackintosh was not invited to the opening ceremony. ""The Hen Run"", glazed passageway running above the roof of the Mackintosh Gallery and leading to the East side of the Building. It was destroyed in 2014 but had been recreated But slowly over the decades Glasgow and the world grew to love this strange building, with its great grid-like structure and its iron work around the windows. Inside the building there were dark corridors and studios drenched in sunlight as well as intimate alcoves, with simple yet beautiful designs. The building had personality. How do you recreate a masterpiece like the Mackintosh Library? Mackintosh and the rooms that inspired Europe Art school restoration brought to life By 1907, funds had been raised to complete the school of art building. The west facade looked like a Japanese Shogun's palace with slim oriel windows The existing east facade resembled one of Mackintosh's Barionial castles but his new west facade was very different, with a trio of slender oriel windows- more linear, geometric. This did not look like a Scottish fortress but more like the palace of a Japanese Shogun. Encased behind the windows was the new library. A space in which Mackintosh's style took yet another leap forward. Glasgow School of Art's library was considered one of the finest rooms in Britain before the fire that destroyed it 2014 Designed around a central courtyard like that of a Japanese residence, balconies and verandas encircled the room. There were beams that created a wooden grid floating in space. It eventually came to be seen as the most perfect room designed by this visionary architect. Glasgow remained unsure of Mackintosh during his lifetime and his career ground to a halt soon after the completion of the school of art. Mackintosh, who was described as having a satanic personality and drank heavily, was thought to have had a nervous breakdown and left his architectural firm in 1910. The Mackintosh library before the fire The outbreak of World War One meant he got very little work and he ended up eking out a living as an artist in London. He spent some of his later years in the South of France and died in 1928 at the age of 60, having not worked on an architectural project for years. 2018 is the 150th anniversary of his birth and the city that once rejected him has been celebrating his legacy and architectural genius. There are some other buildings in the city that bear the Mackintosh mark such as Scotland Street School and Queen Cross Church but the art school was his masterpiece and it has again been destroyed.

Scotland reacts to Glasgow art school fire,"Glaswegians are coming to terms with the fact that one of their most famous buildings has, once again, been ravaged by a fire. Glasgow MP Alison Thewliss said she was ""devastated"" adding the Glasgow School of Art was ""part of the fabric of the city"". University researcher Maria Papanatsiou, who lives round the corner from the building, spoke of her shock and sadness. Maria has lived in the area since 2013. ""I've watched as the restoration went up, and now it's come down,"" she says. She was sitting in her living room when, through her window, she saw flames coming from the art school. ""I went down to the street and was there for at least two hours,"" she said. Maria was not the only one - others had come to watch, including clubbers who had been evacuated from nearby buildings. ""Everyone was very sad,"" she says, ""One guy was even crying."" This video can not be played Tako Taal: I've never seen a fire this large before Artist Tako Taal was having a drink with friends in the school student union bar when the fire broke out. ""We saw people coming in and out saying there was a small fire,"" she said. ""You could smell smoke coming in. There were already two firemen on the scene and we were moved away really quickly. ""Everyone was confused and shocked.  I've never seen a fire this large before."" ""The firefighters were really great,"" she added. Comedian Susan Calman described the scenes as ""horrific"" In the wake of the fire, famous alumni and Glaswegians expressed their heartbreak at the fire and the damage to the Glasgow School of Art. Comedian and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Susan Calman said: ""Thinking of staff, students, alumni  and the wonderful emergency services who, as always, fought to save such a treasure. Just awful."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Artist and TV presenter Lachlan Goudie said he was ""horrified"" by the ravaging of the building describing it as ""a terrible bereavement"". ""This building was part of Glasgow's soul, a visual expression of Scottish creativity at its peak,"" he said. ""To see it devastated once was horrendous, to see it assaulted by the flames a second time is gut wrenching."" TV presenter Lachlan Goudie said the building was 'part of Glasgow's soul' Louise Rowley studied at the school and was travelling back to the city for the first time since graduating. During her time there she worked as a tour guide for the building. ""The whole building is overwhelming,"" she says. ""The hen-run is a beautiful glass room at the back of the building, uniting the east and west wings, somewhere to get inspiration. ""It's so well thought-about and so inspirational."" Ms Thewliss said she was ""absolutely devastated"" by the news describing the building as ""part of the fabric of the city."" ""It is something we hold very dear,"" she added. She said a lot of skill and talent had gone in to the restoration work. ""It's a real blow to see the damage done last night,"" she said. She also sent out a plea for any support that could be given. Mr Mundell said the UK government was ""committed to ensuring this iconic building will be restored if it can be"". He said the way Glaswegians felt about the Glasgow School of Art was equivalent to how Londoners felts about Big Ben. ""People feel an association with the building even if they have never crossed its threshold.""

"US separates 2,000 children in six weeks","Children separated from their parents at the border are classed as unaccompanied minors Almost 2,000 migrant children were separated from their families at the US border over six weeks, officials say. Following a Trump administration crackdown on illegal border crossings from Mexico, adults are being detained, meaning the children with them are removed from their care. The issue is causing a growing political storm in the US. On Thursday Attorney GeneralJeff Sessions cited the Bible to defend the ""zero tolerance"" approach. Why the US is separating migrant children from their parents Immigration 'an existential threat' to US Is US only country to separate migrant children? It means that those entering the US irregularly are criminally prosecuted, a change to a long-standing policy of charging most of those crossing for the first time with a misdemeanour offence. As the adults are being charged with a crime and detained, the children that travel with them are being separated and classed as unaccompanied minors. Figures from the US Department of Homeland Security show that 1,995 children were separated from 1,940 adults who are being held between 19 April and 31 May. No information was given on the age of the separated children. The children are passed into the care of the US Department of Health and Human Services. They are transferred to government detention facilities or foster care while officials try to resolve their case. The United Nations has called on the US to immediately halt the separations. Mr Sessions said having children would not shield border-crossing migrants from prosecution. The attorney general quoted a verse from St Paul's Letter to the Romans on obeying the laws of government. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart store in Texas Critics say that verse was once used to justify slavery. The Trump administration policy is supported by some Republicans, but others have expressed misgivings. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Congress' highest-ranking Republican, said he was not comfortable with the tactics. This week, House Republicans pitched draft immigration legislation that would end the separation of children and parents at the border. Under the plan, families would be detained together. Also in the proposal are provisions to protect 1.8 millionDaca 'Dreamers', eliminatethe diversity lottery, and add $25bn (Â£18bn) for border security. The bill, a compromise between moderates and conservatives, is expected to be voted on next week. So will another, more hard line bill. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would not sign the compromise bill, despite Republican lawmakers having said he supported it. His remark sent legislators on Capitol Hill scrambling, but the White House later said the president had misspoken and he would back both measures. The administration says it has selected a site in Texas to house the migrant children in tents. The issue has led to protests in the US and criticism from the UN Why is the US separating families?

'Spice zombies' photo prompts police pleaA photo showing a group of men slumped over after apparently taking Spice has been widely shared.,"The picture, circulated on social media, was said to be taken on Tuesday in Bridgend A widely-shared photo appearing to show three men slumped over in a street after taking Spice has prompted police to urge the public to ""take a stand against drugs"". The image shows the men in Bridgend town centre, close to where a child is playing. Another picture has since emerged of a man collapsed on a bench in the town. South Wales Police said drugs had a ""hugely detrimental impact"" on communities. The person who took the photos, who did not want to be named, said they were taken on Tuesday. Spice, a former ""legal high"" is an illegal psychoactive substance, designed to mimic the effects of cannabis, but can have severe debilitating effects. Bridgend boy, 11, 'zombie-like after taking Spice' Spice users in Cardiff filmed in 'zombie-like' state Homeless man's shock at Manchester Spice 'zombies' A second image showing a man slumped on a bench has also emerged Det Insp Dean Taylor said the force was aware of the images, which appeared to show the ""devastating"" effect alcohol and drugs could have on people. Drugs have ""a hugely detrimental impact on our communities"" and tackling them was a ""priority"", he said. ""I would ask that the community continue to work with us and make a stand against the drug dealers who impose this misery upon others."" Det Insp Taylor said the recent Operation Pacific in the town centre which targeted so-called ""county lines"" and the supply of drugs had led to ""a number of arrests"".

"'Scammers struck as my mum was dying'The 42-year-old victim was tricked out of ÃÂ£13,000 in a sophisticated scam increasingly used by fraudsters.Business","Mrs Bungay thought she was transferring money to her builder A victim of fraud was tricked out of Â£13,000 in a sophisticated scam as she cared for her dying mother. Angelene Bungay, 42, transferred money to a fraudster posing as the builder who was preparing to convert the loft of her Shrewsbury home. Her bank said that despite Mrs Bungay being one of a growing number of victims of ""push payment fraud"", she would not be refunded. New rules aimed at protecting people are being introduced soon. Mrs Bungay and her husband Richard Lea had decided to extend the family home as they were unable to afford the cost of moving. They found a legitimate builder, paid a deposit, and had a date agreed for the work to start. They extended their home loan to cover the cost. Keen to get started with the work as soon as possible, Mrs Bungay was delighted to receive a reply to the previous email exchanges telling her another customer had cancelled so the builder could begin at an earlier date. What she did not know was that the email, identical to the previous thread, was a hoax and the sender was not her builder but a fraudster. Typical of this kind of scam, it seems the con-artist had hacked into one of their email accounts to pose as the builder. The email, seen by the BBC, gives details of the work to be completed and has nothing to signal it is a deception. Angelene Bungay (centre) with her mother and step-father in happier times The timing of the scam could not have been worse. Mrs Bungay's mother - Susan Ashford - was gravely ill. ""I was spending a week at home caring for my mother when the emails started coming through,"" she said. ""It was a difficult time. My mum had pancreatic cancer. We thought she had beaten it this time last year, but it returned and she passed away having just turned 65."" A second email asked for Â£7,000 to be paid for supplies needed for the work, to be paid into a separate account specifically for materials. Mrs Bungay made the payment, but it was blocked. When she retried, her bank, First Direct, called to discuss the planned payment. That conversation, during which First Direct said followed all the correct procedures, led on to the payment being pushed through to an alternative account supplied by the fraudster. More emails followed, including discussions of the kind of insulation to be used, and so did another payment for Â£6,000. Only then did the fraud become clear to Mrs Bungay. Following a call to her actual, legitimate builder, she found out he had not changed the starting date or asked for any money. She had paid an imposter. Two days after the death of her mother, she was back on the phone to First Direct to report the fraud. She called again the next day, but the money had already disappeared from the bank account it had been paid into. A spokesman for First Direct said: ""We are sorry Mrs Bungay was a victim of fraud. The financial security of our customers is always our number one priority, and we aim to do everything we can to keep their money safe. ""Once we were notified by Mrs Bungay, we contacted the beneficiary bank to make them aware of the fraudulent activity, however we processed the payment in this case following Mrs Bungay's authorisation which means unfortunately we cannot recall the funds."" For her part, Mrs Bungay argued that more searching questions could have been asked by the bank, that could have exposed the fraud, when she first called them to push the payment through. She has taken her case to the financial ombudsman and Action Fraud. When you transfer money from your bank account, you are asked to enter three pieces of information:  the name of the payee, their account number, and the sort code. However, only the last two are cross-checked by the bank. So putting in the correct name is no guarantee that person will get the money. UK Finance offers the following advice: Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full banking password Don't assume an email, text or phone call is authentic. Call the business's official number to check Don't be rushed - a genuine organisation won't mind waiting Listen to your instincts - you know if something doesn't feel right Stay in control - don't panic and make a decision you'll regret Learn more on protecting yourself from financial scams throughthe Take Five campaign,external. This type of scam, known as authorised push payment fraud, is on the rise. Victims, on occasions, have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds. Last year, a total of Â£236m was lost, according to banking trade body UK Finance. There were 43,875 reported cases of these scams. Nearly nine in 10 (88%) of these were consumers, who lost an average of Â£2,784. The rest were businesses who lost on average of Â£24,355 per case. In November, the BBC spoke to Kate Blakeley, who described the ""sheer horror"" of discovering the loss of almost Â£300,000 through such a scam. Ms Blakeley, who was in the process of buying a house with her partner, thought she was transferring money to her conveyancing solicitor, but it was actually going to a fraudster. This video can not be played Kate Blakeley: 'We lost Â£300,000 through payment scam' Unlike other frauds, three-quarters of victims do not receive compensation from the banks as, in effect, they have given their consent to the payments being made. This type of scam was the subject of a ""super-complaint"" made in September 2016 to regulators by consumer group Which?, which has been calling for banks to shoulder more responsibility when victims are tricked in this way. It said victims had no legal right to get their money back from their bank, and far less fraud protection than was seen with other types of payments, such as card payments and direct debits. It had seen cases of people being scammed when buying a house, during building work, but also during holiday lettings and, particularly recently, when buying cars or caravans. The super-complaint has prompted new rules from the Payment Systems Regulator, in place by September, which will see the financial ombudsman consider ordering compensation if a bank or building society fails to keep to high standards when dealing with a report of fraud. Other work should also lead to more protection for consumers. For example, new technology is in the pipeline that will allow customers to confirm a payee - verifying that they are paying the person they intend. All of which is too late for Mrs Bungay who, if nothing else, is desperate for nobody else to suffer in the same way she has.

"Rape accused tells of affair with girl, 17Two former teachers at top private school Christ's Hospital are accused of sexually abusing pupils.","James Husband said he had a ""consensual"" affair with a 17-year-old girl while he worked at Christ's Hospital School A former private school teacher accused of raping a 15-year-old girl has told of an affair with another student. James Husband, 68, recalled the consensual liaison with a 17-year-old girl at Christ's Hospital School while giving evidence in his trial. Hove Crown Court heard he was married and his children attended the school during the ""spur of the moment"" affair. He and co-defendant Gary Dobbie, ex-head of house at the Horsham school, both deny sexually abusing pupils. Mr Husband, of Wigginton in York, denies four counts of rape and five of indecently assaulting a different pupil when she was as young as 14 between 1990 and 1994 while he taught at the prestigious school. Mr Dobbie, 68, of Albi in France and formerly of Hereford, faces a string of allegations against six boys and two girls as young as 12 between 1998 and 2001. He denies 12 counts of indecently assaulting four boys and two girls, attempting to indecently assault a boy and two counts of indecency with a child. He was teaching at independent Shrewsbury School, Shropshire, at the time of his arrest in 2016. The top private school charges up to Â£31,500 a year Mr Husband left his job as a history teacher when it emerged he was having a consensual affair with the 17-year-old pupil who was not underage and is not a complainant in the case, jurors were told. Giving evidence, he told the court there were several instances with the girl - from holding hands and kissing to sex - but said he did not consider it a relationship. During cross-examination, the court heard him describe the moment he kissed the student on the lips after a disco at night in the school grounds. He said: ""I can see her in my mind's eye looking up at me. I can remember the kiss. ""The look on her face suggested that she wanted me to. ""I wanted to kiss her."" In a diary entry read to the court, the girl said: ""Told too many people at school then decided to go for it. The fling. ""So got off with him on Saturday night. The most amazing thing. Happy."" Mr Husband later conceded to the court that he had had sex with two 17-year-olds. Addressing the charges involving the other girl which he denies, claiming they had consensual sex once when she was 16, he said: ""I don't know why [the alleged victim] has brought these allegations against me."" Jurors previously heard he had told the girl when she was 15: ""It's OK,I've had a vasectomy,"" before raping her. The trial continues.

Student jailed for freshers' night rapeLiam Allen raped a fellow student at her flat following a pub crawl which he organised.,"Liam Allen raped a fellow University of Sussex student following a night out in Brighton A student from the University of Sussex has been jailed for raping a fellow student at her flat in Brighton. Liam Allen, 22, had denied the charge, saying his 20-year-old victim gave her consent even though she was drunk. Hove Trial Centre heard Allen raped the woman after a pub crawl which he had organised during Freshers' Week in October 2016. Allen, of Grand Parade, Brighton, was jailed for eight years and placed on the sex offenders' register for life. In sentencing, His Honour Judge Roger Chapple QC said: ""Your victim was vulnerable through drink. ""Under the pretence of taking her home to make her safe, you raped her."" The woman, who was known to Allen but cannot be named for legal reasons, said she could not remember how she ended up at her flat with him. She told Sussex Police she had ""drunk heavily"" and had found Allen on top of her in bed and tried to push him off. ""I felt horrible. I didn't want it to happen. More than once I told him to stop,"" she told police. Photographs of bruises were later shown to the court which she said she had not had before the rape. Det Con Aran Boyt said: ""The day after... Allen spoke on the phone to the victim and her boyfriend, saying he was lonely and she was a good looking girl. ""He said he was sick and twisted for sleeping with her but alleged that she was able to consent. ""He clearly thought about his options after the event, because when we searched his mobile phone we found search terms including 'accused of rape', 'minimum sentence for rape', and 'CPS guidelines for rape'."" After the police investigation began, the University of Sussex banned the computer science student from its campus throughout his second year.

Two days after the death of her mother, she was back on the phone to First Direct to report the fraud. She called again the next day, but the money had already disappeared from the bank account it had been paid into. A spokesman for First Direct said: ""We are sorry Mrs Bungay was a victim of fraud. The financial security of our customers is always our number one priority, and we aim to do everything we can to keep their money safe. ""Once we were notified by Mrs Bungay, we contacted the beneficiary bank to make them aware of the fraudulent activity, however we processed the payment in this case following Mrs Bungay's authorisation which means unfortunately we cannot recall the funds."" For her part, Mrs Bungay argued that more searching questions could have been asked by the bank, that could have exposed the fraud, when she first called them to push the payment through. She has taken her case to the financial ombudsman and Action Fraud. When you transfer money from your bank account, you are asked to enter three pieces of information:  the name of the payee, their account number, and the sort code. However, only the last two are cross-checked by the bank. So putting in the correct name is no guarantee that person will get the money. UK Finance offers the following advice: Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full banking password Don't assume an email, text or phone call is authentic. Call the business's official number to check Don't be rushed - a genuine organisation won't mind waiting Listen to your instincts - you know if something doesn't feel right Stay in control - don't panic and make a decision you'll regret Learn more on protecting yourself from financial scams throughthe Take Five campaign,external. This type of scam, known as authorised push payment fraud, is on the rise. Victims, on occasions, have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds. Last year, a total of Â£236m was lost, according to banking trade body UK Finance. There were 43,875 reported cases of these scams. Nearly nine in 10 (88%) of these were consumers, who lost an average of Â£2,784. The rest were businesses who lost on average of Â£24,355 per case. In November, the BBC spoke to Kate Blakeley, who described the ""sheer horror"" of discovering the loss of almost Â£300,000 through such a scam. Ms Blakeley, who was in the process of buying a house with her partner, thought she was transferring money to her conveyancing solicitor, but it was actually going to a fraudster. This video can not be played Kate Blakeley: 'We lost Â£300,000 through payment scam' Unlike other frauds, three-quarters of victims do not receive compensation from the banks as, in effect, they have given their consent to the payments being made. This type of scam was the subject of a ""super-complaint"" made in September 2016 to regulators by consumer group Which?, which has been calling for banks to shoulder more responsibility when victims are tricked in this way. It said victims had no legal right to get their money back from their bank, and far less fraud protection than was seen with other types of payments, such as card payments and direct debits. It had seen cases of people being scammed when buying a house, during building work, but also during holiday lettings and, particularly recently, when buying cars or caravans. The super-complaint has prompted new rules from the Payment Systems Regulator, in place by September, which will see the financial ombudsman consider ordering compensation if a bank or building society fails to keep to high standards when dealing with a report of fraud. Other work should also lead to more protection for consumers. For example, new technology is in the pipeline that will allow customers to confirm a payee - verifying that they are paying the person they intend. All of which is too late for Mrs Bungay who, if nothing else, is desperate for nobody else to suffer in the same way she has.

"Church gutted as fire spreads from clubWreckage of a church is still smouldering, 15 hours after a fire spread from a derelict nightclub.South East Wales","This video can not be played Bethel Community Church is a Grade-II listed building Two people have been arrested on suspicion of arson following a huge fire which gutted a 130-year-old church and a former nightclub. The Grade-II listed Bethel Community Church on Stow Hill in Newport was destroyedafter the fire spread from a derelict nightclub next door. About 95 firefighters and police officers were at the scene on Friday and crews finally put the blaze out on Saturday evening. No-one is thought to have been hurt. A 43-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman from Newport remain in custody. Gwent Police is appealing for witnesses and has asked for help in identifying people who were inside the derelict club at about 18:00 BST on Friday. It has also emerged that concerns about the state of the former nightclub, which closed in 2010, had been raised with officials days before the blaze. Newport Conservatives said they emailed the local council on 7 June calling for the former Zanzibar and Heights 2000 club to be inspected due to ""fear this could collapse or end up going up in flames."" Newport council has been asked to comment. Church members will meet to pray in Stow Hill car park at 10:30 on Sunday The local authority carried out an ""enforcement inspection"", but the local Tory group want an investigation into why the council did not carry out a ""full site inspection"" - as they claim officers did not enter the building. Newport Conservative activist Michael Enea said he emailed the council after worried residents contacted him. They came following an online video showing people walking around the derelict building, which was full of debris and loose wires. ""There were quite a few concerns about the state of the building,"" he added. ""The roof had totally collapsed and caved in, the building was totally derelict."" Allow Twitter content?

Pastor Andrew Cleverly described the church as a ""beautiful old building"" About 40 people were initially evacuated to the Newport Centre, a leisure centre in the heart of the city. Newport council said the majority of residents will be able to return to their homes by Saturday evening. However, people living in two properties next to the church will stay in temporary accommodation for another night. Fire officers, along with Gwent Police and Newport council, are now preparing to launch a joint investigation  into the cause of the blaze.

Review: Frida Kahlo - Making Her Self Up âââââ,"If you're anything like me, I bet I know what you do with those few fleeting moments of spare time you have (between watching episodes of Love Island or World Cup matches). You reach deep into your bookcase and pull out your much-thumbed 1990 edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art & Artists. Because why wouldn't you? It's a terrific read, packed with expertly abridged biographies of Old Masters and pithy explanations for arcane techniques like encaustic painting (a favourite of Jasper Johns). No wonder we keep going back to it. But, like all things, it is not faultless. There is one surprising and glaring omission. Open it up at page 239, look under K, and you will discover there is no entry for Frida Kahlo beyond the words: ""see RIVERA, DIEGO"". Frida Kahlo with her husband, Diego Rivera, circa 1945 Rivera, who was Kahlo's husband, is afforded a lengthy entry in which he is described as a""â¦most celebrated figure"" and ""leading artist"", who made art ""glorifying the history and people of the country [Mexico]â¦"". It is not until you reach the bits-and-pieces information right at the end that we learn, ""He had numerous love affairs and was three times married, his second wife being a painter, Frida Kahlo (1907-54)."" Not ""the"" painter, or ""fellow artist"", but simply a glib dismissal as ""painter"". Given Kahlo's current status as one of the most famous and revered artists of the 20th Century, it seems like the most extraordinary oversight. And so it is, but it is also instructive. We learn at least three things about the art establishment from the omission: The tendency by (predominately male) art historians to erase female artists from the accepted canon. Frida Kahlo has only relatively recently been anointed by establishment curators in Europe. The art world's limitless talent for post-hoc myth making. The idea that any reputable art history directory would omit Frida Kahlo today is laughable. Indeed, the current edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art & Artists boasts a reasonably lengthy entry under her name. But, once again, it is revealing. The Rivera entry begins with his art credentials: ""Mexican painter, the most celebrated figure inâ¦fresco painting that is Mexico's most distinctive contribution to modern art."" Whereas Kahlo's entry begins: ""Mexican painter. In 1929, when she was still at school, she suffered appalling injuries in a traffic accident, leaving her a permanent semi-invalid, often in severe pain."" It is her personal story, the bolstering of her myth that is deemed the most important thing to say about her, not the nature or style of the paintings she produced, which is surely the reason for the entry in the first place. Self-Portrait as a Tehuana, 1943 So, here we are, more than 60 years after her death aged 47, totally fixated by the cult of Kahlo: a packaged personality that all but obscures what we should really care about, which is her work. The exhibition at the V&A is a typical case in point. To their credit, the curators are not trying to hide the fact that they are selling a show based on the artist's iconic image rather than her paintings, by giving it the title: Frida Kahlo, Making Herself Up. To be honest, my heart sank when I was told the premise of the show was to look at how she constructed her personality and why. Here we go again, yet more myth making. Couldn't we examine how she made her work and why instead? Wouldn't that be more interesting? But as I walked around the show, the vast majority of which is made up of objects that were locked away in the bathroom of her house in Mexico for half a century (more myth making), it became increasingly apparent that in Kahlo's case there is no separation between art and artist: they are one and the same. Frida Kahlo endured multiple operations, and had to wear orthopaedic corsets, including this one made of plaster, which she painted and decorated It turns out the show isn't a hackneyed hagiography at all, but a revelation. From the early family photograph in which an androgynous-looking Frida is wearing a three-piece suit, to the image of her sitting on a Manhattan rooftop dressed in her spectacular Mexican clothes and smoking a cigarette, it becomes crystal clear that from her late teens onwards, Frida Kahlo was essentially a performance artist. Frida on the roof-deck in New York, 1946 The image we have of her, the public image she developed (even when pictured in ""private""), the Frida on show here, is as much an artwork by her as one of her paintings. The traditional Mexican clothes she wore, the indigenous jewellery she collected, the photographs for which she posed, the monobrow, the moustache, her attitude: every detail was meticulously considered and curated by the artist to communicate to us her ideas, ideals, and feelings. Self-portrait with Necklace, 1933 There is clearly also a performative aspect to her paintings; in so much as she is usually the main protagonist acting out the picture's narrative. The sense of her using her body as a canvas is most explicit in the way she decorated the plaster corsets and prosthetic leg on display in a gallery full of her medicines and medical equipment. One of the most intricate objects in the collection is Frida Kahlo's prosthetic leg with leather boot, and silk appliquÃ© with embroidered Chinese motifs, 1953 And so the more this exhibition seeks to unmask the 'real' Frida the further she disappears behind her defiant faÃ§ade. By the time you emerge from the theatrical last room of dresses and shoes, you know for sure that you have absolutely no idea who the real Frida Kahlo was. You only know what she wanted to show: what pain looks like, what Mexico looks like, what gender looks like; what love looks like. It is her agenda, not ours. We can mythologise her all we like, but to do so is to miss the point. As this exhibition makes abundantly clear, maybe not entirely intentionally, Frida Kahlo only ever revealed one thing to us: art - in all her guises.

"US separates 2,000 children in six weeksFigures show the scale of family separations under a crackdown on illegal immigrants at the Mexico border.US & Canada","Children separated from their parents at the border are classed as unaccompanied minors Almost 2,000 migrant children were separated from their families at the US border over six weeks, officials say. Following a Trump administration crackdown on illegal border crossings from Mexico, adults are being detained, meaning the children with them are removed from their care. The issue is causing a growing political storm in the US. On Thursday Attorney GeneralJeff Sessions cited the Bible to defend the ""zero tolerance"" approach. Why the US is separating migrant children from their parents Immigration 'an existential threat' to US Is US only country to separate migrant children? It means that those entering the US irregularly are criminally prosecuted, a change to a long-standing policy of charging most of those crossing for the first time with a misdemeanour offence. As the adults are being charged with a crime and detained, the children that travel with them are being separated and classed as unaccompanied minors. Figures from the US Department of Homeland Security show that 1,995 children were separated from 1,940 adults who are being held between 19 April and 31 May. No information was given on the age of the separated children. The children are passed into the care of the US Department of Health and Human Services. They are transferred to government detention facilities or foster care while officials try to resolve their case. The United Nations has called on the US to immediately halt the separations. Mr Sessions said having children would not shield border-crossing migrants from prosecution. The attorney general quoted a verse from St Paul's Letter to the Romans on obeying the laws of government. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart store in Texas Critics say that verse was once used to justify slavery. The Trump administration policy is supported by some Republicans, but others have expressed misgivings. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Congress' highest-ranking Republican, said he was not comfortable with the tactics. This week, House Republicans pitched draft immigration legislation that would end the separation of children and parents at the border. Under the plan, families would be detained together. Also in the proposal are provisions to protect 1.8 millionDaca 'Dreamers', eliminatethe diversity lottery, and add $25bn (Â£18bn) for border security. The bill, a compromise between moderates and conservatives, is expected to be voted on next week. So will another, more hard line bill. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would not sign the compromise bill, despite Republican lawmakers having said he supported it. His remark sent legislators on Capitol Hill scrambling, but the White House later said the president had misspoken and he would back both measures. The administration says it has selected a site in Texas to house the migrant children in tents. The issue has led to protests in the US and criticism from the UN Why is the US separating families?

May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block,"Theresa May says she is ""disappointed"" an attempt to make upskirting a criminal offence in England and Wales did not progress through Parliament after one of her own MPs blocked it. Conservatives have criticised Sir Christopher Chope for objecting to the private member's bill. If passed, it could see someone who has secretly taken a photo under a victim's skirt face up to two years in prison. The PM said she wanted to see it pass soon ""with government support"". Minister for Women, Victoria Atkins, said the government will allocate time for the bill in Parliament to ensure it does not get pushed down the list of private members' bills, which would mean it could some time to return to the Commons. Ministers are among those criticising Sir Christopher's intervention, withJustice Secretary David Gauke also tweeting,externalhis disappointment with the lack of progress as the law ""needs to be reformed"". But his backbench colleagues have gone further - Tory MP Nick Boles tweeted that Sir Christopher was a politician ""whose knuckles dragged along the ground"". Allow Twitter content?

Sir Christopher has yet to speak out about why he blocked the bill butupskirting victim Gina Martin- who started the campaign for the new law - said he had told her he objected to it ""on principle"" because it ""wasn't debated"". She also told the BBC that he said he ""wasn't really sure"" what upskirting was. ""I said, 'well, I can help you with that',"" Ms Martin added. The bill was expected to sail through the Commons on Friday, but parliamentary rules mean it only required one MP to shout ""object"" to block its progress. Sir Christopher's intervention was met with shouts of ""shame"" from other MPs. Ms Martin started the campaign after two men took a picture up her skirt but weren't prosecuted for it International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt tweeted that many will be ""disappointed"", but that the hard work of campaigners and MPs to get the bill through Parliament ""will not be in vain"". Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said individuals ""can delay, but not prevent"" the bill from becoming law. Other Tory MPs stronger with their criticisms included George Freeman, who used to lead Theresa May's policy unit. He said the move was ""an affront to parliamentary democracy"", while Cheltenham MP Alex Chalk said Sir Christopher had ""let us all down"". Scottish Conservative MP Paul Masterton said the intervention did ""damage"" to the public's view of the party. And Conservative MP and chair of the Commons Foreign Select Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said it was ""shaming"" for his party. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Tugendhat told BBC News: ""It's really objectionable that Christopher should have done this without even knowing what the bill was. ""I think it's disgraceful to block a law that is designed to protect people from having their most intimate selves intruded upon. It's completely unacceptable."" This video can not be played Hear MPs shout ""shame"" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill Tory MP and chair of the Commons Justice Select Committee, Bob Neill, has written to the prime minister to ask for the bill to be allowed its second reading, criticising the ""arcane parliamentary procedure"" that stopped it. Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, who brought the private member's bill to Parliament, also  criticised the ""out-of-touch Tory"" for ""sabotaging"" it. Ms Hobhouse has asked for her bill to return to the House on 6 July. This video can not be played Wera Hobhouse 'angry' after Tory MP blocks upskirting law Justice minister Lucy Frazer said the government was ""committed to making sure upskirting becomes a criminal offence and have every expectation that this will happen"". By Mark D'Arcy, BBC parliamentary correspondent Sir Christopher shouted ""object"" to the bill, stopping it from progressing through the Commons Sir Christopher is a leading member of a group of backbench Conservatives who make a practice of ensuring that what they see as well-meaning but flabby legislation is not lazily plopped on to the statute book by a few MPs on a poorly attended Friday sitting. And after all this is a bill to create a new criminal offence, for which people can go to jail. So, however worthy the cause, he insists on proper, extensive scrutiny, and he has spent most Commons Fridays for the last 20 years doing just that. Indeed, a few minutes before he blocked the upskirting bill, he forced a delay toSeni's Law, which also had strong support from the government. He also opposedplans to give police dogs and horses extra legal protections from attack. The upskirting bill is not dead - there will be other opportunities to get it passed - but they will only succeed if Sir Christopher and his allies can be persuaded not to object again. The only other alternative is for the government to provide debating time for it, or, far more likely, to add the proposals to a bill of their own. Labour MPs have also expressed their anger at the move by Sir Christopher. 'Upskirting': It happened to me Live Nation exec filmed up women's skirts Speaker calls for private members' bills rethink Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities, said: ""It's absolutely disgusting that a male Tory MP has blocked upskirting from becoming a criminal offence. ""If Theresa May is serious about tackling this vile practice, and injustices like sexism, she will need to show leadership and show there's no place in the Tory party for Christopher Chope."" This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting Ms Martin said she remained ""positive and hopeful"" about the bill and had arranged a meeting to discuss it further with Sir Christopher. She started the campaign to change the lawafter two men took a picture up her skirt while she was at a concert in London's Hyde Park last July. Police said they were unable to prosecute as the picture was not graphic enough because she was wearing underwear. What is the current law? There is no law specifically naming and banning upskirting in England and Wales, victims and police are currently only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism Upskirting has been an offence in Scotland since 2010 when it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism What are the limitations of the current situation in England and Wales? Voyeurism only applies to filming actions taking place in private Outraging public decency usually requires someone to have witnessed the action but upskirting is often unobserved Unlike other sexual offences, people don't have automatic right to anonymity What does the new law propose? As well as carrying a maximum two-year sentence, it would also allow, in the most serious cases, those convicted to be placed on the sex offenders register Law to make upskirting illegal considered Call to make 'upskirting' an offence I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back Speaker calls for private members' bills rethink Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

It is not until you reach the bits-and-pieces information right at the end that we learn, ""He had numerous love affairs and was three times married, his second wife being a painter, Frida Kahlo (1907-54)."" Not ""the"" painter, or ""fellow artist"", but simply a glib dismissal as ""painter"". Given Kahlo's current status as one of the most famous and revered artists of the 20th Century, it seems like the most extraordinary oversight. And so it is, but it is also instructive. We learn at least three things about the art establishment from the omission: The tendency by (predominately male) art historians to erase female artists from the accepted canon. Frida Kahlo has only relatively recently been anointed by establishment curators in Europe. The art world's limitless talent for post-hoc myth making. The idea that any reputable art history directory would omit Frida Kahlo today is laughable. Indeed, the current edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art & Artists boasts a reasonably lengthy entry under her name. But, once again, it is revealing. The Rivera entry begins with his art credentials: ""Mexican painter, the most celebrated figure inâ¦fresco painting that is Mexico's most distinctive contribution to modern art."" Whereas Kahlo's entry begins: ""Mexican painter. In 1929, when she was still at school, she suffered appalling injuries in a traffic accident, leaving her a permanent semi-invalid, often in severe pain."" It is her personal story, the bolstering of her myth that is deemed the most important thing to say about her, not the nature or style of the paintings she produced, which is surely the reason for the entry in the first place. Self-Portrait as a Tehuana, 1943 So, here we are, more than 60 years after her death aged 47, totally fixated by the cult of Kahlo: a packaged personality that all but obscures what we should really care about, which is her work. The exhibition at the V&A is a typical case in point. To their credit, the curators are not trying to hide the fact that they are selling a show based on the artist's iconic image rather than her paintings, by giving it the title: Frida Kahlo, Making Herself Up. To be honest, my heart sank when I was told the premise of the show was to look at how she constructed her personality and why. Here we go again, yet more myth making. Couldn't we examine how she made her work and why instead? Wouldn't that be more interesting? But as I walked around the show, the vast majority of which is made up of objects that were locked away in the bathroom of her house in Mexico for half a century (more myth making), it became increasingly apparent that in Kahlo's case there is no separation between art and artist: they are one and the same. Frida Kahlo endured multiple operations, and had to wear orthopaedic corsets, including this one made of plaster, which she painted and decorated It turns out the show isn't a hackneyed hagiography at all, but a revelation. From the early family photograph in which an androgynous-looking Frida is wearing a three-piece suit, to the image of her sitting on a Manhattan rooftop dressed in her spectacular Mexican clothes and smoking a cigarette, it becomes crystal clear that from her late teens onwards, Frida Kahlo was essentially a performance artist. Frida on the roof-deck in New York, 1946 The image we have of her, the public image she developed (even when pictured in ""private""), the Frida on show here, is as much an artwork by her as one of her paintings. The traditional Mexican clothes she wore, the indigenous jewellery she collected, the photographs for which she posed, the monobrow, the moustache, her attitude: every detail was meticulously considered and curated by the artist to communicate to us her ideas, ideals, and feelings. Self-portrait with Necklace, 1933 There is clearly also a performative aspect to her paintings; in so much as she is usually the main protagonist acting out the picture's narrative. The sense of her using her body as a canvas is most explicit in the way she decorated the plaster corsets and prosthetic leg on display in a gallery full of her medicines and medical equipment. One of the most intricate objects in the collection is Frida Kahlo's prosthetic leg with leather boot, and silk appliquÃ© with embroidered Chinese motifs, 1953 And so the more this exhibition seeks to unmask the 'real' Frida the further she disappears behind her defiant faÃ§ade. By the time you emerge from the theatrical last room of dresses and shoes, you know for sure that you have absolutely no idea who the real Frida Kahlo was. You only know what she wanted to show: what pain looks like, what Mexico looks like, what gender looks like; what love looks like. It is her agenda, not ours. We can mythologise her all we like, but to do so is to miss the point. As this exhibition makes abundantly clear, maybe not entirely intentionally, Frida Kahlo only ever revealed one thing to us: art - in all her guises.

"Review: Frida Kahlo - Making Her Self Up âââââ""The more this exhibition seeks to unmask the 'real' Frida the further she disappears behind her defiant faÃ§ade.""","If you're anything like me, I bet I know what you do with those few fleeting moments of spare time you have (between watching episodes of Love Island or World Cup matches). You reach deep into your bookcase and pull out your much-thumbed 1990 edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art & Artists. Because why wouldn't you? It's a terrific read, packed with expertly abridged biographies of Old Masters and pithy explanations for arcane techniques like encaustic painting (a favourite of Jasper Johns). No wonder we keep going back to it. But, like all things, it is not faultless. There is one surprising and glaring omission. Open it up at page 239, look under K, and you will discover there is no entry for Frida Kahlo beyond the words: ""see RIVERA, DIEGO"".

Restoring a masterpiece library,"The Glasgow School of Art full size prototype of a section of the Mackintosh Library returning it to the original 1910 design The Mackintosh library at Glasgow School of Art, one of the world's finest examples of art nouveau design, was almost entirely destroyed by fire in May 2014 but efforts began almost immediately to bring it back to life. The Category A-listed Glasgow School of Art (GSA), considered to be Charles Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece building, was devastated when a fire engulfed its west wing three years ago. The original Mackintosh library (pictured before the fire) was much darker than the new prototype The library in the Mackintosh building was gutted in the blaze on 23 May 2014 The library, which housed original furniture and fittings designed by Mackintosh as well as valuable archives, was reduced to blackened rubble. But those running the famous art school pledged the library would be recreated exactly as the genius architect and designer had handed it over in 1910. Angus Johnston, a master craftsman from Laurence McIntosh, cleans full-size prototype Professor Tom Inns, director of The GSA, said: ""From the outset we said that we would restore the building and restore it well."" In order to do that they have gone to great lengths to recreate every detail of the original library. They have now produced a full-size prototype of a section of the library. Every detail of the original design has been recreated It is just one section and is about one-twelfth of the actual size of the library but its makers says it is correct in every detail. Natalia Burakowska, of Page Park architects, is an expert in the restoration of cultural heritage. She has carried two years of painstaking research to prepare the ground for the prototype. The prototype uses American Tulip wood, the same as the original ""We spent endless amounts of hours in the building measuring the burnt bits,"" she says. ""This has been really important to us because even if you have amazing technology in place it is still the personal contact with the remains of the library that has been an amazing, valuable and important experience for us."" Natalia Burakowska has spent two years painstakingly recreating the design Ms Burakowska also studied the original Mackintosh plans and the enormous GSA archive, as well as photos from students and graduates. She says the details are faithful to Mackintosh's original library right down to using the same nails as him. They were originally made in Glasgow but that firm closed down and sold the machinery to the United States. Craftsmen have been employed to recreate the intricate details of the original design So the nails have been brought from the US. ""A lot of people ask us why would you not just screw all of the timbers together?"" Ms Burakowska says. ""What is important is for this room to age in exactly the same manner as it would age from 1910 onwards. That is really important."" Prof Tom Inns says it is a moving reminder of the original library Specialist woodworkers Laurence McIntosh were responsible for building the prototype. Managing director David Macdonald said using the same nails as the original added to the ""authenticity"" of the recreation. He said: ""Every section has been detailed to show precisely the angle of the nails, how far the nail head is punched in, how it is filled, the exact length of the nail, so it is really important how the structure is held together. ""There is no glue. There are very few screws used in the construction. It is all nails that are holding it together and traditional hand-made dowels. It's all completely authentic."" Master craftsmen Angus Johnson and Martins Cirulis in a full-size model of a section of the fire-gutted Mackintosh Library Mr Macdonald said it was very unusual to make a full size prototype but it had helped identify the pitfalls before the library is recreated for real on-site at the famous Glasgow School of Art building next year. He said: ""The critical brief was to reconstruct the library as it was handed over in 1910. ""So everything has to match precisely what was done by the Mackintosh tradesmen, in every aspect from the timber used, the fixings, the nails, the finish, the carvings and the paint effects on the spindles. It has all had to be precisely replicated."" Although the library prototype has been created with great care and accuracy, comparison between it and pictures of the Mackintosh before it burnt down reveal they are completely different colours. Ms Burakowska says this is because the wood in the library aged and became darker as it was used over 100 years. ""It is much lighter than everyone remembers but this is how Mackintosh would see it in 1910,"" she says. ""It is a reconstruction of the original Mackintosh library so it feels new and there is no way we can change that."" There was some debate about the kind of wood that was used by Mackintosh in the library. Ms Burakowska says: ""Our first thought was that it would probably be built using Kauri Pine then we found some documents in our archives saying the library could be built in Cypress. ""But then scientific analysis of the timber proved that it is actually Tulip wood. ""It is one of the softest hard woods and had been imported from the United States."" She says she hopes it gains a new layer of patina through use, making it darker in the same way as the old library. The Board Room of the GSA was also built in American Tulip Wood and it has provided a ""great example of the kind of finish used in the library"". Prof Tom Inns says the creation of the prototype is an ""incredibly important day for Glasgow School of Art"". He said it was a ""moving"" reminder of what the library was like before the devastating fire. The GSA hope to begin installing the library on-site next spring. As for the prototype - they hope it can go on public display - to show the craft and effort required to bring a masterwork back to life.
