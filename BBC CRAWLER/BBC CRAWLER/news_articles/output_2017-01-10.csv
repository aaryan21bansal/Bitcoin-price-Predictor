Obituary: Clare Hollingworth,"Clare Hollingworth was the war correspondent who broke the news that German troops were poised to invade Poland at the start of World War Two. She went on to report on conflicts across the world but it was that moment that defined her career. She was by no means the first female war reporter, but her depth of technical, tactical and strategic insight set her apart. And, even as she approached her 11th decade, she still kept her passport by her bed in case she should be called to another assignment. Clare Hollingworth was born in Leicester on 10 October 1911 and spent most of her childhood on a farm. What should have been idyllic years were overshadowed by World War One. ""I remember the German bombers flying over the farm we lived in to bomb Loughborough,"" she reminisced. ""And the next day we got Polly the pony and took the trap into Loughborough to see the damage they had done. "" She had set her heart on a writing career early on, much to the exasperation of her mother. British authorities did not believe the German army had entered Poland ""She didn't believe anything journalists wrote and thought they were only fit for the tradesmen's entrance."" After school she attended a domestic science college in Leicester, which instilled in her a lifelong hatred of housework. More interesting to her by far were the battlefield tours that her father arranged to sites as diverse as Naseby, Poitiers and Agincourt. Eschewing the prospect of life as a country squire's wife, Hollingworth became a secretary at the League of Nations Union before studying at London University's School of Slavonic Studies and the University of Zagreb. In 1936 she married a fellow League of Nations worker, Vandeleur Robinson, but soon found herself in Warsaw, distributing aid to refugees who had fled from the Sudetenland, the Czech territory occupied by the Nazis in 1938. She had written the occasional article for the New Statesman and, on a brief visit to London in August 1939, she was signed up by the editor of the Daily Telegraph, Arthur Wilson, who was impressed by her experience in Poland. In this period of heightened tension, the border between Poland and Germany was sealed to all but diplomatic vehicles. After borrowing a car from the British consul in Katowice and proudly displaying the union jack, she drove through the exclusion zone and into Germany. She had a deep knowledge of military strategy While driving back to Poland, having bought wine, torches and as much film as possible, she passed through a valley in which huge hessian screens had been erected. As the wind blew one of the screens back, it revealed thousands of troops, together with tanks and artillery, all facing the Polish border. Her report featured on the front page of the Daily Telegraph on 29 August, 1939. Less than a week after becoming a full-time journalist, she had scooped one of the biggest stories of the 20th Century. Three days later, Hollingworth saw the German tanks rolling into Poland. But when she phoned the secretary at the British Embassy in Warsaw, he told her it could not be true as negotiations between Britain and Germany were still continuing. ""So I hung the telephone receiver out of the window,"" Hollingworth later recalled, ""So he could listen to the Germans invading."" Working on her own, often behind enemy lines, with nothing more than a toothbrush and a typewriter, she witnessed the collapse of Poland before moving to Bucharest, where she realised that her marriage was over. ""I thought that for me - and in a different kind of way for him - my career was more important than trying to rush back home,"" she reflected later. Her story about the spy Kim Philby was blocked by The Guardian Hollingworth spent a busy war in Turkey, Greece and Cairo. When Montgomery - who could not stomach the idea of a woman reporting from the front - captured Tripoli in 1943, he ordered her to return to Cairo. She decided to attach herself to Eisenhower's forces, then in Algiers. Though diminutive and bespectacled, Hollingworth was as tough as nails. She learned how to fly and made a number of parachute jumps. During the latter part of the war, she reported from Palestine, Iraq and Persia, where she interviewed the young Shah. After the war, Hollingworth, by now working for the Observer and the Economist, married Geoffrey Hoare, the Times's Middle East correspondent. The couple were just 300 yards from Jerusalem's King David Hotel when it was bombed in 1946, killing 91 people. The attack left her with a hatred of the man behind the attack, the Irgun leader Menachem Begin, who eventually became prime minister of Israel and won the Nobel Peace Prize. ""I would not shake a hand with so much blood on it,"" she explained. She celebrated her 100th birthday in her adopted home of Hong Kong In 1963 Hollingworth was working for the Guardian in Beirut when Kim Philby, a correspondent for the Observer, disappeared. She was convinced that he was the fabled ""third man"" in a British spy ring that already included Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. After some detective work, she discovered that Philby had left on a Soviet ship bound for Odessa and filed copy to that effect with the Guardian. But this second huge scoop was spiked by the paper's editor, Alastair Hetherington, who feared a libel suit. Three months later, the Guardian ran the story, tucked away on an inside page. The following day the Daily Express splashed it on the front page, prompting the government to admit that Philby had, indeed, defected to the Soviet Union. Hollingworth reported on the Algerian crisis and the Vietnam War. She was one of the first journalists to predict that American military muscle would not prevail and that a stalemate was inevitable. She made a special effort to speak to Vietnamese civilians, away from the watching eyes of the US PR people, to ensure she accurately captured the views of those who were suffering the most. Hoare died in 1966, and Hollingworth, who had become the Telegraph's first Beijing correspondent in 1973, retired to Hong Kong in 1981. She spent her final years in the former colony and was a daily fixture at the Foreign Correspondents' Club, venerated by her colleagues. Although she lost her sight later in life, Clare Hollingworth, a true journalist's journalist, retained an acute interest in world affairs right to the end. She was once asked where she would want to go if the phone rang with a new assignment. ""I would look through the papers,"" she said, ""And say, 'Where's the most dangerous place to go?', because it always makes a good story.""

Cash car,"""Betty"" the 1999 Paul Smith Mini Cooper adds some fun to private car hire Betty, a resplendent royal blue 1999 Paul Smith Mini Cooper, has just arrived downstairs. Handing over the keys is a tweed-wearing, bearded Tony Grant, who owns 10 such Minis with names like Poppy, Mildred and Lulu. Self-styled ""Head Gasket"" at Small Car Big City, he is adding a new twist to the car hire and car-sharing business. As part of the fun, there are fancy dress outfits in the boot to matchThe Italian Job film,externaltheme, along with a crowbar and a bar of (imitation) gold. I booked Betty through recently launched car-sharing app Turo, which is aiming to bring an Airbnb vibe to the world of wheels. While car-sharing firms, such as ZipCar which owns its own fleet, have been around for more than a decade, so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) car sharing - private owners renting out their cars - hasn't really taken off. And yet, given that we use our cars just 5% of the time, as Andre Haddad, Turo's chief executive tells me, the business potential remains. Small Car Big City founder Tony Grant and one of his beloved Minis This is why Turo, and a handful of other recent start-ups like easyCar, Getaround, and Rentecarlo, are hoping to unlock all this unused capacity sitting idle in the street. ""ZipCar's fleets at their maximum reached 15,000 vehicles, so they were not able to reach massive scale,"" says Mr Haddad. ""They obviously built a very successful company, but globally, hourly car sharing reached, at its peak, less than 1% of the entire car rental market space,"" he adds. For Turo, the minimum rental is a day, he says, and their average is four days. Other firms, like Getaround, which has a presence in 10 US cities, focus more on hourly rentals. Car enthusiast and Turo boss Andre Haddad owns a Porsche 911 Mr Haddad, who describes himself as a car enthusiast, says Turo gives people the opportunity to try out interesting cars, from cute Minis to rugged off-roaders. ""It would be really fun to go out in a Jeep Wrangler if you're going up a mountain, but it doesn't really justify owning one,"" he says. One practical challenge of P2P rental is getting the key to the customer if the car's owner isn't around. Richard Laughton, chief executive of easyCar Club, which launched in 2014, says: ""We provide owners with lockboxes they can attach somewhere outside their house, and send a one-use pin to the renter to take the key out, and put it back at the end."" Next year easyCar Club will try out unlocking cars by mobile app, he says. EasyCar Club owners and renters are vetted by the company Another challenge is overcoming the trust issue. After all, would you rent out your precious motor to a total stranger? ""I think one thing that will continually hold back the P2P model is the reluctance of people to put an asset on a shared platform,"" says Adam Stocker, a researcher at Berkeley University Transportation Sustainability Research Center in California. ""The fear that their vehicle gets trashed, misused, or breaks faster - but this is just human nature."" One early US car-sharing start-up, HiGear, shut down in 2012 following the theft of several members' cars. So most P2P companies engage in detailed vetting of new members, and incorporate feedback and user ratings. Turo says it has developed machine learning tools to help with the screening process. EasyCar believes telematics boxes could help track how renters have used - or abused - the car and act as a sort of onboard policeman. EasyCar Club boss Richard Laughton does not own a car And what if the renter crashes or damages your car? ""Insurance has been a really big challenge,"" admits Jacob Nielsen, co-founder of Rentecarlo, a P2P car-sharing firm founded by ""three guys from Denmark"" two-and-a-half years ago. Admiral Insurance has worked with several P2P start-ups to develop a suitable product, says Mr Nielsen. The insurer even allows renters to earn up to five years' no-claims bonus while driving someone else's car, providing they drive more than 30 days in a year, he says. Such innovations and technological improvements have enabled easyCar to ""double bookings year-on-year"", says Mr Laughton. Other P2P car-sharing firms seem to be enjoying similar rates of growth, as younger people in particular embrace the concept of ""mobility as a service"" and eschew ownership. So what does this mean forcar manufacturers' traditional business models,external? ""I would say 2016 definitely was the year the major auto manufacturers woke up to the shared mobility space,"" says Mr Stocker. Mercedes' P2P car-sharing service Croove lets private owners rent out their cars For example, Mercedes-Benz recently launched a car-sharing app called Croove. In September, Ford bought Chariot, a San Francisco-based crowd-sourced shuttle service, and is even investing in a bike-sharing start-up called Motivate. Manufacturers clearly understand that personal car ownership is becoming old hat. General Motors tried to buy Uber rival Lyft this summer, but was rebuffed, despite both companies joining forces to develop driverless taxis. Car sharing may worry public authorities less than house sharing. Property-sharing giant Airbnb has recently come under fire from city authorities - in Amsterdam, for instance - over concerns that it increases city centre congestion and enables guests to avoid paying hotel tax. But car-sharing companies like Turo and others could help decrease the overall number of cars on the road to start with as fewer people see the need to own their own vehicle. But once driverless cars come in, authorities might worry they pose threat to public transport systems, some analysts believe. ""It would be very inexpensive to run electric driverless Uber taxis that go around cities and provide transport in a fluid way,"" says Philippe Houchois, an automotive sector analyst at equity research company Jefferies. ""If you get to a point where your cost-per-mile is less than Â£1,"" says Mr Houchois, ""public transport would seem less attractive."" Paradoxically, we could then see a rise in car numbers on our roads, not a reduction.

The front line,"Teachers are often the first to notice changes in the wellbeing of their pupils, say heads Schools have long been are at the front line when it comes to identifying and helping children with mental heath problems. But some heads wonder how much longer they can continue to provide in-school counselling and mentoring as budgets flatline and costs rise. At Whalley Range High School in inner-city Manchester, students' mental wellbeing is a priority. ""There is a lot of stress,"" executive head teacher, Patsy Kane, told the BBC. There is a waiting list for the school's counselling service, funded from its general budget, and two specially trained support staff run a child protection service. Teaching staff were ""vigilant"", keeping an eye out for pupils showing raised levels of stress and anger, said Ms Kane. Each year group at the 1,500 strong girls' secondary has its own pastoral manager whose duties include ongoing assessment of pupils' mental health. There is also a school nurse and a school counsellor available four or five days each week, all paid for from the school's overall budget. The academy trust that runs Whalley Range also includes Levenshulme High School for girls and East Manchester Academy, which is mixed. They serve some of the most deprived and culturally diverse wards in the city and all have a strong focus on pupils' mental health. The real difficulties come when pupils' problems go beyond the capacity of the professionals in the school, according to Ms Kane. ""Local services are just overwhelmed,"" she said. ""These are very challenging times."" Ms Kane said the schools often had to advise parents to take children with suicidal thoughts straight to accident and emergency ""as this can be the only way to get support quickly"". And one pupil ""in extreme need"" had been sent to a hospital in the north-east of England ""hundreds of miles away as there was not a single adolescent mental health bed available in this region"". ""If there isn't a bed, a child's life could be at risk,"" she said But being treated so far from home was even more disorientating for distressed teenagers. Whalley Range High School - where pupils' mental wellbeing is a priority Demand for in-school counselling was growing and pupils were offered the service ""for as long as they need it,"" said Ms Kane. But changes to the way school budgets were calculated in England meant that many inner city schools, including in Manchester, faced cuts. ""I don't know how much longer we are going to be able to protect counselling,"" she said. Under government plans, announced on Monday, all secondary schools will be offeredmental-health first-aid,externaltraining. The plans also include a pledge that by 2021 no child will be sent away from their local area for treatment. But with budget pressure on existing services already apparent, head teachers' leaders are anxious to know how the plans will be funded. ""This is a highly complex area,"" said Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents secondary heads. ""Many schools already provide their own support on site, and do a very good job despite limited resources, but they often face serious difficulties in referring young people to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. ""There is simply not enough provision - and families face excessively long waiting times,"" said Mr Trobe. According to the National Association of Head Teachers, about three-quarters of schools already lack the funds to provide good enough mental health care for pupils. ""Rising demand, growing complexity and tight budgets are getting in the way of helping the children who need it most,"" said NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby. ""Moves to make schools more accountable for the mental health of their pupils must first be accompanied by sufficient school funding and training for staff and should focus only on those areas where schools can act, including promotion of good mental health, identification and signposting or referrals to the appropriate services,"" he added. For Ms Kane, the emphasis is on making the schools she runs ""safe and welcoming places"". Counselling and other forms of psychological support were more important than ever as changes to the exam system ""are creating more stress"", she said. ""There is a lot of memorising required and less course work."" The school holds assemblies for candidates, on how to revise and relax, and mindfulness training. And there are lessons in small groups for some of the more vulnerable pupils. There is also an emphasis on sport, and the school encourages volunteering. ""You feel better if you help someone else,"" said Ms Kane. ""We want students to learn strategies for life.  It's not just about protecting them.""

Gasman to Starman,"A Twitter mention of the Thin White Duke made some see red AsDavid Bowiefans around the world marked the anniversary of the star's death, one particular tribute sparked controversy like no other. It came not from Bowie's widow Iman, nor from one of his many famous collaborators such as Iggy Pop or Brian Eno. No, the unlikely source was Paul - surname unknown - who works on the British Gas Help Twitter account. On Tuesday, when Paul tweeted to let everyone know he was on shift and ready to help with customer queries about dodgy boilers and other gas-related matters, he also mentioned an unrelated subject that was on many people's minds: While much of the reaction was positive, others who saw the tweet were enraged at what they saw as corporate bandwagon jumping. Others were offended by Paul's use of grammar. And some referenced Bowie lyrics as they mused on whether utility company employees might have better things to do with than to tweet about dead rock stars. Stung by the negative responses, Paul tweeted again to insist that his motives were sincere. Some seemed prepared to accept the sentiment, but felt there was a time and a place - and this wasn't it. However, by now the initial ferocity of the onslaught against Paul had produced a backlash against the backlash. Those who had been charmed rather than alarmed by a corporate account showing some personality took up arms. Writer Jon Ronson was among those who applauded. And there were some tongue-in-cheek expressions of solidarity. A spokesman for British Gas confirmed to BBC Trending that Paul is a real person and that he and and his colleagues working on the help account are encouraged to add personality to their tweets. He added that the company had nothing to add on the content of the tweets.

Healing a nation,"Barack Obama sealed his racial legacy the moment he sealed victory in the 2008 election - a black man would occupy a White House built by slaves, a history-defying as well as history-making achievement. In 1961, the year of Obama's birth, there existed in the American South a system of racial apartheid that separated the races from the cradle to the grave. Whites-only water fountains. Whites-only schools. Whites-only graveyards. In some states, his very conception - involving an African father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas - would have been a criminal offence. Washington, too, remained a largely segregated city. When in the 1950s, a former TV executive by the name of E Frederic Morrow became the first black White House aide not to have a job description that included turning down beds, polishing shoes or serving drinks with a deferential bow, he was prohibited from ever being alone in the same room as a white woman. Back then, as Morrow recounted in his memoir, Black Man in the White House, African-Americans were routinely stereotyped as sexual predators incapable of controlling their desires. Little more than half a century later, a black man ran the White House - occupying the Oval Office, sitting at the head of the conference table in the Situation Room, relaxing with his beautiful young family in the Executive Mansion - a family that has brought such grace and glamour to America's sleepy capital that it is possible to speak of a Black Camelot. President and first lady on the first day of his presidency When Jack and Jackie Kennedy lived in the White House, that would have been unthinkable, even though the civil rights movement was starting to hammer more insistently at the walls of prejudice, and seeking legal and legislative redress for a malignant national condition described as the ""American dilemma"". When demonstrators assembled in August 1963 to hear Martin Luther King deliver his I Have a Dream Speech at the Lincoln Memorial, few would have thought that a black man would one day take the oath of office at the other end of the National Mall. Likewise, how many of the protesters bludgeoned by white policemen on Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 would have dared to imagine that, 50 years later, they would cross that same bridge hand in hand with the country's first black president? Obama and civil rights hero John Lewis lead Selma walk, 50 years on For veterans of the black struggle, those remarkable images of Obama marking the 50th anniversary of the Selma protest became instantly iconographic, a truly golden jubilee. In legacy terms, his very presence in the White House is one of the great intangibles of his presidency. Just how many black Americans have been encouraged to surmount colour bars of their own? Just how many young African-Americans have altered the trajectory of their lives because of the example set by Obama? What marks does Obama's presidency deserve? Michelle Obama: ""Lead by example"" And behaviourally, what an example it has been. Because of the lingering racism in American society, the Obamas doubtless knew they would have to reach a higher standard, and they have done so, seemingly, without breaking a sweat. In deportment and personal conduct, it is hard to recall a more impressive or well-rounded First Family. Eight years, no scandals The ""when they go low, we go high"" approach to racists who questioned his citizenship has made the Obamas look even more classy. His family's dignity in the face of such ugliness recalls the poise of black sit-in protesters in the early 60s, who refused to relinquish their seats at segregated restaurants and lunch counters even as white thugs poured sugar and ketchup over their heads, and punched, kicked and spat at them. Yet racial firsts, of the kind achieved by Barack Hussein Obama, can present a distorted view of history and convey a misleading sense of progress. They are, by their very nature, a singular achievement, a milestone indicative of black advance rather than a destination point. Hollywood did not become colourblind the moment in 1964 that Sidney Poitier became the first black man to win best actor at the Academy Awards any more than discrimination ended in the justice system when Thurgood Marshall first donned the billowing robes of a Supreme Court jurist. Years after Poitier's win, black acting success at the Oscars continued to elude many America's racial problems have not melted away merely because Obama has spent eight years in the White House. Far from it. Indeed, the insurmountable problem for Obama was that he reached the mountaintop on day one of his presidency. Achieving anything on the racial front that surpassed becoming the country's first black president was always going to be daunting. Compounding that problem were the unrealistically high expectations surrounding his presidency. This video can not be played Barack Obama: What would he have done differently? His election triumph is 2008 was also misinterpreted as an act of national atonement for the original sin of slavery and the stain of segregation. Yet Obama did not win the election because he was a black man. It was primarily because a country facing an economic crisis and embroiled in two unpopular wars was crying out for change. Doubtless there have been substantive reforms. His two black attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, have revitalised the work of the justice department's civil rights division, which was dormant during the Bush years. The Affordable Healthcare Act, or Obamacare, as it was inevitably dubbed, cut the black uninsured rate by a third. Partly in a bid to reverse the rate of black incarceration, he has commuted the sentences of hundreds of prisoners - 10 times the number of his five predecessors added together. As well as calling for the closure of private prisons, he became the first president to visit a federal penitentiary. ""There but for the grace of God,"" said a man who had smoked pot and dabbled with cocaine in his youth. Janitor Fred Thomas shows off his Obama subway fare card in Washington in 2009 Early on, he used the bully pulpit of the presidency to assail black absentee fathers, and, more latterly, spoke out against police brutality. But that record of accomplishment looks rather meagre when compared to the drama of hearing ""Hail to the Chief"" accompany the arrival of a black man on the presidential stage. Race relations have arguably become more polarised and tenser since 20 January 2009. Though smaller in scale and scope, the demonstrations sparked by police shootings of unarmed black men were reminiscent of the turbulence of the 1960s. The toxic cloud from the tear gas unleashed in Ferguson and elsewhere cast a long and sometimes overwhelming shadow. Not since the LA riots in 1992 - the violent response to the beating of Rodney King and the later acquittal of the police officers filmed assaulting him - has the sense of black grievance and outrage been so raw. Ferguson unleashed racial tensions in summer 2014 Historians will surely be struck by what looks like an anomaly, that the Obama years gave rise to a movement called Black Lives Matter. Public opinion surveys highlight this racial restlessness. Not long after he took office in 2009, a New York Times/CBS News poll suggested two-thirds of Americans regarded race relations as generally good. In the midst of last summer's racial turbulence, that poll found there had been a complete reversal. Now 69% of Americans assessed race relations to be mostly bad. An oft-heard criticism of Obama is that he has failed to bring his great rhetorical skills to bear on the American dilemma, and prioritised the LGBT community's campaign for equality at the expense of the ongoing black struggle. But while he was happy to cloak himself in the mantle of America's first black president, he did not set out to pursue a black presidency. He did not want his years in office to be defined by his skin colour. The impact of Obama's presence in the White House on a black generation is impossible to calculate As a candidate, he often left others to attach racial meaning to his candidacy, rather than doing so himself. His famed race speech in the 2008 primary campaign, when his friendship with a fiery black preacher threatened to derail his candidacy, was as much about his white heritage as his black. This remained true when he won election. Besides, there were pressing problems to deal with, not least rescuing the American economy in the midst of the Great Recession and extricating US forces from two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Early on in his presidency, his efforts at racial mediation also seemed ham-fisted. The ""beer summit"" at the White House, when he brought together the black Harvard academic Henry Louis Gates and the white police officer who had arrested him on the porch of his own home in an affluent suburb of Boston, all seemed rather facile. A clumsy photo-opportunity rather than a teachable moment. Obama, one sensed, wanted to speak out more forcefully - initially he said the Cambridge police ""acted stupidly"" - but his political cautiousness reined him in. A private moment on the Rosa Parks bus Seemingly, he did not want to come across to the public as a black man in the White House. Rather in those early years, it was as if he was trying to position himself as a neutral arbiter in racial matters, though one sensed his preference was for not intervening at all. As his presidency went on, however, it became more emphatically black. He spoke out more passionately and more intimately. Telling reporters that his son would have looked like Trayvon Martin, the unarmed high school student shot dead in Florida by a neighbourhood watch coordinator, was a departure. This new, more candid approach culminated in Charleston, South Carolina, when Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the black preacher slain, along with eight other worshippers, by a white supremacist at a bible study class at the Emanuel American Methodist Episcopal church. That afternoon he spoke, as he often does in front of mainly black audiences, with a cadence that almost ventriloquised the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, and ended, electrifyingly, by singing Amazing Grace. The acquittal of Martin's killer led to the creation of Black Lives Matter That month he seemed to be at the height of his powers. The Confederate flag, a symbol for many of black subordination, was about to brought down in the grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol because the Charleston gunman Dylann Roof had brandished it so provocatively. Obamacare had withstood a Supreme Court challenge. On the morning that he flew to Charleston, the Supreme Court decreed same-sex marriage would be legal in every state. Progressivism seemed to have triumphed. Obama seemed to have vanquished many of his foes. But that month Donald Trump had also announced his improbable bid for the White House, and the forces of conservatism were starting to rally behind an outspoken new figurehead, who sensed that nativism, xenophobia and fear of the other would be central to his electoral appeal. That America's first black president will be followed by the untitled leader of the Birther movement, a candidate slow to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan and happy to receive the backing of white nationalists, Donald Trump can easily be portrayed as a personal repudiation and also proof of racial regression. This video can not be played Inside the mind of White America The truth, though, is more complicated. Obama is ending his presidency with some of his highest personal approval ratings, and clearly believes he would have beaten Trump in a head-to-head contest. Moreover, although Trump won decisively in the electoral college, almost three million people more voted for Hillary Clinton nationwide. In judging the mood of the country, the 2016 election hardly produced a clear-cut result that lends itself to neat analysis. What Trump's election does look to have done, however, is end Obama's hopes of being a transformative president, not least because of the proposed rollback of his signature healthcare reform. Truly transformative presidents, like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, enact reforms, like social security, that become part of the nation's fabric rather than being ripped apart. If Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress get their way, Obamacare will be shredded. Nor has he been transformative in the attitudinal sense. Indeed, Trump's victory, messy though it was, can easily be viewed partly as a ""whitelash"". Much of his earliest and strongest support came from so-called white nationalists, who saw in his candidacy the chance to reassert white cultural and racial dominance. Some of the loudest cheers at his rallies came in response his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim invectives. This video can not be played Millennials worry about what's in store for the next generation of black Americans Trump's message, from the moment he announced his candidacy to the final tweets of his insurgent campaign, was aimed primarily at white America. The billionaire's victory also makes it harder to view Obama as a transitional president. Eight years ago, it was tempting to cast the country's first black president as the leader who would oversee a peaceable demographic shift from a still strongly Caucasian America - the last census showed that 62.6% of US citizens are white - to a more ethnically diffuse nation. But the talk now is of walls, not human bridges. White and black Americans split on race The people around the president-elect Of course, the notion that Obama would usher in a post-racial America was always fanciful, and a claim wisely he steered clear of himself. For all his cries of ""Yes we can,"" he was never that naÃ¯ve. A young visitor to the Oval Office asks Obama if his hair feels like his, in 2009 But the black writer Ta-Nehisi Coates makes a persuasive case that Obama has always been overly optimistic on race, in large part because he did not have a conventional black upbringing. His formative years were spent in Hawaii, America's most racially integrated state, and the whites he encountered, namely his mother and grandparents, were doting and loving. Obama was not the victim of discrimination in the same way as a black kid growing up in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, or even New York or Illinois. As a result, he may have underestimated the forces that would seek to paralyse his presidency and to impede racial advance more broadly. The president has said repeatedly since election night that the result proves that history is not linear but rather takes a zig-zagging course. Caught in the act, asleep in the White House He is also fond of paraphrasing Martin Luther King's famed line that the arc of history bends towards justice. However, that curvature has veered off in a wholly unexpected direction. Besides, even to talk of arcs of history at this moment of such national uncertainty seems inapt. For as we enter the final days of the Obama presidency, the more accurate descriptor of race relations is a fault-line - the most angry fault-line in US politics and American life, and one that continues to rumble away, threatening small explosions at any time. From Obama we expected seismic change of a more positive kind. And although it was a presidency that began atop a mountain, it ended in something of a valley.

What to do if you have a cold or flu10 January 2017 (22:01:59),"None of us can dodge colds and flu, and there are a wide range of potential treatments that we all turn to. But not all of them will help - and which remedy you should turn to will depend on whether you have a cold or the flu. They share similar symptoms - but they are different beasts. A cold will make you feel rotten. Flu is more severe and sends you to your bed. It's also likely to come with a fever and leave you feeling truly exhausted. So here is what the evidence has shown helps... and what doesn't. Most of us will have heard this old adage. But experts at the Common Cold Centre in Cardiff say there isn't good evidence behind it. The saying may have come about because people with a fever often lose their appetite. The advice is that you should try to eat some healthy food to keep your strength up, but don't feel that you have to force it down if you're not hungry. Listen to your body. Don't push yourself too hard and get some rest. How much you need will depend on how you feel. Certainly, a mild cold shouldn't stop you getting out and about... or going to work! Neither is proven to help, but honey and lemon might be a better option than the whisky, particularly if you plan to have more than one drink. Doctors recommend plenty of fluids - by which they mean water - plus the odd cup of tea or coffee. If you have a cold or the flu you will probably be sneezing, coughing and sweating out more fluid than you normally would, and so need to keep topped up. But don't overdo it. There is plenty of research to show that drinking too much water can be dangerous - and can even kill. Both work. You can even take paracetamol and ibuprofen together to ease your symptoms - it is safe to take both doses at the same time or spaced apart. But do keep tabs on how much you've had so you don't exceed the maximum recommended doses in any 24-hour period. Ibuprofen is best taken with food or on a full stomach. There's no good evidence that they work, but they could offer some temporary relief. Rubbing some on your chest or putting a few drops in a steamy bowl of water can help unblock your nose. Vitamin C has been proposed as a treatment for respiratory infections since the 1930s. It became particularly popular in the 1970s when a Nobel laureate - Linus Pauling - suggested that studies comparing it with a placebo (dummy) treatment showed vitamin C would prevent and alleviate colds. But a recent analysis by theCochrane Group,external, which assesses medical evidence for and against different treatments and therapies, found dosing up doesn't appear to help that much, if at all. Vitamin C is pretty harmless - we pee out any excess amounts that the body can't use. But Zinc can be dangerous if you take too much, so the advice is to take care with the quantity you take. There has been a huge public information campaign to raise awareness of when antibiotics are - and are not - necessary. Antibiotics are no use in treating colds and flu because they are caused by viruses - and antibiotics do not treat viruses. The only time you need to see your GP is if a bacterial infection develops. NHS Choices hasmore information,externalon cold and flu care. We'd like to hear about your tried and trusted remedies -join the debate,externalon Facebook.

How battle for Mosul is gathering pace9 January 2017 (11:49:44),"Iraqi forces have gained ground since launching a ""second phase"" in the operation The announcement by the Iraqi military that its forces havereached the Tigris Riverfor the first time in the battle for Mosul marks a significant moment in the 12-week campaign to recapture so-called Islamic State's (IS) last major stronghold in the country. Lieutenant General Abdal-Amir al-Lami, the Iraqi deputy chief of staff for operations, confirmed on 8 January that the Iraqi security forces (ISF) had seized the eastern end of one of the bridges linking the two sides of the city. A solid foothold seems to have been made in the riverside Beladiyat area, which is the site of many of Mosul's newer municipality offices and the Salam Hospital, the scene of adaring earlier attempt,externalby Iraqi forces to punch a corridor through to the river. North of Beladiyat, the 2nd Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) brigade experienced a simultaneous breakthrough towards the river in the Muthana neighbourhood and the ancient ruins of Nineveh. Gains are also being made in north-east Mosul, as the 1st and 3rd ISOF brigades attempt the recapture of the Kindi military base and adjacent upper income neighbourhoods. Broad-based advances suggest that IS resistance is ""showing signs of collapse"" in east Mosul, as suggested by Brett McGurk, the senior US official in the counter-IS coalition,in a tweet,externalon 8 January. One causal factor was clearly the concentration of all available ISF forces in east Mosul, achieved by closing down ancillary assaults north and south-west of the city. During a two-week hiatus the 2nd Emergency Response Brigade and 5th Federal Police division troops were shifted from areas south-west of Mosul to new positions east of the Tigris. These forces re-energised the ISF thrust towards Beladiyat and the bridges inside the city when the offensive wasrestarted on 29 December. Another accelerant was the coalition's role in reconfiguring the Iraqi battle plan, fostering greater co-ordination between Iraqi headquarters and providing more powerful artillery and air strikes. The latter boost in firepower required US howitzers to be deployed at the eastern edges of Mosul city. Over 400 coalition special forces were inserted into the urban battle as advisers and strike co-ordinators, often well within the range of IS attacks. Steady advances in east Mosul will provide a welcome bright spot as the gruelling battle for the city enters its 12th week. Iraqi forces are now present in 35 of east Mosul's 47 neighbourhoods, including the largest and most densely populated parts of the east side. Thousands of Iraqis have fled the fighting, though not as many as some predictions Hard fighting may still be ahead for Mosul University and the Kindi army base, both of which are in east Mosul. None of the 29 large and heavily populated west Mosul neighbourhoods have been liberated. Unless an unexpectedly rapid collapse of IS unfolds, the western side of the city will need to be assaulted in a separate military operation launched after some weeks of reset and planning for the ISF. This suggests that east Mosul may be cleared in January 2017 or early February, whilst the clearance of west Mosul may stretch well into the second quarter of 2017. The sequential clearing of different quarters of Mosul city may succeed in limiting the time that civilians are exposed to intense combat in individual neighbourhoods. Thus far the battle has seen far less damage done to Mosul's infrastructure than previous attritional struggleslike Ramadi in Iraq or Kobane in Syria, though the daily damage to neighbourhoods has intensified since the offensive restarted. Frame from video by Amaq news agency appearing to show a collapsed section of the Old Bridge The coalition has specifically sought to minimise the cost and time required to rebuild bridges,selectively destroyingeasy-to-replace spars and off-ramps to deny the bridges to IS but to leave them quickly repairable after the battle. The number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Mosul city itself was estimated by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs at42,000,externalin early December, around 4-6% of Mosul's remaining population and a far lower number than many pre-battle projections. The flow of IDPs from the city has increased since 29 December according to OCHA, including15,942,externalin the eight days after the offensive restarted. However, OCHA also announced that security in liberated areas has also allowed14,000,externalIDPs to return to Mosul city. Away from most media coverage, the liberated zones of east Mosul city are witnessing the gradual return of policing, running water and diesel-run neighbourhood electrical generation networks. Most important, the cross-sectarian and multi-ethnic ISF in Mosul city have broadly been accepted by local Sunni Arab residents, who seem grateful for their largely humane treatment of the population and their sacrifices in coming to the distant northern Sunni city of Mosul to liberate it from IS. IS is expected to step up attacks in other parts of Iraq as it loses hold of Mosul The most likely IS response to the loss of east Mosul will be efforts to intensify anti-civilian bombings in Baghdad, where seven bombings in the first eight days of 2017 have killed 87 people and wounded as many as 231. The Iraqi government and coalition are currently building up Baghdad's perimeter defences, installing sensors on tethered blimps and launching disruptive security operations in the rural outskirts of the city to break up bombing cells. Dr Michael Knights is the Lafer Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He has worked in all of Iraq's provinces, and spent time embedded with the Iraqi security forces. His recent report on post-battle stabilisation of Mosul is available via theWashington Institute website,external.

Financially aware," 1.Mind the traps.We all tend to think we’re good at spotting a deal – but actually we will spend more money for a cheap car in an auction just because the luxury car sold before it went for a lot of money. 2. If you pay by card rather than cash you tend to spend more money and buy unhealthier foods.Try paying by cashmore frequently for your smaller purchases, particularly at lunchtimes. Even better - make yourself a packed lunch. 3.Your personalityplays a big role in how good you are at saving money. Sometimes people mistakenly think our attitude towards money comes from our upbringing and our parents, but have you ever noticed that siblings can have very different attitudes towards spending? Stable extroverts are more open, comfortable and carefree about their money. Whilst people who score high on conscientiousness are better savers. 4.The rule of threes: shops and online stores often lay things out in groups of threes. Imagine you’re looking to buy a cheap computer...there will be three items of a similar spec laid out in front of you. The three items will range in price from cheapest to most expensive. By showing you the one that’s more expensive, at least two out of three consumers will always buy the computer that is the middle price, rather than purchasing the cheapest item. This is the ‘compromise effect’ that most people fall for. We are most sensitive to disadvantages when shopping and often avoid the cheapest one in case the product is no good. 5.Not all money is worth the same.You will get more pleasure from winning £25 in a lottery one week followed by £50 the next, rather than £75 all in one go. Be mindful of your money and try and enjoy any winnings, no matter how much. 6.Beware the prices that end in a nine.£2.99, £3.49 or £59. People tend to think that these prices are better value, simply because the number nine is so often used to signal a discount. Amazingly, this will have the effect on people's minds that if they see something priced at £39 next to something valued at £35, they'll actually buy the one costing £39 because they think it's a discount! 7.It’s not in a name.Some studies have shown that people will buy according to their name. So for example, if your name is Frank, you might be quite likely to go for something valued at £55 because of the letter ‘F’. Crazy, but true. Fortunately, only people with certain letters in their names need to worry about this one. 8.We care about fairness.A study was done about snow shovels and whether it was ok to double the price of a snow shovel when there has been a heavy snowfall and the shovel is in demand? People were fundamentally against this because it’s not fair. 9.‘Reference points’ are importantto a buyer. This is when a consumer will be looking at the previous price prior to a discount to see what their savings could be, or they compare the price they've seen to what other stores are pricing the same item at. Sellers have a lot of trouble trying to control what a customer’s reference points are – if they can control which reference points you see (think shopping online or the mark-down prices in stores) they can control what price you’re willing to pay. 10.Keep your eyes peeled for tricks.The shops change their tactics fairly regularly, because consumers tend to realise after a year or so what is going on. What supermarkets tried 10 years ago isn’t what they’re doing today. Claudia Hammond on how shops are trying to make the most of your cognitive processes. Claudia Hammond looks at 'loss aversion'.

"'A football decision, not a money grab'","This video can not be played January 2017: Expansion is 21st century move - Infantino Fifa president Gianni Infantino has defended theexpansionof the World Cup to 48 teams, insisting the change was based on ""sporting merit"" and not to make money. The sport's world governing body voted unanimously in favour of the change at a meeting in Zurich on Tuesday. Campaign group New Fifa Now described the expansion as ""a money grab and power grab"". But Infantino told the BBC: ""It is the opposite, it's a football decision."" He added: ""Every format has advantages in financial terms. We were in a comfortable situation to take a decision based on sporting merit."" 'A 48-team World Cup makes me want Blatter back' Podcast: Fans not convinced by World Cup revamp An initial stage of 16 groups of three teams will precede a knockout stage for the remaining 32 with the change coming in for the 2026 tournament. According to Fifa research,,externalrevenue is predicted to increase to Â£5.29bn for a 48-team tournament, giving a potential profit rise of Â£521m. ""This is a historic decision which marks the entrance of the World Cup into the 21st Century,"" added Infantino. The Football Association has urged Fifa to consider the needs of fans, players, teams and leagues and asked for more information on how the tournament would work, with Infantino admitting much of the detail has yet to be worked out. The European Club Association (ECA), which represents the interests of clubs at European level, reiterated it was against expansion. It said Fifa had made a political rather than a sporting decision. New Fifa Now says the governing body needs to reform, and that the change would ""dilute the competitiveness of the tournament"". Infantino, however, maintains the expansion will increase the quality of the teams in the competition. ""Costa Rica eliminated England and Italy in the last World Cup, a good solid team and there are many other teams who could make it to the World Cup,"" he said. ""I believe that the actual quality could rise, because many more countries will have the chance to qualify so they will invest in their elite football as well as grassroots."" Responding to criticism from European clubs, Infantino added: ""The game has changed. Football has now become a truly global game. Everyone is happy about investment in Europe, but what about helping outside Europe? They need to be open. ""The key message from clubs I appreciate fully has always been don't touch the calendar, the dates of the World Cup or the burden for the players, and both these commissions fulfil them. ""We will play 32 days like now, we play maximum seven matches like now, 12 stadiums, like now, but give the chance for more countries to dream."" This video can not be played The World Cup's weirdest format changes The number of tournament matches will rise to 80, from 64, but the eventual winners will still play only seven games. The tournament will be completed within 32 days - a measure to appease powerful European clubs, who objected to reform because of a crowded international schedule. The changes mark the first World Cup expansion since 1998. Infantino said the decision on who will get the extra qualification slots has yet to be made but ""this will be looked at speedily"", adding: ""The only sure thing is that everyone will have a bit more representation than they have."" The president said he believed the World Cup could emulate what he felt was a successful Euro 2016 tournament, where the number of teams taking part was similarly increased. Qualifying for last year's tournament featured a record 53 nations, while the number of teams at the finals increased from 16 to 24. ""It was the most interesting in the history of the European Championship,"" said Infantino. ""All the other teams started to believe in their chance to qualify and play matches with a different mindset that they could qualify. ""We saw Wales, Iceland, Northern Ireland qualify, some for the first time, some for first time in many years. The Netherlands always qualify, but they didn't. Qualifying created a whole new dynamic and hopefully we will do the same.""

Corbyn and the immigration question,"This video can not be played In full: Jeremy Corbyn interview with Laura Kuenssberg Here's the thing. Despite the impression given by Labour HQ overnight that Jeremy Corbyn was on the point of ditching his long held backing of the freedom of movement of European citizens - that allows an unlimited number of them to come and live and work in the UK - when push came to shove in interviews this morning, he couldn't quite bring himself to say it. Yes, in a speech he'll say that he wants ""fair"" and ""managed"" levels of immigration, and a clampdown on abusive practices at work by many employers. But he has not changed his mind on the most basic question when it comes to immigration. Does he think that the current levels, with 190,000 EU citizens coming to the UK last year are too high? ""No."" For many of his supporters, that might be a relief. He has continually defended the rights of people to come to the UK and refused to put a limit on numbers. So, if the Labour leader had a genuine change of heart, that could have caused him problems with his ardent base among the party membership, not least because his whole reputation is built on his long held adherence to a set of firm principles. But for the increasing number of Labour MPs who have come to believe that the public demands a very different approach, it is a problem. Whether it is the party's Deputy Leader Tom Watson, or the former leader Ed Miliband, even before the referendum when so much public concern about immigration was aired, there was a building view that the freedom of movement rules had to be changed. That is driven partly because of the looming electoral threat to them from UKIP. More straightforwardly and importantly, it is what many MPs simply say voters tell them they want -  and they might not vote for them next time unless they do something about it. Their leader though, won't budge on the big question, his position on numbers. He is instead putting forward again a policy that Labour has had since the last General Election, where the rules on employers would be tightened, to stop employers undercutting wages by exploiting foreign workers, and banning recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas. He told me this would ""probably"" reduce the numbers, and his team believe it could have a significant effect, but they can't put a figure on the kind of difference they believe it would make to the level of immigration. Right now, that does not seem the kind of policy that is likely to convince millions of undecided voters when the clamour for limits to the country's record levels of immigration have only grown. Just for good measure, Mr Corbyn repeated his idea of putting a limit on earnings that he first proposed last year, immediately lambasted by his political enemies. As 2017 begins, Mr Corbyn's internal party critics will sigh, that still as the world changes around him, Mr Corbyn stays in his comfort zone, in the hope that eventually, more members of the public will join him there.

Labour happier now over immigration?,"""Jeremy Corbyn hasn't changed his mind about anything in 40 years,"" goes the mocking refrain. It sounds scornful, and it's meant to. It's also unfair. Just a little, anyway. Today, it became abundantly clear that Labour's leader has not changed his mind on the value, as he sees it, of free movement of people between European states. It's become equally clear - behind the scenes - that a great many colleagues wish he would. And not just his many ideological and political opponents. Some of Mr Corbyn's close and loyal supporters think so too. As evidence accumulates of Labour's slide in the opinion polls (and yes, I know we don't swallow polling numbers without chewing anymore, but consistent double-digit Tory leads can't be discounted), so concern has grown about a liberal approach to EU migration widely judged to be costing Labour dearly on countless doorsteps. John Trickett, Labour's national campaign co-ordinator and a strong Corbyn ally, is said to be concerned. How could he not be? Those hoping, praying, for a shift are said to include some within Mr Corbyn's inner circle. It's also suggested that his staunchest, arguably most powerful ally, Unite trade union leader Len McCluskey, might welcome a line closer to the instincts of many voters. ""Voters"", in this context, encompasses disillusioned Labour supporters, those who backed Brexit, and perhaps members of Unite who may not share their general secretary's enthusiasm for Mr Corbyn or, for that matter, Labour under any leader at all. The overnight briefing promised a declaration that Mr Corbyn was not ""wedded"" to free movement of people in the EU ""on principle"". Some headlines promised a significant shift, even a ""U-turn"". Yet this morning, as the party leader ran through a series of broadcast media interviews, and later when he delivered the much-trailed speech setting out his thinking on Brexit, it seemed somewhere along the line, Mr Corbyn may have missed a meeting. ""He messed it up,"" a senior shadow cabinet member told me, only he used a much stronger word than ""messed"". The pressure will continue. ""Jeremy moved on NATO, eventually, and we ended up with a no-score draw on nuclear weapons,"" added the shadow minister. ""Jeremy can be budged. Sometimes. But it takes a hell of an effort and a lot of time."" He was right, of course. Mr Corbyn now accepts, however unenthusiastically, that NATO is a defence alliance Britain must back and not merely a hangover from the cold war. He has put aside his dream of Labour returning to a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. He is still adamant that he would never order a nuclear strike, a flat contradiction to the principal of nuclear deterrence which Labour has yet to confront. He has moved, nonetheless. His position, if not his thinking, has changed. Now he talks of free movement as a possible component of an EU divorce settlement still to be negotiated. That's a long way from the thinking of shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, who expressed sympathy, when I interviewed him on my Sunday morning 5 live programme, Pienaar's Politics, for the idea of limiting access to the UK jobs market to EU migrants who have a job guaranteed. But it opened at least the possibility of further movement in future. Only a possibility, mind. The Labour leader is stubborn. Or a man of deep conviction. Take your choice. The enthusiasts who elected and continue to sustain Mr Corbyn continue to be zealous and loyal. Supporters of free movement of people as a useful, as well as necessary element of the EU single market may welcome Mr Corbyn's reluctance to forsake them. But a lot of Labour MPs have moved from bitter resentment to weary fatalism, hoping that, somehow, the mood among party members changes sufficiently to produce a change. Preferably a change of leader. These include the senior Labour MP who told me privately today that his constituency - a northern stronghold with a majority of around 15,000 - now felt like a marginal seat, vulnerable to the overtures of UKIP. Some allies of Mr Corbyn had grown resentful that the mainstream media appeared to have lost interest in reporting the doings of Labour, or analysing the party's policy development. No-one can make the same complaint today. I'm not  sure the party's position is any happier as a result.

Generations at war,"Millennial daughter and baby boomer father, Claudia and Ian Wells We take it for granted that our children will be better off than us but the so-called millennials - anyone born in the 1980s or 1990s - could become the first generation to earn less than their parents. And are those parents, mostly baby boomers who benefited from economic good times, tax cuts and free higher education to blame? Baby boomers, people born between 1946 and 1965, will on average earn Â£740,000 during their lives, according to the Resolution Foundation. Generation X, those now aged between 35 and 50, are projected to earn 13% more than that - Â£835,000 on average. But the figure formillennials, the under-35s, is lower than that - they are forecast to earn Â£825,000 over their working lives. Laura Gardiner, author of the Resolution Foundation's reportStagnation Generation,externalfound a range of reasons for the dismal outlook for millennials. Millennial Laura Gardiner says that her generation has been particularly hard hit by the financial crisis Laura, a millennial herself, says the timing of the financial crisis was particularly bad for her generation. ""This pay squeeze in particular hit millennials just at the point you expect your pay to be rising most quickly, in your early twenties,"" she says. There's still a chance that millennials' lifetime earnings could outstrip those of their parents because they are likely to live longer and work longer, Laura says. She adds, however, that the slowdown in productivity growth (which affects national income) and the rise of insecure or precarious work, such as zero-hours contracts, self employment and short-term contracts, could prove so devastating that millennials would still earn less than their parents. This video can not be played Father and daughter Ian and Claudia discuss their financial prospects Claudia Wells, who is 24, graduated from university in 2015 and since then has had a series of temporary and short-term contracts, the most recent of which has taken her to France. ""In today's market,"" she says, ""finding a job can be hard."" Claudia also faces other financial burdens compared with her baby boomer father Ian. As soon as she starts earning more than Â£21,000 she will have to start paying off more than Â£40,000 of student debt. Ian compares his daughter's circumstances with his own: ""At 23 I was in a secure, big company job with a good pension scheme, I had bought my first modest house and I was paying off a mortgage, not student debt."" ""I live in a shared house and the idea of me or any of my friends owning a house by ourselves is pretty unforeseeable,"" Claudia says. Housing supply has failed to meet demand - another problem facing millennials In fact, by the age of 30, Claudia's generation are 50% less likely to own their own homes than their baby boomer parents. Almost two-thirds of Ian's generation were homeowners by the same age. Part of the problem is that supply has failed to keep up with demand for housing as the population has grown. And Angus Hanton, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, which exists to promote fairness between the generations, believes that older people are hogging the housing that is available. ""Partly,"" he says, ""because they are living longer and partly because there aren't suitable places to downsize to, but they are taking more than their share."" This matters for Claudia's generation because property remains the single biggest asset owned by people in the UK and is a valuable source of wealth and, potentially, rental income in later life. Angus Hanton, a baby boomer himself, says his generation is taking ""more than their share"" Ian and his wife own their home outright and receive rental income from properties overseas that will supplement his already generous defined benefits pension and large savings pot, should he choose to retire. For ""generation rent"" - as millennials are also known - their retirement prospects look a lot bleaker. Not only are they more likely to forego income and wealth from owning property, they also face much higher pension costs. And, despite the start of auto-enrolment into company pension schemes, the shift towards defined contribution pensions and the rise in self-employment (excluded from auto-enrolment) could dramatically reduce millennials' retirement income. The state is often seen as the arbiter of fairness between generations. But, there is evidence that government policy itself may have widened the intergenerational divide. Prof Sir John Hills of the London School of Economicsfound that baby boomers,externalwere, on average, net beneficiaries of the welfare state - they will get more in benefits than they have paid in tax. They have enjoyed tax cuts and a boom in welfare spending. Subsequent generations, by contrast, are likely to be net contributors over their lifetimes and get back less than they have paid in, thanks to austerity cuts to state benefits. ""The older generation have more voting power... they lobby more, the MPs and the policy makers are more likely to be baby boomers so [young people's] interests tend to be treated as less important,"" says Angus Hanton. So government decisions to protect the state pensions with a ""triple lock"" guaranteeing an annual rise of at least 2.5%, at a time when other working-age benefits are being cut, has added to the controversy over intergenerational fairness. ""In the UK we have a huge number of pensioners who are wealthy, probably two million over-60s who live in households with more than a million pounds' worth of assets,"" adds Angus. ""It seems odd that they should be getting this handout of the state pension."" Baroness Greengross, who is from the ""silent"" inter-war generation, doesn't believe parents are at war with their children Not everyone, however, puts the blame quite so squarely on the shoulders of the baby boomers. ""I would dispute the fact that the generations are at war,"" says Baroness Greengross, president of the Pensions Policy Institute. ""The older generation has no desire to fight the younger generation... these are their children and grandchildren."" There is evidence that, in some countries at least, state level transfers of wealth from the young are, to some extent, offset by private transfers from old to young within families. And, Ian admits that, like most parents, he is setting aside money to help Claudia get on to the housing ladder.

Has inequality been getting worse?10 January 2017 (15:09:34),"The claim:Levels of inequality in the UK have been getting worse. Reality Check verdict:Official figures suggest that income distribution has become less unequal over the past decade. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday morning that he would be interested in a cap on earnings, because ""we cannot go on creating worse levels of inequality"". Coincidentally, Tuesday morning also saw the release of theannual report on income inequality,externalfrom the Office for National Statistics. It said that there had been a gradual decline in income inequality over the past decade. It is using the Gini Coefficient, which is a measure of inequality - in this case, a coefficient of zero would mean that all households had the same income while 100 would mean that one household had all the income. These figures are for disposable income, which is what you get after you've added benefits and subtracted direct taxes such as income tax and council tax. There are caveats around these figures - they are based on surveys, so there is a margin of error, and it is particularly difficult to get survey responses from people at the top of the income distribution. But the official figures suggest that there was a considerable increase in inequality in the 1980s, relatively little change from the early 1990s to mid-2000s and then a gradual decline in the past decade, returning the UK to the same level of inequality as was seen in the mid-1980s. So from these figures it would be wrong to conclude that inequality has been getting worse. What could be missing from this analysis? The ONS looks at inequality across the whole population - there has also been much interest in comparing the richest 1% or 0.1% with the rest of the population. The World Top Incomes Database (which you can see infigure 3 of this blog,external) suggests that since 1990 there has been relatively little change in the share of income taken by the richest 20% or 10% of the population. The richest 1% and the richest 0.1% had seen their share of income rising steadily until the financial crisis, but it has fallen since then. So once again, inequality has not been growing. The measures identified so far have been looking at income rather than wealth. It is also possible to calculate Gini coefficients for wealth, although the latest official figures for it covered only up tothe middle of 2014,external. From 2006 to 2014, there was a small increase in overall wealth inequality, with property wealth having the biggest effect. Housing costs are a particular issue - theDepartment for Work and Pensions calculates,externala Gini coefficient for income distribution that takes housing costs into account. The difference it makes is that inequality increases in 2013-14, although it is still below pre-financial crisis levels. None of this suggests that inequality does not exist in the UK or that it is not a problem or indeed that it is not worse than in other countries, but there is little evidence that it has been getting worse in the UK in the past decade.

How Conservative leaders have attempted to define society9 January 2017 (13:57:26),"Theresa May has set out her vision for a ""shared society"" in which the state has a role in helping people who are struggling to get by. It marks the latest attempt by a Conservative leader to spell out what society should, or should not, be. Margaret Thatcher's remark about society was one of her most famous In a 1987 interview with Woman's Own magazine, Margaret Thatcher said there was ""no such thing as society"", and that line went on to become one of her most famous. It has been much debated over the years, with critics seeing it as evidence of a heartless approach where needy individuals are left to fend for themselves. But Thatcher's supporters complain the quote is taken out of context, and in her memoirs the former PM said it had been ""distorted beyond recognition"". More recently, polling hasfound,externalthat while a strong majority of people disagreed with the ""no such thing"" line in isolation, most agreed with the longer version. Here it is: ""I think we've been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it's the government's job to cope with it... They're casting their problem on society. ""And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families, and no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first. ""It's our duty to look after ourselves and then, also, to look after our neighbour. People have got the entitlements too much in mind, without the obligations. There's no such thing as entitlement, unless someone has first met an obligation."" Thatcher's successor, John Major, entered Downing Street in 1990 promising to create a ""classless society"", which he described as a ""a tapestry of talents in which everyone from child to adult respects achievement"". He was still talking about it in his party conference speech the following year: ""I spoke of a classless society. I don't shrink from that phrase. ""I don't mean a society in which everyone is the same, or thinks the same, or earns the same. But a tapestry of talents in which everyone from child to adult respects achievement; where every promotion, every certificate is respected; and each person's contribution is valued. And where the greatest respect is reserved for the law."" William Hague promised a 'responsible society' Next up was William Hague, who called for a ""responsible society"", and said Thatcher's famous line had been wilfully misinterpreted and used against the Conservatives. ""A strong society rests on responsible individuals and families. They need to be able to turn to straightforward, reliable help when times are bad,"" the Tories' 2001manifesto,externalsaid. ""But that should not become dependence on the state when times are good."" This video can not be played David Cameron: ""I think we're onto a really big idea, a really exciting future for our country"" ""There is such a thing as society; it's just not the same thing as the state,"" declared David Cameron in his 2005 victoryspeech,externalafter becoming Conservative leader. Five years later, the idea of a Big Society was a key strand of the Conservatives' 2010 general election manifesto. It involved allowing voluntary groups and charities to run public services, encouraging people to do more volunteering and giving local groups more power to take decisions affecting their area. After becoming PM, Cameron described building the Big Society as his ""great passion"", hoping ""people power"" would help keep pubs and museums open and mean more residents getting involved with their communities. But there were reports Conservative candidates found it a hard concept to explain on the doorstep, and the Tories' political opponents said it was simply a way of hiding cuts to local services as the new government reduced public spending. Mentions of the Big Society became less prominent over the course of the Parliament, and the theme featured little in the 2015 general election campaign. Having quit frontline politics after the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Cameron now works with the National Citizen Service, describing the organisation as ""the Big Society in action"". This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to ""build a better Britain"" In what has been seen as a break from David Cameron's championing of voluntary work, Theresa May has stressed the role of the state in creating ""a society that works for everyone"". The so-called shared society, she says, ""doesn't just value our individual rights but focuses rather more on the responsibilities we have to one another"" and respects ""the bonds of family, community, citizenship and strong institutions that we share as a union of people and nations"". In a speech setting out her vision, she said there was ""more to life than individualism and self-interest"". ""We form families, communities, towns, cities, counties and nations. And we embrace the responsibilities those institutions imply. ""And government has a clear role to play to support this conception of society.""

Gavin Hewitt: Why UK still weighing up EU exit negotiating strategy,"It is a curious moment in British politics. The government is facing the most important negotiations in over 50 years. The outcome will shape the future of the UK economy - but you would not necessarily know it. The consumers - the voters - appear to be shrugging off the uncertainties, the unknowns and the warnings of future risks. Many economists had predicted that a vote to leave the EU would tip Britain into recession. Instead, after six months, the UK is on track to be the fastest growing economy in the G7. Orders in the manufacturing sector are expanding at the fastest rate in 25 years. Consumers are acting ""almost as though the referendum had not taken place"" asserts Andy Haldane, the Chief Economist at the Bank of England. The economic forecasters are on the defensive or taking a turn in the confessional, admitting that the forecasting profession ""is to some extent in crisis"". It is a reminder of what I was once told - that economics is not a science but the politics of money. There have been times in the past when politicians have urged voters to go out and spend, almost as if shopping was a patriotic duty. In recent months, the British consumer has needed no urging. There has been a surge in UK retail sales Warnings have been defied. Financed by a surge in borrowing, spending is accelerating. Confidence is high, buoyed by real income growth, the housing market outside London, low unemployment and a soaring stock market. Our European neighbours are a little open-mouthed at the way the script is unfolding. But many of the same economists and forecasters who had warned against Brexit still believe a reckoning is coming. The rising costs of imports because of a weakened pound and increased fuel prices will combine to force some retailers to raise their prices. Higher inflation will test consumer appetites. Theresa May: UK cannot keep 'bits' of EU membership Pound falls on May's Brexit comments Brexit Britain: What has actually happened so far? Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU The robust economy has bought the government political space. It is not at the moment under pressure and does not yet need to show its hand but, slowly, a narrative is emerging that carries risks for Theresa May and her tightly-wound circle; that they are hobbled by indecision. Perhaps, not surprisingly, you hear it said in the European Commission that the government neither has a strategy for the negotiations ahead nor does it know what it wants. That is seeping into the conversations in Westminster and was boosted by the charge from Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK Ambassador to the EU,of ""muddled thinking"" in the government. Sir Ivan Rogers has warned about ""muddled thinking"" over Brexit It is a narrative rejected by Mrs May and, to be fair to No 10, there are no easy choices. It is as complex a negotiation as any government has faced. Inevitably some people will be disappointed. Brussels thinks the UK has made its choice. The PM has said the UK will insist on controlling EU immigration and on leaving the jurisdiction of the European courts. To those sitting in the halls of the EU that means Britain is set on leaving the single market because access to the internal market depends on accepting freedom of movement. Theresa May has repeatedly rejected the idea that what the UK wants is a binary decision. She certainly believes that the government has to reassert control over EU migration and that is close to being a red line. But ministers believe that does not preclude a deal, whereby access to the single market is negotiated for certain industries or where some elements of freedom of movement are accepted, while negotiating for the right to apply a brake if the system is under pressure. Angela Merkel has said there will be ""no cherry picking"" by the UK over its Brexit deal The official EU line is the one echoed by Angela Merkel who insists there will be ""no cherry picking"". So far, the 27 other members of the EU have been remarkably united behind that response. The government, however, believes that once the negotiations start there will be greater flexibility to be exploited. Downing Street knows that almost any deal has the capacity to stir up divisions, not least within the PM's own party. The differences will not easily be reconciled. Many of the Brexiteers want to leave the single market and the customs union as quickly as possible, precisely because of the conditions attached to belonging to it. However, a sizeable part of the Conservative Party, the City and the business community believes that leaving the single market would be reckless, risking serious damage to the UK economy. Some time after the end of March, when Article 50 is triggered, the negotiations will begin. The initial focus will be on the terms of the divorce. Early on, the UK will face the bill to settle outstanding obligations, like contributions to the EU budget and towards EU pensions. In Brussels they put the price tag somewhere between 55 and 60 billion euros. That one item alone has the potential to sour negotiations. In the two years to settle the divorce there will almost certainly be no time to agree a trade deal. That is why both the EU and some UK ministers are calling for a transitional arrangement. Negotiating new trade agreements will be a key part of a successful Brexit This will be a much more dangerous period for the government. Inward investment may weaken, businesses may postpone expenditure and some companies may decide to move part of their operations to a EU capital, while consumers may lose their confidence. The challenge for the government will be to keep the voters believing that an agreement is achievable which protects the economy. The greatest risk for the prime minister is that her opening bid is dismissed out of hand or that it becomes apparent that a compromise is beyond reach. There are well-known figures in the European Commission who do not disguise their determination to see the UK hurt. That was Sir Ivan Rogers's concern, that the UK could slide into a ""disorderly break"" with nothing to show for all the talking, leaving the UK trading under World Trade Organization rules with common tariffs. Within 10 weeks Mrs May will have to shed her instinctive caution, define her goals and become the great persuader both in Europe and at home. At some stage she will face the maxim ""to lead is to choose"". What are the Brexit options?

"Amol Rajan: Desmond, Montgomery and the Express","I wrote on this blog in December that titles such as the Telegraph or Express might be for sale in 2017. Overnight, it has been revealed that Trinity Mirror PLC has been in discussion with Richard Desmond's Northern & Shell about taking a minority interest in a new company which would - probably but not certainly - include the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star, Daily Star Sunday and their websites. Trinity's interest in the Express titles goes back years. But there is a much bigger story going on here. The man behind a deal to potentially take these titles off Richard Desmond is none other than David Montgomery, the former editor of the News of the World and Today who went on to become a major investor in media. Over recent months, Montgomery has been trying to raise the necessary finances, speaking to several banks, as well as equity partners. Montgomery is being advised by Lloyds, Bank of Canada, and the familiar figure of Jonnie Goodwin of Lepe Partners. Before Christmas, he had raised Â£125m. This comprises Â£60m of debt finance, Â£10m from Montgomery, Â£30m from other equity backers - and Â£25m from Trinity Mirror. Mark Kleinman of Sky News has reported that the investors Montgomery is speaking to include Towebrook Capital Partners. I have not been able to verify this yet myself. Richard Desmond, who bought the Express titles in 2000, spoke to me about his intentions. In May last year, Express Newspapers, which is part of Northern & Shell, announced it had tripled pre-tax profits in 2015 to Â£30.5m. Desmond told me that with OK! Magazine doing well, and his printworks in Luton owning assets now worth ""around Â£100m"", Express Newspapers was making around Â£50m. I asked Desmond if he was intent on selling to Montgomery and had received an offer. ""There's a lot of talk, nothing has happened. I haven't had an offer."" Asked specifically if he wished to sell Express Newspapers, Desmond said: ""Why would I? You tell me, why would I?"" But he swiftly added that he was ""interested in everything"". Asked if he would demand a five-times multiple of profits for Express Newspapers, he said: ""Why wouldn't I?"" Desmond hasn't seen Montgomery since his Christmas party. ""My people have been speaking loads to his management."" His preference, as things stand, is to consolidate back-office staff rather than sell Express Newspapers - though he would, of course, entertain the latter option if he was offered a suitable price. Richard Desmond: A brilliant deal-maker ""If we can bring in a minority partner to share back-office staff, that could save tens of millions,"" he added. He specifically referred to ""IT, ad sales"" in reference to these back-office operations. Using what were clearly ballpark figures on a deal that hasn't yet transpired, about an entity not yet clearly defined, Desmond told me the savings for Trinity Mirror of a combined company could be around Â£30m, and for Desmond they could be around Â£60m. ""If Trinity then owned 20% of the new company, which should make Â£80m, that's Â£16m."" I should urge caution about these figures, because Desmond himself did: when I asked what exactly would make Â£80m, he was open that this was a generalisation about a possible future company. Desmond is a brilliant deal-maker who sold Channel 5 to Viacom for Â£463m in 2014, having bought it in 2010 for just Â£103.5m. By the way, Viacom has had an excellent two years with Channel 5, with ratings up, in the years since that sale. He didn't give me the impression he is keen to get out of media in a hurry. I asked David Montgomery if the above figures were accurate and indeed whether he was being advised by those I mention above. At the time of writing he hadn't responded to my queries. I asked a Trinity Mirror PLC spokesman whether the Â£25m figure was accurate. He offered no comment. I have spoken to multiple sources across the industry about the likelihood of a deal going through between Montgomery and Desmond. As things stand, it is very uncertain. Desmond won't sell for a knockdown price: after all, he has stable profits. And any consolidation of back-office operations depends on a huge range of specifics that are yet to be hammered out. But as I have repeatedly said on this blog, there is a coming consolidation in the media sector, and indeed in over-supplied sub-sectors such as that of national newspapers in Britain. By over-supplied I simply mean we have plenty for an island with our population. Expect more on this soon. And I will publish Montgomery's response if and when I get it.

Mark Easton: Thailand's water woes,"Tourists use inflatable rings to cross a road on the Thai island of Koh Samui Mr Supit bows low, palms together, fingers pointing to the wrathful heavens above. The north-east monsoon should have left the Thai island of Koh Samui more than a month ago, but the start of 2017 there has been greeted by a week of unremitting tropical storms. Supposedly the high season, Mr Supit's hotel is dripping with umbrellas and soaking towels. The rains have prevented many staff from getting to work, made his international guests miserable and washed away his organic garden. He breaks his wai - the traditional palms together gesture of greeting - throwing his arms apart with a shrug and a shake of his head. ""What more can I do?"" he asks. ""We are going to cross the sea in front of us,"" he jokes as he attempts to drive down Main Street, floodwater sloshing up to the gunwales of his Ford. ""This is very strange weather. We had similar storms five years ago, but that was in March. I have never known a new year like this.  We are thinking this must be the result of climate change."" Supit Choo-in: ""We must focus on green again."" Like the scooters abandoned beside the flooded roads, many of the resorts dotted around Samui's coast have spluttered to a stop.  A few plucky guests have filmed themselves laughing on lilos bobbing down the street, beers in hand, but Thai tourism is an industry that floats on sunshine and there has been virtually none of that for a week. The local TV news is reporting that hundreds of families on the holiday island have been left homeless, bridges are down and many roads are impassable beneath brown, malodorous floodwater. Elsewhere in the province, the unexpected deluge has killed at least 18 people. A mile from his hotel, Mr Supit stops his car to look at a rockfall that has crashed across the ring road, red boulders brought down by the heavy rains. ""We need to be focusing on green again,"" he murmurs. Mr Supit recalls the environmental initiative launched with much fanfare by hoteliers and tour companies on Koh Samui in the late 90s after a landmark speech from the late king. Thailand is still in mourning for King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died last October after 70 years on the throne. Black and white shrines to his memory are everywhere, reverence for the monarch akin to worship of a deity, his utterances regarded almost as sacred texts. In 1997, after massive currency speculation led to the total collapse of the Thai economy, mass unemployment and food shortages, King Bhumibol addressed the nation. He appealed for what he called a ""sufficiency economy"", a philosophy of moderation, balance and caution that, he argued, would help Thailand cope with the socio-economic, cultural and environmental challenges of globalisation. Some translated the speech as a decree to introduce a sustainable tourism policy - a change long overdue in a country that had witnessed almost unconstrained development for decades. Deforestation, the destruction of natural habitats and a brazen prostitution industry were among the ugly faces of the tourism goldrush. Officials cautioned that without the kind of restraint implicit in the king's crisis speech, many of the unspoiled natural environments that attracted travellers would be destroyed. Thailand's famous white beaches would be lost to the sea, one minister warned.  Vibrant marine habitats and dense tropical jungles would be obliterated. A number of private hoteliers joined the Green Leaf Foundation, committing them to make their resorts carbon neutral. There are eco-friendly tour companies offering trips to the beautiful Angthong National Marine Park.  On Koh Samui, a government-backed initiative called Seven Greens was introduced, promoting sustainable practices and philosophy. Recently, the Ministry of Tourism has urged holiday businesses to focus on attracting ""quality"" visitors - sophisticated and environmentally aware travellers who will value Thailand's natural and cultural treasures. The days of low-cost mass tourism are supposed to be numbered. Unseasonal downpours in southern Thailand have turned many streets into canals But political rhetoric has not always matched reality. The tourist strips are still overflowing with sex bars, cheap beer and greasy burgers. Among Koh Samui's top attractions are monkey shows that animal welfare groups blame for wiping out half of Thailand's white-handed gibbon population. This is not a country that finds it easy to embrace the sacrifices of a green revolution: government figures suggest the average Thai uses an astonishing eight plastic bags a day. In the last two decades around 60 environmental activists have been killed in Thailand while campaigning against powerful logging companies and industrial polluters. Some question just how serious the military-backed government is in pursuing green policies. In his flooded organic garden, Mr Supit reflects on the 40 years since he landed his first tourist job as a pot washer in a Bangkok kitchen. ""In the early days, people spent more money than now,"" he tells me as we assess the damage wreaked by the unwelcome storms. In 1960, only 81,000 tourists visited Thailand, mostly high-rollers and adventurers from Europe and the Far East, people prepared to pay for something exotic. ""Today many more come, but they don't spend - particularly the Chinese,"" Mr Supit laments. Not much is left of Mr Supit's organic garden A record 33 million tourists visited Thailand in 2016, more than eight million of them from China, pushing revenues up 18% in a single year. But Mr Supit is not alone in worrying that the country is overstretching itself. ""I am very much concerned,"" he confides. ""We have to lift up the quality and we must focus on green again. At the moment I don't think my guests are prepared to pay more for that."" His two-acre organic garden is an act of defiance: beds of traditional Thai basil and morning glory, lemongrass and lime trees are fed with homemade fertiliser, brewed on the plot from pineapple, molasses and water. When available, the Fairhouse Villa hotel chef makes full use of the fresh fruit, vegetables and spices. Sadly, his kitchen will not benefit for a while, with many of the garden's tender plants washed into the sea by the unseasonal storms. ""It is tough work,"" Mr Supit says, surveying the damage. ""But we will keep planting.  We will get there."" He smiles and looks ruefully at the darkening sky. With the rains still falling, Thailand needs more people like Mr Supit.

Weekend exercise enough to boost health,"Many busy, working people try to fit in all their exercise at the weekend Cramming all your recommended weekly exercise into one or two weekend sessions is enough to produce important health benefits, a study suggests. And being active without managing 150 minutes of moderate activity a week was still enough to reduce the risk of an early death by a third. The findings,externalare based on a survey of about 64,000 adults aged over 40 in England and Scotland. Health experts said purposeful exercise was key to better health. Researchers from Loughborough University and the University of Sydney analysed data on the time people spent doing exercise and their health over 18 years. They found that no matter how often people exercised in a week or for how long, the health benefits were similar as long as they met the activity guidelines. This was good news for people with a busy lifestyle who turned into ""weekend warriors"" in order to fit in all their recommended physical activity, they said. Compared with those who didn't exercise at all, people who did some kind of physical activity - whether regularly or irregularly - showed a lower risk of dying from cancer and from cardiovascular disease (CVD), which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. ""Weekend warriors"", who did all their exercise on one or two days of the week, were found to lower their risk of dying from CVD by 41% and cancer by 18%, compared with the inactive. Those who exercised regularly on three or more days per week reduced their risks by 41% and 21%. Even the ""insufficiently active"" lowered their risk by a significant amount - 37% and 14%, the researchers said, writing in an article published online in JAMA Internal Medicine. ""Weekend warriors"" are more likely to be men than women People aged 19-64 should try to do: at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking every week, and strength exercises (such as lifting weights) on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles Or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, such as running or a game of singles tennis every week, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles Or a mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity every week, such as two 30-minute runs plus 30 minutes of fast walking, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles Source: NHS Choices and Public Health England What do you think? Join the debate on the BBC Lifestyle & HealthFacebook page,external. Dr Gary O'Donovan, study author and expert in physical activity and health, from Loughborough University, said the key was doing exercise that was ""purposeful, and done with the intention of improving health"". ""You are not going to fidget or stand your way to health,"" he said. He added that a commitment to an active lifestyle was usually accompanied by other healthy lifestyle options, which made a positive difference regardless of body mass index (BMI). But Dr O'Donovan said no-one yet knew the best way of meeting the weekly recommended exercise total. The study cannot show a direct link between physical activity and a reduction in health risks in individuals. But extensive research has shown that exercise and a healthy diet can reduce the risk of a range of diseases - such as cancer, heart disease and type-2 diabetes -  as well as helping to control weight, blood pressure and reduce symptoms of depression. Justin Varney, national lead for adult health and wellbeing at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""The maximum health benefits are achieved from 150 minutes of moderate activity per week.

A tank of my own,"This video can not be played Dealing with the luxury market is ""a learning curve"", says Geoff Howe Some of the very rich like to go further than just displaying their wealth. They want things that few others can have, such as vehicleslike an armour-plated SUV. And now there's another extreme machine aimed at the moneyed motor-mad: the EV2. ""It's a luxury, high-speed vehicle,"" explains one of its makers, Mike Howe. ""You hit a button and the gull-wing doors pop up just like a Lamborghini. Inside you have eight-way leather seats, reverse camera, cameras up top, state of the art tracks, state of the art suspension..."" In fact, according to Mike's twin brother Geoff, the EV2 is a ""luxurious tank"". That's because the machine has tracks like a tank, rather than wheels. Twin brothers Geoff (left) and Mike Howe began building and inventing things while still at school The brothers claim that, thanks to its tracks, their vehicle can move at high speed across all kinds of rugged terrain in a similar fashion to its military counterpart - but unlike the latter, the EV2 is devoid of armaments. They say that there is demand for the product. However, the luxury market is a new departure for them, and a far cry from their normal line of business. The brothers trace the origin of their enterprise (based in Maine, in the US) all the way back to their childhood. ""We were always pushing the envelope,"" recalls Geoff. ""We built our own log cabin because the other kids down the street had a tree house that their father helped build. Mike and I didn't have a father figure at the time. So we had to do it on our own. We wanted to make it bigger, better."" As time passed, they graduated from log cabins to unusual vehicles, such as off-road racers. In their college years, they converted a tour bus into a mobile stage for their rock and roll band. Thanks to its tracks, their vehicle can move at high speed across all kinds of rugged terrain, the brothers claim Later, they became obsessed with the idea of building an extremely fast, tracked vehicle. After years of work, they ended up creating a small tank, which they called the Ripsaw. The device caught the attention of the US Army, which eventually ordered manned and unmanned versions for research and development. As a result of the US military's interest, the brothers were able to turn their hobby into a business. The challenges they faced in creating the Ripsaw were formidable. The company also invented the Ripchair, an off-road wheelchair with tracks For example, the faster you try to make a tracked vehicle go, the more likely you are to lose a track. ""It's like a wheel coming off on a car,"" explains Mike. Engineering problems like these proved tough to solve. The brothers looked beyond the automotive world for answers, and took lessons from elsewhere, such as from the technology employed in chainsaws. As they gained experience, they expanded their range to include products like robotic systems that could help to disable bombs, and the Ripchair, an extraordinary off-road wheelchair with tracks. Hollywood also began to take an interest, and the brothers' vehicles have appeared in several big-budget pictures, like GI Joe 2 and Mad Max: Fury Road. It was collaboration with the movie industry that led to a new direction for the business. The brothers see luxury forming only a small part of their range One day, the brothers received a call from someone working for a wealthy individual who had seen one of their vehicles on screen, and wanted a bespoke leisure version of the Ripsaw. They were at first surprised by the request, but after careful consideration, they decided to give the idea a go. The result was the EV2. They find dealing with the luxury market a whole new challenge. ""There is a learning curve,"" explains Geoff. One of the biggest difficulties is establishing clear lines of communication. He is rarely able to talk directly to the end client - so it is vital to ensure that the customer's wishes are being met, rather than those of any intermediaries. The company has also made robotic systems to help disable bombs The brothers have found that clients in this market are interested in a range of options. In addition to those already mentioned, they include a night vision and thermal imaging system, which displays images of the road ahead and around the vehicle. ""You can shut all the lights off at night and the vehicle is completely dark and you can run 60 miles an hour down the road and see everything you need to see to be able to drive safely,"" says Mike. Some of the tanks are equipped with thermal imaging or night vision He adds that it's up to the client to establish where and how the vehicle can be driven safely and legally. The high cost of EV2 (a typical model costs hundreds of thousands of dollars) presents another challenge. Because so much money is at stake, the brothers sometimes need to do some delicate checking on potential customers, to establish that they are able to afford the cost. They say they have enjoyed adding a ""luxury"" product to their portfolio - but they do not want it to end up skewing the direction of the whole business, which is why they see it forming only a small part of their range in future. This approach is wise, says author and consultant Peter York, who has advised many large luxury enterprises. Luxury tanks will only form a small part of the business, the twins say ""If you start spending time on billionaires' private fantasies then there are immense opportunity costs. ""A technologically innovative business and a luxury business are very different,"" he says. Still, the brothers are always open to new ideas, and for a special client, they will continue to push the envelope. At present they are working on a variant with 2,000 horsepower - nearly four times the power of a standard EV2. ""We have no idea how it's going to work out,"" says Mike Howe. ""We're riding that edge between what's physically possible and what's a dream.""

One year on,"David Bowie: One of the defining artists of his generation It's one year since music legend David Bowie died of cancer. The musician died two days after his 69th birthday, having kept his illness hidden from everyone except his family and closest collaborators. He had only just released his 25th album, Blackstar, which came to be seen as his ""parting gift"" to fans, reflecting as it did on themes of mortality and decay. It was a typically adventurous and enigmatic record from a musician who maintained a sense of mystery throughout his career. Since his death, however, fans have been afforded the occasional glimpse into his creative life - all of which elevate his status as a visionary, musical genius and humanitarian. Here are 10 things we've learned in the last 12 months. Bowie was cremated in private last January. In accordance with his wishes, no family or friends were present at the ceremony, and the whereabouts of his ashes remain a secret. His son Duncan Jones denied a rumour they had been spread at the Burning Man festival in Nevada, adding that if his father's ashes were to be scattered in public, ""it would be at the Skegness Butlins,external"". However, according toBowie's will,external, which was filed in New York on 29 January, the star wanted his ashes scattered in Indonesia ""in accordance with the Buddhist rituals of Bali"". For his final album, Bowie dispensed with his regular band and hired a group of young jazz musicians to push his music in a new direction. It was adventurous and exciting, but the star wasn't sure how fans would react. ""He was nervous it wasn't a good album,"" said Jonathan Barnbrook, who designed the sleeve. Speaking of which... The title of Bowie's last album suggests a light flickering out, while the video for Blackstar features a skeleton inside a spacesuit that is ""100% Major Tom,"" according to director Johan Renck, who spoke to Francis Whately for the BBC Two documentaryBowie: The Last Five Years. The album's artwork, which presents a single black star on a white background, is also loaded with symbolism. ""The idea of mortality is in there, and of course the idea of a black hole sucking in everything, the Big Bang, the start of the universe, if there is an end of the universe,""Jonathan Barnbrook explained to design website Dezeen,external. ""These are things that relate to mortality."" On the vinyl edition, the star is cut out of the sleeve, leaving the record exposed. ""The fact that you can see the record as a physical thing that degrades, it gets scratched as soon as it comes into being, that is a comment on mortality too,"" said Barnbrook. Months after the album was released, fans discovered that holding the record in direct sunlight would make a field of stars appear on the black inner sleeve. Once removed, the stars would fade away - adding another layer of symbolism to the cover. The list of stars who almost starred in Peter Jackson's Lord of The Rings trilogy is almost as long as the films themselves. Nicolas Cage auditioned to play Aragorn, while the part of Gandalf was offered to Sean Connery and Patrick Stewart. Amazingly, Bowie - star of 1986 film Labyrinth - was also on that list. Actor Dominic Monaghan, who played the hobbit Merry in the movies, said he had seen the singer enter the casting studio in 1999. ""I'm assuming he read for Gandalf. I can't think of anything else he would've read for,""he told The Huffington Post,external. ""We approached him,"" the film's casting director, Amy Hubbard, later confirmed. ""I'm pretty sure it was Peter Jackson's idea [but] he was unavailable."" Bowie left an estate of around $100m (Â£82m) to his wife, Iman, and his two children. But he also gave $2m (Â£1.6m) to his personal assistant Corinne ""Coco"" Schwab. It might seem like an extraordinary act of generosity, but Schwab was his closest confidante for 42 years. She started working for Bowie in London in 1973 when she answered an advert in the London Evening Standard asking for a ""girl Friday for a busy office"". Before long, she was his right-hand woman, looking after every aspect of his life, right down to diet. In an earlyRolling Stone profile,external, she was depicted going to the market to buy the star some extra-rich milk, sighing, ""I've got to put more weight on that boy."" In later years, Bowie called Schwab his ""best friend"" and credited her with helping him kick his cocaine addiction in 1970s Berlin. ""Coco was the one person who told me what a fool I was becoming and she made me snap out of it,"" he said. Producer Brian Eno (pictured above left with Jarvis Cocker and Bowie), who worked on Bowie's legendary Berlin trilogy in the 1970s, said he had been in touch with the singer just a week before his death, discussing new projects. ""Over the last few years - with him living in New York and me in London - our connection was by email,""he told the BBClast year. ""We signed off with invented names: some of his were Mr Showbiz, Milton Keynes, Rhoda Borrocks and the Duke of Ear. ""I received an email from him seven days ago. It was as funny as always, and as surreal, looping through word games and allusions and all the usual stuff we did. It ended with this sentence: 'Thank you for our good times, Brian. they will never rot'. And it was signed 'Dawn'. ""I realise now he was saying goodbye."" In the week Bowie died,19 of his albums entered the UK chart. Discounting greatest hits compilations and Blackstar (a new release), the record most people turned to was his fourth album, Hunky Dory. Released in 1971, and featuring the songs Life On Mars, Changes and Oh, You Pretty Things!, it is one of Bowie's most accessible and engaging albums, recorded with the band who would become known as Ziggy Stardust's Spiders From Mars one year later. Posthumous sales of Hunky Dory were undoubtedly boosted by the song Kooks, which was one of the most widely-shared Bowie songs on social media in the days following his death. A music hall pastiche, the track finds Bowie musing on fatherhood after the birth of his first son, Zowie. Awkward, warm and funny (not always common qualities in Bowie songs) it includes lyrics like: ""Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads / 'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's dads."" Earlier this week, Hunky Dory was voted Bowie's best album bylisteners of BBC 6 Music. In 1968, David Bowie's music publisher had the then-unknown singer write English lyrics for a song that had been a huge hit in France: Claude FranÃ§ois and Jacques Revaux's Comme d'habitude. ""I went, 'yeah, that'd be a good exercise,'"" he recalled, ""So I wrote a lyric for it, called Even a Fool Learns to Love"". Not having a band at the time, Bowie had simply played the Claude FranÃ§ois song at home and recorded his own version over the top, singing in time to the French lyrics. But Bowie's words were rejected and Paul Anka got the job instead. His version was called My Way, and it became a global smash for Frank Sinatra. ""I was so pissed,"" said Bowie later. ""I thought, 'God, I could have done with that money'. And so I wrote Life on Mars, which was sort of a Sinatra-ish parody, but done in a more rock style."" The demo for Even a Fool Learns to Love was unearthed last year and broadcast for the first time on the BBC Four seriesThe People's History of Pop. It is not, to be brutally honest, worth seeking out. The story of how it inspired one of Bowie's signature songs can be heard on the Radio 2 documentaryExploring Life On Mars. Given the number of musical personas Bowie adopted throughout his 50-year career, it is hard to find an artist he hasn't inspired. But 20-year-old pop singer Lorde -who performed a tribute to the star at last year's Brit Awards,externaland is pictured above with Bowie and Tilda Swinton - revealed the star personally intervened in her career. Writing on Facebook,external, she recalled how Bowie had asked to meet her after she played a concert in honour of Swinton's birthday in 2013. ""I've never met a hero of mine and liked it,"" she said. ""It just sucks, the pressure is too huge, you can't enjoy it. ""David was different. That night something changed in me - I felt a calmness grow, a sureness. ""I realised I was proud of my spiky strangeness because he had been proud of his. And I know I'm never going to stop learning dances, brand new dances."" Francis Whately's documentary, Bowie: The Last Five Years gave fans a rare glimpse of Bowie's sense of humour. He was seen larking around backstage, sticking flashing baubles to his face and attacking his band with a plastic crow. Towards the end of the film, Whately excavated a rare interview, in which the star was asked what he wanted be remembered for. ""I'd love people to believe,"" he said, ""That I really had great haircuts."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

How battle for Mosul is gathering pace,"Iraqi forces have gained ground since launching a ""second phase"" in the operation The announcement by the Iraqi military that its forces havereached the Tigris Riverfor the first time in the battle for Mosul marks a significant moment in the 12-week campaign to recapture so-called Islamic State's (IS) last major stronghold in the country. Lieutenant General Abdal-Amir al-Lami, the Iraqi deputy chief of staff for operations, confirmed on 8 January that the Iraqi security forces (ISF) had seized the eastern end of one of the bridges linking the two sides of the city. A solid foothold seems to have been made in the riverside Beladiyat area, which is the site of many of Mosul's newer municipality offices and the Salam Hospital, the scene of adaring earlier attempt,externalby Iraqi forces to punch a corridor through to the river. North of Beladiyat, the 2nd Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) brigade experienced a simultaneous breakthrough towards the river in the Muthana neighbourhood and the ancient ruins of Nineveh. Gains are also being made in north-east Mosul, as the 1st and 3rd ISOF brigades attempt the recapture of the Kindi military base and adjacent upper income neighbourhoods. Broad-based advances suggest that IS resistance is ""showing signs of collapse"" in east Mosul, as suggested by Brett McGurk, the senior US official in the counter-IS coalition,in a tweet,externalon 8 January. One causal factor was clearly the concentration of all available ISF forces in east Mosul, achieved by closing down ancillary assaults north and south-west of the city. During a two-week hiatus the 2nd Emergency Response Brigade and 5th Federal Police division troops were shifted from areas south-west of Mosul to new positions east of the Tigris. These forces re-energised the ISF thrust towards Beladiyat and the bridges inside the city when the offensive wasrestarted on 29 December. Another accelerant was the coalition's role in reconfiguring the Iraqi battle plan, fostering greater co-ordination between Iraqi headquarters and providing more powerful artillery and air strikes. The latter boost in firepower required US howitzers to be deployed at the eastern edges of Mosul city. Over 400 coalition special forces were inserted into the urban battle as advisers and strike co-ordinators, often well within the range of IS attacks. Steady advances in east Mosul will provide a welcome bright spot as the gruelling battle for the city enters its 12th week. Iraqi forces are now present in 35 of east Mosul's 47 neighbourhoods, including the largest and most densely populated parts of the east side. Thousands of Iraqis have fled the fighting, though not as many as some predictions Hard fighting may still be ahead for Mosul University and the Kindi army base, both of which are in east Mosul. None of the 29 large and heavily populated west Mosul neighbourhoods have been liberated. Unless an unexpectedly rapid collapse of IS unfolds, the western side of the city will need to be assaulted in a separate military operation launched after some weeks of reset and planning for the ISF. This suggests that east Mosul may be cleared in January 2017 or early February, whilst the clearance of west Mosul may stretch well into the second quarter of 2017. The sequential clearing of different quarters of Mosul city may succeed in limiting the time that civilians are exposed to intense combat in individual neighbourhoods. Thus far the battle has seen far less damage done to Mosul's infrastructure than previous attritional struggleslike Ramadi in Iraq or Kobane in Syria, though the daily damage to neighbourhoods has intensified since the offensive restarted. Frame from video by Amaq news agency appearing to show a collapsed section of the Old Bridge The coalition has specifically sought to minimise the cost and time required to rebuild bridges,selectively destroyingeasy-to-replace spars and off-ramps to deny the bridges to IS but to leave them quickly repairable after the battle. The number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Mosul city itself was estimated by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs at42,000,externalin early December, around 4-6% of Mosul's remaining population and a far lower number than many pre-battle projections. The flow of IDPs from the city has increased since 29 December according to OCHA, including15,942,externalin the eight days after the offensive restarted. However, OCHA also announced that security in liberated areas has also allowed14,000,externalIDPs to return to Mosul city. Away from most media coverage, the liberated zones of east Mosul city are witnessing the gradual return of policing, running water and diesel-run neighbourhood electrical generation networks. Most important, the cross-sectarian and multi-ethnic ISF in Mosul city have broadly been accepted by local Sunni Arab residents, who seem grateful for their largely humane treatment of the population and their sacrifices in coming to the distant northern Sunni city of Mosul to liberate it from IS. IS is expected to step up attacks in other parts of Iraq as it loses hold of Mosul The most likely IS response to the loss of east Mosul will be efforts to intensify anti-civilian bombings in Baghdad, where seven bombings in the first eight days of 2017 have killed 87 people and wounded as many as 231. The Iraqi government and coalition are currently building up Baghdad's perimeter defences, installing sensors on tethered blimps and launching disruptive security operations in the rural outskirts of the city to break up bombing cells. Dr Michael Knights is the Lafer Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He has worked in all of Iraq's provinces, and spent time embedded with the Iraqi security forces. His recent report on post-battle stabilisation of Mosul is available via theWashington Institute website,external.

Could a national maximum wage work?,"Jeremy Corbyn has called for a high earnings cap In 1942, Franklin D Roosevelt - not known as a Socialist radical, though he had his moments - proposed that anyone earning over $25,000 should be taxed at 100%. Effectively, the President of the United States was calling for a high pay cap of, in today's money, just under $400,000 or Â£330,000. Interviewed this morning on the Today programme,Jeremy Corbyn rekindled the debateon high pay, saying that a ""cap"" should be considered for the highest earners. With legislation if necessary. Franklin D Roosevelt - not known as a socialist radical Given that a direct limit (making it ""illegal"" for example for anyone to earn over, say, Â£200,000) would be almost impossible to enforce in a global economy where income takes many forms - salary, investments, returns on assets - very high marginal rates of tax could be one way to control very high levels of pay. Another could be by imposing limits on the pay ratio between higher and lower earners in a company - possibly a more politically palatable option. The High Pay Centre, for example, supports considering this approach. Their research reveals the ratio has increased substantially. ""The average pay of a FTSE 100 chief executive has rocketed from around Â£1m a year in the late 1990s - about 60 times the average UK worker - to closer to Â£5m today, more than 170 times,"" the organisation said in 2014. Firms have been under fire over high rates of executive pay In its submission to the review of corporate governance by the House of Commons business select committee in October, the centre said executive pay was ""out of control"". It is only relatively recently that high marginal rates of tax have been dropped as a way of limiting ""out of control"" pay. Although America's Congress couldn't quite stomach the wartime 100% super tax (the actor Ann Sheridan commented ""I regret that I have only one salary to give to my country"") by 1945 the marginal rate on incomes over $200,000 was 94%. Post-war, very high rates of income tax on high earners were the norm and income inequality was far lower. By the 1970s in the UK, the marginal rate on higher incomes was 84%, a figure that rose to 98% with the introduction of a surcharge on investment income. Denis Healey, then the Labour chancellor, famously said he wanted to ""squeeze the rich until the pips squeak"" - a quote he subsequently denied. The mood changed with economic stagnation, industrial strife and the arrival of mainstream monetarism and its political leaders - Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Strikers gather round a brazier at a picket line in London in 1979 They built an economic and political philosophy based on a belief that it wasn't the state's job to spend, in Thatcher's famous phrase, ""other people's money"" - it was better to allow people to retain the money they earned and spend it as they saw fit, even if it was an awful lot. Lower levels of income tax were the result and economic growth strengthened for a period. Income inequality also grew, maybe a price worth paying for the economic riches which, it was argued, were flowing around the country. For many, especially since the financial crisis, the pendulum has swung back, away from lower taxes towards a more punitive approach to high incomes. Mr Corbyn was speaking about a belief that some individuals at the top of the income scale now have far too much money to spend compared with the ""just about managing"" classes. Theresa May has also made it clear that ""fat cat pay"" is on her radar. The economics of high pay and whether it should be limited are based on a judgement between two competing interests. The first is summed up by the Laffer Curve, popularised by the US economist Arthur Laffer, which argues that if income taxes are too high (or pay limits in any guise too strong) they reduce the incentive to work, which ultimately affects growth, national wealth and government income. At its most basic, under the ""Laffer rules"" a 0% income tax rate would collect no revenue. And a 100% income tax rate would also collect no revenue, as no one would bother working. Ronald Reagan slashed the top rates of US income tax It has been used from Reagan onwards as the economic underpinning for an argument that lower taxes support growth. In the 1980s, US government revenues increased as taxes were cut, although that was as much to do with general strong levels of growth as it was to do with the tax cuts themselves. The second, contrary, economic pressure, as countless studies from the World Bank and others have shown, is that countries with high levels of income inequality have lower levels of growth. Tackling that inequality, by whatever method, incentivises people to work more effectively. The problem is that lifting lower wages by increasing, for example, productivity levels, could be a more effective way of reducing the gap between low and high pay, although it would take many years of concerted effort to be successful. Since the 1970s, the notion of a government inspired ""incomes policy"" has been - in the popularity stakes - right up there with multi-millionaire bankers at a meeting of Momentum, the organisation that supports Mr Corbyn's Labour leadership. But, ever since the introduction of the minimum wage in the 1990s, the government has made it clear that the amount people are paid is not simply a matter for private businesses and the free market. Mr Corbyn has said he wants to consider a national maximum wage. Many might nod in agreement. How to do it, though, and whether it is economically helpful for growth, is a very different matter.

Brazil prison riots: What's the cause?,"Overcrowding is a serious problem A spate of violence in Brazil's prisons has cast a spotlight on a system which appears to be near a state of collapse. Almost 100 inmates lost their lives in the first week of January alone - brutally murdered, the guards apparently unable to stop the bloodshed. But how has it come to this? A crackdown on violent and drug-related offences in recent years has seen Brazil's prison population soar since the turn of the century. The prison in Roraima state where 33 inmates were killed on 6 January held 1,400 inmates when a deadly riot started. That is double its capacity. Overcrowding makes it hard for prison authorities to keep rival factions separate. It also raises tensions inside the cells, with inmates competing for limited resources such as mattresses and food. In the relatively wealthy state of Sao Paulo, a single guard oversees 300 to 400 prisoners in some prisons, Camila Dias, a sociologist at the Federal University of ABC in Sao Paulo and expert on Brazil's prison system, told Reuters. That means it is relatively easy for prisoners - and gangs - to take control of the facilities. As a result, ""when the prisoners want to have an uprising, they have an uprising,"" Ms Dias said. Drugs gang 'kills 33 inmates' in Brazilian jail Brazil sets out security overhaul after deadly riot Brazil prison riot kills at least 56 Killings are already common within the walls of Brazil's prisons - 372 inmates lost their lives in this way in 2016, according to Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper - but this recent surge has been linked to the breakdown in a two-decade truce of sorts between the country's two most powerful gangs. A lack of guards means prisoners can take control, experts say. Pictured: A riot in 2014 Up until recently, the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command (PCC) drug gang and Rio de Janeiro's Red Command had a working relationship, supposedly to ensure the flow of marijuana, cocaine and guns over Brazil's porous borders and into its cities. But recently they have fallen out - although the exact reasons why remain unclear. And following the government crackdown on criminal gangs, there are thousands of members of both gangs locked up inside Brazilian prisons. Rafael Alcadipani, a public security expert at the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank in Sao Paulo, told Reuters it means any feud between the two sides on the streets will almost certainly spill over into the largely ""self-regulated"" jails. ""We see that as soon as we have a gang war, these killings are inevitably going to happen because the state has no control over the prisons,"" he said. Many Brazilian prisons are underfunded. The army patrols outside a prison in northern Brazil where more than 30 inmates died Following the deadly riots in Amazonas, state governor Jose Melo asked the federal government for equipment such as scanners, electronic tags and devices which block mobile phone signals inside prisons. His request illustrates the lack of basic equipment in prisons which house large numbers of prisoners. He also said that the state police force was struggling to cope and requested that federal forces be sent. Poorly-trained and badly-paid prison guards often face inmates who not only outnumber them but who also feel they have little to lose as they face long sentences already. Following the 1 January riot, which left 56 inmates dead in a prison in Manaus, the Brazilian government announced a plan to modernise the prison system. But with Brazil going through its worst recession in two decades and a 20-year cap on public spending in place, it is hard to see how the government plans to fund it.

Stephen Evans: Can North Korea's nuclear bid be stopped?,"When President Trump (as he will then be) enters the White House, he will have an item flashing as urgent in his email inbox: North Korea. In the election campaign, he offered to sit down with the country's leader Kim Jong-un over a burger, but that generosity seems less likely now. Eight years ago, when President Obama moved in, the tone was similarly helpful. Right at the start of his tenure, the new president made a gesture of conciliation to the North Korean leader, not quite an offer of friendship but an indication that nose-to-nose threats need not be the way. In his inaugural address in 2009, President Obama said he would offer an outstretched hand to those who would ""unclench their fists"". A few months later, Kim Jong-un responded with the launch of a substantial, multi-stage rocket and an underground explosion of a nuclear device. Both tests were seen by the United Nations as a defiant contravention of the policy of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Some presidents talk tough but trip over realities. George W Bush said in 2006 that North Korea launching a long-range missile would be ""unacceptable"" - just before one was launched. A year earlier, he had said that ""a nuclear armed Korea will not be tolerated."" Donald Trump recently tweeted about North Korea's nuclear ambitions Yet, on all expert estimates, North Korea has made substantial progress in achieving that aim, of having a nuclear arsenal capable of devastating cities in the United States at very short notice. The ability is not there yet but many technology experts think it is getting there. So the Obama (and Hillary Clinton) policy of strategic patience is giving way to louder talk of military impatience. The doctrine of squeezing North Korea with sanctions and waiting for change is being supplemented by military plans. South Korea said it was bringing forward plans to form army units trained to ""decapitate"" the regime - in plain English, to kill Kim Jong-un. The outgoing secretary of defence in Washington said that any test of a long-range missile which threatened the United States or its allies (South Korea and Japan) would result in it being shot down. North Korea's nuclear programme: How advanced is it? Trump: North Korea intercontinental missile 'won't happen' How might Donald Trump deal with North Korea's Kim Jong-un? Six ways a Trump presidency changes the world The Pentagon planners are working overtime.  But what are the military options? Not many, is the answer of most experts. Dr Jeffrey Lewis, of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, said that shooting down a test missile fired by North Korea would be very difficult to do and the attempt might lead to massive retaliation by conventional artillery against Seoul, the outskirts of which are within sight of North Korea. He told the BBC that North Korea's nuclear and missile sites were scattered and that, in any case, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) could be launched from mobile trucks. Another expert echoed that view. Rodger Baker, an analyst of the region with Stratfor, a global consultancy on geo-politics, said that the trouble with any limited military action against North Korea was that it could easily trigger all-out conflict. South Korea's capital, Seoul, is within range of North Korean artillery ""They could fire additional short range missiles into South Korea and US military facilities,"" he explained. There is similar scepticism about the idea of assassinating Kim Jong-un in the absence of open war. Dr Heather Williams, who lectures at the Defence Studies Department at King's College London, said: ""If South Korea pursues this option, they are really playing with fire and might be testing whether or not North Korea really will retaliate - but it would be retaliation against South Korea."" She is annoyed at Mr Trump's tweeting - after Kim Jong-un's assertion that North Korea might get ICBM, the president-elect tweeted: ""It won't happen."" Dr Williams added that ""so much of nuclear strategy is about signalling and what type of message you are sending. Deterrence is rooted in signalling, so changing from a very carefully-crafted, nuanced nuclear messaging to nuclear messaging in 140 characters is incredibly dangerous."" Much more likely military options than overt aggression, according to the experts, are attempts to slow the nuclear programme by, say, assassinating scientists or inserting viruses into the industry's computer systems (as was apparently done in the case of Iran). It is worth noting, too, that Iran and North Korea are very different. Iran did not have nuclear devices, whereas North Korea has already detonated five of them and hasa well-developed and large testing site (3D images courtesy of the Nuclear Threat Initiative).,external South Korea says it will form army units to ""decapitate"" - assassinate - North Korea's leadership Iran had elections and so the leadership had to take more account of the economic discontent of the people. It had a much more open society, internally and towards the outside world. All this makes the North Korean nut so much harder to crack. Some experts - and not just from dovish institutions - say that there may come a time soon when the reality of a nuclear North Korea has to be accepted. Eric Gomez, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute in the United States, told the BBC:  ""The US long-term goal is de-nuclearisation and that is a noble long-term goal and I think it should remain a long-term goal. ""But, given the status of their nuclear programme now, I just don't think it's a very realistic goal in the immediate term. ""If we can come to the table over some sort of limitation to the current arsenal in terms of delivery systems, that might be the first step towards a larger agreement down the road."" But there are difficulties with that: Kim Jong-un might not buy it Japan and South Korea would have to accept a nuclear power on their doorstep, albeit one which could not under a deal expand its arsenal to hit the United States Mr ""It won't happen"" Trump might regard accepting a nuclear North Korea as wimpish It is not a word he likes.

'Missing element' found in Earth's core,"This study suggests silicon exists in the Earth's inner core with iron and nickel Japanese scientists believe they have established the identity of a ""missing element"" within the Earth's core. They have been searching for the element for decades, believing it makes up a significant proportion of our planet's centre, after iron and nickel. Now by recreating the high temperatures and pressures found in the deep interior, experiments suggest the most likely candidate is silicon. The discovery could help us to better understand how our world formed. Lead researcher Eiji Ohtani from Tohoku University told BBC News: ""We believe that silicon is a major element - about 5% [of the Earth's inner core] by weight could be silicon dissolved into the iron-nickel alloys."" Hard to reach The innermost part of Earth is thought to be a solid ball with a radius of about 1,200km (745 miles). It is far too deep to investigate directly, so instead scientists study how seismic waves pass through this region to tell them something of its make-up. It is mainly composed of iron, which makes up an estimated 85% of its weight, and nickel, which accounts for about 10% of the core. To investigate the unaccounted for 5% of the core, Eiji Ohtani and his team created alloys of iron and nickel and mixed them with silicon. They then subjected them to the immense pressures and temperatures that exist in the inner core. They discovered that this mixture matched what was seen in the Earth's interior with seismic data. Prof Ohtani said more work was needed to confirm the presence of silicon and that it did not rule out the presence of other elements. Core formation Commenting on the research, Prof Simon Redfern from the University of Cambridge, UK, said:  ""These difficult experiments are really exciting because they can provide a window into what Earth's interior was like soon after it first formed, 4.5 billion years ago, when the core first started to separate from the rocky parts of Earth. ""But other workers have recently suggested that oxygen might also be important in the core."" He said that knowing what is there could help scientists to better understand the conditions that prevailed during the formation of the Earth. In particular whether the early interior was one where oxygen was greatly limited - known as reducing conditions. Or whether oxygen was in abundance, which is described as oxidising. If a larger amount of silicon had been incorporated in Earth's core more than four billion years ago, as suggested by Prof Ohtani's results, that would have left the rest of the planet relatively oxygen rich. But if, instead, oxygen was sucked into the core that would leave the rocky mantle surrounding the core depleted of the element. Prof Redfern said: ""In a way, these two options are real alternatives that depend a lot on the conditions prevailing when Earth's core first began to form. ""The most recent results add to our understanding, but I suspect that they are by no means the last word on the story."" Prof Ohtani presented his research to therecent Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union,externalin San Francisco.

Marissa Mayer not on post-Yahoo board,"Yahoo says its chief executive Marissa Mayer will not be on the board of a company that emerges from the $4.83bn (Â£4bn) takeover deal by Verizon. Yahoo is in the process of selling its email, websites, mobile apps and advertising tools to Verizon. What is left after that sale will be owned by a holding company to be named Altaba. Its main assets will be a 15% stake in Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba and a 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan. Five other current members of the Yahoo board also won't be on the board of the new firm. Ms Mayer is expected to remain with Yahoo's core business. Verizon's deal for Yahoo's core internet assets came under renewed scrutiny last month after the Yahoo disclosed one of thelargest known data breaches in history. Verizon is examining the impact of the data breach and there is speculation that the deal may not go through.

Mini adventure,"""Betty"" the 1999 Paul Smith Mini Cooper adds some fun to private car hire Betty, a resplendent royal blue 1999 Paul Smith Mini Cooper, has just arrived downstairs. Handing over the keys is a tweed-wearing, bearded Tony Grant, who owns 10 such Minis with names like Poppy, Mildred and Lulu. Self-styled ""Head Gasket"" at Small Car Big City, he is adding a new twist to the car hire and car-sharing business. As part of the fun, there are fancy dress outfits in the boot to matchThe Italian Job film,externaltheme, along with a crowbar and a bar of (imitation) gold. I booked Betty through recently launched car-sharing app Turo, which is aiming to bring an Airbnb vibe to the world of wheels. While car-sharing firms, such as ZipCar which owns its own fleet, have been around for more than a decade, so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) car sharing - private owners renting out their cars - hasn't really taken off. And yet, given that we use our cars just 5% of the time, as Andre Haddad, Turo's chief executive tells me, the business potential remains. Small Car Big City founder Tony Grant and one of his beloved Minis This is why Turo, and a handful of other recent start-ups like easyCar, Getaround, and Rentecarlo, are hoping to unlock all this unused capacity sitting idle in the street. ""ZipCar's fleets at their maximum reached 15,000 vehicles, so they were not able to reach massive scale,"" says Mr Haddad. ""They obviously built a very successful company, but globally, hourly car sharing reached, at its peak, less than 1% of the entire car rental market space,"" he adds. For Turo, the minimum rental is a day, he says, and their average is four days. Other firms, like Getaround, which has a presence in 10 US cities, focus more on hourly rentals. Car enthusiast and Turo boss Andre Haddad owns a Porsche 911 Mr Haddad, who describes himself as a car enthusiast, says Turo gives people the opportunity to try out interesting cars, from cute Minis to rugged off-roaders. ""It would be really fun to go out in a Jeep Wrangler if you're going up a mountain, but it doesn't really justify owning one,"" he says. One practical challenge of P2P rental is getting the key to the customer if the car's owner isn't around. Richard Laughton, chief executive of easyCar Club, which launched in 2014, says: ""We provide owners with lockboxes they can attach somewhere outside their house, and send a one-use pin to the renter to take the key out, and put it back at the end."" Next year easyCar Club will try out unlocking cars by mobile app, he says. EasyCar Club owners and renters are vetted by the company Another challenge is overcoming the trust issue. After all, would you rent out your precious motor to a total stranger? ""I think one thing that will continually hold back the P2P model is the reluctance of people to put an asset on a shared platform,"" says Adam Stocker, a researcher at Berkeley University Transportation Sustainability Research Center in California. ""The fear that their vehicle gets trashed, misused, or breaks faster - but this is just human nature."" One early US car-sharing start-up, HiGear, shut down in 2012 following the theft of several members' cars. So most P2P companies engage in detailed vetting of new members, and incorporate feedback and user ratings. Turo says it has developed machine learning tools to help with the screening process. EasyCar believes telematics boxes could help track how renters have used - or abused - the car and act as a sort of onboard policeman. EasyCar Club boss Richard Laughton does not own a car And what if the renter crashes or damages your car? ""Insurance has been a really big challenge,"" admits Jacob Nielsen, co-founder of Rentecarlo, a P2P car-sharing firm founded by ""three guys from Denmark"" two-and-a-half years ago. Admiral Insurance has worked with several P2P start-ups to develop a suitable product, says Mr Nielsen. The insurer even allows renters to earn up to five years' no-claims bonus while driving someone else's car, providing they drive more than 30 days in a year, he says. Such innovations and technological improvements have enabled easyCar to ""double bookings year-on-year"", says Mr Laughton. Other P2P car-sharing firms seem to be enjoying similar rates of growth, as younger people in particular embrace the concept of ""mobility as a service"" and eschew ownership. So what does this mean forcar manufacturers' traditional business models,external? ""I would say 2016 definitely was the year the major auto manufacturers woke up to the shared mobility space,"" says Mr Stocker. Mercedes' P2P car-sharing service Croove lets private owners rent out their cars For example, Mercedes-Benz recently launched a car-sharing app called Croove. In September, Ford bought Chariot, a San Francisco-based crowd-sourced shuttle service, and is even investing in a bike-sharing start-up called Motivate. Manufacturers clearly understand that personal car ownership is becoming old hat. General Motors tried to buy Uber rival Lyft this summer, but was rebuffed, despite both companies joining forces to develop driverless taxis. Car sharing may worry public authorities less than house sharing. Property-sharing giant Airbnb has recently come under fire from city authorities - in Amsterdam, for instance - over concerns that it increases city centre congestion and enables guests to avoid paying hotel tax. But car-sharing companies like Turo and others could help decrease the overall number of cars on the road to start with as fewer people see the need to own their own vehicle. But once driverless cars come in, authorities might worry they pose threat to public transport systems, some analysts believe. ""It would be very inexpensive to run electric driverless Uber taxis that go around cities and provide transport in a fluid way,"" says Philippe Houchois, an automotive sector analyst at equity research company Jefferies. ""If you get to a point where your cost-per-mile is less than Â£1,"" says Mr Houchois, ""public transport would seem less attractive."" Paradoxically, we could then see a rise in car numbers on our roads, not a reduction.

'A love letter',"Kidman says she is 'so connected' to the issues portrayed in Lion Nicole Kidman has said she was brought to tears by the ""beautiful"" depiction of an adoptive mother's love in her latest film, Lion. The actress, who plays adoptive mother Sue Brierley, has two adopted children in real life. Kidman told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she wished she had more children. But, she added, her husband Keith Urban tells her to ""shut down"" such urges. Kidman told the programme that - in showing how an adoptive mother's love for a child is the same as a birth mother's - the film makes her cry. ""When it's shown in the film with such warmth and openness and compassion, I think that's a beautiful thing for people to see."" She said it brings her to tears ""probably because I'm so connected to it, and it's so succinctly put by the writer"". Kidman has two adopted children with her former husband Tom Cruise - Isabella, 24, and Connor, 21. The film tells the story of a young boy adopted by an Australian couple In the film, directed by Garth Davis, her character adopts a five-year-old boy, Saroo, from an orphanage in the Indian city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). Saroo had become tragically separated from his family after he boarded a train and was transported hundreds of miles from his rural village. Kidman says one scene in the film - which is based on a true story - epitomises an adoptive mother's love for her children. When Saroo begins his journey to find his birth mother, Kidman says her character Sue Brierley ""wanted his biological mother to know she'd kept him safe [and] raised him with love into a beautiful human being"". Kidman describes the film as a ""love letter"" to all her children, and ""to other mothers and children too"". ""It's rare that we get [to talk about] unconditional love - that no matter where you go, what you do, what your journey isâ¦ I'm here and I love you."" Kidman has two young children, Sunday Rose, eight, and Faith, six, with country musician Urban. Kidman, 49, is the same age her grandmother was when she gave birth for the final time. She told Victoria Derbyshire she wished she had ""two or three more children"". But, she added: ""My husband says 'that is the wanting mind Nicole, shut it down'."" Nevertheless, Kidman told Derbyshire: ""I love children, I love raising children. My sister has six childrenâ¦ they make me feel good. ""I love being around them, the ups and downs, watching them grow - the things they say and teach."" Kidman said she did not have any regrets in life, counting herself as ""blessed"". But, she added: ""Would I enjoy giving to more young people? Yes."" The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

Soldiers in love,"US Army interpreter Nayyef Hrebid and Iraqi soldier Btoo Allami fell in love at the height of the Iraq War. It was the start of a dangerous 12-year struggle to live together as a couple. In 2003, Nayyef Hrebid found himself in the midst of the Iraq war. The fine art graduate had signed up to be a translator for the US Army after he couldn't find a job. ""I was based in Ramadi, which was the worst place at that time. We would go out on patrols and people would be killed by IEDs [roadside bombs] and snipers. I was asking myself: 'Why am I here? Why am I doing this?'"" However, a chance encounter with a soldier in the Iraqi army changed everything. ""One day I was sitting outside and this guy came out of the shower block. I saw his hair was shiny and very black and he was smiling. I just thought, 'Oh my god, this guy is really cute.' ""I felt like something beautiful had happened in this very bad place."" Hrebid was secretly gay. He hadn't come out because same-sex relationships are taboo in Iraq and gay people are at risk of violent attacks. ""In Iraq being gay is seen as very wrong and brings shame on your family. You can even get killed for it so you have to be very careful,"" he says. Hrebid worked as a translator for the US army What Hrebid didn't realise was that the soldier, Btoo Allami, was also attracted to him. ""I had this strange feeling like I had been looking for him. My feelings grew over time and I knew I wanted to talk to him,"" Allami says. They had a chance to get to know each other when they took part in a mission to clear insurgents from the city's general hospital. ""After patrols we would come back to the safe house and one day Btoo invited me over to eat food and talk with him and the other soldiers,"" Hrebid says. ""We talked night after night and my feelings for him grew. "" Three days after the dinner, Hrebid and Allami found an excuse to go outside to talk on their own. They sat in a dark parking lot, full of US Humvees. ""I felt very close to Nayyef and I felt it was time for me to say something,"" Allami says. ""So I told him about my feelings and that I loved him. And then he kissed me and left. It was an amazing night. I didn't eat for two days afterwards."" Btoo, pictured by a Humvee, was a sergeant in the Iraqi army The relationship swiftly developed and they spent an increasing amount of time together at the camp. ""On missions I'd try to be close to him, when I should have been with the Americans. We would walk together and we took some pictures together,"" Hrebid says. Listen to Nayyef Hrebid and Btoo Allamispeaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service Get the Outlook podcastfor more extraordinary real-life stories Their American and Iraqi colleagues soon noticed. ""I was telling my American captain about Btoo and he helped bring him over to stay with me at the American camp for a few nights,"" says Hrebid. ""But some of the other soldiers stopped talking to me after they found out I was gay. One of my translator friends from my home city ended up hitting me with a big stick, which broke my arm."" In 2007, Hrebid and Allami were both deployed to Diwaniyah in southern Iraq. They were lucky to be in the same city but still had to keep their relationship secret. But in 2009, Hrebid applied for asylum in America, as his long involvement with the US Army made it too dangerous to stay. ""I thought I could go and then it would be easy to apply for Btoo to come afterwards,"" Hrebid says. ""I knew if we stayed in Iraq we had no future. We were going to end up married to women and hiding our whole lives. But I had watched the TV series Queer As Folk and I realised there were gay communities on the other side of the world."" Hrebid was granted asylum and settled in Seattle. However, his attempts to get a visa for Allami to join him were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Allami's family had discovered he was gay and started putting pressure on him to marry a woman.  With help from Hrebid's friend Michael Failla, a refugee activist, he escaped to Beirut. ""It wasn't an easy decision to make as I had a 25-year contract with the army,"" Allami says. ""Plus I was the only one supporting my family. But I knew I had to be with Nayyef."" Allami (left) and Hrebid knew they couldn't live openly as a gay couple in Iraq Allami applied to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for resettlement but his tourist visa ran out before they resolved his case. As an illegal immigrant he had to steer clear of soldiers and checkpoints to avoid being sent back to Iraq. ""The waiting was hard,"" says Allami. ""I felt like I was stuck and not moving forward. But then I would speak to Nayyef and that always made me feel stronger."" They talked to each other on Skype every day. ""He would watch me cook breakfast and I would watch him cook dinner and we would talk as if we lived together,"" Hrebid says. Although homosexuality is legal in Iraq, activists say many gay men, and some women, have died in targeted killings In 2012, aBBC World Service investigationfound that law enforcement agencies had been involved in systematic persecution of homosexuals The Islamic State group killed dozens of gay men between 2015 and 2016 - many werethrown to their deathsfrom high-rise buildings Allami was interviewed by the UNHCR several times, but his application was beset with problems and delays. Again Michael Failla provided support, flying twice to Beirut to advocate on Allami's behalf. ""I call him my godfather,"" Allami says. But while awaiting the UNHCR decision Allami got an interview at the Canadian Embassy in Lebanon. With Failla's help he was able to fly to Vancouver in September 2013. The couple were now living just a tantalising 140 miles (225 km) apart across the border. ""I came across every weekend to see Btoo and any day I had off work,"" Hrebid says. The couple got married in Canada in 2014 on Valentine's Day. Hrebid then applied for a US visa for Allami as his husband. In February 2015 they were invited for an interview with US immigration in Montreal. ""It was a long flight, six or seven hours, and it was freezing - like 27 below zero,"" says Hrebid. ""The officer asked us three or four questions and after about 10 minutes she told Btoo: 'You've been approved to live as an immigrant in the United States.' ""I had to ask her to repeat it again. I put my hand over my mouth to stop myself screaming. We went outside and I was just crying and shaking. I could not believe it was finally happening. We were going to live together in the place where we wanted to live."" In March 2015, Hrebid and Allami travelled from Vancouver to Seattle by bus.  They decided to have another wedding ceremony in the US and tied the knot in Washington State. ""We did not celebrate the first one and we wanted to have a dream wedding,"" says Hrebid. ""It was the most happy day of my life."" Today they live together in an apartment in Seattle. Hrebid, who now works as a home decor department manager is a US citizen. Allami has a green card and is due to become a citizen next year. He works as a building supervisor. Their story has been turned in to a documentary called Out of Iraq, which premiered at the LA Film Festival last year. ""We do not have to hide. I can hold his hand when we walk down the street,"" Hrebid says. Allami agrees. ""It's so different for us now,"" he says. ""Before we were so hopeless but now we feel like a family. It's a gay-friendly city. I'm living the dream. I'm free.""

Was 27 December the busiest day in NHS history?,"The claim:Tuesday 27 December was the busiest day in the history of the National Health Service. Reality Check verdict:In relation to attendance at type-one accident and emergency departments (the general A&E departments at big hospitals), Mr Hunt is correct. That's a reasonable measure of how busy the NHS is, but other measures suggest different days were busier. Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt made the claim on BBC Radio 4's Today programme as he thanked staff for their work over Christmas. NHS Englandpublishes daily statistics,externalduring the winter for several metrics to do with NHS services, so we can look into whether it is the case. We can assume he was talking about the NHS in England only, because health is devolved, so he is not in charge of the NHS in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The number of people attending accident and emergency departments is an important indicator of demand for hospital services. On 27 December, there were 60,215 attendances at A&E departments. That is a high level, but it's not the highest for the month, which was set at 60,692 on 5 December. But it turns out that Mr Hunt was talking about only type-one A&E departments, which is what most people would think of as an A&E department. Type-two are specialist units, such as Moorfields Eye Unit, while type-three are GP-led walk-in centres. There were 46,315 attendances at type-one A&E departments, which is the highest of the month. Comparisons with previous years are difficult due to changes in coverage and figures not being broken down in the same way. Another important measure is the number of emergency admissions, which was 13,715 on 27 December. That is a high figure, but the number was higher on each of the following three days - it was 14,649 on 28 December. Looking at the proportion of beds occupied: on 27 December, 90.5% of the total number of available beds were occupied. That's actually quite low by the standards of last month - there were higher figures on 24 days in December. NHS England says that the week ending 1 January 2017 was the busiest week for the NHS 111 24-hour non-emergency service since it began in August 2010, but we do not get that figure broken down by day so cannot say whether the Tuesday was the busiest day. We also do not have daily figures for how busy other parts of the NHS were, such as GPs.
