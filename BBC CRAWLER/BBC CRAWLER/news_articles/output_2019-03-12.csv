Any sign of May changing course?,"Second time very unlucky. The tweaks to the deal with the EU that the prime minister sweated for more than a month to achieve were to little purpose. The government was, again, comprehensively defeated, this time by almost 150 votes. One senior cabinet minister said this afternoon another thumping defeat would mean that she ""has to change course"". So far, she has shown no sign of that, repeating, as we have heard her say so very many times at the despatch box, that she believes her deal is still the best one. But neither did she move away from the promises she has made more recently, to give MPs a vote on whether they want to stop us leaving without a formal deal at the end of this month. MPs reject Mayâs EU withdrawal deal again There is already consternation in the Commons over her additional pledge that leaving without a deal remains the default option. The vote will, though, after pressure from colleagues, be a free vote where Tories can vote as they wish. That might not sound like a big deal, but for the government to let its own troops vote as they like on an issue that's so important is extremely unusual. And if, as is likely, they rule out leaving with no deal for now, on Thursday she confirmed another vote for delaying Brexit. What isn't clear from all of that is how the prime minister actually intends to dig herself out of this dreadful political hole. Some of her colleagues around the Cabinet table think it shows she has to tack to a closer deal with the EU. Some of them believe it's time now to go hell-for-leather to leave without an overarching deal but move to make as much preparation as possible, and fast. Other ministers believe genuinely, still with around two weeks to go, and an EU summit next week, there is still time to try to manoeuvre her deal through - somehow. The response of the 27 other EU countries to any request for an extension would be influential too. But that's an argument for another day, and there are likely to be many, for sure. You might wonder how has Theresa May found herself in this position again? When she hailed a revised deal last night in Strasbourg then crashed to defeat again. Her rivals and friends would give a long list of reasons. Her own difficulties in deploying the authority of Number 10, to charm and promise, to chivvy reluctant backbenchers, are well known. The grumpy dynamics and misunderstandings with the EU have played a part too. Decades of disputes over Europe inside the Tory Party are at the root - and part of today's problem. But above all, Theresa May as prime minister has been trying to achieve what would have been distinctly challenging for any leader to pull off at any time - to complete a grand project, abhorred by many, adored by others - to persuade Parliament to unplug the UK from the European Union without a majority in Parliament. Her decision to gamble with a small majority in 2017 haunts her profoundly still. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know?

Government has no plans for border checks,"MPs will now get a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal on 29 March and, if that fails, one on whether Brexit should be delayed The BBC understands the UK government does not intend to collect customs duties or have any other controls at the Irish border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Instead it will rely on self-reporting by businesses. Details of how the UK will manage the border if there is no deal will be published on Wednesday. Meanwhile the DUP will vote against a motion in Parliament that would rule out the UK leaving the EU with no deal. It is also understood the government's border plan will suggest an app-based system to record cross border trading. Brexit: All you need to know Brexit deal: How did my MP vote? Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? It is still not clear what the Irish government will do on its side of the border if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. The government has consistently said it will do everything in its power to avoid a hardening of the border whatever the circumstances. The prime ministerlost a second vote on her dealin Parliament by 149 votes on Tuesday evening. Those voting against the deal included the 10 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs. DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told BBC News NI that the DUP would vote against a motion on Wednesday that would rule out the UK leaving the EU without a deal. He said the prime minister ""should be saying to the EU, 'forget about this deal. It was voted down comprehensively twice in the House of Commons, here is something we could properly spend our time between now and the end of June working on"". The border issue has been politically sensitive and the government has resisted outlining a policy until now. Addressing the Commons, the prime minister said that if MPs voted against the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March then there would be a further vote on Thursday on whether Brexit should be delayed. She said failing to reach a deal would do ""potential damage to the union...when one part of our union is without governance"", referencing the stalemate in the Stormont assembly. Northern Ireland has been without devolved government for more than two years after a power-sharing arrangement collapsed. Protests have taken place at the Irish border arguing against any return of physical infrastructure Opposition to the government's plan focused on thebackstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish borderafter Brexit in the event of a wider trade deal not being reached. Although the prime minister said on Monday that she had secured legally binding changes to her deal, legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that the UK would have no legal means of leaving the backstop without EU agreement. For that reason, the DUP said its 10 MPs would vote against the deal again, having opposed it in January when it was first voted on in Parliament. What is DUP's Brexit talks hope? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Mr Wilson, who had warned his partywould not back the deal because enough progress had not been made on the backstop, said the government needed to ""respect the constitutional and economic integrity"" of the UK.

Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the result showed the ""absolute disregard for the people of Ireland"", and that no-deal planning needed to be intensified. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party was extremely disappointed that the deal had been rejected again and called for an extension to Article 50: the legal process that triggered the Brexit process, in order to avoid a no-deal exit. Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson urged ""calm heads"" and that a short technical extension should be ""seriously considered"", while Alliance leader Naomi Long called for another referendum as ""a matter of urgency"". ""The clearest, most coherent and most democratic route through this impasse lies with a people's vote, including both the prime minister's deal and the Remain option,"" she said. TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy PM) Simon Coveney said a no-deal Brexit ""looks closer now than it did a few hours ago"", because of the result. In an interview with Irish national broadcaster RTÃ, he stressed that the focus must be on London, adding that's ""where the crisis is"". He said the Irish government had already done a large amount of no-deal planning, with its omnibus no-deal bill currently going through the Oireachtas (Irish houses of parliament.) In a joint statement, the UK's four farming union presidents, including Ivor Ferguson of Ulster Farmers' Union, said it is ""critical"" that a clear strategy is now identified to try and find a deal that Parliament can support. The Federation of Small Businesses in NI said the result had ""further heightened uncertainty"" and was another setback for businesses. The NI Retail Consortium said that retailers are ""now simply beyond frustration at the lack of certainty and clarity over future trading"", while Retail NI called for an extension of Article 50 as well. ""Every element of the Northern Ireland business community, trade unions and voluntary sector is speaking with one very clear voice on Brexit - we need a deal,"" said Glyn Roberts, its chief executive. The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 after voting to leave in 2016. The UK and EU have been engaged in negotiations for two years, with the issue of the Irish border the sticking point. Brexit's border drama nears final act Both sides committed to avoid a hard Irish border - the return of checks or physical infrastructure - along the 310-mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They agreed to a backstop: an insurance policy to maintain an open border unless and until another solution is found. But the DUP and other parties at Westminster argued that the backstop posed a risk to the integrity of the union by creating an ""Irish Sea border"", and secondly, that it tied the UK to EU rules indefinitely with no say in them. But a majority of business and farming groups in Northern Ireland, as well as other political parties, had supported the backstop and the government's deal.

Europe and India join Boeing aircraft ban after crash,"The European Union and India have banned the Boeing 737 Max from flying over their airspace to ensure passenger safety. They join a long list of countries in suspending the plane, including the UK. It comes afteran Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people on board. It was the second fatal accident involving the 737 Max 8 model in less than five months. US officials say the aircraft are still safe to fly. However, the US Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union is now calling for the Federal Aviation Administration ""to temporarily ground the 737 Max fleet in the US out of an abundance of caution"". India's Ministry of Civil Aviation announced that it would ground the Boeing 737-Max planes ""immediately"". It said: ""These planes will be grounded till appropriate modifications and safety measures are undertaken to ensure their safe operations."" It following a similar decision by the EU Aviation Safety Agency which said it is suspending the aircraft ""as a precautionary measure"". Earlier today, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was banning the plane, joining other countries including China. Investigators have recovered the flight recorders from the Ethiopian Airlines plane and are currently examining the data to determine what caused the crash. EU Aviation Safety Agency said: ""The accident investigation is currently ongoing, and it is too early to draw any conclusions as to the cause of the accident."" American and Southwest airlines continue to fly their 737 Max 8s in the US The CAA said its directive would remain in place until further notice. It said it took the decision because it did not currently have ""sufficient information"" from the flight data recorder about the fatal crash. Tui Airways and Norwegian both operate the Boeing Max 8 in the UK as part of their fleets. One Turkish Airlines flight to Birmingham turned around and returned to Istanbul. And a Norwegian Air plane from Stockholm to Tel Aviv turned back over Romania. A Tui statement confirmed their 737 Max 8 aircraft were grounded. ""Any customers due to fly home today on a 737 Max 8 from their holiday will be flown back on another aircraft,"" it read. ""Customers due to travel in the coming days will also travel on holiday as planned on other aircraft."" Norwegian said it had also suspended flights of the aircraft and apologised for the inconvenience to passengers. India's SpiceJet, which has an estimated 13 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in its fleet, has suspended the aircraft. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has declared the 737 Max 8 airworthy. But the largest operator of 737 Max 8s in America, Southwest Airlines, is offering passengers scheduled to fly on one of the Boeing planes the chance to change their bookings. Rival American Airlines said its ""standard policies for changes still apply"". Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running to be the Democrats' presidential candidate, called on the FAA ""to get these planes out of the sky."" Boeing has confirmed that for the past few months it has been developing a ""flight control software enhancement"" for the aircraft, but says it is confident they are safe to fly. More than $27bn (Â£21bn) has been wiped off the company's market value since the close of trading on Friday. The delay that saved a man's life More about Boeing 737 Max 8 Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline In the aftermath of the accident, Ethiopia, Singapore, China, France, Ireland, Germany, Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia have all temporarily suspended the 737 Max. Singapore's Changi Airport is the world's sixth busiest and a major hub connecting Asia to Europe and the US, but only a handful of airlines operate the Max 8 aircraft in and out of the country.

"Boeing 737 Max 8 airworthy, US says","This video can not be played The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza, at the scene, said there was a huge crater at the site of the crash The US Federal Aviation Administration has told airlines it believes Boeing's 737 Max 8 model to be airworthy, after two fatal crashes inside six months. An Ethiopian Airlines plane en route from Addis Ababa to Nairobi crashed six minutes after take-off on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. The incident followed Lion Air 737 Max 8 crash in October that killed 189. Some in the aviation community have called for the aircraft to be grounded pending a full investigation. But late on Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a ""continued airworthiness notification"" saying the plane was safe to fly. China, Indonesia, and Ethiopia on Monday ordered their airlines to ground the jet. Aerolineas of Argentina, Mexico's Aeromexico and Brazil's Gol have also suspended flights of the aircraft. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore on Tuesday said it was ""temporarily suspending operation of all variants of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft into and out of Singapore"". The suspension will take effect from 14:00 local time (06:00 GMT). Other airlines kept flying the 737 Max 8 after Boeing said it was safe. Shares in Boeing fell by 12.9% on Monday in the wake of the crash. US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the FAA would ""take immediate and appropriate action"" if a defect was found in the plane. FAA chief Dan Elwell said the notification ""informs the international community where we are and (gives) ... one answer to the whole community"". The delay that saved a man's life More about Boeing 737 Max 8 Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org and a member of the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee, called for the plane to be grounded. ""The FAA's 'wait and see' attitude risks lives as well as the safety reputation of the US aviation industry,"" Mr Hudson said in a statement on Monday. The aircraft came down near the town of Bishoftu, 60km (37 miles) south-east of the capital. The cause of the disaster is not clear, but the pilot had reported difficulties and asked to return to Addis Ababa. Investigators have found the cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder  but it will be a while before the findings are made public. Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitorFlightradar24,externalreported that the plane's ""vertical speed was unstable after take-off"". The pilot was named as Senior Capt Yared Getachew,external, who Ethiopian Airlines said had a ""commendable performance"" over more than 8,000 hours in the air. Several witnesses who worked in the farmland below the plane's flight path told the Reuters news agency they heard loud rattling noises coming from the aircraft. ""When it was hovering, fire was following its tail, then it tried to lift its nose,"" said one witness, Gadisa Benti. ""When it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up. It went straight to the ground with its nose, it then exploded."" Rolled out in 2017, the Max 8 is the latest iteration of the 737 line. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the model of 5,011 orders. The plane that crashed was among six of 30 that Ethiopian Airlines had ordered as part of its expansion.It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"",externalon 4 February, the airline said. Airlines ground 737 Max 8 jets Who's still flying the Max 8 Boeing said it was ""deeply saddened"",externalby the crash and was sending a team to provide technical assistance. Following last October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. The anti-stall system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, preliminary findings suggested. The Lion Air plane was also new and the accident happened soon after take-off. What October's Max 8 crash told us How could a brand new plane crash? After that accident, Boeing sent an emergency notice to airlines warning them of a problem with the anti-stall system. Ethiopian Airlines shared this image of CEO Tewolde Gebremariam at the crash site Boeing is expected to release a software patch to the system to deal with the issue, Reuters reports. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. There were people of more than 30 nationalities on the flight, including 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and nine Britons (two of whom were dual nationals travelling on non-British passports). Among the Canadians was a family of six, originally from India. Kosha Vaidya, 37, and her husband Prerit Dixit, 45 were taking their 14-year-old daughter Ashka and 13-year-old daughter Anushka to Nairobi - where Kosha was born - along with her parents, Pannagesh Vaidya, 73, and Hansini Vaidya, 67. There were also eight Italians, eight Chinese, eight Americans, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Germans, four Indians and four people from Slovakia on board.

Airlines ground Boeing 737 Max 8 jets,"Several airlines have grounded Boeing 737 Max 8 jets following a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash. The flight crashed minutes after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. It was the second disaster in five months involving a Boeing 737 Max 8. Aviation regulators in China and Indonesia have suspended flights using that model. Ethiopian Airlines, Cayman Airways and Comair, have also grounded their 737 Max 8 aircraft. Boeing shares fell 13% in early trading on Wall Street, but then recovered some of those losses. While experts warn it is too early to say what caused the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, it comes after the same model crashed in aflight operated by Lion Air in October. The plane lost altitude soon after takeoff, killing 189 people on board. ""Given that two accidents both involved newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 8 planes and happened during take-off phase, they have some degree of similarity,"" the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement. Which airlines have grounded their 737 Max 8 planes? Ethiopian Airlines 'black box found' Boeing faces questions after crash What is the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft? How could a brand new plane crash? The Chinese regulator ordered local carriers to ground all 737 Max 8 flights by 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT). Air China, China Eastern Airlines, Kunming Airlines, and China Southern Airlines are among the carriers affected. More than 90 Boeing 737 Max 8 models are in use in mainland China. The Indonesian Transport Ministry said inspections would begin on 12 March of one Garuda Indonesia plane and 10 operated by Lion Air.  Planes would be grounded until cleared by safety regulator. Shares in French aerospace group Safran, which makes the engines for the 737, fell on Monday. The aircraft is relatively new to the skies, having only been in commercial use since 2017. Boeing said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the crash and is sending a team to provide technical assistance to the investigation. The investigation will be led by Ethiopian authorities co-ordinating with teams of experts from Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board. The Indian government said it was discussing the situation with local regulators. Jet Airways and SpiceJet - neither of which made any comment - both use the aircraft. Comair, which has the franchise for British Airways in South Africa, said it was removing its 737 Max from its schedule while it ""consults with other operators, Boeing and technical experts"". According to Boeing's website, 16 airlines have taken delivery of the 737 Max 8.Â TUI Group has 15 in its fleet and said it is in close contact with the manufacturer, but has no plans to take them out of service.  It is the only airline to have any such planes registered with the UK's Civil Aviation Authority. A spokesperson for Flydubai told Reuters the carrier is ""monitoring the situation"". Norwegian Airlines, which has 18 in its fleet largely flying between Ireland the US, is continuing to use the planes. Its director of flight operations said the airline will follow any recommendations from Boeing and aviation authorities. It has three - including one from London Gatwick to Helsinki - in use today. Singapore's SilkAir said it was in contact with Boeing and all its flights using 737 Max 8 aircraft - of which it has six - are operating as normal, while Air Italy is also operating its planes as normal. Several North American airlines also operate the aircraft and have said they are monitoring the investigation. Southwest Airlines flies 34 of the aircraft and  said it had been in contact with Boeing and was operating as normal. American Airlines and Air Canada each have 24 in their fleet.

US under pressure to ground Boeing aircraft,"Investigators examine wreckage from the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said it will not ground the Boeing 737 Max aircraft despite mounting pressure. The US regulator said a review showed ""no systemic performance issues"" with the aircraft. An Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday killing all 157 people on board, in the second fatal accident involving the 737 Max 8 model in five months. Numerous countries have banned the plane from their airspace. On Wednesday Hong Kong, Vietnam and New Zealand joined the list of countries that had banned 737 Max models. The UK, China, the European Union and Australia had previously done so. Which airlines use the 737 Max 8? Ethiopian Airlines: Who are the victims? Ethiopian Airlines: Flight recorders recovered from crash site Ted Cruz, a Republican senator who chairs a subcommittee on aviation and space, said: ""I believe it would be prudent for the US likewise to temporarily ground 737 Max aircraft until the FAA confirms the safety of these aircraft and their passengers."" Democratic senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal have written to the FAA - which they referred to as ""our aviation safety cop on the beat"" - asking that the Boeing 737 Max should be grounded ""until the agency can conclusively determine that the aircraft can be operated safely"". Democrat presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren said that the FAA should follow other nations' lead ""immediately"" and ""get these planes out of the sky"". Senator Ted Cruz says it would be ""prudent"" for the Boeing 737 Max aircraft to be temporarily grounded And Republican senator Mitt Romney said: ""Out of an abundance of caution for the flying public, the FAA should ground the 737 Max 8 until we investigate the causes of recent crashes and ensure the plane's airworthiness."" But the FAA said that other civil aviation authorities had not ""provided data to us that would warrant action"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Airline workers also want the FAA to ground the Boeing 737 Max. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union said it is calling on the FAA ""to temporarily ground the 737 MAX fleet in the US out of an abundance of caution"". Its president Sara Nelson, said: ""The US has the safest aviation system in the world, but Americans are looking for leadership in this time of uncertainty. ""The FAA must act decisively to restore the public faith in the system. The Allied Pilots Association told its members: ""It is important for you to know that if you feel it is unsafe to work the 737 Max, you will not be forced to fly it."" Southwest Airlines and American Airlines - both major operators of the Boeing 737 Max - are continuing to use the planes. Southwest Airlines is offering passengers scheduled to fly on one of the Boeing planes the chance to change their bookings. American Airlines said its ""standard policies for changes still apply"". The Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft are the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating. The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years.

Avoid no-deal Brexit - business,"Business groups are ""exasperated"" after the Prime Minister's EU withdrawal plan was again rejected by Parliament. They called on MPs to shut down the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and come up with a clear EU exit plan. The City UK, the finance industry body, said leaving without a deal ""would be an own goal of historic proportions"". The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans on Wednesday, including trade tariffs and Irish border proposals. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said the extension of the Brexit process ""should be as short as realistically possible and backed by a clear plan"". ""It's time for Parliament to stop this circus,"" she added. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers' group Make UK, said: ""It is now essential that Parliament brings the curtain down on this farce and removes the risk of no deal. ""That outcome would be disastrous for the UK manufacturing, jeopardising many thousands of jobs in every constituency in the land."" The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans, including tariff rates, on Wednesday. Last week, reports suggested that should the UK leave the EU with no deal in place, the UK governmentmight cut trade tariffs on between 80% and 90% of goods. And on Tuesday, Theresa May said thatno-deal plans for the Irish borderwould be released on Wednesday. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said the public would be hit by no-deal Brexit in the form of tariffs, non-tariff barriers and currency depreciation. These would ""all push up costs and reduce the choice on the shelves we currently enjoy,"" she said. She added that businesses are ""exasperated by the lack of clarity over their future trading arrangements"". ""Hundreds of ships are currently sailing towards Britain without a clear understanding of the tariffs, checks, or documentation requirements, they will face when they arrive,"" she said. Mike Hawes, chief executive of car industry body the SMMT, said the vote to reject Mrs May's deal ""leaves us perilously close to the 'cliff edge'."" ""No-deal would be catastrophic for the automotive industry,"" he said. ""It would end frictionless trade, add billions to the cost of manufacturing and cost jobs. ""UK automotive businesses will be put at immediate risk. Parliament must reject no-deal and take it permanently off the table,"" he added. The pound was volatile ahead of the Commons vote on Tuesday, sinking after the government's senior law officer said the legal risk of the UK being tied to EU rules after Brexit remained unchanged. It regained some ground after the vote, but settled lower. Andrew Wilson, Europe, Middle East and Africa chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said: ""We expect the British pound, which has reversed last night's strength over the course of the day, to weaken further amid prolonged uncertainty. ""That said, ruling out of a 'no-deal' Brexit could provide some support for the currency,"" he added. MPs reject Mayâs EU withdrawal deal again How does Brexit affect the pound?

Ronaldo hat-trick sends Juve through,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 122nd goal in the Champions League in the first half before adding two more after the break Cristiano Ronaldo once again underlined his worth in Europe's elite competition as his hat-trick overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Atletico Madrid to send Juventus into the Champions League last eight. The fans of the Turin club had yet to see their Â£99m summer signing produce the sort of displays in Europe that helped Real Madrid to four Champions League titles in five seasons, but that all changed on a thrilling night inside the Juventus Stadium. Having brought the tie level with two typical headers, Ronaldo capped off another remarkable performance and entered Juventus folklore when he smashed in the tie-winner from the spot four minutes from time, after Federico Bernardeschi had been fouled in the area. It was his 124th goal in the Champions League and eighth hat-trick in the competition. The home fans erupted on the final whistle and the players rushed to Ronaldo. ""It was meant to be a special night and it was, not just for my goals but for the attitude we showed,"" the 34-year-old said. ""That is the sort of mentality you need to win the Champions League. ""This was why Juventus brought me here. To help do things that they have never done before."" Atletico's defeat means they miss out on the chance to play the final at their own Wanda Metropolitano stadium on 1 June. The draw for the last eight will take place on Friday at 11:00 GMT. This is why they brought me here' - Ronaldo's latest iconic Champions League performance Relive the action from the Juventus Stadium Football Daily Podcast: Analysis and reaction after Ronaldo seals famous win Seven-goal Man City thrash Schalke in last 16 Juventus midfielder Sami Khedira posted this team photo after the win Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri set up his team to play a high line and put pressure on their Spanish opponents from the first whistle, with the onus on full-backs Leonardo Spinazzola and Joao Cancelo to advance forward as often as possible. The home side thought that tactic had paid off early when captain Giorgio Chiellini poked home in the fourth minute. However, following a VAR review it was declared that Ronaldo had fouled Jan Oblak in the build-up. There was no need to refer to VAR when Juve next had the ball in the net through Ronaldo's first header past the Slovenian keeper. It gave the home fans, who were handed 30,000 flags to wave, hope that their side could produce one of the great Champions League fightbacks in recent times. That became more likely soon after the restart when Ronaldo headed in his second. It was Cancelo who supplied the cross on this occasion. Oblak appeared to claw his effort off the line before goal-line technology alerted referee Bjorn Kuipers that the goal was good by a matter of inches. For the winner, former Fiorentina player Bernardeschi was pushed inside the area by his tracker Angel Correa after making a 50-yard run - the Juve crowd held their breath for a second before the Dutch official pointed to the spot. It was left for Ronaldo to crown a memorable display by himself and his team by firing his spot-kick to the right of Oblak. Allegri praised his side's measured approach to the task. ""The players have shown great maturity,"" he said. ""There was the risk of having a hysterical match, as if everything had to be done in 10 minutes."" Atletico's World Cup-winning forward Antoine Griezmann had one effort on goal It was perhaps a surprise that Diego Simeone's Atletico were overwhelmed so easily. Since the start of the 2013-14 campaign, they have kept more clean sheets than any other team in the Champions League (34) but on Tuesday La Liga's second-placed side looked likely to concede whenever Juve flung the ball in from the wings. It was expected they would concede the lion's share of possession, but on the rare occasions they did have the ball the three-time finalists were both pedestrian and sloppy. One moment of carelessness led to the opening goal when Alvaro Morata, who started alongside Antoine Griezmann up front, misplaced a header which allowed Emre Can to start the Juve attack. Morata also had his side's best effort when he headed over from six yards. Manager Simeone said: ""I don't think it was our worst performance, nor did I see a lack of character. They simply played better and we have to congratulate them."" Juventus have progressed in a Champions League knockout tie having lost the first leg for the first time since 2005-06 v Werder Bremen. Atletico are the fourth team in Champions League history to win the first leg of a knockout game at home by a 2-0 scoreline but fail to progress to the next round. Atletico failed to have a shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since December 2008 v Marseille. Chiellini is the fifth player reach 500 appearances for Juventus in all competitions after Alessandro del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, Gaetano Scirea and Giuseppe Furino.

Evidence found of massive solar storm,"Scientists have found evidence of a huge blast of radiation from the Sun that hit Earth more than 2,000 years ago. The result has important implications for the present, because solar storms can disrupt modern technology. The team found evidence in Greenland ice cores that the Earth was bombarded with solar proton particles in 660BC. The event was about 10 times more powerful than any since modern instrumental records began. The Sun periodically releases huge blasts of charged particles and other radiation that can travel towards Earth. The particular kind of solar emission recorded in the Greenland ice is known as a solar proton event (SPE). In the modern era, when these high-energy particles collide with Earth, they can knock out electronics in satellites we rely on for communications and services such as GPS. The radiation may also pose a health risk for astronauts. And passengers and crew on commercial aircraft that fly at high altitudes and close to the poles, such as on transatlantic routes, could receive increased radiation doses - though this depends on many variables. Other types of solar radiation events can trigger aurorae in the high atmosphere and shut down electrical grids. Large solar proton events could potentially threaten satellites, such as those that provide GPS services ""There are high-energy solar energetic particle events, or solar proton events. These are the high energy particles directly hitting Earth and producing the particles we measure,"" co-author Raimund Muscheler, from Lund University in Sweden, told BBC News. ""Connected to this are also the lower energy particles that come usually within 1-4 days to Earth. These produce the geomagnetic storms."" The violent solar storms that threaten Earth The two types of particle events may not always coincide, however. Modern instrumental monitoring data extends back about 60 years. So finding an event in 660BC that's an order of magnitude greater than anything seen in modern times suggests we haven't appreciated how powerful such events can be. There wouldn't have been any appreciable signs of the event to people alive at the time. But if there were any associated geomagnetic storms, it might have triggered aurorae at lower latitudes than is usual. 660BC was the date, according to legend, when Japan's first emperor - Jimmu - acceded to the throne. It was the time of the Iron Age in Europe and the Middle East - before the rise of the Roman Empire. The researchers found evidence for the event in the form of radioactive isotopes (particular forms of an element) present in the Greenland ice. These were beryllium-10 and chlorine-36, which are regarded as being of cosmic origin. Researchers have also identified two other large events from the past, which left evidence in both Greenland ice cores and tree rings. The signature researchers look for in tree rings is the isotope carbon-14. One of these, which occurred between 774 and 775AD, was comparable in its magnitude to the one in 660BC. ""Our event is about the same size as [the event in 774/775]. There is some uncertainty, but they look very similar,"" said Dr Muscheler. However, the event in 660BC does not have such a clear carbon-14 signature in tree ring data. Scientists are now working to understand how common the extreme events are, something that could help us plan for big solar storms in future. The research has beenpublished in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).,external Follow Paulon Twitter.,external Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

Hundreds sexually abused at detention unit,"Neville Husband, who died in 2010, was in charge of the kitchen at Medomsley An officer at a former youth detention centre sexually assaulted hundreds of inmates, it has emerged. Neville Husband was jailed in 2003 for abusing five teenagers at the unit in Medomsley, County Durham. Other victims then came forward, and in 2005 Husband admitted four more attacks. He died in 2010. But the BBC'sInside Outprogramme has found the Ministry of Justice has spent Â£3.6m settling 237 compensation claims for sexual abuse committed by him. Medomsley, which closed in 1988, held offenders aged between 17 and 21 who had committed relatively minor crimes. But the regime - the ""short, sharp, shock"" designed to steer them away from a life of crime - was described as brutal, with one former inmate likening it to a ""concentration camp, run on violence"". Five other former officers have now been convictedin connection with the physical abuse. This video can not be played Ray Poar, who was 17 at the time, said the abuse had left him feeling ashamed all his life However, for some victims the abuse was sexual. Husband was in charge of the kitchen and raped and abused young men on an ""almost daily basis"" over a period of years, police said, while other officers allegedly turned a blind eye. One of his victims - who has waived his right to anonymity - was Ray Poar, sent to Medomsley at the age of 17 for stealing biscuits. He said: ""He shoved me against the wall and he had his hand around my throat, squeezing and squeezing tighter and tighter, and all the time telling me that I was going to do what he wanted. ""I just let him do it. I didn't want to go through that again, I didn't want to die. ""It was the same every time from then on. It became part of the day. ""I'm ashamed of myself... it's ruined my life, it's completely ruined it."" Another victim, Dave Stoker, who has since died, was also aged 17 when sent to Medomsley for minor theft. He told the BBC in 2015: ""[Husband] told me if it got out he would make my life hell. I was frightened to tell anyone. ""I was so disgusted. I felt dirty and ashamed of myself. It's turned me to drink."" Mr Stoker developed cirrhosis of the liver and died in 2017. Husband wasjailed for eight years in 2003,external, and his sentence increased by a further two in 2005 after more victims came forward. In the same year a storeman at the centre, Leslie Johnson, who has also since died, was sentenced to six years in jail for sexual offences. Operation Seabrook has become one of the largest investigations of its kind in the UK However, many more men came forward alleging sexual or physical abuse by a number of former officers and in 2013 Durham Police reopened its enquiries. This became one of the largest investigations of its kind in the UK and the force said the current number of potential victims was ""1,668 and rising"". The force said in a statement: ""It is not possible to say how many men were sexually assaulted by Husband [as] victims may have named a male called ""Neville"", ""The Chef"" or ""Husband"", however in the absence of a formal ID Procedure (due to the fact the suspect deceased) we cannot categorically state that the male known personally to these victims is Husband. ""At this stage of the investigation we have in excess of 300 allegations linked to him, however, once the investigation is concluded it is highly likely that these numbers will be considerably higher."" Det Supt Paul Goundry, who initially led the investigation, said: ""They were sent there for riding in a stolen car, pinching a pedal cycle, minor shoplifting - you'd never dream of that nowadays. ""When they got there they were faced with what is effectively a brutal regime, and if you ended up in the kitchen you would almost certainly be raped or sexually abused."" Men guilty of detention centre abuse A Freedom of Information request submitted by the BBC to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) revealed the MoJ has spent ""Â£3.6m on damages settling 237 private law claims for compensation relating to sexual abuse committed by Neville Husband."" The MoJ said in a statement: ""It is right that those responsible for such appalling behaviour are finally being brought to justice and we hope never to see abuse on this scale ever again. ""The culture of care and the safeguards in custody have improved hugely since Medomsley closed, but we are not complacent. ""We will continue to improve safeguards and track down any kind of abuse, and will continue working with police to bring to justice those who committed abuse in the past.""

Ronaldo hat-trick sends Juve throughCristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick overturns a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Atletico Madrid as Juventus advance to the Champions League last eight.BBC SportComments,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 122nd goal in the Champions League in the first half before adding two more after the break Cristiano Ronaldo once again underlined his worth in Europe's elite competition as his hat-trick overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Atletico Madrid to send Juventus into the Champions League last eight. The fans of the Turin club had yet to see their Â£99m summer signing produce the sort of displays in Europe that helped Real Madrid to four Champions League titles in five seasons, but that all changed on a thrilling night inside the Juventus Stadium. Having brought the tie level with two typical headers, Ronaldo capped off another remarkable performance and entered Juventus folklore when he smashed in the tie-winner from the spot four minutes from time, after Federico Bernardeschi had been fouled in the area. It was his 124th goal in the Champions League and eighth hat-trick in the competition. The home fans erupted on the final whistle and the players rushed to Ronaldo. ""It was meant to be a special night and it was, not just for my goals but for the attitude we showed,"" the 34-year-old said. ""That is the sort of mentality you need to win the Champions League. ""This was why Juventus brought me here. To help do things that they have never done before."" Atletico's defeat means they miss out on the chance to play the final at their own Wanda Metropolitano stadium on 1 June. The draw for the last eight will take place on Friday at 11:00 GMT. This is why they brought me here' - Ronaldo's latest iconic Champions League performance Relive the action from the Juventus Stadium Football Daily Podcast: Analysis and reaction after Ronaldo seals famous win Seven-goal Man City thrash Schalke in last 16 Juventus midfielder Sami Khedira posted this team photo after the win Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri set up his team to play a high line and put pressure on their Spanish opponents from the first whistle, with the onus on full-backs Leonardo Spinazzola and Joao Cancelo to advance forward as often as possible. The home side thought that tactic had paid off early when captain Giorgio Chiellini poked home in the fourth minute. However, following a VAR review it was declared that Ronaldo had fouled Jan Oblak in the build-up. There was no need to refer to VAR when Juve next had the ball in the net through Ronaldo's first header past the Slovenian keeper. It gave the home fans, who were handed 30,000 flags to wave, hope that their side could produce one of the great Champions League fightbacks in recent times. That became more likely soon after the restart when Ronaldo headed in his second. It was Cancelo who supplied the cross on this occasion. Oblak appeared to claw his effort off the line before goal-line technology alerted referee Bjorn Kuipers that the goal was good by a matter of inches. For the winner, former Fiorentina player Bernardeschi was pushed inside the area by his tracker Angel Correa after making a 50-yard run - the Juve crowd held their breath for a second before the Dutch official pointed to the spot. It was left for Ronaldo to crown a memorable display by himself and his team by firing his spot-kick to the right of Oblak. Allegri praised his side's measured approach to the task. ""The players have shown great maturity,"" he said. ""There was the risk of having a hysterical match, as if everything had to be done in 10 minutes."" Atletico's World Cup-winning forward Antoine Griezmann had one effort on goal It was perhaps a surprise that Diego Simeone's Atletico were overwhelmed so easily. Since the start of the 2013-14 campaign, they have kept more clean sheets than any other team in the Champions League (34) but on Tuesday La Liga's second-placed side looked likely to concede whenever Juve flung the ball in from the wings. It was expected they would concede the lion's share of possession, but on the rare occasions they did have the ball the three-time finalists were both pedestrian and sloppy. One moment of carelessness led to the opening goal when Alvaro Morata, who started alongside Antoine Griezmann up front, misplaced a header which allowed Emre Can to start the Juve attack. Morata also had his side's best effort when he headed over from six yards. Manager Simeone said: ""I don't think it was our worst performance, nor did I see a lack of character. They simply played better and we have to congratulate them."" Juventus have progressed in a Champions League knockout tie having lost the first leg for the first time since 2005-06 v Werder Bremen. Atletico are the fourth team in Champions League history to win the first leg of a knockout game at home by a 2-0 scoreline but fail to progress to the next round. Atletico failed to have a shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since December 2008 v Marseille. Chiellini is the fifth player reach 500 appearances for Juventus in all competitions after Alessandro del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, Gaetano Scirea and Giuseppe Furino.

People must decide - Sturgeon,"The Brexit deadline should be put back long enough for a new referendum in light of the UK government's latest defeat, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The latest version of Theresa May's exit plan wasvoted down in the Commonsby 391 to 242 on Tuesday evening. MPs will now vote on Wednesday on the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal, and potentially then on whether to extend the process beyond 29 March. The Scottish first minister said MPs should reject no deal ""decisively"". And she said the failure of the Commons to agree on a deal meant the issue should now be put back to the public in a fresh referendum. The prime minister meanwhile said she was ""disappointed"" with the defeat, and told MPs that they now face ""unenviable choices"". Live: Reaction as MPs prepare for no-deal vote Brexit: a simple guide Mrs May flew to Strasbourg for talks with the EU's chief negotiator on Monday evening, returning with what she described as""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit plan. However, this proposal was ultimately rejected by MPs by a margin of 149 votes. This was a lesser defeat than that Mrs May suffered in January - when an earlier iteration of her proposal wasshot down by a historic margin of 230 votes- but she once again faced significant opposition from her own Conservative backbenchers and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). All of Scotland's SNP, Labour and Lib Dem MPs voted along party lines against the deal, along with Tory rebel Ross Thomson. Scottish Conservative MP John Lamont, who voted against Mrs May's deal in January, was one of those who switched to support her, after saying it had been improved and was ""better than no deal"". Meanwhile fellow Tory Douglas Ross, who also voted against the deal in January, missed Tuesday's vote after his wife went into labour. This video can not be played MPs voted by 391 to 242 against Theresa May's Brexit plan Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that Mrs May ""only has herself to blame"" for the defeat, and said ""by rights this prime minister and government should be out of office this evening"". She said: ""Here we have a UK teetering on the edge, and a government that has just stopped functioning. ""What has to happen now is the House of Commons must vote decisively tomorrow to take no deal off the table completely. ""And then there must be an extension to Article 50, long enough to allow for another EU referendum to take place. Because if parliament can't decide - and parliament has failed to decide - then the people surely must decide."" The SNP leader also said she was ""very angry at what is unfolding"". She said: ""I'm spending an inordinate amount of time right now planning for the possibility of not having medicine supplies, food supplies, exporters not being able to get their goods to market. ""I am very angry that we have government that has been incompetent, that has failed to listen and that has brought the UK - Scotland included - to the brink of catastrophe, and still tonight seem to be oblivious to the damage they're doing."" Ms Sturgeon also said that ""in the fullness of time"" Scots should be offered a choice as to whether to ""carry on down this disastrous path with the UK"" or ""prosper and succeed with independence"". This video can not be played PM Theresa May: ""This House risks no Brexit at all"" MPs will now return to the Commons to debate whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal - something many members have pledged to oppose, and which Mrs May is giving Conservative members a free vote. If no deal is also rejected, MPs will then hold a vote on Thursday on whether to seek an extension of the ""Article 50"" deadline, the current exit date of 29 March. An extension to the Article 50 period of negotiations would need to be unanimously agreed with the 27 remaining EU member states. Mrs May - who had earlier said that losing the vote ""risks no Brexit at all"" - told MPs after the latest defeat that ""voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face"". She said: ""The EU will want to know what use we want to make of an extension. Does this house want to revoke Article 50? Does it want to hold a second referendum? Or does it want to leave with a deal, but not this deal? ""These are unenviable choices, but thanks to the choice the house has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced."" Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said Mrs May was ""in office but not in power"", and said parliament ""must now vote to take no deal off the table"".

Disgraced MP back to vote on Brexit deal,"Fiona Onasanya was convicted at the Old Bailey in January An MP who was jailed for perverting the course of justice has voted in the House of Commons for the first time since her release. Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya travelled to Parliament to vote against the Prime Minister's Brexit deal. Onasanya was sentenced to three months in prison in January after she lied to police about who was driving her car when it was caught speeding. She has faced calls to step down and allow a by-election to take place. The 35-year-old, who was elected as a Labour MP, served her sentence at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey and was released on 26 February. Onasanya submitted an appeal against her conviction, but it was thrown out by judge Sir Brian Leveson at the Royal Courts of Justice last week.

'Gross failures' in toddler sepsis deathMarcie Tadman was being treated for pneumonia at the Royal United Hospital in Bath when she died.Somerset,"Marcie could have survived if doctors followed national guidelines on treating severely ill children A two-year-old girl died from sepsis because of major failings in the way she was cared for by medics, an inquest has found. Marcie Tadman suffered a fatal cardiac arrest at the Royal United Hospital in Bath on 5 December 2017, a day after being admitted with pneumonia. The inquest heard seven doctors who treated her had not considered sepsis. Avon Coroner Maria Voisin concluded Marcie died from natural causes contributed to by neglect. Ms Voisin said there had been a range of failings by the hospital: ""I consider that putting these basic failures together led to the gross failure to provide or perform any effective medical treatment. ""The gross failures to follow proper or routine procedures and protocols included standard monitoring. ""There was a serious deterioration in Marcie's condition and staff caring for her should have realised the need for action in all the circumstances. ""I find that the gross failure has caused or significantly contributed to Marcie's death."" Marcie's father James Tadman had taken her to the hospital's emergency department the previous day because she had a cough, a temperature and had been vomiting - but the sepsis screening tool was not completed. Three days before her death, Marcie had been seen by an out-of-hours GP who had diagnosed a viral infection said she should have Calpol. During the hearing, expert Dr Nelly Ninis said: ""There was such a systemic failure here to manage a child with a serious illness. ""Children with serious illnesses show you where all the failings are because they fall ill so quickly. ""The hospital policies are well written and had they been used they would have been enough and there were Nice (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines that were not followed."" Speaking afterwards, Mr Tadman spoke of the ""hell"" his family has gone through since her death. Marcie died just a few months after her mother Lindsay passed away, having been diagnosed with cancer. ""My family and I have been through hell and no words can adequately describe how we are feeling,"" Mr Tadman said. ""We put our trust in the Royal United Hospital, assuming our little girl would get the very best care but tragically that was not the case. ""The hospital's own internal investigation has identified a number of failings and these have been described by one expert as 'systemic'."" He continued: ""We can only hope that... every child that receives treatment at the hospital in the future will be better protected. ""The only crumb of comfort I can take from the impossible situation I find myself facing is that Marcie has been reunited with her Mummy, my wife, who sadly lost her fight against cancer in July 2017."" The hospital trust's medical director has apologised to Marcie's family.

"Evidence found of massive solar stormScientists find evidence of a huge blast of radiation from the Sun that hit Earth more than 2,000 years ago.Science & Environment","Scientists have found evidence of a huge blast of radiation from the Sun that hit Earth more than 2,000 years ago. The result has important implications for the present, because solar storms can disrupt modern technology. The team found evidence in Greenland ice cores that the Earth was bombarded with solar proton particles in 660BC. The event was about 10 times more powerful than any since modern instrumental records began. The Sun periodically releases huge blasts of charged particles and other radiation that can travel towards Earth. The particular kind of solar emission recorded in the Greenland ice is known as a solar proton event (SPE). In the modern era, when these high-energy particles collide with Earth, they can knock out electronics in satellites we rely on for communications and services such as GPS. The radiation may also pose a health risk for astronauts. And passengers and crew on commercial aircraft that fly at high altitudes and close to the poles, such as on transatlantic routes, could receive increased radiation doses - though this depends on many variables. Other types of solar radiation events can trigger aurorae in the high atmosphere and shut down electrical grids. Large solar proton events could potentially threaten satellites, such as those that provide GPS services ""There are high-energy solar energetic particle events, or solar proton events. These are the high energy particles directly hitting Earth and producing the particles we measure,"" co-author Raimund Muscheler, from Lund University in Sweden, told BBC News. ""Connected to this are also the lower energy particles that come usually within 1-4 days to Earth. These produce the geomagnetic storms."" The violent solar storms that threaten Earth The two types of particle events may not always coincide, however. Modern instrumental monitoring data extends back about 60 years. So finding an event in 660BC that's an order of magnitude greater than anything seen in modern times suggests we haven't appreciated how powerful such events can be. There wouldn't have been any appreciable signs of the event to people alive at the time. But if there were any associated geomagnetic storms, it might have triggered aurorae at lower latitudes than is usual. 660BC was the date, according to legend, when Japan's first emperor - Jimmu - acceded to the throne. It was the time of the Iron Age in Europe and the Middle East - before the rise of the Roman Empire. The researchers found evidence for the event in the form of radioactive isotopes (particular forms of an element) present in the Greenland ice. These were beryllium-10 and chlorine-36, which are regarded as being of cosmic origin. Researchers have also identified two other large events from the past, which left evidence in both Greenland ice cores and tree rings. The signature researchers look for in tree rings is the isotope carbon-14. One of these, which occurred between 774 and 775AD, was comparable in its magnitude to the one in 660BC. ""Our event is about the same size as [the event in 774/775]. There is some uncertainty, but they look very similar,"" said Dr Muscheler. However, the event in 660BC does not have such a clear carbon-14 signature in tree ring data. Scientists are now working to understand how common the extreme events are, something that could help us plan for big solar storms in future. The research has beenpublished in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).,external Follow Paulon Twitter.,external Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

Brexit deal: What do the documents say?,"Theresa May presented what she said was an ""improved deal"" for Brexit, in the hope of convincing MPs to back it. Following the prime minister's last-ditch visit to Strasbourg, the government published three documents: A ""joint legally binding instrument"" on the withdrawal agreement A joint statement about the UK and EU's future relationship A ""unilateral declaration"" by the UK Then the government's official legal adviser, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, published his interpretation of the documents and whether they solved the problem of thebackstop. So, what are the documents' key passages? The attorney general considered the new documents published on Monday night, which he helped to negotiate, and concluded that they offered additional legal reassurance to the UK, which he described as substantive and binding. But it's worth emphasising the text of the withdrawal agreement itself hasn't changed at all. So here Mr Cox says the risk of getting stuck in the backstop has been reduced but it hasn't been removed altogether. In other words, the guarantees that many supporters of Brexit were seeking haven't been achieved in full. The last sentence of the attorney general's legal opinion is the most difficult for the government to swallow. His argument is that the UK has a route out of the backstop if the EU fails to act in good faith - but proving bad faith in front of an international tribunal is a difficult thing to do. And this excerpt makes it clear that if any future problem is caused by an honest difference of opinion that cannot be resolved, then the UK would have no way to get out of the backstop without the EU's explicit agreement. So it may not matter much that the EU has said time and again that it doesn't want the backstop to come into operation either - the fact that these new documents don't explicitly change the circumstances surrounding the backstop means that the legal risk remains the same. The ""joint interpretive instrument"" offers another layer of legal reassurance on top of the pledges the EU has made in the past. But it doesn't change the text of the proposed backstop arrangements, there's still no end date and no clear exit mechanism for one party without the agreement of the other. It's pretty obvious that the EU doesn't like the backstop - it poses many awkward questions for the single market. But in order to avoid using it, the two sides will need to come up with an alternative solution which keeps the Irish border as open as it is now. That may not be easy. Yes, there's an arbitration, or ""dispute settlement"", mechanism, but we knew that already. This excerpt emphasises that if relations became really difficult in the future then - in theory - nothing would be ruled out. But if things got this bad, then the backstop would only be one of many problems in the future UK-EU relationship. One of the pledges in the joint EU-UK statement is to speed up work on alternative arrangements - a phrase favoured by Brexiteers. The idea is to find a solution, possibly based on technology, which would help keep the border open and avoid any need to implement the backstop arrangements. The EU is pretty sceptical about much of this, but it has now agreed, in writing, to make a serious effort to investigate further. This was supposed to have encouraged wavering MPs that their concerns were being listened to - but the overall conclusion of the attorney general's new legal opinion will carry greater weight. The UK has published a unilateral statement which sets out its understanding of what the text of the withdrawal agreement means. The fact that the EU has chosen not to object to this statement, even if it disagrees with some of its conclusions, does mean that the statement carries some legal weight. Negotiations about this document, and how the EU might respond to it, went down to the wire - but it's not clear that it will make a huge amount of difference in the long run.

Border 'no-deal plan' to be published,"MPs will now get a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal on 29 March and, if that fails, one on whether Brexit should be delayed The BBC understands the UK government does not intend to collect customs duties or have any other controls at the Irish border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Instead it will rely on self-reporting by businesses. Details of how the UK will manage the border if there is no deal will be published on Wednesday. Meanwhile the DUP will vote against a motion in Parliament that would rule out the UK leaving the EU with no deal. It is also understood the government's border plan will suggest an app-based system to record cross border trading. Brexit: All you need to know Brexit deal: How did my MP vote? Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? It is still not clear what the Irish government will do on its side of the border if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. The government has consistently said it will do everything in its power to avoid a hardening of the border whatever the circumstances. The prime ministerlost a second vote on her dealin Parliament by 149 votes on Tuesday evening. Those voting against the deal included the 10 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs. DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told BBC News NI that the DUP would vote against a motion on Wednesday that would rule out the UK leaving the EU without a deal. He said the prime minister ""should be saying to the EU, 'forget about this deal. It was voted down comprehensively twice in the House of Commons, here is something we could properly spend our time between now and the end of June working on"". The border issue has been politically sensitive and the government has resisted outlining a policy until now. Addressing the Commons, the prime minister said that if MPs voted against the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March then there would be a further vote on Thursday on whether Brexit should be delayed. She said failing to reach a deal would do ""potential damage to the union...when one part of our union is without governance"", referencing the stalemate in the Stormont assembly. Northern Ireland has been without devolved government for more than two years after a power-sharing arrangement collapsed. Protests have taken place at the Irish border arguing against any return of physical infrastructure Opposition to the government's plan focused on thebackstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish borderafter Brexit in the event of a wider trade deal not being reached. Although the prime minister said on Monday that she had secured legally binding changes to her deal, legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that the UK would have no legal means of leaving the backstop without EU agreement. For that reason, the DUP said its 10 MPs would vote against the deal again, having opposed it in January when it was first voted on in Parliament. What is DUP's Brexit talks hope? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Mr Wilson, who had warned his partywould not back the deal because enough progress had not been made on the backstop, said the government needed to ""respect the constitutional and economic integrity"" of the UK.

Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the result showed the ""absolute disregard for the people of Ireland"", and that no-deal planning needed to be intensified. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party was extremely disappointed that the deal had been rejected again and called for an extension to Article 50: the legal process that triggered the Brexit process, in order to avoid a no-deal exit. Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson urged ""calm heads"" and that a short technical extension should be ""seriously considered"", while Alliance leader Naomi Long called for another referendum as ""a matter of urgency"". ""The clearest, most coherent and most democratic route through this impasse lies with a people's vote, including both the prime minister's deal and the Remain option,"" she said. TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy PM) Simon Coveney said a no-deal Brexit ""looks closer now than it did a few hours ago"", because of the result. In an interview with Irish national broadcaster RTÃ, he stressed that the focus must be on London, adding that's ""where the crisis is"". He said the Irish government had already done a large amount of no-deal planning, with its omnibus no-deal bill currently going through the Oireachtas (Irish houses of parliament.) In a joint statement, the UK's four farming union presidents, including Ivor Ferguson of Ulster Farmers' Union, said it is ""critical"" that a clear strategy is now identified to try and find a deal that Parliament can support. The Federation of Small Businesses in NI said the result had ""further heightened uncertainty"" and was another setback for businesses. The NI Retail Consortium said that retailers are ""now simply beyond frustration at the lack of certainty and clarity over future trading"", while Retail NI called for an extension of Article 50 as well. ""Every element of the Northern Ireland business community, trade unions and voluntary sector is speaking with one very clear voice on Brexit - we need a deal,"" said Glyn Roberts, its chief executive. The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 after voting to leave in 2016. The UK and EU have been engaged in negotiations for two years, with the issue of the Irish border the sticking point. Brexit's border drama nears final act Both sides committed to avoid a hard Irish border - the return of checks or physical infrastructure - along the 310-mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They agreed to a backstop: an insurance policy to maintain an open border unless and until another solution is found. But the DUP and other parties at Westminster argued that the backstop posed a risk to the integrity of the union by creating an ""Irish Sea border"", and secondly, that it tied the UK to EU rules indefinitely with no say in them. But a majority of business and farming groups in Northern Ireland, as well as other political parties, had supported the backstop and the government's deal.

'Avoid no-deal Brexit own goal',"Business groups are ""exasperated"" after the Prime Minister's EU withdrawal plan was again rejected by Parliament. They called on MPs to shut down the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and come up with a clear EU exit plan. The City UK, the finance industry body, said leaving without a deal ""would be an own goal of historic proportions"". The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans on Wednesday, including trade tariffs and Irish border proposals. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said the extension of the Brexit process ""should be as short as realistically possible and backed by a clear plan"". ""It's time for Parliament to stop this circus,"" she added. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers' group Make UK, said: ""It is now essential that Parliament brings the curtain down on this farce and removes the risk of no deal. ""That outcome would be disastrous for the UK manufacturing, jeopardising many thousands of jobs in every constituency in the land."" The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans, including tariff rates, on Wednesday. Last week, reports suggested that should the UK leave the EU with no deal in place, the UK governmentmight cut trade tariffs on between 80% and 90% of goods. And on Tuesday, Theresa May said thatno-deal plans for the Irish borderwould be released on Wednesday. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said the public would be hit by no-deal Brexit in the form of tariffs, non-tariff barriers and currency depreciation. These would ""all push up costs and reduce the choice on the shelves we currently enjoy,"" she said. She added that businesses are ""exasperated by the lack of clarity over their future trading arrangements"". ""Hundreds of ships are currently sailing towards Britain without a clear understanding of the tariffs, checks, or documentation requirements, they will face when they arrive,"" she said. Mike Hawes, chief executive of car industry body the SMMT, said the vote to reject Mrs May's deal ""leaves us perilously close to the 'cliff edge'."" ""No-deal would be catastrophic for the automotive industry,"" he said. ""It would end frictionless trade, add billions to the cost of manufacturing and cost jobs. ""UK automotive businesses will be put at immediate risk. Parliament must reject no-deal and take it permanently off the table,"" he added. The pound was volatile ahead of the Commons vote on Tuesday, sinking after the government's senior law officer said the legal risk of the UK being tied to EU rules after Brexit remained unchanged. It regained some ground after the vote, but settled lower. Andrew Wilson, Europe, Middle East and Africa chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said: ""We expect the British pound, which has reversed last night's strength over the course of the day, to weaken further amid prolonged uncertainty.

What just happened with Brexit?,"This video can not be played MPs voted by 391 to 242 against Theresa May's Brexit plan Theresa May's planned Brexit deal has suffered a major defeat in the UK parliament, leaving the Brexit process in disarray. Mrs May began the day with renewed hope after securing last-minute changes to her withdrawal deal with the EU. But MPs roundly defeated her proposals, 391 votes to 242, weeks after her first attempt to pass the deal met the same fate. Had the vote gone her way, the UK would be preparing to leave the EU on 29 March. That exit date still looms large, but things could go a few different ways before then. The next step is... another vote (this one on Wednesday). MPs will vote on a motion on whether to allow the UK to exit the EU on 29 March without a deal - a so-called ""disorderly"" or ""no-deal"" Brexit. Leaving the EU without a deal - and therefore without the 21-month transition period provided for by the deal - carries significant risks for trade, immigration, health, and more, and parliament will almost certainly reject that possibility. Latest reaction as vote fails Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? What would 'no deal' look like? Rejection of a no-deal Brexit would then set up... yes, you guessed it: another vote. This one would decide whether Mrs May will go back to the EU to request an extension to Article 50 - the formal name for the notification from the UK that it is leaving the union. That would throw the Brexit ball into the EU's court - potentially allowing the union to decide the terms of any extension period. Speaking after her defeat on Tuesday, Mrs May said: ""Voting against leaving without a deal and asking for an extension does not solve the problems we face. The European Union will want to know what use we mean to make of such a extension, and this house will have to answer that question."" Much of the dissent - and last-minute wrangling - over Mrs May's deal revolved around the so-called backstop. Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border - physical checks or infrastructure - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland with few restrictions. The UK and the Republic of Ireland are both part of the EU single market and customs union, so products don't need to be inspected for customs and standards. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If the UK leaves, that changes. The backstop is a safety net, an arrangement that will apply to the Irish border after Brexit if a wider deal or technological solution can't be found that keeps the border as frictionless as it is today. But Conservative Brexiteers are concerned that the backstop could keep the UK indefinitely locked into an arrangement with the EU, if no alternative is found. Mrs May hoped her last minute amendments to the deal would resolve the backstop issue, but the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, made it clear on Tuesday that the risk of being locked into the backstop remained. The prime minister is embattled. Her short premiership has been dogged by the Brexit negotiations, which has now served her up two massive parliamentary defeats. Mrs May was suffering from a sore throat on Tuesday as she stood up in the House of Commons to defend her deal, after late-night negotiations in Brussels, knowing all the while that she stood a strong chance of another defeat. Her first attempt to pass a Brexit deal through the Commons was roundly rejected in January, brought down by a large rebellion against her from within her own party. Now a second significant defeat in the Commons risks weakening Mrs May's party leadership even further, and amplifying calls for her resignation. Among the possible outcomes should parliament be unable to agree on the terms of a deal, the prime minister might also face a general election - the second of her premiership. Speaking in the House of Commons after the vote on Tuesday, the opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it might be time to... you guessed it: have another vote.

Brexit: What could happen next?What just happened with Brexit?Brexit deal: What do the documents say?Pound volatile after Brexit vote defeatVideoVideoThe moment the result was announced,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Brexit deal: What do the documents say?Pound volatile after Brexit vote defeatVideoVideoThe moment the result was announced,"Theresa May presented what she said was an ""improved deal"" for Brexit, in the hope of convincing MPs to back it. Following the prime minister's last-ditch visit to Strasbourg, the government published three documents: A ""joint legally binding instrument"" on the withdrawal agreement A joint statement about the UK and EU's future relationship A ""unilateral declaration"" by the UK Then the government's official legal adviser, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, published his interpretation of the documents and whether they solved the problem of thebackstop. So, what are the documents' key passages? The attorney general considered the new documents published on Monday night, which he helped to negotiate, and concluded that they offered additional legal reassurance to the UK, which he described as substantive and binding. But it's worth emphasising the text of the withdrawal agreement itself hasn't changed at all. So here Mr Cox says the risk of getting stuck in the backstop has been reduced but it hasn't been removed altogether. In other words, the guarantees that many supporters of Brexit were seeking haven't been achieved in full. The last sentence of the attorney general's legal opinion is the most difficult for the government to swallow. His argument is that the UK has a route out of the backstop if the EU fails to act in good faith - but proving bad faith in front of an international tribunal is a difficult thing to do. And this excerpt makes it clear that if any future problem is caused by an honest difference of opinion that cannot be resolved, then the UK would have no way to get out of the backstop without the EU's explicit agreement. So it may not matter much that the EU has said time and again that it doesn't want the backstop to come into operation either - the fact that these new documents don't explicitly change the circumstances surrounding the backstop means that the legal risk remains the same. The ""joint interpretive instrument"" offers another layer of legal reassurance on top of the pledges the EU has made in the past. But it doesn't change the text of the proposed backstop arrangements, there's still no end date and no clear exit mechanism for one party without the agreement of the other. It's pretty obvious that the EU doesn't like the backstop - it poses many awkward questions for the single market. But in order to avoid using it, the two sides will need to come up with an alternative solution which keeps the Irish border as open as it is now. That may not be easy. Yes, there's an arbitration, or ""dispute settlement"", mechanism, but we knew that already. This excerpt emphasises that if relations became really difficult in the future then - in theory - nothing would be ruled out. But if things got this bad, then the backstop would only be one of many problems in the future UK-EU relationship. One of the pledges in the joint EU-UK statement is to speed up work on alternative arrangements - a phrase favoured by Brexiteers. The idea is to find a solution, possibly based on technology, which would help keep the border open and avoid any need to implement the backstop arrangements. The EU is pretty sceptical about much of this, but it has now agreed, in writing, to make a serious effort to investigate further. This was supposed to have encouraged wavering MPs that their concerns were being listened to - but the overall conclusion of the attorney general's new legal opinion will carry greater weight. The UK has published a unilateral statement which sets out its understanding of what the text of the withdrawal agreement means. The fact that the EU has chosen not to object to this statement, even if it disagrees with some of its conclusions, does mean that the statement carries some legal weight. Negotiations about this document, and how the EU might respond to it, went down to the wire - but it's not clear that it will make a huge amount of difference in the long run.

Pound volatile after Brexit vote defeatVideoVideoThe moment the result was announced,"Business groups are ""exasperated"" after the Prime Minister's EU withdrawal plan was again rejected by Parliament. They called on MPs to shut down the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and come up with a clear EU exit plan. The City UK, the finance industry body, said leaving without a deal ""would be an own goal of historic proportions"". The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans on Wednesday, including trade tariffs and Irish border proposals. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said the extension of the Brexit process ""should be as short as realistically possible and backed by a clear plan"". ""It's time for Parliament to stop this circus,"" she added. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers' group Make UK, said: ""It is now essential that Parliament brings the curtain down on this farce and removes the risk of no deal. ""That outcome would be disastrous for the UK manufacturing, jeopardising many thousands of jobs in every constituency in the land."" The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans, including tariff rates, on Wednesday. Last week, reports suggested that should the UK leave the EU with no deal in place, the UK governmentmight cut trade tariffs on between 80% and 90% of goods. And on Tuesday, Theresa May said thatno-deal plans for the Irish borderwould be released on Wednesday. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said the public would be hit by no-deal Brexit in the form of tariffs, non-tariff barriers and currency depreciation. These would ""all push up costs and reduce the choice on the shelves we currently enjoy,"" she said. She added that businesses are ""exasperated by the lack of clarity over their future trading arrangements"". ""Hundreds of ships are currently sailing towards Britain without a clear understanding of the tariffs, checks, or documentation requirements, they will face when they arrive,"" she said. Mike Hawes, chief executive of car industry body the SMMT, said the vote to reject Mrs May's deal ""leaves us perilously close to the 'cliff edge'."" ""No-deal would be catastrophic for the automotive industry,"" he said. ""It would end frictionless trade, add billions to the cost of manufacturing and cost jobs. ""UK automotive businesses will be put at immediate risk. Parliament must reject no-deal and take it permanently off the table,"" he added. The pound was volatile ahead of the Commons vote on Tuesday, sinking after the government's senior law officer said the legal risk of the UK being tied to EU rules after Brexit remained unchanged. It regained some ground after the vote, but settled lower. Andrew Wilson, Europe, Middle East and Africa chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said: ""We expect the British pound, which has reversed last night's strength over the course of the day, to weaken further amid prolonged uncertainty. ""That said, ruling out of a 'no-deal' Brexit could provide some support for the currency,"" he added. MPs reject Mayâs EU withdrawal deal again How does Brexit affect the pound?

"'Unacceptable' self-harm still on InstagramThe NSPCC says leaving graphic images of cutting on the site is ""simply not acceptable"".","The NSPCC's Tony Stower said social media firms should face ""really tough regulation"" The NSPCC has criticised Instagram for continuing to allow ""distressing"" pictures of self-harm to remain on the site. Last month, Instagram said all graphic images of self-harm would be removed. The BBC reported three images of people cutting themselves to Instagram. The social media platform added warnings to two but ruled that all three could remain on the site. A spokesman for Instagram said it ""will take time... to get this right"". NSPCC head of child safety online Tony Stower said leaving the posts on the site was ""simply not acceptable"". Mr Stower was shown the image by the Victoria Derbyshire programme that Instagram said did ""not violate our community guidelines"", of a person cutting their wrist. He said it was ""clear... this is a distressing image that should be taken down"". He said the images could be damaging ""to the victims who have self-harmed and may be thinking about [self-harming]"". Alisha Cowie, the current holder of the Miss England title, cut herself as a teenager, and said it was those same kind of images ""that caused me to self-harm"" aged 13. ""What's [leaving them on the site] saying to other children, or even teens or adults on Instagram?"" she asked. She said the images were still ""disturbing"" for her to see now, as an adult. Alisha Cowie said she was inspired to self-harm by images she saw online Instagram says it does allow pictures of healed scars if they are seen to be posted by people who no longer self-harm and offer support to others. But in February, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said all graphic images of self-harm would be removed. His pledge came after the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017,said Instagram had ""helped kill"" his daughter. Mr Stower said it was necessary for the government to place ""really tough regulation"" on social media firms. ""We've seen time and again for the last 10 years these companies will only do the bare minimum. ""They won't do anything until they're forced to,"" he added. The government said it would ""soon publish a White Paper which will set out the responsibilities ofÂ onlineÂ platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not"". Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017. Instagram said in a statement: ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the people who use Instagram. ""As part of an ongoing review with global experts, we are making changes to no longer allow any graphic images of self-harm, such as cutting, and we are making it harder for people to discover non-graphic, self-harm related content. ""We have a responsibility to get this right and are committed to making this change as quickly as possible, but it will take time.''

UK economy stalls despite strong January,"The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the three months to January, matching the growth of the previous three months. The report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a pick-up in activity in January when the economy expanded by 0.5%. The ONS said strength in IT, health services and wholesale trading offset falls in the manufacturing of metals and cars, and construction repair work. The increase in wholesale could indicate stockpiling ahead of Brexit. The total output of goods and services in the UK, or gross domestic product (GDP), grew by 0.2% in the three months to the end of January. The services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the private sector economy, grew by 0.5% on a rolling three-month basis, mainly driven by wholesale and retail trade. Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS said growth across the latest three months had ""remained weak"" with falls in the output of metal products, cars and construction repair work all dampening economic growth. However, he added that was offset by strong performances in wholesale, IT and health services. In January the economy staged a bit of a comeback, growing by 0.5% The services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the private sector economy, grew by 0.3% in January after a 0.2% fall in December. Construction, which accounts for about 6% of the economy, reversed December's fall to grow by 2.8% in January. Production and manufacturing output also both grew in January, having contracted in December. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG said the data confirmed growth momentum in the UK economy had ""stalled"". ""The first glimpse of GDP data for this year points to a UK economy hovering well below its growth potential, as we wait for the Brexit fog to dissipate. Ms Selfin said she expected growth to ""remain subdued in the short-term"". However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist with Capital Economics, said the numbers provided some reassurance that the UK economy is weathering a political crisis at home and a slowdown overseas ""pretty well"". ""Of course, the data may deteriorate in February and March if Brexit has caused consumers and firms to reach for the handbrake,"" he added. Clouds gathering over global economy UK economic growth slowest since 2012 Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""The service sector remains the main driver of UK growth on this rolling three-month measure, with industrial production and construction contracting. Despite a boost in January, the manufacturing sector remains an area of concern with significant cost pressures and moderating demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector. ""The lack of clarity on crucial aspects of how companies will operate after 29 March, as well as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, has led many firms having to take drastic action to safeguard their operations, which has resulted in unnecessary costs, diversion of resources and loss of business, subduing overall economic activity. It seems it depends on your point of view. Some experts think the increase in wholesale activity does signal that some businesses are building up stocks ahead of Brexit. KPMG's Ms Selfin said there was ""evidence that stockpiling in anticipation of Brexit has bolstered growth in some industries"". However, at Capital Economics Andrew Wishart said there was ""little evidence"" of stockbuilding, with output in the transport and storage sector falling in January and the three-month growth in imports easing off. The ONS was unable to comment on whether the growth was linked to UK manufacturers stockpiling. The uncomfortable truth is that the economy has lost speed. Growth of 0.2% across three months is a fraction of what the UK typically achieves. Brexit uncertainty appears to have hammered business investment, while growth in the Eurozone has fallen way short of expectations. Although the economy expanded by 0.5% in January alone, even the number crunchers who calculate these monthly estimates admit that they're volatile and need cautious treatment. And January's rebound was driven by manufacturing and construction. But surveys suggest recent industrial activity has been driven by speeding up production of finished goods ahead of Brexit rather than new orders; though the ONS numbers don't distinguish between these. And the rebound follows very weak months for manufacturing and construction - output across the last three months in both was flat. Total growth across the last three months was driven by services - in particular the wholesale retailing, again hinting at stockbuilding. The ""fog of Brexit"" may have actually inflated activity of late. Beyond that, growth is at best sluggish.

"U-turn over Molly Russell legal aidThe family of the 14-year-old, who took her own life, appealed when funding for lawyers was refused.","Molly Russell died in 2017 after seeing content about suicide on social media The family of a teenager who took her own life after viewing material about self-harm on social media have been granted legal aid for her inquest, after being initially turned down. Molly Russell was 14 when she died in 2017 and her parents in part blame the content she viewed on Instagram. Her parents appealed when refused funds to cover their lawyers for the hearing. Ian Russell said he was flabbergasted when officials told him the case did not have ""wider public interest"". Mr Russell said he was delighted the Legal Aid Agency - which operates under the Ministry of Justice - confirmed it had reconsidered its decision. He added: ""I would like to thank everyone for the many offers of support we have received. This decision is a weight lifted from our family and we now look ahead to a full and fearless inquest into Molly's death.""

DUP 'will not vote' for Brexit deal,"This video can not be played 'We could be stuck with the EU' - DUP's Sammy Wilson reacts to the attorney general's legal advice ""Sufficient progress"" has not been made for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to vote for the Brexit deal in the Commons, the party has said. On Monday, Theresa May said she had secured ""legally binding changes"" to the Brexit deal. Earlier, the Taoiseach said fears the EU was trying to hold the UK in a permanent backstop ""can now be put to bed"". But the DUP said the EU has been ""intransigent"". Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexitcast: What happened in Strasbourg? Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? What is DUP's Brexit talks hope? MPsare currently voting on the deal, after Mrs May made a final bid to convince them to back it. In the Commons, the party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said new legal advice from the Attorney General meant the UK could still be ""trapped"" in the backstop. The party's leadership met the prime minister on Tuesday afternoon, before she headed to Parliament to open the debate on her deal. The BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg reported that the DUP would definitely vote against the deal later, and not just abstain. In a statement, a DUP spokesman said the party recognised that the prime minister had made ""limited progress"" in her discussions with the EU. ""The European Union has been intransigent. It is possible to reach a sensible deal which works for the United Kingdom and the European Union but it will require all sides to be reasonable and in deal-making mode,"" it added. ""It is clear that the risks remain that the UK would be unable to lawfully exit the backstop were it to be activated,"" it added. ""We will support the right deal which respects the referendum result and Northern Ireland's place as an integral part of the United Kingdom."" Geoffrey Cox said he had set out 'frankly and candidly' his view of the legal effect of the new provisions Geoffrey Cox'snew legal advice,externalsays ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that the UK would have no legal means of leaving the backstop without EU agreement. The Attorney General concludes that the new provisions ""reduce the risk"" of the UK being ""indefinitely and involuntarily"" held in the backstop if there was ""bad faith or want of best endeavours of the EU"". But he said the legal risk remains that if bad faith could not be demonstrated, but rather ""simply because of intractable differences"", the UK would have ""no internationally lawful means"" of exiting the backstop, except through another agreement. He repeated his view that there is a ""political judgement"" to be made on whether it is worth agreeing the deal. In November 2018,Mr Cox had advised that the backstop would be indefiniteand could only be brought to an end with a subsequent UK-EU agreement. This video can not be played 'Which way will the politicians jump?' BBC News NI's John Campbell explains the latest developments It took several hours after the Attorney General's legal advice was published for the DUP to issue its verdict: no. Hardly the outcome the prime minister will have been hoping for from the party that keeps her in power. But it has always said it would rather leave the EU with no deal than a bad deal, and it still says it will support ""the right deal"" for Northern Ireland. Anyone expecting the DUP to have blinked at the last minute probably does not know much about how the party operates. Its refusal to budge means many Brexiteer Tory MPs probably voting against the deal too. With most Labour MPs and the SNP also against the deal, albeit for different reasons, this time it looks like there might be too many holes in the prime minister's ship to stop it from sinking. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar said he hoped the House of Commons would now pass the Brexit withdrawal deal Mr Varadkar told a press conference early on Tuesday in Dublin that what had been agreed was complementary to the withdrawal deal, not a rewrite. ""The further agreement yesterday provided additional clarity, reassurance and guarantees sought by some to eliminate doubt or fears, however unreal, that the goal was to trap the UK indefinitely in the backstop,"" he said. ""It is not. These doubts and fears can be put to bed."" He said Brexit had been in many ways a ""dark cloud hanging over us"" and a positive vote could lift that cloud. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 after voting to leave by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m - in 2016. The UK and EU have been engaged in negotiations for two years, with the issue of the Irish border the sticking point. Brexit's border drama nears final act Live: Reaction to May's deal ahead of MPs' vote Both sides committed to avoid a hard Irish border - ie the return of checks or physical infrastructure - along the 310-mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They agreed to a backstop: an insurance policy to maintain an open border unless and until another solution is found. But the DUP and other parties at Westminster argued that the backstop posed a risk to the integrity of the union by creating an ""Irish Sea border"", and secondly, that it tied the UK to EU rules indefinitely with no say in them. They voted down the deal when it first came to Parliament in January, and have said they will do so again unless the new documents, announced on Monday night, meet certain tests. The Irish border has been one of the biggest sticking points during Brexit negotiations By John Campbell, BBC News NI Business and Economics Editor Theresa May said she was going back to the EU to seek one of two things. They were either a firm time limit on the Irish border backstop or some way to allow the UK to walk away from it without suffering a penalty. She has not achieved either of those aims in her latest negotiation. But she did not leave Strasbourg empty-handed. What she has gained from the EU is a plain-language version of what the two sides have already agreed. That is the new ""legally-binding"" bit - it does not replace the backstop but sits alongside it and gives a greater understanding of what had been agreed in the first place. After talks with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday evening, the prime minister said she ""passionately believed"" her Brexit deal addressed concerns raised by MPs. Speaking alongside Mrs May in Strasbourg, Mr Juncker warned if the deal was voted down, there would be ""no third chance"".

Laura Kuenssberg: Has PM done enough?Brexit deal: What do the documents say?VideoVideoMay: This House risks no Brexit at allPound volatile on Brexit deal adviceWhat's happening this week?,"""Devastating"" - that's how one influential Brexiteer described the attorney general's legal advice. Yes, the Brexiteer lawyer Geoffrey Cox says the negotiations with the EU and tweaks to the deal have reduced the risk of the UK being stuck in the controversial backstop for ever and a day. That's why last night, Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker looked so thrilled and delighted to have managed to broker something. But what Mr Cox also says clearly is that the risk still exists. Without going through the minutiae of the three-page legal opinion, in short, he has given the prime minister a fig leaf to try to patch a gaping political hole, rather than a generous cover with room to spare. Legal risk of Brexit backstop 'unchanged' Live: Theresa May addresses Commons ahead of Brexit vote It is not true to say that ""nothing has changed"". And remember the latest round of negotiations were never going to tear up the whole deal on the backstop, or change it fundamentally. However, political expectations had been stirred - the last few days have always been about making changes at the margins that would make the UK feel better about the whole thing, not make it go away. And there will be some Tory MPs who use this moment to do what they have wanted to find a way to do for some time - change their mind, and walk through the Aye lobby tonight to back the prime minister. One is said to have joked to the prime minister they'd wanted her to ""bring a rabbit out of the hat from Brussels, and you've come back with a hamster, but that's good enough for me"". But as things stand the number of switchers seems far less than required to avoid another defeat for the prime minister. Last time out she was beaten by a record 230 votes. One cabinet minister guessed the number tonight might be around 150. Everyone is guessing still. But this looks like another dreadful day for Number 10, and another moment when doubts will be on display about not just the divorce deal with the EU, but about the prime minister's leadership too. Something has changed yes, but not enough. 'Legally binding' changes to EU deal agreed Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know?

Brexit deal: What do the documents say?VideoVideoMay: This House risks no Brexit at allPound volatile on Brexit deal adviceWhat's happening this week?,"Theresa May presented what she said was an ""improved deal"" for Brexit, in the hope of convincing MPs to back it. Following the prime minister's last-ditch visit to Strasbourg, the government published three documents: A ""joint legally binding instrument"" on the withdrawal agreement A joint statement about the UK and EU's future relationship A ""unilateral declaration"" by the UK Then the government's official legal adviser, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, published his interpretation of the documents and whether they solved the problem of thebackstop. So, what are the documents' key passages? The attorney general considered the new documents published on Monday night, which he helped to negotiate, and concluded that they offered additional legal reassurance to the UK, which he described as substantive and binding. But it's worth emphasising the text of the withdrawal agreement itself hasn't changed at all. So here Mr Cox says the risk of getting stuck in the backstop has been reduced but it hasn't been removed altogether. In other words, the guarantees that many supporters of Brexit were seeking haven't been achieved in full. The last sentence of the attorney general's legal opinion is the most difficult for the government to swallow. His argument is that the UK has a route out of the backstop if the EU fails to act in good faith - but proving bad faith in front of an international tribunal is a difficult thing to do. And this excerpt makes it clear that if any future problem is caused by an honest difference of opinion that cannot be resolved, then the UK would have no way to get out of the backstop without the EU's explicit agreement. So it may not matter much that the EU has said time and again that it doesn't want the backstop to come into operation either - the fact that these new documents don't explicitly change the circumstances surrounding the backstop means that the legal risk remains the same. The ""joint interpretive instrument"" offers another layer of legal reassurance on top of the pledges the EU has made in the past. But it doesn't change the text of the proposed backstop arrangements, there's still no end date and no clear exit mechanism for one party without the agreement of the other. It's pretty obvious that the EU doesn't like the backstop - it poses many awkward questions for the single market. But in order to avoid using it, the two sides will need to come up with an alternative solution which keeps the Irish border as open as it is now. That may not be easy. Yes, there's an arbitration, or ""dispute settlement"", mechanism, but we knew that already. This excerpt emphasises that if relations became really difficult in the future then - in theory - nothing would be ruled out. But if things got this bad, then the backstop would only be one of many problems in the future UK-EU relationship. One of the pledges in the joint EU-UK statement is to speed up work on alternative arrangements - a phrase favoured by Brexiteers. The idea is to find a solution, possibly based on technology, which would help keep the border open and avoid any need to implement the backstop arrangements. The EU is pretty sceptical about much of this, but it has now agreed, in writing, to make a serious effort to investigate further. This was supposed to have encouraged wavering MPs that their concerns were being listened to - but the overall conclusion of the attorney general's new legal opinion will carry greater weight. The UK has published a unilateral statement which sets out its understanding of what the text of the withdrawal agreement means. The fact that the EU has chosen not to object to this statement, even if it disagrees with some of its conclusions, does mean that the statement carries some legal weight. Negotiations about this document, and how the EU might respond to it, went down to the wire - but it's not clear that it will make a huge amount of difference in the long run.

Pound volatile on Brexit deal adviceWhat's happening this week?,"The pound is volatile ahead of Tuesday evening's Commons vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal. Earlier it sank after the government's senior law officer said the legal risk of the UK being tied to EU rules after Brexit ""remains unchanged"". Currency traders fear the attorney general's advice means Theresa May's revised Brexit deal is less likely to be accepted by pro-Brexit MPs. However, the pound has since recovered most of its lost ground. According to attorney general Geoffrey Cox,the UK may not be able to leavethe Irish backstop without the EU's agreement. The pound fell from â¬1.17 to â¬1.15 against the euro following his words on Tuesday morning. Sterling also fell two cents against the dollar from $1.32 to $1.30. Mr Cox's advice is likely to weigh heavily on MPs when parliament votes on the new version of the deal later on Tuesday. Simon Derrick, managing director of BNY Mellon, said the fall in sterling reflected increased uncertainty over the Brexit process. ""The market believes it increases the likelihood of a 'no' vote tonight,"" he said. ""It complicates the issue, it leaves us with the possibility still of a no-deal Brexit, and uncertainty over politics more generally. It muddies the water."" Mr Derrick said if the prime minister's deal was defeated by only a narrow margin ""that might encourage optimism"" that a tweaked deal could be agreed before the end of the month. However, a substantial defeat for the prime minister was likely to push sterling lower, he said. ""When the deal was originally defeated in January, sterling traded down at $1.26 . You could see it move lower again,"" said Mr Derrick. How does Brexit affect the pound? Legal risk of Brexit backstop 'unchanged' Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? Earlier on Tuesday the pound had been trading higher after Theresa May said she had achieved ""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit deal during talks in Brussels. Mrs May said they could be used to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop - the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - indefinitely. The backstop has been criticised by some who believe it will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, but the bloc has said ""if used [it] will apply temporarily"".

What's happening this week?,"On Tuesday, MPs will pass their verdict on Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to take Britain out of the European Union on 29 March. Here is what you need to know about the vote. At 7pm on Tuesday evening, after a full day of debate. They are passing judgement on the deal Theresa May spent two years negotiating with the European Union. Brexit: What could happen next? This is the big one. If MPs vote the deal down, one of two things is likely to happen. The UK will either leave the EU on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement - or that departure date will be delayed. If they back the deal, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March but things will stay broadly as they are until December 2020, while the two sides thrash out a permanent trade deal. Yes - andby a massive margin. Mrs May said she secured ""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit deal on Monday, a day ahead of MPs voting on it. She said the first change could be used to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop - the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - indefinitely. The second is a ""joint statement"" from the EU and the UK. It adds to the political declaration on the UK and EU's future relationship and commits to replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the government's chief law officer, haspublished updated legal advice,externalon the prime minister's deal, saying the new provisions secured by Mrs May ""reduce the risk"" of the UK being ""indefinitely and involuntarily"" held  in the backstop. But his advice adds that ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that the UK would have no legal means of exiting without EU agreement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If MPs vote down Mrs May's withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, then MPs have been promised a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal or not. This is likely to take place on Wednesday. If they back a no-deal Brexit in this vote, then the UK will leave without a deal on 29 March. If they reject a no-deal Brexit then they could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU. Not necessarily. If Mrs May loses the vote on Tuesday by a narrow margin, she could ask the EU for a short technical delay to allow everyone to regroup and make one last push to get it ""over the line"". Mrs May could make that final push at the next EU summit on 22 March, with another Commons vote to follow, assuming she can get a delay to Brexit. Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The first thing to stress is that it is not a trade deal. It is simply an agreement to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, minimising disruption to businesses and citizens of the UK and EU nations. Things would carry on pretty much as usual for at least 21 months after the official departure date of 29 March. During that time, the two sides would try to hammer out a permanent trading relationship - the overall aim of those talks is set out in the political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and EU, which MPs are also voting on. The withdrawal agreement also commits the UK to paying a Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would also retain their residency and social security rights. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The decision MPs make on Tuesday will shape the UK's economy and society for decades to come, influencing incomes, job prospects and much else besides. There may also be some more immediate consequences. Many fear a no-deal Brexit will cause chaos at ports, disruption to food and medical supplies and long-term economic damage, with big multinational companies moving out of the UK. Others say these fears are exaggerated and the UK will thrive when it has made a clean break from the EU. The ""Irish backstop"" clause. This is a bit of legal jargon that is meant to prevent the return of cameras and border guards along the 310 mile border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - the only land border between the EU and the UK. It would keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, avoiding the need for physical checks on vehicles passing through the border, which many fear could reignite the Northern Irish Troubles. It is only meant to kick in if the two sides have not agreed a trade deal by December 2020 - and it is meant to be temporary. But because there is no end date written into the agreement, and no way of quitting it without the EU's say-so, many MPs fear it will become permanent, effectively making a mockery of Brexit. These MPs want a time-limit on the backstop - something the EU has ruled out. The EU says the deal it struck with Mrs May is the best and only one available and it can't be rewritten. Mrs May used to say that too, until MPs rejected it in January. MPs are studying the additional legal assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop, agreed by Mrs May in 11th hour talks with EU officials, before deciding whether to vote for her deal or not. After months of questions about his position, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he could support a new referendum, while continuing to push for his preferred option of a general election or Labour's own version of Brexit. Many Labour MPs from areas that voted Leave in the 2016 referendum could vote against it, however, reducing its chances of success. The Labour leadership also appears to be warming to the idea of a Norway-style deal with the EU, which is backed by a group of Conservative and Labour MPs. This would see the UK remain in the EU single market, which its supporters say would protect jobs. If Mrs May's deal is defeated on Tuesday, there could be moves to get MPs to back ""Common Market 2.0"", as its supporters call this plan.

McGuinness award apology 'not enough'A survivor of an IRA bomb calls on San Francisco's mayor to rescind a posthumous honour for the IRA leader.Storm Gareth brings strong wind and rainThe seventh storm of the season is expected to last until Wednesday and it may bring travel disruption.Northern Ireland,"An IRA bomb survivor has called on the mayor of San Francisco to rescind a posthumous award honouring Martin McGuinness's ""courageous service in the military"". Mary Hamilton said an apology from mayor London Breed has ""come too late"" for IRA victims. Mrs Hamilton was injured in the1972 Claudy bomb. Mr McGuinness has been awarded a Certificate of Honour, the equivalent to a ""freedom of the city"" award. Obituary: Martin McGuinness McGuinness' journey from IRA leader to meeting the Queen IRA victims criticised the honour, which also recognises the former IRA leader's role in the peace process. On Monday DUP leader Arlene Foster invited Ms Breed to Northern Ireland to see how ""terrorism still causes pain"". In a statement, the mayor explained that Mr McGuinness had been selected as one of five Grand Marshalls for the award. ""As part of San Francisco's annual St Patrick's Day festivities, the Mayor of San Francisco has traditionally provided Certificates of Honor to the Honorary Grand Marshalls selected by the United Irish Societies of San Francisco,"" she said. ""San Francisco values mean respect for the democratic process and non-violent political actions. ""The language on the Certificate of Honor should have taken more care to apply these values when reflecting the history of Mr McGuinness's life towards peacemaker and his role in the peace process that resulted in the Good Friday Agreement."" Ms Breed said she apologised for ""the pain this certificate has caused"". But Mrs Hamilton said the award to Mr McGuinness should be rescinded. Now an Ulster Unionist party councillor, the former deputy Mayor of Derry, whose brother-in-law George Hamilton was also shot and killed by the IRA in 1972, said she broke down when she heard about the award. Mrs Hamilton said she believed them Mayor of San Francisco, who signed off on the award, had been ill-informed. ""To me the mayor should have visited Northern Ireland to see the legacy that has been left behind,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She is among a number of IRA victims to criticise the award. The aftermath of the Claudy bombings in July 1972 Ann Travers said she was ""completely sickened"" by the honour. Her sister Mary was murdered by the IRA in Belfast in 1984. The target of the ambush was their father, Tom, a resident magistrate. He survived. ""There was nothing courageous about the IRA. As far as I am aware they were not a military organisation but a terrorist organisation. ""Martin McGuinness left behind as his legacy, people with a huge amount of hurt,"" she said. The Poppy Day bomb in Enniskillen in 1987 brought widespread condemnation Margaret Veitch, whose parents died in the IRA Enniskillen bombing, told theBelfast Telegraph,externalthe former deputy first minister, who died in 2017, had gone to his grave ""an unrepentant terrorist"". ""Terrorists are terrorists the world over, except in Northern Ireland where they are put into government and given awards,"" she said. She added: ""I don't know what's wrong with people that terrorists are now being honoured. Will San Francisco now be giving a posthumous honour to Osama bin Laden?"" Mrs Foster, the former first minister, has written to Andrew Whittaker, the British consul general in San Francisco, to pass on a letter to the mayor of San Francisco which details ""some of the IRA's activities"" and extends an invitation to visit Northern Ireland to ""find out first-hand from those who suffered from their terrorism."" In a statement, Mrs Foster said that Mr McGuinness ""undoubtedly played a very important role in the restoration of devolution"" in his later life but ""the earlier part of his life was one of violence"". Martin McGuiness served as Deputy First Minister with Arlene Foster as First Minister until he stood down in January 2017. She said Mr McGuinness was ""commander of the Provisional IRA Londonderry"" during car bomb attacks in Claudy and Coleraine as well as the murder of Patsy Gillespie who was ""used as human car bomb"". Mrs Foster said these attacks are ""likely to be unknown"" to the San Francisco mayor. Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie, a retired Army captain, also reacted angrily. He tweeted to the Democratic mayor of San Francisco: ""I fought shoulder to shoulder with your country after the 9/11 terrorist attack. Yet you honour terrorists who butchered men, women and children in mine. #ShameOnYou."" Mr McGuinness died at the age of 66 in 2017. He was second-in-command of the IRA in Derry at the time of Bloody Sunday. In 1997, he became MP for Mid Ulster, by which time he was  Sinn Fein's chief negotiator in the peace process. By 2007, he was Northern Ireland's deputy first minister standing alongside First Minister Ian Paisley. A Sinn FÃ©in spokesman said the San Francisco award was a ""welcome recognition of the life and legacy of Martin McGuinness"". ""Martin McGuinness made a colossal contribution to the peace process, Irish unity and reconciliation,"" the spokesman said.

"'Unacceptable' self-harm still on InstagramThe NSPCC says leaving graphic images of cutting on the site is ""simply not acceptable"".UK","The NSPCC's Tony Stower said social media firms should face ""really tough regulation"" The NSPCC has criticised Instagram for continuing to allow ""distressing"" pictures of self-harm to remain on the site. Last month, Instagram said all graphic images of self-harm would be removed. The BBC reported three images of people cutting themselves to Instagram. The social media platform added warnings to two but ruled that all three could remain on the site. A spokesman for Instagram said it ""will take time... to get this right"". NSPCC head of child safety online Tony Stower said leaving the posts on the site was ""simply not acceptable"". Mr Stower was shown the image by the Victoria Derbyshire programme that Instagram said did ""not violate our community guidelines"", of a person cutting their wrist. He said it was ""clear... this is a distressing image that should be taken down"". He said the images could be damaging ""to the victims who have self-harmed and may be thinking about [self-harming]"". Alisha Cowie, the current holder of the Miss England title, cut herself as a teenager, and said it was those same kind of images ""that caused me to self-harm"" aged 13. ""What's [leaving them on the site] saying to other children, or even teens or adults on Instagram?"" she asked. She said the images were still ""disturbing"" for her to see now, as an adult. Alisha Cowie said she was inspired to self-harm by images she saw online Instagram says it does allow pictures of healed scars if they are seen to be posted by people who no longer self-harm and offer support to others. But in February, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said all graphic images of self-harm would be removed. His pledge came after the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017,said Instagram had ""helped kill"" his daughter. Mr Stower said it was necessary for the government to place ""really tough regulation"" on social media firms. ""We've seen time and again for the last 10 years these companies will only do the bare minimum. ""They won't do anything until they're forced to,"" he added. The government said it would ""soon publish a White Paper which will set out the responsibilities ofÂ onlineÂ platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not"". Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017. Instagram said in a statement: ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the people who use Instagram. ""As part of an ongoing review with global experts, we are making changes to no longer allow any graphic images of self-harm, such as cutting, and we are making it harder for people to discover non-graphic, self-harm related content. ""We have a responsibility to get this right and are committed to making this change as quickly as possible, but it will take time.''

"Probe finds maternity staff shortagesMaternity staff felt there were not enough of them to do their jobs properly, an inspection reveals.Wales","Cwm Taf health board covers 300,000 people living in the south Wales valleys More details about the scale of the issues facing maternity services in Cwm Taf health board have emerged. They show concerns about ""significant"" maternity staff shortages continued evenafter an investigation was announced into the deaths of 27 babies. Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) found serious problems at Royal Glamorgan hospital, which warned of a potential risk to patient safety. The health board said it had addressed ""all of the immediate concerns"". The HIW held an unannounced inspection at the Royal Glamorgan in October. This was less than two weeks after Cwm Taf health board revealed it was reviewing the care of dozens of babies in the south-east Wales valleys, who had died or suffered ""adverse outcomes"". This now stands at 43 cases, including 22 stillbirths and five deaths shortly after birth. The HIW found:,external Maternity staff shortages on every shift on a regular basis - staff told inspectors there was ""only sometimes, or never enough staff to enable them to do their jobs properly"" They worked long hours to cover rota gaps - with the risk that decisions could be impaired due to fatigue Workers were drafted in from community services to cover at the hospital - potentially compromising the skills mix on shifts Compulsory training for staff, incident reviews and ward audits not being completed, with overstretched staff having to prioritise day-to-day care Emergency equipment and drugs not being regularly checked Some of the concerns were so serious that HIW issued an ""immediate assurance letter"" requiring the health board to act within seven days. Overall the inspectors warned of ""potential risk to the safety of patients"" unless the problems were addressed. Immediate maternity safety improvements ordered Cwm Taf told to 'get back on track' 'My baby is buried 4,000 miles away' 26 baby deaths in maternity probe Consultant-led maternity services moved to Prince Charles hospital (right) from Royal Glamorgan at the start of March Along with concerns about staff shortages inspectors found other problems relating to communication, culture and leadership. These included staff feeling their concerns would not be acted upon, a ""blame culture"" and a lack of confidence in senior managers. However HIW did find frontline staff were trying their best to care for patients with dignity and respect in difficult circumstances, with patients generally positive about the care and treatment provided to them. Apart from Cwm Taf's ongoing internal investigation, the Welsh Government has commissioned a separate and wider independent review, led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives. As a result of a visit in January, a series of immediate actions were agreed. This included bringing forward the admission criteria of premature babies at the Royal Glamorgan hospital from 28 to 32 weeks - with babies needing doctor-led care now treated at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil from the start of March. But BBC Wales - after obtaining correspondence under a Freedom of Information request - can reveal that In January the health board back was also implementing other urgent actions including: Ensuring consultant cover within 20 minutes for the labour ward and that there was sufficient cover for the high-risk pregnancy clinic Immediate extra support for junior doctors which was judged to be ""inadequate"" Addressing the ""high usage"" of locum doctors and giving more support for new midwives 2016-September 2018 43serious incidents 5neonatal deaths 22still births 16live babies 16reviews complete - not serious or care appropriate 15reviews complete - awaiting outcome or inquest The correspondence includes a letter from Cwm Taf's chief executive Allison Williams to staff, which includes an apology for managers not listening. In the letter she states it was ""clearly unacceptable and I am sincerely sorry"" that staff did not feel sufficiently engaged in the management, developments and changes in maternity services. In a statement to BBC Wales, Ms Williams said: ""We take our responsibilities for patients extremely seriously and are determined to do everything necessary to deliver a high quality maternity service that provides safe and effective care.Â ""Since the HIW inspection in October, actions to address all of the immediate concerns have been taken."" She said that included measures to improve staff rotas and cover, and improved procedures for flagging concerns. The health board has also just implemented long-planned changes to the way maternity services are delivered in the area, with consultant-led care delivered at Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr Tydfil and the Royal Galmorgan hospital becoming a midwife-led unit. ""We believe these changes will help us to address the challenges that we have faced, particularly around staffing, and provide us with an opportunity to improve the care we provide to women and their families,"" added the chief executive.

Molly Russell was 14 when she died in 2017 and her parents in part blame the content she viewed on Instagram. Her parents appealed when refused funds to cover their lawyers for the hearing. Ian Russell said he was flabbergasted when officials told him the case did not have ""wider public interest"". Mr Russell said he was delighted the Legal Aid Agency - which operates under the Ministry of Justice - confirmed it had reconsidered its decision. He added: ""I would like to thank everyone for the many offers of support we have received. This decision is a weight lifted from our family and we now look ahead to a full and fearless inquest into Molly's death."" His daughter's case ledministers to demand that online firms do moreto remove harmful posts.

"Last Great Escape veteran dies, aged 101The inmates' tunnel below Stalag Luft III was uncovered as Jack Lyon tried to make his own escape.","Jack Lyon, who was caught when the escape tunnel was uncovered, described the Hollywood film of the wartime escape as ""absolute rubbish"" One of the last veterans of World War Two's Great Escape has died at the age of 101 - just days before the 75th anniversary of the audacious getaway. Jack Lyon, a former RAF navigator, died at his home in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, on Friday. He was lookout during the breakout bid from Stalag Luft III in 1944, but the escape tunnel was uncovered before he had the chance to get out himself. Ironically, he said the plot being rumbled probably saved his life. According to the RAF Benevolent Fund, he had been one of the last known living veterans of the escape attempt, which became the subject of a Hollywood film in 1963. None of the 76 who escaped from the Nazi camp is now alive - 73 were recaptured, of whom 50 were executed on the orders of Adolf Hitler. Jack Lyon was captured after his plane crash-landed near Dusseldorf In an interview with the BBC on his 100th birthday in 2017, Mr Lyon said: ""Had I got out, I probably wouldn't be talking to you because my chances of getting home were virtually nil. I was under no illusions about that."" And he described the Hollywood portrayal of the escape bid, which starred Steve McQueen and a motorcycle, as ""absolute rubbish"". He said: ""Not one American took part in it, and as for the motorbike, it never existed."" RAFBF chief executive Air Vice Marshal David Murray, said: ""Jack belonged to a generation of servicemen we are sadly losing as time goes on. ""His legacy and those of his brave comrades who planned and took part in the audacious Great Escape breakout, are the freedoms we enjoy today. ""To truly pay tribute to his memory and all this who have gone before him, we must never forget. ""Jack's death is especially poignant as it comes just two weeks before the 75th anniversary of the Great Escape, on March 24.""

Has anything changed in the Brexit deal?,"So has anything changed? Yes, and no. The statement issued by the UK and the EU (known officially as ajoint interpretive instrument,external) gives added legal reassurance that both sides intend that the backstop plan for the Irish border, if it ever needs to be used, would be only a temporary measure. But the EU has said this before - notably in aletter sent to Theresa May,externalin January by the President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker and the President of the European Council Donald Tusk. On 14 January, Mrs May said the attorney general had confirmed that the letter meant that EU conclusions about the temporary nature of the backstop ""would have legal force in international law"". So this new document is just another layer of reassurance. In fact, the joint instrument will have the same legal standing asthe withdrawal agreement. But it does not replace, over-rule or contradict it. It is worth emphasising that the text of the backstop itself has not changed, and that means it has no guaranteed end date and there is no unilateral exit mechanism that has been agreed by both sides. So some of the demands made by Brexiteers, which the prime minister said she would seek to address, have not been met. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The motion that the government has laid before Parliament in advance of the meaningful vote reflects all this. It says the joint instrument reduces the risk that the UK could be held in the backstop in Ireland indefinitely - it doesn't say that it removes that risk altogether. Alongside the joint instrument, two other documents have been agreed: ajoint statement,externalthat commits both sides to try to develop technological solutions for the Irish border by the end of 2020; and aunilateral UK statement,externalwhich sets out the government's interpretation of how it could eventually exit the backstop if the EU acts in bad faith. This unilateral statement is only the view of one side. But the fact that the EU has chosen not to object to it means that it does carry some weight. Again, that is not the same as a legal guarantee, but the EU will argue that it has gone as far as it can to meet the political concerns being expressed in Westminster. Taken together, the documents issued last night do offer further reassurance for those who fear that the EU wants to trap the UK permanently in the backstop - something the EU has always insisted it has no intention of doing. But the real problem is finding something that can replace the backstop, which also fulfils the demand to keep the Irish border as open as it is now. No-one knows exactly what that might be: a basic free trade agreement would not be enough. And an agreement to search for alternative arrangements is no guarantee that they will actually be found in a relatively short period of time before the end of 2020.

On Monday, the avalanche risk on the mountain was assessed to be 'high' Earlier Insp Campbell told BBC Scotland that the weather in the area was atrocious. ""The rescuers have been working through some really difficult conditions there, high winds preventing the use of the helicopter,"" she said. ""So although I wasn't up there personally I can just imagine, from the weather on the ground today, it's been very, very challenging for them. ""I would really like to thank those volunteers from the mountain rescue team and those people who were in the area who came into action and assisted so ably."" The Scottish Ambulance Service said it had dispatched three ambulances, a helimed resource and a trauma team to the scene after being alerted at 12:22. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her thoughts were with the bereaved and injured following the ""absolutely tragic news"". Local SNP MSP Kate Forbes added: ""I'm sure that the hearts of everybody in the local area go out to those who are grieving. I sincerely hope that there are no further casualties."" She also expressed gratitude to the mountain rescue team volunteers who were ""ready and willing to go out in all weathers whenever the call comes"".

UK joins Boeing aircraft ban after crash,"The European Union and India have banned the Boeing 737 Max from flying over their airspace to ensure passenger safety. They join a long list of countries in suspending the plane, including the UK. It comes afteran Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people on board. It was the second fatal accident involving the 737 Max 8 model in less than five months. US officials say the aircraft are still safe to fly. However, the US Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union is now calling for the Federal Aviation Administration ""to temporarily ground the 737 Max fleet in the US out of an abundance of caution"". India's Ministry of Civil Aviation announced that it would ground the Boeing 737-Max planes ""immediately"". It said: ""These planes will be grounded till appropriate modifications and safety measures are undertaken to ensure their safe operations."" It following a similar decision by the EU Aviation Safety Agency which said it is suspending the aircraft ""as a precautionary measure"". Earlier today, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was banning the plane, joining other countries including China. Investigators have recovered the flight recorders from the Ethiopian Airlines plane and are currently examining the data to determine what caused the crash. EU Aviation Safety Agency said: ""The accident investigation is currently ongoing, and it is too early to draw any conclusions as to the cause of the accident."" American and Southwest airlines continue to fly their 737 Max 8s in the US The CAA said its directive would remain in place until further notice. It said it took the decision because it did not currently have ""sufficient information"" from the flight data recorder about the fatal crash. Tui Airways and Norwegian both operate the Boeing Max 8 in the UK as part of their fleets. One Turkish Airlines flight to Birmingham turned around and returned to Istanbul. And a Norwegian Air plane from Stockholm to Tel Aviv turned back over Romania. A Tui statement confirmed their 737 Max 8 aircraft were grounded. ""Any customers due to fly home today on a 737 Max 8 from their holiday will be flown back on another aircraft,"" it read. ""Customers due to travel in the coming days will also travel on holiday as planned on other aircraft."" Norwegian said it had also suspended flights of the aircraft and apologised for the inconvenience to passengers. India's SpiceJet, which has an estimated 13 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in its fleet, has suspended the aircraft. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has declared the 737 Max 8 airworthy. But the largest operator of 737 Max 8s in America, Southwest Airlines, is offering passengers scheduled to fly on one of the Boeing planes the chance to change their bookings. Rival American Airlines said its ""standard policies for changes still apply"". Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running to be the Democrats' presidential candidate, called on the FAA ""to get these planes out of the sky."" Boeing has confirmed that for the past few months it has been developing a ""flight control software enhancement"" for the aircraft, but says it is confident they are safe to fly. More than $27bn (Â£21bn) has been wiped off the company's market value since the close of trading on Friday. The delay that saved a man's life More about Boeing 737 Max 8 Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline In the aftermath of the accident, Ethiopia, Singapore, China, France, Ireland, Germany, Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia have all temporarily suspended the 737 Max. Singapore's Changi Airport is the world's sixth busiest and a major hub connecting Asia to Europe and the US, but only a handful of airlines operate the Max 8 aircraft in and out of the country. No Australian airlines operate the Boeing 737 Max, and only two foreign airlines - SilkAir and Fiji Airways - fly the model into the country.

The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating. The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion.It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"",externalon 4 February, the airline said. Followinglast October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted.

According to the charging documents,external, Ms Huffman made a ""charitable contribution"" of $15,000 (Â£11,500) to participate in the scheme on behalf of her eldest daughter. She allegedly arranged to use the scheme a second time, for her younger daughter, before deciding not to do so. Ms Huffman was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. She was secretly recorded discussing the scheme with a co-operating witness. Felicity Huffman was photographed inside the US Courthouse in Los Angeles The papers said the co-operating witness met Ms Huffman and her husband, the actor William H Macy, at their Los Angeles home and explained the scam to them. The witness said the pair ""agreed to the plan"". Mr Macy was not indicted. Ms Huffman appeared in a Los Angeles court later on Tuesday and was released on $250,000 bail. The judge ordered the actress to restrict her travel to the continental US. Mr Macy also attended court. This video can not be played The scheme involved creating fake sporting photographs, said US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew Lelling The actress Lori Loughlin, best known for starring in the US sitcom Full House, was also among those indicted. Ms Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli - who was also indicted - ""agreed to pay bribes totalling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits"" to the University of Southern California (USC) rowing team, the documents said. Both their daughters are currently studying at USC. Federal prosecutors in Boston charged William ""Rick"" Singer, 58, with running the alleged scheme through his company Edge College & Career Network. Mr Singer pleaded guilty on Tuesday in Boston federal court to charges including racketeering, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. He could receive a maximum of 65 years in prison and more than $1m in fines. He told the court: ""I am responsible. I put all the people in place,""local news site Mass Live reported,external. Mr Singer will be sentenced in June. William H Macy, Felicity Huffman and the couple's two daughters at a 2014 movie premiere. According to the FBI, athletics coaches at various institutions were also involved in the scheme - recommending the fraudulent applicants internally and pocketing bribes in return. The head women's football coach at Yale University was allegedly paid $400,000 to accept a student who did not even play the sport - and those parents gave Mr Singer $1.2m for arranging the bribe. ""This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth, combined with fraud,"" Mr Lelling said. ""There can be no separate college admission for wealthy, and I will add there will not be a separate criminal justice system either."" In all, 33 parents were charged as well as 13 athletics coaches and associates of Mr Singer's business. Lori Loughlin has two daughters attending USC The documents detailed two alleged scams run by Mr Singer's firm, Edge College & Career Network: cheating on college entrance exams and using connections with coaches at top schools to organise bribes while faking athletic credentials for students. ""Some parents took advantage of one... some took advantage of the other, and some took advantage of both,"" Mr Lelling said. Parents including Ms Huffman and Ms Loughlin paid somewhere between several thousand dollars and $6.5m to Edge for its services, authorities said, earning Singer about $25m between roughly 2011 and 2018. The firm reportedly instructed parents to claim their child had a disability which required that they be given extra time to complete exams. The FBI said parents were then told to invent an excuse - such as a family wedding - for their students to sit the entrance exams at specific facilities, where staff had been bribed to turn a blind eye to cheating. Someone working for the firm involved in the scandal either sat the exam for the students, gave students the answers, or corrected their answer papers, the FBI said. The Edge staff member who assisted in the cheating was briefed on exactly how well to perform, in order not to raise suspicion that a child's scores had improved too much, the FBI said. Trump 'to scrap' college racial bias policy Wealthy students tighten university grip Fake US university exposes visa scheme In most cases, the students did not know their admissions had been paid for with bribes, but in several the students were involved, officials added. The firm also allegedly created detailed fake athletics profiles for students - including photo-shopping the faces of potential students on to pictures of athletes found online - allowing students to be recruited on athletic scholarships. Mr Lelling said the case arose after authorities were tipped off by the ""target of an entirely different investigation"". Georgetown University was targeted by the scam USC said it had fired two employees who were indicted in the alleged bribery case: senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and water polo coach Jovan Vavic. Court documents say Mr Vavic placed two students on his water polo team to help them get into the university, and was paid $250,000. Ms Heinel also allegedly accepted bribes to facilitate admissions. ""USC is in the process of identifying any funds received by the university in connection with this alleged scheme. Additionally, the university is reviewing its admissions processes broadly to ensure that such actions do not occur going forward."" Georgetown, Yale, UCLA, Wake Forest and the University of Texas released similar statements acknowledging the investigation. On social media, many have expressed outrage over the alleged scam, pointing out that the US college system is already biased in favour of wealthier, white Americans. And others have noted that for the mega-rich, it's easy to legally donate money to a school in order to receive admission. People were photographed climbing school walls to pass on answers to Indian students in 2015 In China, 2,440 pharmacists were accused of cheatingby using earpieces in a national licensing test in 2014, according to China's state TV. Exam cheating is widespread in India. In 2015, several hundred people were arrested in connection with mass school exam cheating in the state of Bihar. A year laterstudent Ruby Rai, who'd been ranked first in state exams, was arrestedand her results cancelled after video of a college interview she'd flunked went viral.

"Last Great Escape veteran dies, aged 101","Jack Lyon, who was caught when the escape tunnel was uncovered, described the Hollywood film of the wartime escape as ""absolute rubbish"" One of the last veterans of World War Two's Great Escape has died at the age of 101 - just days before the 75th anniversary of the audacious getaway. Jack Lyon, a former RAF navigator, died at his home in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, on Friday. He was lookout during the breakout bid from Stalag Luft III in 1944, but the escape tunnel was uncovered before he had the chance to get out himself. Ironically, he said the plot being rumbled probably saved his life. According to the RAF Benevolent Fund, he had been one of the last known living veterans of the escape attempt, which became the subject of a Hollywood film in 1963. None of the 76 who escaped from the Nazi camp is now alive - 73 were recaptured, of whom 50 were executed on the orders of Adolf Hitler. Jack Lyon was captured after his plane crash-landed near Dusseldorf In an interview with the BBC on his 100th birthday in 2017, Mr Lyon said: ""Had I got out, I probably wouldn't be talking to you because my chances of getting home were virtually nil. I was under no illusions about that."" And he described the Hollywood portrayal of the escape bid, which starred Steve McQueen and a motorcycle, as ""absolute rubbish"". He said: ""Not one American took part in it, and as for the motorbike, it never existed."" RAFBF chief executive Air Vice Marshal David Murray, said: ""Jack belonged to a generation of servicemen we are sadly losing as time goes on. ""His legacy and those of his brave comrades who planned and took part in the audacious Great Escape breakout, are the freedoms we enjoy today. ""To truly pay tribute to his memory and all this who have gone before him, we must never forget. ""Jack's death is especially poignant as it comes just two weeks before the 75th anniversary of the Great Escape, on March 24.""

Max Clifford appeal told of trial 'error',"Max Clifford was serving an eight-year jail term when he died The judge at the sexual assault trial of publicist Max Clifford made a ""very significant error"" by not asking the jury to consider the issue of consent, the Court of Appeal has been told. Lawyers say private detectives also have new evidence that throws doubt on the convictions, which are ""unsafe"". Clifford, from Surrey, began the legal challenge before he died aged 74 while serving an eight-year prison term. His daughter, Louise, has continued the appeal on his behalf. The PR consultant was jailed in May 2014 after being convicted of eight indecent assaults, carried out between 1977 and 1984, against four young women and girls. He died from heart failure in December 2017 after collapsing in his cell at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire. Prosecutors told Clifford's trial he had used his celebrity connections to lure women. Obituary: Max Clifford Max Clifford jailed for eight years On Tuesday, his lawyer, Sarah Forshaw QC, said the jury at Southwark Crown Court should have been able to consider whether the women Clifford allegedly assaulted had consented. She told the Court of Appeal that Clifford - known for representing a string of famous clients and selling exclusive stories to tabloid newspapers - had always denied ""forced sexual activity"". She said the grounds of his appeal were ""fresh evidence"", and ""misdirections or inadequate directions"" by the trial judge Anthony Leonard. Max Clifford's daughter has continued the legal challenge on his behalf Ms Forshaw said the ""removal"" of the issue of consent, or ""belief in consent"", from the jury, was an issue. She told the court in his first police interview Clifford had said he wanted to ""emphasise that I have never forced any female to engage in any form of sexual activity with me against their will"". ""He flatly denied the scenarios these women were painting,"" the barrister added. ""The complainants were painting scenarios involving forced sexual activity, which he would always deny, and denied until his death."" Ms Forshaw said Clifford's daughter ""wanted to do what she can to restore his reputation"". Rosina Cottage QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said there was ""no room"" for the issue of consent to be considered by the jury during its deliberations because at the trial Clifford denied the alleged incidents had taken place. He had maintained his relationships with women were ""respectable"", she said. The court also heard that the CPS wanted Clifford's daughter to contribute towards the costs of the appeal. The Court of Appeal has reserved judgment in the case.

Missing Briton died in 'tragic accident',"Catherine Shaw left her accommodation in Guatemala in the early hours of 5 March A British woman who went missing in Guatemala probably died in ""a tragic accident"", a charity has said. Catherine Shaw, 23, from Witney, Oxfordshire, was reported missing after she left Hotel Mayachik near Lake Atitlan on 5 March. Her body was found by a search team about 60ft (18m) from the top of the Indian Nose hiking trail on Monday. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which has been helping Ms Shaw's family, said ""foul play was probably not involved"". Trust chief executive Matthew Searle said speculation that she was raped and murdered was ""incredibly unhelpful, distressing and unnecessary"". He said Ms Shaw had been fasting and she may have passed out or fallen ""due to her lack of intake of food and fluid"". He added: ""She was very much a nature lover and adored sunrises, so it seems quite conceivable that she went up the mountain to greet the sunrise, shedding clothing as she went."" Body found in search for missing Briton Drones used in Guatemala search Family 'desperate' over missing Briton The trust was also working to get pictures of Ms Shaw's body removed from the internet, Mr Searle said. Catherine Shaw had previously visited Mexico and California In a statement, her parents Ann and Tarquin thanked those who helped find her or sent messages of support. ""We wish it to be known how grateful our family are for the huge response locally and across the world in our search for Catherine,"" they said. ""Catherine just loved mountains and sunrises. She died doing what she loved."" A puppy which Ms Shaw took with her when she left the accommodation was found at the peak of the hiking trail on Friday morning. Her body was discovered shortly after a jacket, believed to belong to Ms Shaw, was found nearby. Ms Shaw's body was found on a mountain near Lake Atitlan in Guatemala She set out travelling in September and had been with a friend in Guatemala for two weeks, having previously visited Mexico and California. Over the weekend Guatemalan police, local people and Britons in the country searched along the Indian Nose hiking trail. Drones were also used to search the wooded area.

K-pop star retires amid 'sex bribery' case,"Seungri (left) is accused of trying to procure sex workers for his business investors (file picture) One of South Korea's most successful boyband stars has announced his retirement from showbiz, a day after he was charged with supplying prostitutes to business investors. Seungri will be leaving the five-piece group Big Bang, who have sold over 140 million records since their 2006 debut and are known as the ""Kings of K-pop"". The 28-year-old wrote on Instagram: ""I have decided to retire because the controversy has become so big."" He has denied procuring prostitutes. Seungri, whose real name is Lee Seung-hyun, had already cancelled all planned engagements in February, and the March shows of his solo tour. In a statement he apologised to his fans, and promised to ""sincerely participate in investigations into all allegations"". The world's most controversial K-pop band How to be the perfect K-pop fan WATCH: Can a girl from the Bronx be the next K-pop star? Seungri was questioned by police in February over reports of drug-taking and sexual assault at the Burning Sun club, where he was a public relations director. Local media reports have also linked the singer to ""sex bribery"" - or providing sex services to potential investors in his company Yuri Holdings, which manages his entertainment and restaurant businesses. The lobbying is alleged to have happened at nightclubs in Seoul, South Korea's capital. Prostitution is illegal in South Korea. It is alleged that Seungri tried to obtain prostitutes for clients through a group chat on the messaging app KakaoTalk in 2015. Messages have emerged which appear to show him urging a staff member to make the arrangements. He was also allegedly part of a chat where secretly-filmed sex videos were shared. The hidden camera clips were allegedly taped by another K-pop singer, Jung Joon-young. Korean broadcaster SBS reports that 10 women were filmed. Jung's agency said he would fully cooperate with police investigations. Seungri, who was once described as ""the Great Gatsby of Korea"" for his lavish lifestyle, has a gigantic fanbase - but some had called for him to leave Big Bang as the scandal swept the country. Seungri also owns a global restaurant franchise A petition surfaced last week calling for him to step aside after causing ""unrecoverable damage to the group's reputation"". The singer said in his Instagram statement,external: ""I have faced heavy criticism from the public for the last month and-a-half and I'm being probed by all investigative authorities in the country. ""As I've been branded as a 'national traitor', I cannot stand the fact that I'm harming others for my own sake."" A former supporter replied to the post saying: ""I'm so embarrassed at myself for being your fan for the last 10 years."" Others pledged to stand by Seungri and the band. Fan @_nhungnhim29 wrote simply: ""We'll never let you go."" Bigbang is one of the decade's most successful boybands, at the forefront of K-pop's worldwide spread Shares in the Seungri's talent agency, YG Entertainment Inc, fell 15.6% on Monday, the day his retirement was announced, reaching their lowest level since November 2018. Seungri isn't the first member of Big Bang to be embroiled in controversy, however. In 2011, band leader G-Dragon was investigated for smoking marijuana, which is illegal in South Korea, but was released without charge. Another member, rapper T.O.P, was handed a 10-month suspended prison sentence for marijuana use in 2017. K-pop superstar in intensive care In South Korea they are showbiz royalty - but their popularity has spread across Asia and the rest of the world. In 2016, Forbes magazine named G-Dragon as the most influential person under 30 in Asia's entertainment and sports industries. An example of the band's fame in action: G-Dragon is currently performing his two-year term of military service - which is mandatory for able-bodied men in South Korea. When it began,he got such a deluge of supportive letters that his army base ran out of paper to print them on, and fans had to be urged to show restraint. Seungri had been expected to start his own military service on 25 March. South Korea's Military Manpower Administration confirmed on Monday that he is still expected to join the army as scheduled.

'Unacceptable' self-harm still on Instagram,"The NSPCC's Tony Stower said social media firms should face ""really tough regulation"" The NSPCC has criticised Instagram for continuing to allow ""distressing"" pictures of self-harm to remain on the site. Last month, Instagram said all graphic images of self-harm would be removed. The BBC reported three images of people cutting themselves to Instagram. The social media platform added warnings to two but ruled that all three could remain on the site. A spokesman for Instagram said it ""will take time... to get this right"". NSPCC head of child safety online Tony Stower said leaving the posts on the site was ""simply not acceptable"". Mr Stower was shown the image by the Victoria Derbyshire programme that Instagram said did ""not violate our community guidelines"", of a person cutting their wrist. He said it was ""clear... this is a distressing image that should be taken down"". He said the images could be damaging ""to the victims who have self-harmed and may be thinking about [self-harming]"". Alisha Cowie, the current holder of the Miss England title, cut herself as a teenager, and said it was those same kind of images ""that caused me to self-harm"" aged 13. ""What's [leaving them on the site] saying to other children, or even teens or adults on Instagram?"" she asked. She said the images were still ""disturbing"" for her to see now, as an adult. Alisha Cowie said she was inspired to self-harm by images she saw online Instagram says it does allow pictures of healed scars if they are seen to be posted by people who no longer self-harm and offer support to others. But in February, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said all graphic images of self-harm would be removed. His pledge came after the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017,said Instagram had ""helped kill"" his daughter. Mr Stower said it was necessary for the government to place ""really tough regulation"" on social media firms. ""We've seen time and again for the last 10 years these companies will only do the bare minimum. ""They won't do anything until they're forced to,"" he added. The government said it would ""soon publish a White Paper which will set out the responsibilities ofÂ onlineÂ platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not"". Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017. Instagram said in a statement: ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the people who use Instagram. ""As part of an ongoing review with global experts, we are making changes to no longer allow any graphic images of self-harm, such as cutting, and we are making it harder for people to discover non-graphic, self-harm related content. ""We have a responsibility to get this right and are committed to making this change as quickly as possible, but it will take time.''

Pound falls sharply on Brexit deal advice,"The pound is volatile ahead of Tuesday evening's Commons vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal. Earlier it sank after the government's senior law officer said the legal risk of the UK being tied to EU rules after Brexit ""remains unchanged"". Currency traders fear the attorney general's advice means Theresa May's revised Brexit deal is less likely to be accepted by pro-Brexit MPs. However, the pound has since recovered most of its lost ground. According to attorney general Geoffrey Cox,the UK may not be able to leavethe Irish backstop without the EU's agreement. The pound fell from â¬1.17 to â¬1.15 against the euro following his words on Tuesday morning. Sterling also fell two cents against the dollar from $1.32 to $1.30. Mr Cox's advice is likely to weigh heavily on MPs when parliament votes on the new version of the deal later on Tuesday. Simon Derrick, managing director of BNY Mellon, said the fall in sterling reflected increased uncertainty over the Brexit process. ""The market believes it increases the likelihood of a 'no' vote tonight,"" he said. ""It complicates the issue, it leaves us with the possibility still of a no-deal Brexit, and uncertainty over politics more generally. It muddies the water."" Mr Derrick said if the prime minister's deal was defeated by only a narrow margin ""that might encourage optimism"" that a tweaked deal could be agreed before the end of the month. However, a substantial defeat for the prime minister was likely to push sterling lower, he said. ""When the deal was originally defeated in January, sterling traded down at $1.26 . You could see it move lower again,"" said Mr Derrick. How does Brexit affect the pound? Legal risk of Brexit backstop 'unchanged' Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? Earlier on Tuesday the pound had been trading higher after Theresa May said she had achieved ""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit deal during talks in Brussels. Mrs May said they could be used to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop - the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - indefinitely. The backstop has been criticised by some who believe it will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, but the bloc has said ""if used [it] will apply temporarily"".

Police probe 'IRA' link to suspect devices,"The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it Detectives investigating devices sent to addresses in London and Glasgow have said a claim of responsibility has been made in the name of the ""IRA"". The Met and Police Scotland said similar packages were sent in the past by dissident Northern Ireland groups. Officers also revealed that one package may be unaccounted for. The devices arrived on 5 and 6 March at Waterloo Station, buildings near Heathrow Airport and London City Airport and the University of Glasgow. A joint statement from Police Scotland and the Metropolitan Police said the claim of ""IRA"" responsibility was received on Monday by the Belfast-basedIrish News,external. A recognised codeword was used. University of Glasgow evacuated over suspect package Explosives found at airports and station Bomb disposal experts carried out a controlled explosion following the Glasgow discovery It added: ""Given the packages received last week bore similarities to devices sent in the past which were linked to dissident groups associated with Northern Ireland-related terrorism, officers were already looking at this as a line of inquiry. However, we continue to keep an open mind and enquiries continue. ""We are also aware that those claiming responsibility have indicated five devices were sent. At this time, only four devices have been recovered. ""Extensive advice has already been issued to relevant businesses and sectors to be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police. This advice was previously sent to armed forces personnel and is being reiterated again in light of this claim. ""We continue to urge the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to police."" Julian O'Neill, BBC Northern Ireland Home Affairs Correspondent The vehicle on fire after an explosion in Londonderry The parcel bomb incidents come almost a year after MI5 downgraded the threat posed in Britain by Irish Republicans. It is currently classified as ""moderate"", meaning attacks are possible, but not likely. In Northern Ireland, the risk is greater, exemplified by a car bomb whichdetonated in Londonderryin January. All the attacks were claimed by an organisation calling itself the IRA. It is often referred to as ""the new IRA"", to distinguish it from the group which was active in Northern Ireland's troubles. It is comprised of dissidents who never accepted its namesake's ceasefire more than 20 years ago. Police on both sides of the Irish Sea have mostly been able to contain its threat. They have described it as ""a small"" organisation, perhaps with 50 or so actively engaging in terrorist activity. On 5 March, three ""small improvised explosive devices"" were found at sites across London. Scotland Yard said the packages were all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags. One caught fire when opened by staff at Heathrow. Irish police have been assisting the Met as the Heathrow and Waterloo packages had Republic of Ireland stamps. The following day, a suspect package was found in the mail room at Glasgow University. Several university buildings were evacuated before bomb disposal officers detonated the item.

"K-pop star retires amid 'sex bribery' caseSeungri, whose band sold 140 million records, is accused of supplying prostitutes to business clients.","Seungri (left) is accused of trying to procure sex workers for his business investors (file picture) One of South Korea's most successful boyband stars has announced his retirement from showbiz, a day after he was charged with supplying prostitutes to business investors. Seungri will be leaving the five-piece group Big Bang, who have sold over 140 million records since their 2006 debut and are known as the ""Kings of K-pop"". The 28-year-old wrote on Instagram: ""I have decided to retire because the controversy has become so big."" He has denied procuring prostitutes. Seungri, whose real name is Lee Seung-hyun, had already cancelled all planned engagements in February, and the March shows of his solo tour. In a statement he apologised to his fans, and promised to ""sincerely participate in investigations into all allegations"". The world's most controversial K-pop band How to be the perfect K-pop fan WATCH: Can a girl from the Bronx be the next K-pop star? Seungri was questioned by police in February over reports of drug-taking and sexual assault at the Burning Sun club, where he was a public relations director. Local media reports have also linked the singer to ""sex bribery"" - or providing sex services to potential investors in his company Yuri Holdings, which manages his entertainment and restaurant businesses. The lobbying is alleged to have happened at nightclubs in Seoul, South Korea's capital. Prostitution is illegal in South Korea. It is alleged that Seungri tried to obtain prostitutes for clients through a group chat on the messaging app KakaoTalk in 2015. Messages have emerged which appear to show him urging a staff member to make the arrangements. He was also allegedly part of a chat where secretly-filmed sex videos were shared. The hidden camera clips were allegedly taped by another K-pop singer, Jung Joon-young. Korean broadcaster SBS reports that 10 women were filmed. Jung's agency said he would fully cooperate with police investigations. Seungri, who was once described as ""the Great Gatsby of Korea"" for his lavish lifestyle, has a gigantic fanbase - but some had called for him to leave Big Bang as the scandal swept the country. Seungri also owns a global restaurant franchise A petition surfaced last week calling for him to step aside after causing ""unrecoverable damage to the group's reputation"". The singer said in his Instagram statement,external: ""I have faced heavy criticism from the public for the last month and-a-half and I'm being probed by all investigative authorities in the country. ""As I've been branded as a 'national traitor', I cannot stand the fact that I'm harming others for my own sake."" A former supporter replied to the post saying: ""I'm so embarrassed at myself for being your fan for the last 10 years."" Others pledged to stand by Seungri and the band. Fan @_nhungnhim29 wrote simply: ""We'll never let you go."" Bigbang is one of the decade's most successful boybands, at the forefront of K-pop's worldwide spread Shares in the Seungri's talent agency, YG Entertainment Inc, fell 15.6% on Monday, the day his retirement was announced, reaching their lowest level since November 2018. Seungri isn't the first member of Big Bang to be embroiled in controversy, however. In 2011, band leader G-Dragon was investigated for smoking marijuana, which is illegal in South Korea, but was released without charge. Another member, rapper T.O.P, was handed a 10-month suspended prison sentence for marijuana use in 2017. K-pop superstar in intensive care In South Korea they are showbiz royalty - but their popularity has spread across Asia and the rest of the world. In 2016, Forbes magazine named G-Dragon as the most influential person under 30 in Asia's entertainment and sports industries. An example of the band's fame in action: G-Dragon is currently performing his two-year term of military service - which is mandatory for able-bodied men in South Korea. When it began,he got such a deluge of supportive letters that his army base ran out of paper to print them on, and fans had to be urged to show restraint. Seungri had been expected to start his own military service on 25 March. South Korea's Military Manpower Administration confirmed on Monday that he is still expected to join the army as scheduled.

Something has changed - is it enough?,"""Devastating"" - that's how one influential Brexiteer described the attorney general's legal advice. Yes, the Brexiteer lawyer Geoffrey Cox says the negotiations with the EU and tweaks to the deal have reduced the risk of the UK being stuck in the controversial backstop for ever and a day. That's why last night, Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker looked so thrilled and delighted to have managed to broker something. But what Mr Cox also says clearly is that the risk still exists. Without going through the minutiae of the three-page legal opinion, in short, he has given the prime minister a fig leaf to try to patch a gaping political hole, rather than a generous cover with room to spare. Legal risk of Brexit backstop 'unchanged' Live: Theresa May addresses Commons ahead of Brexit vote It is not true to say that ""nothing has changed"". And remember the latest round of negotiations were never going to tear up the whole deal on the backstop, or change it fundamentally. However, political expectations had been stirred - the last few days have always been about making changes at the margins that would make the UK feel better about the whole thing, not make it go away. And there will be some Tory MPs who use this moment to do what they have wanted to find a way to do for some time - change their mind, and walk through the Aye lobby tonight to back the prime minister. One is said to have joked to the prime minister they'd wanted her to ""bring a rabbit out of the hat from Brussels, and you've come back with a hamster, but that's good enough for me"". But as things stand the number of switchers seems far less than required to avoid another defeat for the prime minister. Last time out she was beaten by a record 230 votes. One cabinet minister guessed the number tonight might be around 150. Everyone is guessing still. But this looks like another dreadful day for Number 10, and another moment when doubts will be on display about not just the divorce deal with the EU, but about the prime minister's leadership too.

"'No vaccine, no school' in Italy","The new law demands 10 compulsory vaccinations - and has proved controversial Italian children have been told not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. The deadline follows months of national debate over compulsory vaccination. Parents risk being fined up to â¬500 (Â£425; $560) if they send their unvaccinated children to school. Children under six can be turned away. The new law came amid a surge in measles cases - but Italian officials say vaccination rates have improved since it was introduced. Under Italy's so-called Lorenzin law - named after the former health minister who introduced it - children must receive a range of mandatory immunisations before attending school. They include vaccinations for chickenpox, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella. Children up to the age of six years will be excluded from nursery and kindergarten without proof of vaccination under the new rules. Those aged between six and 16 cannot be banned from attending school, but their parents face fines if they do not complete the mandatory course of immunisations. The deadline for certification was due to be 10 March after a previous delay - but as it fell on a weekend, it was extended to Monday. ""Now everyone has had time to catch up,"" Health Minister Giulia Grillo told La Repubblica newspaper. Measles cases triple in Europe Vaccine deniers gaining ground YouTube takes ads off 'anti-vax' videos She had reportedly resisted political pressure from deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini to extend the deadline even further. Ms Grillo said the rules were now simple: ""No vaccine, no school"". Italian media report that regional authorities are handling the situation in a number of different ways. In Bologna, the local authority has sent letters of suspension to the parents of some 300 children, and a total of 5,000 children do not have their vaccine documentation up to date. In other areas there have been no reported cases, while still others have been given a grace period of a few days beyond the deadline. The new law was passed to raise Italy's plummeting vaccination rates from below 80% to the World Health Organisation's 95% target. On Monday - the last day for parents to provide documentation proving their children had been properly vaccinated - the Italian health authority released figures claiming a national immunisation rate at or very close to 95% for children born in 2015, depending on which vaccine was being discussed. The 95% threshold is the point at which ""herd immunity"" kicks in - when enough of the population is vaccinated for the spread of the disease to become unlikely, thereby protecting those who cannot be vaccinated. That includes babies too young to be vaccinated themselves, or those with medical conditions such as a compromised immune system. Last month, an eight-year-old recovering from cancer was unable to attend school in Rome due to his weak immune system. The child had spent months receiving treatment for leukaemia, but was at risk of infection because a proportion of pupils in the school had not been vaccinated - including several in the same class. Demonstrations against compulsory vaccination were held in Rome, 2017 The Lorenzin law, drafted by the previous government, had a tumultuous birth. When the current coalition came to power, it said it would drop mandatory immunisations although it later reversed its position. The two populist parties in power had faced accusations that they were pursuing anti-vaccination policies. Writing in a Facebook post on Monday, Ms Grillo admitted it ""is a law that, at the time of approval, we criticised for several reasons"" - and said that the law would be changed to include only those vaccinations that were necessary based on scientific data. The anti-vaccination movement has been growing globally in recent years, sparking alarm from the World Health Organization. A long-discredited paper by Andrew Wakefield was behind much of the scare, but rumours around immunisation have continued to spread, leading to public health risks as not enough people are immune to such diseases. Mr Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register after fraudulently claiming there was a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and autism and bowel disease in children. He made the claim based on the experiences of just 12 children, and no other study since has been able to replicate his results.

Breaking|Breaking news'Several people' in Ben Nevis avalancheA coastguard helicopter and an air ambulance have been sent to the scene.Highlands & Islands,"A Coastguard helicopter involved in the rescue effort A third person has died following an avalanche on Ben Nevis, police have confirmed. Two climbers died at the scene and a fourth person was injured in the incident, which took place in an area known as Number 5 Gully. The alarm was raised at 11:50 and a Coastguard helicopter, air ambulance, three road ambulances and a trauma team were sent to the scene. Mountain rescue teams from Lochaber and Glencoe also joined the rescue effort. And a group of military personnel training in the area offered assistance to the rescuers. Police initially said two people died in the avalanche and two people were injured. One of the injured climbers later died and the second was airlifted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow for treatment. Officers said they were working to establish the identity of the climbers and were following a ""positive line of inquiry"" in relation to their identity. Insp Isla Campbell said: ""This has been a challenging operation and I want to pass on my thanks to the mountain rescue teams, colleagues at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Scottish Ambulance Service for their assistance in extremely difficult conditions. ""I would also like to praise members of the public and staff from the Scottish Avalanche Information Service who were on scene at the time and provided immediate assistance."" On Monday, the avalanche risk on the mountain was assessed to be 'high' Earlier Insp Campbell told BBC Scotland that the weather in the area was atrocious. ""The rescuers have been working through some really difficult conditions there, high winds preventing the use of the helicopter,"" she said. ""So although I wasn't up there personally I can just imagine, from the weather on the ground today, it's been very, very challenging for them. ""I would really like to thank those volunteers from the mountain rescue team and those people who were in the area who came into action and assisted so ably."" The Scottish Ambulance Service said it had dispatched three ambulances, a helimed resource and a trauma team to the scene after being alerted at 12:22. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her thoughts were with the bereaved and injured following the ""absolutely tragic news"". Local SNP MSP Kate Forbes added: ""I'm sure that the hearts of everybody in the local area go out to those who are grieving. I sincerely hope that there are no further casualties."" She also expressed gratitude to the mountain rescue team volunteers who were ""ready and willing to go out in all weathers whenever the call comes"". Mountain rescue teams, the coastguard, police and ambulance service were involved in the rescue effort Ben Nevis has been the scene of other fatal accidents this winter. A 21-year-old German woman, who was studying at Bristol University, diedafter she fell from a ridge she had been climbing with three other peopleon New Year's Day. In December,Patrick Boothroyd, 21, from West Yorkshiredied after a fall on the mountain. Elsewhere in the Highlands, a 57-year-old man died after he and a companion werereported missing in Glen Coe on Saturday.

BBC investigated over pay discrimination,"The BBC is to be investigated over suspected past pay discrimination against female employees. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) inquiry follows complaints that female workers were not paid the same as men for equal work. The BBC has voluntarily provided the EHRC with information about its pay policies. The investigation will look at records dating back to 2016. The EHRC says it hopes to publish the results by the end of this year. The BBC's director general Tony Hall said: ""We've been through a tremendous period of reform - and have already changed things for the better. The Commission itself recognises our commitment to reform and our collaborative approach. ""We try to be the gold standard of what everyone wants from society - openness, respect and equality. We may not always succeed, but I am confident that we are a decent and fair employer. And, of course, if there's more we can do, we will."" The EHRC said it ""suspects that there has been unlawful pay discrimination by the BBC... in the period prior to the introduction of these recent reforms. ""The Commission recognises the BBC's commitment to reform and its desire to work collaboratively in ensuring that the reforms are fully refined and embedded. Against that background, the Commission wishes to review whether such reforms have fully corrected any potential historic unlawful pay discrimination."" The BBC's Carrie Gracie resigned from her role as China Editor over equal pay In January, the BBC published a review of on-air pay carried out by PwC, and set out a five-point plan to help create a fairer and more equal BBC. Those plans included substantial pay cuts for some men and increases for some male and female presenters and greater pay transparency. A BBC spokesperson said: ""As we have already acknowledged, we have some historic equal pay cases. We are profoundly sorry for this. We regret the time it has taken to resolve all of the questions, but some of these are complex and have not been straightforward to resolve. We are determined to make progress on the remaining ones. ""Given the public focus on this important issue we understand why the Equality and Human Rights Commission is looking for assurance on equal pay and we welcome it. It is a logical time to do this as we have gone through a period of significant reform. ""We are confident that the BBC can provide that assurance and indeed go beyond and demonstrate our commitment to be a model for others to follow in this area as a result of our reform programme, although of course we will learn any lessons from the EHRC's work as we continue to deliver change."" In January, the BBC was criticised by a group of MPswho said the corporation was refusing to admit it had a problem when it comes to equal pay. The House of Commons culture committee has been investigating the issue. It said it was ""very disappointed that the BBC has failed to acknowledge that a pay discrimination problem exists"". The inquiry was sparked when presenter Carrie Gracie accused the BBC of pay discrimination last year. The BBC said it had now made ""significant reforms"". The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee publishedhighly critical findings into the BBC's pay structurein October.

"Missing Briton died in 'tragic accident'Catherine Shaw may have fallen while climbing a mountain in Guatemala, a charity says.Oxford","Catherine Shaw left her accommodation in Guatemala in the early hours of 5 March A British woman who went missing in Guatemala probably died in ""a tragic accident"", a charity has said. Catherine Shaw, 23, from Witney, Oxfordshire, was reported missing after she left Hotel Mayachik near Lake Atitlan on 5 March. Her body was found by a search team about 60ft (18m) from the top of the Indian Nose hiking trail on Monday. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which has been helping Ms Shaw's family, said ""foul play was probably not involved"". Trust chief executive Matthew Searle said speculation that she was raped and murdered was ""incredibly unhelpful, distressing and unnecessary"". He said Ms Shaw had been fasting and she may have passed out or fallen ""due to her lack of intake of food and fluid"". He added: ""She was very much a nature lover and adored sunrises, so it seems quite conceivable that she went up the mountain to greet the sunrise, shedding clothing as she went."" Body found in search for missing Briton Drones used in Guatemala search Family 'desperate' over missing Briton The trust was also working to get pictures of Ms Shaw's body removed from the internet, Mr Searle said. Catherine Shaw had previously visited Mexico and California In a statement, her parents Ann and Tarquin thanked those who helped find her or sent messages of support. ""We wish it to be known how grateful our family are for the huge response locally and across the world in our search for Catherine,"" they said. ""Catherine just loved mountains and sunrises. She died doing what she loved."" A puppy which Ms Shaw took with her when she left the accommodation was found at the peak of the hiking trail on Friday morning. Her body was discovered shortly after a jacket, believed to belong to Ms Shaw, was found nearby. Ms Shaw's body was found on a mountain near Lake Atitlan in Guatemala She set out travelling in September and had been with a friend in Guatemala for two weeks, having previously visited Mexico and California. Over the weekend Guatemalan police, local people and Britons in the country searched along the Indian Nose hiking trail. Drones were also used to search the wooded area.

Bungled footballer murder probe reopened,"The killing of Kevin Nunes in 2002 remains unsolved after a string of police mistakes The 2002 murder of a footballer is to be re-investigated after a string of police errors led to five convictions being overturned. Kevin Nunes was 20 when he was killed in an apparent gangland shooting in Pattingham, Staffordshire. Five men jailed in 2008 had their murder convictions quashed after police failings in the case were uncovered. Staffordshire's Chief Constable Gareth Morgan apologised to Mr Nunes' family and said they had been ""let down"". This video can not be played Staffordshire Police's chief constable, Gareth Morgan, says the new investigation is 'the right thing to do' The re-investigation follows a review of the case by Merseyside Police which has made more than 60 recommendations. Announcing the new investigation, Mr Morgan said it was ""a significant moment"" for Mr Nunes' family. Mr Nunes' partner, Leanne Williams, was pregnant with their son when he was killed He said he acknowledged the ""serious police failings"" and apologised on behalf of the Staffordshire force. ""I am particularly sorry that the family of Kevin have not received justice for his death. I know they have been let down,"" he said. By Phil Mackie, BBC News Correspondent This is really welcome news for Kevin Nunes' partner, Leanne Williams, their 16-year-old son and the rest of the family. Even back in 2002 they thought there would be little chance of a successful prosecution because few people were willing to come forward with information. The case is believed to have involved drugs gangs. The family celebrated when five men were jailed in 2008, but were distraught when the convictions were quashed because of mistakes made during the original investigation. It has taken a lot to rebuild the relationship between the family and Staffordshire Police, but they are pleased there's new hope that Kevin's killers can be found and brought to justice. Despite police taking more than 1,000 statements about Mr Nunes' murder, only one witness, Simeon Taylor, was willing to give evidence. The five men who were put at the scene of Mr Nunes' murder by Taylor were jailed for life in 2008, but they were freed in 2012 when information about how police handled their informant came to light. Mr Nunes' body was found on a country lane in South Staffordshire in 2002 Taylor, who was in jail when he came forward, abused the police protection he was given, committing crimes and breaching a behaviour code of conduct 76 times without ever being charged for fear it would harm his role as key witness. The force was also found to have taken Taylor on nights out drinking and even sent him on a taxpayer funded trip to South Africa, believed to have cost up to Â£10,000. The police mistakes that sank a murder case Force reviews 'flawed' gun murder case Latest news from the West Midlands A senior investigating officer and a team of detectives will now re-investigate the murder.

Something has changed but is it enough?,"""Devastating"" - that's how one influential Brexiteer described the attorney general's legal advice. Yes, the Brexiteer lawyer Geoffrey Cox says the negotiations with the EU and tweaks to the deal have reduced the risk of the UK being stuck in the controversial backstop for ever and a day. That's why last night, Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker looked so thrilled and delighted to have managed to broker something. But what Mr Cox also says clearly is that the risk still exists. Without going through the minutiae of the three-page legal opinion, in short, he has given the prime minister a fig leaf to try to patch a gaping political hole, rather than a generous cover with room to spare. Legal risk of Brexit backstop 'unchanged' Live: Theresa May addresses Commons ahead of Brexit vote It is not true to say that ""nothing has changed"". And remember the latest round of negotiations were never going to tear up the whole deal on the backstop, or change it fundamentally. However, political expectations had been stirred - the last few days have always been about making changes at the margins that would make the UK feel better about the whole thing, not make it go away. And there will be some Tory MPs who use this moment to do what they have wanted to find a way to do for some time - change their mind, and walk through the Aye lobby tonight to back the prime minister. One is said to have joked to the prime minister they'd wanted her to ""bring a rabbit out of the hat from Brussels, and you've come back with a hamster, but that's good enough for me"". But as things stand the number of switchers seems far less than required to avoid another defeat for the prime minister. Last time out she was beaten by a record 230 votes. One cabinet minister guessed the number tonight might be around 150. Everyone is guessing still. But this looks like another dreadful day for Number 10, and another moment when doubts will be on display about not just the divorce deal with the EU, but about the prime minister's leadership too.

Kuenssberg: Will changes satisfy MPs?,"This video can not be played Theresa May: We have secured what MPs asked for Monday morning government blues have been replaced by Tuesday morning nervous hopes. The government does not suddenly expect its Brexit deal to be ushered through at speed, cheered on by well-wishers. It does, however, believe that Monday night's double act in Strasbourg by Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker puts it, to quote one cabinet minister, ""back in the races"". The extra assurances wrought from weeks of talkswith the EU will move some of the prime minister's objectors from the ""no"" column to the ""yes"". And for Mrs May to have achieved nothing from this process might have been terminal, and not just for her deal itself. But even her most enthusiastic supporters, such as they are these days, don't pretend the prime minister and the government are home and dry. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal Brexit A rump of Brexiteers will require public assurance from the attorney general, who's said to be agonising, that the update to the EU divorce deal has real meaning - and is not just a rickety set of steps to climb down. With the vote hours away, the PM begins one of the singularly most important days in her leadership so far with the same challenge that's plagued her every day - will her version of Brexit ever be sufficient for enough Brexiteers? Part of that answer lies not just in whether they believe in the substance of the assurances the prime minister and her team have bargained with Brussels, but also whether they believe the man who was sitting next to her on Monday - Mr Juncker - who warned MPs explicitly that there will be ""no third chance"". It's this deal, no deal, or indeed, no Brexit - almost (at last, her supporters might say), reading supportively from the PM's script. One senior cabinet minister said 10 days ago it was imperative that the EU made clear whatever was on offer was indeed its ""best and final offer"". Mrs May's critics will be asking themselves on Tuesday not just if what she has brokered changes enough, but whether that is, really, really now it?

UK joins Boeing 737 Max aircraft ban,"The European Union and India have banned the Boeing 737 Max from flying over their airspace to ensure passenger safety. They join a long list of countries in suspending the plane, including the UK. It comes afteran Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people on board. It was the second fatal accident involving the 737 Max 8 model in less than five months. US officials say the aircraft are still safe to fly. However, the US Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union is now calling for the Federal Aviation Administration ""to temporarily ground the 737 Max fleet in the US out of an abundance of caution"". India's Ministry of Civil Aviation announced that it would ground the Boeing 737-Max planes ""immediately"". It said: ""These planes will be grounded till appropriate modifications and safety measures are undertaken to ensure their safe operations."" It following a similar decision by the EU Aviation Safety Agency which said it is suspending the aircraft ""as a precautionary measure"". Earlier today, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was banning the plane, joining other countries including China. Investigators have recovered the flight recorders from the Ethiopian Airlines plane and are currently examining the data to determine what caused the crash. EU Aviation Safety Agency said: ""The accident investigation is currently ongoing, and it is too early to draw any conclusions as to the cause of the accident."" American and Southwest airlines continue to fly their 737 Max 8s in the US The CAA said its directive would remain in place until further notice. It said it took the decision because it did not currently have ""sufficient information"" from the flight data recorder about the fatal crash. Tui Airways and Norwegian both operate the Boeing Max 8 in the UK as part of their fleets. One Turkish Airlines flight to Birmingham turned around and returned to Istanbul. And a Norwegian Air plane from Stockholm to Tel Aviv turned back over Romania. A Tui statement confirmed their 737 Max 8 aircraft were grounded. ""Any customers due to fly home today on a 737 Max 8 from their holiday will be flown back on another aircraft,"" it read. ""Customers due to travel in the coming days will also travel on holiday as planned on other aircraft."" Norwegian said it had also suspended flights of the aircraft and apologised for the inconvenience to passengers. India's SpiceJet, which has an estimated 13 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in its fleet, has suspended the aircraft. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has declared the 737 Max 8 airworthy. But the largest operator of 737 Max 8s in America, Southwest Airlines, is offering passengers scheduled to fly on one of the Boeing planes the chance to change their bookings. Rival American Airlines said its ""standard policies for changes still apply"". Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running to be the Democrats' presidential candidate, called on the FAA ""to get these planes out of the sky."" Boeing has confirmed that for the past few months it has been developing a ""flight control software enhancement"" for the aircraft, but says it is confident they are safe to fly. More than $27bn (Â£21bn) has been wiped off the company's market value since the close of trading on Friday. The delay that saved a man's life More about Boeing 737 Max 8 Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline In the aftermath of the accident, Ethiopia, Singapore, China, France, Ireland, Germany, Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia have all temporarily suspended the 737 Max. Singapore's Changi Airport is the world's sixth busiest and a major hub connecting Asia to Europe and the US, but only a handful of airlines operate the Max 8 aircraft in and out of the country. No Australian airlines operate the Boeing 737 Max, and only two foreign airlines - SilkAir and Fiji Airways - fly the model into the country. If you are affected by this story emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external This video can not be played The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza, at the scene, said there was a huge crater at the site of the crash The Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft are the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating. The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion.It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"",externalon 4 February, the airline said. Followinglast October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. Eyewitnesses say they saw a trail of smoke, sparks and debris as the plane nosedived. Have you been personally affected by this story?

Boat abandoned off Land's End found in Norway,"Duncan Hutchison's boat was found in SÃ¸mna, Norway A hand-built wooden rowing boat has been found in Norway six months after it was abandoned off Land's End during an attempted Transatlantic crossing. Duncan Hutchison, from Lochinver, spent three years constructing the craft before attempting to row it from New York to his home in the west Highlands. He wasrescued in Septemberafter rowing more than half of his 3,000-mile (4,828 km) adventure. The boat was found in SÃ¸mna, a municipality north of Trondheim. The country has a link to the craft's name, Sleipnir, which is the name of an eight-legged horse from Norse mythology that could glide across the sea. It was spotted floating close to shore at the weekend and was hauled ashore. Mr Hutchison said he never had any doubts about Sleipnir's chances of survival in rough seas The Norwegians who found it were able to track down Mr Hutchison from the boat's registration number and personal items he was forced to leave behind. Among Mr Hutchison's belongings still inside the boat was a ball with a red hand print on it in the style of Wilson, a prop in the Tom Hanks film Cast Away. Mr Hutchison, who was rescued by a New York-bound tanker in bad weather, rough seas and after his power supply failed after 100 days at sea, is now making arrangements to have Sleipnir taken to Scotland. He said he was not surprised the boat survived after he was forced to abandon it. Mr Hutchison said: ""I never had any qualms about the Sleipner's survival at sea, even in the worst conditions. ""My only concern was that once it came ashore it might be smashed up against rocks. Thankfully the people who found it were able to take it ashore."" Duncan Hutchison and a feathered friend during his Atlantic challenge Mr Hutchison started the crossing in May Mr Hutchison's Cast Away-style Wilson was still inside Sleipner when it was found in Norway He added: ""I thought it might end up in Norway because of the Gulf Stream."" Mr Hutchison's has raised thousands of pounds for the charity Wateraid from his venture. He had been rescued earlier in his attempted crossing when he got into difficulty in stormy weather off New Jersey in the US. His boat with all his belongings was even lost for a time, before washing up on a beach, allowing him to resume his attempt.

School's LGBT lessons 'are appropriate',"About 100 people gathered outside the school for a protest at the start of February Lessons about LGBT rights and homophobia at a school which sparked parent protests are age-appropriate, Ofsted has said. Rallies have been held outside Birmingham's Parkfield Community Schoolover the No Outsiders project. In a report, Ofsted said there was no evidence the curriculum overly focused on LGBT issues or was not taught in an age-appropriate manner. Head teacher David Williams described the findings as ""great news"". But one parent who has opposed the project called the Ofsted report ""a fallacy"". Inspectors visited the school after concerns were raised about its leadership. The project was developed by assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat in 2014, with theaim of educating children to accept differences in society. As well as LGBT issues, it teaches about race, religion, gender identity, age and disabilities. Latest news from the West Midlands But it hasfaced criticism from some Muslim parentsfor teaching children about same-sex couples. They claimed the classes were not appropriate for young children and have staged protests. Assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat created the No Outsiders programme In a report, Ofsted's senior inspector Peter Humphries said: ""A very small, but vocal, minority of parents are not clear about the school's vision, policies and practice. ""This group of parents feel that staff do not sufficiently listen to their concerns. ""Their view is that PSHE education and equalities curriculum focuses disproportionately on LGBT issues and that this work is not taught in an age-appropriate manner. ""Inspectors found no evidence this was the case."" The school which helps the whole family 'You're a hijabi girl, you can't box' Boy, 8, 'hid knives to protect himself' Maqsood Hussain, who has two children at the school, called the Ofsted report a ""whitewash"", insisting the issue concerned the age of the children. ""If there is nothing wrong, why do you find 600 children being withdrawn from school as a result of what is being taught in school?,"" he said. ""Why do you find a petition with over 500 names attached to it? Why do you find parents protesting for the last five or six weeks and then, there is nothing wrong? ""Clearly there is a breakdown. Clearly there are issues. The report itself is a whitewash. The report itself is a fallacy."" The education watchdog recommended the outstanding-rated school ""develops its engagement with parents"" so they understand how curriculum content is taught. In a letter to parents, Mr Williams said it was ""great news"" inspectors recognised it had maintained the ""high standards of education seen at the previous inspection"". West Midlands Police said it would be attending future meetings arranged by the school to prevent any breaches of the peace.

Laura Kuenssberg: Will May's changes satisfy Brexiteers?,"This video can not be played Theresa May: We have secured what MPs asked for Monday morning government blues have been replaced by Tuesday morning nervous hopes. The government does not suddenly expect its Brexit deal to be ushered through at speed, cheered on by well-wishers. It does, however, believe that Monday night's double act in Strasbourg by Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker puts it, to quote one cabinet minister, ""back in the races"". The extra assurances wrought from weeks of talkswith the EU will move some of the prime minister's objectors from the ""no"" column to the ""yes"". And for Mrs May to have achieved nothing from this process might have been terminal, and not just for her deal itself.

'Lack of consistency' over carers funding,"The Scottish government's draft budget for 2018-19 contained a commitment of Â£19.4m to support the implementation of the new legislation Money for implementing a new law to support unpaid carers in Scotland is being spent inconsistently by councils, according to charities. The Carers (Scotland) Act 2016 came into force last April giving carers a legal right to support. This included counselling, practical help, training and short breaks. Figures given toBBC Scotland's The Ninesuggested more than a quarter of government funding for councils to roll out the Carers Act has not been spent. The Scottish government said while each council may vary in how they spend the money it should be used to support carers. Carers 'struggling to get a break' Bill to support carers passed by MSPs Warning over cost of Carers Bill Cosla, the body that represents Scottish councils, said different local authorities ""will have different ways of spending the limited resources on offer to achieve their aims"". The Scottish government's draft budget for 2018-19 contained a commitment of Â£19.4m to support the implementation of the new legislation, including Â£2m for ""workforce development"". In December 2018, three charities which represent carers sent Freedom of Information (FoI) requests to all Scottish councils asking how they had spent their share of this funding. They said their findings suggested that Â£5.4m of the funding had not yet been spent, and that figure could prove to be as high as Â£9m once local authorities have provided full evidence of how they have spent the funding. The act aims to give carers a legal right to support such as training, advice, respite and short breaks The Carers (Scotland) Act 2016 enshrines in law, for the first time, a duty on local authorities to provide support to carers, if they meet eligibility criteria set by the council. Prior to this carers had the right to have their needs assessed, but not a right to support services. The act gives every adult carer the right to an Adult Carer Support plan, and every carer under 16 the right to a Young Carers Statement. These are personalised support plans which identify carers' needs. The Carers Act also places a requirement on local authorities to have an information and advice service for carers. Claire Cairns, from Coalition of Carers in Scotland, said its research had revealed a ""lack of consistency"" in the way the Carers Act was being delivered. ""When the act was brought to parliament, the minister said, 'this is to provide support on a more consistent basis.' That was the phrase he used, and I think that's one thing the Carers Act hasn't achieved,"" she said. ""Some areas haven't fully committed the funding they received from the Scottish government and actually spent it on carer support."" Claire Cairns, from Coalition of Carers in Scotland, said more resources were required to ensure carers get the support they need Ms Cairns also said there had been a rise in referrals to carer centres across Scotland. ""It means carers are getting support earlier which is exactly what the act should be doing,"" she said. ""But the knock-on effect in services is there needs to be more resources to make sure that when carers come in through the door they're getting the support they're looking for."" Hannah is a carer for her mum Vivienne and her brother David Ten-year-old Hannah McGavin, from Dunoon, takes care of her mum Vivienne, who has health problems including arthritis of the spine, and her autistic brother David. She said: ""Sometimes my mum's always struggling with things. I know other people like some of my friends who are young carers - sometimes I notice that their families are getting a little bit more support than ours."" Hannah is in the process of applying for a young carer's statement - an official document which would identify her support needs. She receives support from a local charity, including away days and counselling. She added: ""I'd rather do a little more fun and a little less caring sometimes. But it's what I need to do because I need to help David and my mum."" Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership said it was working closely with local carer organisations to implement the Carers Act. A spokeswoman said a referral to the local social work team would be encouraged for any carers nearing the eligibility criteria. The Coalition of Carers in Scotland - working with Shared Care Scotland and the Coalition of Care Providers - and sent FoIs to all 32 councils in Scotland. They received responses from 29 local authorities and three councils - East Dunbartonshire, Shetland and West Lothian - had not yet responded. The findings highlighted: Significant variations in the way the money was spent by each council A total of Â£13m had been spent by councils on the Carers Act so far Both Moray and Orkney councils had not allocated any of their share of the funding specifically toward implementing the Carers Act. The charities also raised concerns that the share of the funding given to some councils had not been spent effectively, with a significant portion going on waiving fees for services provided to support carers. The charities said this was not directly related to extending support for carers under the terms of the Carers Act. There was also evidence that some of the funding provided to councils simply replaced existing funding that had been discontinued. Donna Alcorn says she has not been getting the support she needs Donna Alcorn, 34, from Parkhead in Glasgow, had to cut her hours as a dental nurse to care full-time for her six-year-old son Lewis. He has tuberous sclerosis, a condition that involves the growth of non-cancerous tumours in his brain. She also looks after nine-month-old baby Connor. ""It's mostly Lewis's challenging behaviours and seizure activity,"" she said. ""It's hard to deal with because it then makes you think, 'How much longer can I physically cope with Lewis?' That in itself is a massive fear for me. ""We get 24 nights a year at a residential respite. It's the only two nights a month where we know we won't be woken up by screaming or shouting in the middle of the night."" She added: ""The supports that were supposed to be put in place over the summer holidays didn't get put in place. ""You're a mess when you're a carer because you don't get time to look after you. Your sole focus is the person you're caring for. ""For somebody to be looking out for the carer would be quite nice."" Glasgow Health and Social Care Partnership said it had carried out ""a comprehensive needs assessment"" and ""a substantial budget"" had been provided for support costs in this case. A Scottish government spokesman said last year's budget included Â£66m to ""support additional expenditure by local government on social care, including the Carers Act"". She added: ""We've provided Â£17.4m to local authorities to fully fund the implementation of the Carers Act. Along with integration authorities they are responsible for how they deliver support to carers in keeping with the legislation. ""While this may lead to some variation in the nature of the service delivered by each local authority to reflect their local circumstances, we have been clear in our expectation that the resources we have provided should support carers"" The budget for delivering the Carers Act is expected to be increased by Â£10.5m next year. Councillor Stuart Currie, Cosla's health and social care spokesman, said ""We are aware that work is underway locally to change systems which could impact on the figures reported. ""Concerns were raised by Cosla around the funding of the act and we have committed to working with Scottish government to ensure that the policy is fully funded to allow councils to fulfil their duties.""

Australia bars Boeing 737 Max aircraft,"The European Union and India have banned the Boeing 737 Max from flying over their airspace to ensure passenger safety. They join a long list of countries in suspending the plane, including the UK. It comes afteran Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people on board. It was the second fatal accident involving the 737 Max 8 model in less than five months. US officials say the aircraft are still safe to fly. However, the US Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union is now calling for the Federal Aviation Administration ""to temporarily ground the 737 Max fleet in the US out of an abundance of caution"". India's Ministry of Civil Aviation announced that it would ground the Boeing 737-Max planes ""immediately"". It said: ""These planes will be grounded till appropriate modifications and safety measures are undertaken to ensure their safe operations."" It following a similar decision by the EU Aviation Safety Agency which said it is suspending the aircraft ""as a precautionary measure"". Earlier today, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was banning the plane, joining other countries including China. Investigators have recovered the flight recorders from the Ethiopian Airlines plane and are currently examining the data to determine what caused the crash. EU Aviation Safety Agency said: ""The accident investigation is currently ongoing, and it is too early to draw any conclusions as to the cause of the accident."" American and Southwest airlines continue to fly their 737 Max 8s in the US The CAA said its directive would remain in place until further notice. It said it took the decision because it did not currently have ""sufficient information"" from the flight data recorder about the fatal crash. Tui Airways and Norwegian both operate the Boeing Max 8 in the UK as part of their fleets. One Turkish Airlines flight to Birmingham turned around and returned to Istanbul. And a Norwegian Air plane from Stockholm to Tel Aviv turned back over Romania. A Tui statement confirmed their 737 Max 8 aircraft were grounded. ""Any customers due to fly home today on a 737 Max 8 from their holiday will be flown back on another aircraft,"" it read. ""Customers due to travel in the coming days will also travel on holiday as planned on other aircraft."" Norwegian said it had also suspended flights of the aircraft and apologised for the inconvenience to passengers. India's SpiceJet, which has an estimated 13 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in its fleet, has suspended the aircraft. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has declared the 737 Max 8 airworthy. But the largest operator of 737 Max 8s in America, Southwest Airlines, is offering passengers scheduled to fly on one of the Boeing planes the chance to change their bookings. Rival American Airlines said its ""standard policies for changes still apply"". Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running to be the Democrats' presidential candidate, called on the FAA ""to get these planes out of the sky."" Boeing has confirmed that for the past few months it has been developing a ""flight control software enhancement"" for the aircraft, but says it is confident they are safe to fly. More than $27bn (Â£21bn) has been wiped off the company's market value since the close of trading on Friday. The delay that saved a man's life More about Boeing 737 Max 8 Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline In the aftermath of the accident, Ethiopia, Singapore, China, France, Ireland, Germany, Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia have all temporarily suspended the 737 Max. Singapore's Changi Airport is the world's sixth busiest and a major hub connecting Asia to Europe and the US, but only a handful of airlines operate the Max 8 aircraft in and out of the country. No Australian airlines operate the Boeing 737 Max, and only two foreign airlines - SilkAir and Fiji Airways - fly the model into the country.

The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating. The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion.It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"",externalon 4 February, the airline said. Followinglast October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted.

BBC investigated over pay discriminationThe Equality and Human Rights Commission is looking into past pay discrimination against women at the BBC.Entertainment & Arts,"The BBC is to be investigated over suspected past pay discrimination against female employees. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) inquiry follows complaints that female workers were not paid the same as men for equal work. The BBC has voluntarily provided the EHRC with information about its pay policies. The investigation will look at records dating back to 2016. The EHRC says it hopes to publish the results by the end of this year. The BBC's director general Tony Hall said: ""We've been through a tremendous period of reform - and have already changed things for the better. The Commission itself recognises our commitment to reform and our collaborative approach. ""We try to be the gold standard of what everyone wants from society - openness, respect and equality. We may not always succeed, but I am confident that we are a decent and fair employer. And, of course, if there's more we can do, we will."" The EHRC said it ""suspects that there has been unlawful pay discrimination by the BBC... in the period prior to the introduction of these recent reforms. ""The Commission recognises the BBC's commitment to reform and its desire to work collaboratively in ensuring that the reforms are fully refined and embedded. Against that background, the Commission wishes to review whether such reforms have fully corrected any potential historic unlawful pay discrimination."" The BBC's Carrie Gracie resigned from her role as China Editor over equal pay In January, the BBC published a review of on-air pay carried out by PwC, and set out a five-point plan to help create a fairer and more equal BBC. Those plans included substantial pay cuts for some men and increases for some male and female presenters and greater pay transparency. A BBC spokesperson said: ""As we have already acknowledged, we have some historic equal pay cases. We are profoundly sorry for this. We regret the time it has taken to resolve all of the questions, but some of these are complex and have not been straightforward to resolve. We are determined to make progress on the remaining ones. ""Given the public focus on this important issue we understand why the Equality and Human Rights Commission is looking for assurance on equal pay and we welcome it. It is a logical time to do this as we have gone through a period of significant reform. ""We are confident that the BBC can provide that assurance and indeed go beyond and demonstrate our commitment to be a model for others to follow in this area as a result of our reform programme, although of course we will learn any lessons from the EHRC's work as we continue to deliver change."" In January, the BBC was criticised by a group of MPswho said the corporation was refusing to admit it had a problem when it comes to equal pay. The House of Commons culture committee has been investigating the issue. It said it was ""very disappointed that the BBC has failed to acknowledge that a pay discrimination problem exists"". The inquiry was sparked when presenter Carrie Gracie accused the BBC of pay discrimination last year. The BBC said it had now made ""significant reforms"". The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee publishedhighly critical findings into the BBC's pay structurein October.

"Knife crime: Schools not responsible, says Ofsted","Responsibility for rising knife crime cannot be ""landed on schools in the absence of properly funded local services,"" says the head of Ofsted. Amanda Spielman says schools in London are not well enough supported when it comes to dealing with knife crime. Ms Spielman says that schools do not have the ability to address the complex societal problems that lie behind the rise in knife violence. She also says exclusions are not the root cause of the surge in knife crime. ""Children who carry knives almost invariably have complex problems that begin long before they are excluded,"" the watchdog says. In a report,Safeguarding children and young people in education from knife crime - lessons from London,external, Ofsted looks at how more than 100 schools, colleges, and pupil referral units (Prus) in the capital are protecting children from knife violence in school, as well as how they teach pupils to stay safe outside of school. The report, which follows a spate of fatal teenage stabbings, says knife crime needs to be tackled by various groups, including police, local authorities and policy makers. It also says serious violence on school grounds is ""extremely rare"". Excluded pupils 'sucked into knife crime' Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Ms Spielman says: ""Schools simply do not have the ability to counter the deep-seated societal problems behind the rise in knife crime. ""Some schools are valiantly trying to fund school-based early help services or other services that were once provided for free. ""But we cannot allow responsibility for this to be landed on schools in the absence of properly funded local services."" The Ofsted report says the common denominator among young people involved in knife violence is their vulnerability. ""Almost invariably, these children have experienced poverty, abuse or neglect or are living within troubled families,"" it says. ""They may also experience social exclusion due to factors such as their race or socio-economic background. ""School leaders also told us that those involved were also more likely to be low attainers academically compared with their peers."" Ms Spielman also says schools are worried about damaging their reputation if they talk about the issue of knife crime openly. ""Many school and college leaders we spoke to were trying to educate children about the dangers of knife crime and the risks of grooming and exploitation by gangs. ""However, some are concerned that if they do this they will be seen as a 'problem school', and subsequently avoided by parents."" The report says: schools have very different ways of dealing with knives and teaching children about the risks and head teachers need more guidance about what works schools have inconsistent approaches to involving the police and there is an overall lack of clarity on when this is necessary, meaning children at some schools are more likely to be criminalised for their actions more clarity is needed on ""managed moves"", when a child is moved from one school or Pru to another, and the Department for Education should collect data on these, as it does on exclusions. A spokesman for the government said: ""The issues surrounding knife crime, gang culture and bad behaviour at school are complicated. ""We should not draw a simple causal link from exclusions to crime - as Ofsted themselves argue. ""Any form of violence in a school is completely unacceptable and we have strengthened teachers' powers so they can take action, including searching pupils, if they suspect a pupil has brought a prohibited item - such as a knife - into school. ""No head teacher ever takes the decision to exclude a pupil lightly - but it is right that a school has the ability to permanently exclude when that last resort is needed."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the report highlighted the importance of early intervention. ""The government's policy of cuts has failed vulnerable children in particular and Ofsted have now said that this could be one of the factors driving the rise in knife crime,"" she said. ""Labour is committed to a public health approach to knife crime, which brings together schools and other public services along with increased police numbers to tackle knife crime from every angle."" Nickie Aiken, London Councils' executive member for schools and children's services, said: ""We need a complete rethink of how our Prus operate and work alongside our schools to support our young people. ""I'm concerned that secondary schools are increasingly sending difficult and damaged children to Prus. ""The whole offer needs to be changed. We should think of pupil referral units as places of respite where children go for short periods, always with the aspiration that they return to the normal school system."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT union, which represents school leaders,  said schools were part of the picture but ""certainly not the whole story"". ""The apparent rise in violent crime amongst young people is the result of deep-seated problems of poverty, inequality and social alienation as well as cuts to police, local authority and school budgets,"" he said.

"MPs to vote on May's Brexit dealBrexit-supporting MPs consider their response after the PM says she has secured ""legally binding"" changes from the EU.","This video can not be played PM Theresa May: ""This House risks no Brexit at all"" MPs are voting on Theresa May's Brexit deal after she made a final bid to convince them to back it. Battling a sore throat after late night talks with the EU, the prime minister urged MPs to vote for her ""improved deal"" or risk ""no Brexit at all"". But some leading Tory Brexiteers and the DUP, who keep her government in power, have rejected the deal. They say the legal assurances secured by the PM are not enough to prevent the UK being tied permanently to the EU. Reaction to May deal ahead of vote Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? The votes May needs for her Brexit deal Sir Bill Cash, a leading Brexiteer, said: ""In the light of our own legal analysis and others we do not recommend accepting the government's motion today."" Sir Bill was part of a panel of legally-trained Brexiteer MPs who examined the PM's revised deal, concluding that it did not deliver the binding changes MPs had demanded. Another Brexit-supporting Tory, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he had not yet decided which way to vote. Conservative MP Simon Clarke, leaving a meeting of Mr Rees-Mogg's European Research Group, said a ""majority"" of the group would vote against the deal. The DUP said in a statement that ""sufficient progress has not been achieved at this time"". Commons Speaker John Bercow did not select any of the amendments to the government motion that had been tabled by MPs. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn on PM's Brexit deal: ""Not one single word has changed"". With husband Philip watching from the public gallery, Mrs May made a final plea to MPs to ""come together"" and ""prove beyond all doubt that democracy comes before party, faction or personal ambition"". ""This is the moment and this is the time,"" she said. ""Back this motion and get the deal done, because only then can we get on with what we came here to do - what we were sent here to do. ""We cannot serve our country by overturning a democratic decision of the British people."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. MPs voted overwhelminglyto reject the PM's deal on 15 January by 432 votes to 202. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that ""after three months of running down the clock"" the prime minister had ""achieved not a single change to the withdrawal agreement"". He said it was the same ""bad deal"" MPs had rejected in January and Labour would be voting against it again because it ""risks people's living standards"", jobs and the NHS. As things stand the number of switchers seems far less than required to avoid another defeat for the prime minister. Last time out she was beaten by a record 230 votes. One cabinet minister guessed the number tonight might be around 150. Everyone is guessing still. But this looks like another dreadful day for Number 10, and another moment when doubts will be on display about not just the divorce deal with the EU, but about the prime minister's leadership too. Something has changed yes, but not enough. Read more from Laura here. Charles Walker, vice chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said defeat for the government in the vote later would lead to a general election. He told BBC Radio 4's World At One: ""If it doesn't go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks. ""It is not sustainable, the current situation in Parliament."" He added: ""She will lead us into that general election. We haven't got time for a leadership election."" Downing Street said: ""We are not preparing for and we do not want a general election."" This video can not be played Attorney General Geoffrey Cox: ""Let me make it clear. The legal risk... remains unchanged"" It comes after Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told MPs the legal risk of being tied to the EU after Brexit ""remains unchanged"". He added that the new assurances secured by the PM did ""reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained"" in the Irish backstop if talks on the two sides future relationship broke down due to ""bad faith"" by the EU. He defined ""bad faith"" as a ""pattern of refusing to accept reasonable proposals"" on the Irish backstop. But he said the question of whether a satisfactory post-Brexit deal on a permanent trading relationship can be reached remained ""a political judgment"" - and he said MPs should back the PM's deal. Inhis advice,external, Mr Cox said ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that if a post-Brexit trade agreement can not be reached due to ""intractable differences"", the UK would have ""no internationally lawful means"" of leaving the backstop without EU agreement. Ian Blackford accused the PM of 'laughing' during his speech Mrs May earlier addressed a meeting of Conservative MPs, in an effort to change the minds of those opposed to her deal. Conservative MPs leaving the meeting suggested half of those who voted against the deal last time will switch to support it later, said BBC's Chief Political Correspondent Vicky Young. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she believed the prime minister's deal would go through ""otherwise instability will follow which would be so unwelcome"". But Brexit-backing former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told MPs: ""I am afraid this deal has now reached the end of the road and if it is rejected tonight I hope that it will be put to bed."" He said the only option to preserve the UK's ""self-respect"" was to leave on 29 March, without Mrs May's agreement, and then negotiate a free trade deal. But the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that the idea of a ""transition period"" without the withdrawal agreement agreed with Mrs May was a ""dangerous illusion"" with no legal basis. Brexiteer Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns said the UK should leave the EU ""without a bad deal"", adding that the country needed to look ""beyond the borders of the EU"". This video can not be played Snap general election on the cards, says Conservative MP Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable told MPs Brexit will ""make this country poorer, weaker and less secure"" and called for people to have the final say in another referendum. And leading Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve warned ""we are about to do a serious and historic mistake"", describing Brexit as ""self-mutilation"". The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford urged the prime minister to ""extend Article 50 and bring forward another EU referendum"". He earned a rebuke from Speaker John Bercow for accusing Mrs May of ""sitting there laughing"" while he was ""talking about the rights that will be taken away from our young people"" by Brexit. Theresa May flew to the European Parliament with Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay on Monday for last-minute talks with Mr Juncker and EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. She returned with three documents: A ""joint legally binding instrument"",externalon the withdrawal agreement which the UK could use to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop indefinitely. A joint statement about the UK and EU's future relationship,externalwhich commits to replacing the backstop with an alternative by December 2020. A ""unilateral declaration"",externalstating there is nothing to stop the UK from leaving the backstop if discussions on a future relationship with the EU break down and there is no prospect of an agreement. Many MPs fear the backstop, initially agreed by the UK government in December 2017, would keep the country in a customs arrangement with the EU indefinitely. The PM has claimed the new documents addresses this issue and urged MPs to back the ""improved deal"". Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker gave a joint press conference after late night talks in Strasbourg The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 after voting to leave by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m - in 2016. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has warned MPs they would be putting everything at risk if they voted down the deal. ""In politics sometimes you get a second chance,"" he said. ""It is what we do with that second chance that counts. There will be no third chance."" The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the new agreements showed both sides' ""good faith"" - although he made clear they did ""not undermine"" the principle of the backstop or how it might come into force.

Laura Kuenssberg: Will May's changes satisfy Brexiteers?What's happening this week?Audio,"This video can not be played Theresa May: We have secured what MPs asked for Monday morning government blues have been replaced by Tuesday morning nervous hopes. The government does not suddenly expect its Brexit deal to be ushered through at speed, cheered on by well-wishers. It does, however, believe that Monday night's double act in Strasbourg by Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker puts it, to quote one cabinet minister, ""back in the races"". The extra assurances wrought from weeks of talkswith the EU will move some of the prime minister's objectors from the ""no"" column to the ""yes"". And for Mrs May to have achieved nothing from this process might have been terminal, and not just for her deal itself. But even her most enthusiastic supporters, such as they are these days, don't pretend the prime minister and the government are home and dry. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal Brexit A rump of Brexiteers will require public assurance from the attorney general, who's said to be agonising, that the update to the EU divorce deal has real meaning - and is not just a rickety set of steps to climb down. With the vote hours away, the PM begins one of the singularly most important days in her leadership so far with the same challenge that's plagued her every day - will her version of Brexit ever be sufficient for enough Brexiteers? Part of that answer lies not just in whether they believe in the substance of the assurances the prime minister and her team have bargained with Brussels, but also whether they believe the man who was sitting next to her on Monday - Mr Juncker - who warned MPs explicitly that there will be ""no third chance"". It's this deal, no deal, or indeed, no Brexit - almost (at last, her supporters might say), reading supportively from the PM's script. One senior cabinet minister said 10 days ago it was imperative that the EU made clear whatever was on offer was indeed its ""best and final offer"". Mrs May's critics will be asking themselves on Tuesday not just if what she has brokered changes enough, but whether that is, really, really now it?

What's happening this week?Audio,"On Tuesday, MPs will pass their verdict on Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to take Britain out of the European Union on 29 March. Here is what you need to know about the vote. At 7pm on Tuesday evening, after a full day of debate. They are passing judgement on the deal Theresa May spent two years negotiating with the European Union. Brexit: What could happen next? This is the big one. If MPs vote the deal down, one of two things is likely to happen. The UK will either leave the EU on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement - or that departure date will be delayed. If they back the deal, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March but things will stay broadly as they are until December 2020, while the two sides thrash out a permanent trade deal. Yes - andby a massive margin. Mrs May said she secured ""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit deal on Monday, a day ahead of MPs voting on it. She said the first change could be used to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop - the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - indefinitely. The second is a ""joint statement"" from the EU and the UK. It adds to the political declaration on the UK and EU's future relationship and commits to replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the government's chief law officer, haspublished updated legal advice,externalon the prime minister's deal, saying the new provisions secured by Mrs May ""reduce the risk"" of the UK being ""indefinitely and involuntarily"" held  in the backstop. But his advice adds that ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that the UK would have no legal means of exiting without EU agreement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If MPs vote down Mrs May's withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, then MPs have been promised a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal or not. This is likely to take place on Wednesday. If they back a no-deal Brexit in this vote, then the UK will leave without a deal on 29 March. If they reject a no-deal Brexit then they could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU. Not necessarily. If Mrs May loses the vote on Tuesday by a narrow margin, she could ask the EU for a short technical delay to allow everyone to regroup and make one last push to get it ""over the line"". Mrs May could make that final push at the next EU summit on 22 March, with another Commons vote to follow, assuming she can get a delay to Brexit. Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The first thing to stress is that it is not a trade deal. It is simply an agreement to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, minimising disruption to businesses and citizens of the UK and EU nations. Things would carry on pretty much as usual for at least 21 months after the official departure date of 29 March. During that time, the two sides would try to hammer out a permanent trading relationship - the overall aim of those talks is set out in the political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and EU, which MPs are also voting on. The withdrawal agreement also commits the UK to paying a Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would also retain their residency and social security rights. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The decision MPs make on Tuesday will shape the UK's economy and society for decades to come, influencing incomes, job prospects and much else besides. There may also be some more immediate consequences. Many fear a no-deal Brexit will cause chaos at ports, disruption to food and medical supplies and long-term economic damage, with big multinational companies moving out of the UK. Others say these fears are exaggerated and the UK will thrive when it has made a clean break from the EU. The ""Irish backstop"" clause. This is a bit of legal jargon that is meant to prevent the return of cameras and border guards along the 310 mile border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - the only land border between the EU and the UK. It would keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, avoiding the need for physical checks on vehicles passing through the border, which many fear could reignite the Northern Irish Troubles. It is only meant to kick in if the two sides have not agreed a trade deal by December 2020 - and it is meant to be temporary. But because there is no end date written into the agreement, and no way of quitting it without the EU's say-so, many MPs fear it will become permanent, effectively making a mockery of Brexit. These MPs want a time-limit on the backstop - something the EU has ruled out. The EU says the deal it struck with Mrs May is the best and only one available and it can't be rewritten. Mrs May used to say that too, until MPs rejected it in January. MPs are studying the additional legal assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop, agreed by Mrs May in 11th hour talks with EU officials, before deciding whether to vote for her deal or not. After months of questions about his position, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he could support a new referendum, while continuing to push for his preferred option of a general election or Labour's own version of Brexit. Many Labour MPs from areas that voted Leave in the 2016 referendum could vote against it, however, reducing its chances of success. The Labour leadership also appears to be warming to the idea of a Norway-style deal with the EU, which is backed by a group of Conservative and Labour MPs. This would see the UK remain in the EU single market, which its supporters say would protect jobs. If Mrs May's deal is defeated on Tuesday, there could be moves to get MPs to back ""Common Market 2.0"", as its supporters call this plan. Opponents say it would not end the free movement of people or allow the UK to strike its own trade deals around the world.

UK economic growth remains sluggish,"The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the three months to January, matching the growth of the previous three months. The report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a pick-up in activity in January when the economy expanded by 0.5%. The ONS said strength in IT, health services and wholesale trading offset falls in the manufacturing of metals and cars, and construction repair work. The increase in wholesale could indicate stockpiling ahead of Brexit. The total output of goods and services in the UK, or gross domestic product (GDP), grew by 0.2% in the three months to the end of January. The services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the private sector economy, grew by 0.5% on a rolling three-month basis, mainly driven by wholesale and retail trade. Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS said growth across the latest three months had ""remained weak"" with falls in the output of metal products, cars and construction repair work all dampening economic growth. However, he added that was offset by strong performances in wholesale, IT and health services. In January the economy staged a bit of a comeback, growing by 0.5% The services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the private sector economy, grew by 0.3% in January after a 0.2% fall in December. Construction, which accounts for about 6% of the economy, reversed December's fall to grow by 2.8% in January. Production and manufacturing output also both grew in January, having contracted in December. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG said the data confirmed growth momentum in the UK economy had ""stalled"". ""The first glimpse of GDP data for this year points to a UK economy hovering well below its growth potential, as we wait for the Brexit fog to dissipate. Ms Selfin said she expected growth to ""remain subdued in the short-term"". However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist with Capital Economics, said the numbers provided some reassurance that the UK economy is weathering a political crisis at home and a slowdown overseas ""pretty well"". ""Of course, the data may deteriorate in February and March if Brexit has caused consumers and firms to reach for the handbrake,"" he added. Clouds gathering over global economy UK economic growth slowest since 2012 Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""The service sector remains the main driver of UK growth on this rolling three-month measure, with industrial production and construction contracting. Despite a boost in January, the manufacturing sector remains an area of concern with significant cost pressures and moderating demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector. ""The lack of clarity on crucial aspects of how companies will operate after 29 March, as well as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, has led many firms having to take drastic action to safeguard their operations, which has resulted in unnecessary costs, diversion of resources and loss of business, subduing overall economic activity. It seems it depends on your point of view. Some experts think the increase in wholesale activity does signal that some businesses are building up stocks ahead of Brexit. KPMG's Ms Selfin said there was ""evidence that stockpiling in anticipation of Brexit has bolstered growth in some industries"". However, at Capital Economics Andrew Wishart said there was ""little evidence"" of stockbuilding, with output in the transport and storage sector falling in January and the three-month growth in imports easing off. The ONS was unable to comment on whether the growth was linked to UK manufacturers stockpiling. The uncomfortable truth is that the economy has lost speed. Growth of 0.2% across three months is a fraction of what the UK typically achieves. Brexit uncertainty appears to have hammered business investment, while growth in the Eurozone has fallen way short of expectations. Although the economy expanded by 0.5% in January alone, even the number crunchers who calculate these monthly estimates admit that they're volatile and need cautious treatment. And January's rebound was driven by manufacturing and construction. But surveys suggest recent industrial activity has been driven by speeding up production of finished goods ahead of Brexit rather than new orders; though the ONS numbers don't distinguish between these. And the rebound follows very weak months for manufacturing and construction - output across the last three months in both was flat. Total growth across the last three months was driven by services - in particular the wholesale retailing, again hinting at stockbuilding. The ""fog of Brexit"" may have actually inflated activity of late. Beyond that, growth is at best sluggish.

Bungled footballer murder probe reopenedFive men had their convictions overturned after a botched investigation into Kevin Nunes' 2002 murder.Birmingham & Black Country,"The killing of Kevin Nunes in 2002 remains unsolved after a string of police mistakes The 2002 murder of a footballer is to be re-investigated after a string of police errors led to five convictions being overturned. Kevin Nunes was 20 when he was killed in an apparent gangland shooting in Pattingham, Staffordshire. Five men jailed in 2008 had their murder convictions quashed after police failings in the case were uncovered. Staffordshire's Chief Constable Gareth Morgan apologised to Mr Nunes' family and said they had been ""let down"". This video can not be played Staffordshire Police's chief constable, Gareth Morgan, says the new investigation is 'the right thing to do' The re-investigation follows a review of the case by Merseyside Police which has made more than 60 recommendations. Announcing the new investigation, Mr Morgan said it was ""a significant moment"" for Mr Nunes' family. Mr Nunes' partner, Leanne Williams, was pregnant with their son when he was killed He said he acknowledged the ""serious police failings"" and apologised on behalf of the Staffordshire force. ""I am particularly sorry that the family of Kevin have not received justice for his death. I know they have been let down,"" he said. By Phil Mackie, BBC News Correspondent This is really welcome news for Kevin Nunes' partner, Leanne Williams, their 16-year-old son and the rest of the family. Even back in 2002 they thought there would be little chance of a successful prosecution because few people were willing to come forward with information. The case is believed to have involved drugs gangs. The family celebrated when five men were jailed in 2008, but were distraught when the convictions were quashed because of mistakes made during the original investigation. It has taken a lot to rebuild the relationship between the family and Staffordshire Police, but they are pleased there's new hope that Kevin's killers can be found and brought to justice. Despite police taking more than 1,000 statements about Mr Nunes' murder, only one witness, Simeon Taylor, was willing to give evidence. The five men who were put at the scene of Mr Nunes' murder by Taylor were jailed for life in 2008, but they were freed in 2012 when information about how police handled their informant came to light. Mr Nunes' body was found on a country lane in South Staffordshire in 2002 Taylor, who was in jail when he came forward, abused the police protection he was given, committing crimes and breaching a behaviour code of conduct 76 times without ever being charged for fear it would harm his role as key witness. The force was also found to have taken Taylor on nights out drinking and even sent him on a taxpayer funded trip to South Africa, believed to have cost up to Â£10,000.

"'No vaccine, no school' in ItalyItaly now requires children to prove they have been vaccinated before attending school.Europe","The new law demands 10 compulsory vaccinations - and has proved controversial Italian children have been told not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. The deadline follows months of national debate over compulsory vaccination. Parents risk being fined up to â¬500 (Â£425; $560) if they send their unvaccinated children to school. Children under six can be turned away. The new law came amid a surge in measles cases - but Italian officials say vaccination rates have improved since it was introduced. Under Italy's so-called Lorenzin law - named after the former health minister who introduced it - children must receive a range of mandatory immunisations before attending school. They include vaccinations for chickenpox, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella. Children up to the age of six years will be excluded from nursery and kindergarten without proof of vaccination under the new rules. Those aged between six and 16 cannot be banned from attending school, but their parents face fines if they do not complete the mandatory course of immunisations. The deadline for certification was due to be 10 March after a previous delay - but as it fell on a weekend, it was extended to Monday. ""Now everyone has had time to catch up,"" Health Minister Giulia Grillo told La Repubblica newspaper. Measles cases triple in Europe Vaccine deniers gaining ground YouTube takes ads off 'anti-vax' videos She had reportedly resisted political pressure from deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini to extend the deadline even further. Ms Grillo said the rules were now simple: ""No vaccine, no school"". Italian media report that regional authorities are handling the situation in a number of different ways. In Bologna, the local authority has sent letters of suspension to the parents of some 300 children, and a total of 5,000 children do not have their vaccine documentation up to date. In other areas there have been no reported cases, while still others have been given a grace period of a few days beyond the deadline. The new law was passed to raise Italy's plummeting vaccination rates from below 80% to the World Health Organisation's 95% target. On Monday - the last day for parents to provide documentation proving their children had been properly vaccinated - the Italian health authority released figures claiming a national immunisation rate at or very close to 95% for children born in 2015, depending on which vaccine was being discussed. The 95% threshold is the point at which ""herd immunity"" kicks in - when enough of the population is vaccinated for the spread of the disease to become unlikely, thereby protecting those who cannot be vaccinated. That includes babies too young to be vaccinated themselves, or those with medical conditions such as a compromised immune system. Last month, an eight-year-old recovering from cancer was unable to attend school in Rome due to his weak immune system. The child had spent months receiving treatment for leukaemia, but was at risk of infection because a proportion of pupils in the school had not been vaccinated - including several in the same class. Demonstrations against compulsory vaccination were held in Rome, 2017 The Lorenzin law, drafted by the previous government, had a tumultuous birth. When the current coalition came to power, it said it would drop mandatory immunisations although it later reversed its position. The two populist parties in power had faced accusations that they were pursuing anti-vaccination policies. Writing in a Facebook post on Monday, Ms Grillo admitted it ""is a law that, at the time of approval, we criticised for several reasons"" - and said that the law would be changed to include only those vaccinations that were necessary based on scientific data. The anti-vaccination movement has been growing globally in recent years, sparking alarm from the World Health Organization. A long-discredited paper by Andrew Wakefield was behind much of the scare, but rumours around immunisation have continued to spread, leading to public health risks as not enough people are immune to such diseases. Mr Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register after fraudulently claiming there was a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and autism and bowel disease in children. He made the claim based on the experiences of just 12 children, and no other study since has been able to replicate his results.

Apology for McGuinness award 'not enough',"An IRA bomb survivor has called on the mayor of San Francisco to rescind a posthumous award honouring Martin McGuinness's ""courageous service in the military"". Mary Hamilton said an apology from mayor London Breed has ""come too late"" for IRA victims. Mrs Hamilton was injured in the1972 Claudy bomb. Mr McGuinness has been awarded a Certificate of Honour, the equivalent to a ""freedom of the city"" award. Obituary: Martin McGuinness McGuinness' journey from IRA leader to meeting the Queen IRA victims criticised the honour, which also recognises the former IRA leader's role in the peace process. On Monday DUP leader Arlene Foster invited Ms Breed to Northern Ireland to see how ""terrorism still causes pain"". In a statement, the mayor explained that Mr McGuinness had been selected as one of five Grand Marshalls for the award. ""As part of San Francisco's annual St Patrick's Day festivities, the Mayor of San Francisco has traditionally provided Certificates of Honor to the Honorary Grand Marshalls selected by the United Irish Societies of San Francisco,"" she said. ""San Francisco values mean respect for the democratic process and non-violent political actions. ""The language on the Certificate of Honor should have taken more care to apply these values when reflecting the history of Mr McGuinness's life towards peacemaker and his role in the peace process that resulted in the Good Friday Agreement."" Ms Breed said she apologised for ""the pain this certificate has caused"". But Mrs Hamilton said the award to Mr McGuinness should be rescinded. Now an Ulster Unionist party councillor, the former deputy Mayor of Derry, whose brother-in-law George Hamilton was also shot and killed by the IRA in 1972, said she broke down when she heard about the award. Mrs Hamilton said she believed them Mayor of San Francisco, who signed off on the award, had been ill-informed. ""To me the mayor should have visited Northern Ireland to see the legacy that has been left behind,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She is among a number of IRA victims to criticise the award. The aftermath of the Claudy bombings in July 1972 Ann Travers said she was ""completely sickened"" by the honour. Her sister Mary was murdered by the IRA in Belfast in 1984. The target of the ambush was their father, Tom, a resident magistrate. He survived. ""There was nothing courageous about the IRA. As far as I am aware they were not a military organisation but a terrorist organisation. ""Martin McGuinness left behind as his legacy, people with a huge amount of hurt,"" she said. The Poppy Day bomb in Enniskillen in 1987 brought widespread condemnation Margaret Veitch, whose parents died in the IRA Enniskillen bombing, told theBelfast Telegraph,externalthe former deputy first minister, who died in 2017, had gone to his grave ""an unrepentant terrorist"". ""Terrorists are terrorists the world over, except in Northern Ireland where they are put into government and given awards,"" she said. She added: ""I don't know what's wrong with people that terrorists are now being honoured. Will San Francisco now be giving a posthumous honour to Osama bin Laden?"" Mrs Foster, the former first minister, has written to Andrew Whittaker, the British consul general in San Francisco, to pass on a letter to the mayor of San Francisco which details ""some of the IRA's activities"" and extends an invitation to visit Northern Ireland to ""find out first-hand from those who suffered from their terrorism."" In a statement, Mrs Foster said that Mr McGuinness ""undoubtedly played a very important role in the restoration of devolution"" in his later life but ""the earlier part of his life was one of violence"". Martin McGuiness served as Deputy First Minister with Arlene Foster as First Minister until he stood down in January 2017. She said Mr McGuinness was ""commander of the Provisional IRA Londonderry"" during car bomb attacks in Claudy and Coleraine as well as the murder of Patsy Gillespie who was ""used as human car bomb"". Mrs Foster said these attacks are ""likely to be unknown"" to the San Francisco mayor. Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie, a retired Army captain, also reacted angrily. He tweeted to the Democratic mayor of San Francisco: ""I fought shoulder to shoulder with your country after the 9/11 terrorist attack. Yet you honour terrorists who butchered men, women and children in mine. #ShameOnYou."" Mr McGuinness died at the age of 66 in 2017. He was second-in-command of the IRA in Derry at the time of Bloody Sunday. In 1997, he became MP for Mid Ulster, by which time he was  Sinn Fein's chief negotiator in the peace process. By 2007, he was Northern Ireland's deputy first minister standing alongside First Minister Ian Paisley. A Sinn FÃ©in spokesman said the San Francisco award was a ""welcome recognition of the life and legacy of Martin McGuinness"". ""Martin McGuinness made a colossal contribution to the peace process, Irish unity and reconciliation,"" the spokesman said.

"'No vaccine, no school' in ItalyItaly now requires children to prove they have been vaccinated before attending school.","The new law demands 10 compulsory vaccinations - and has proved controversial Italian children have been told not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. The deadline follows months of national debate over compulsory vaccination. Parents risk being fined up to â¬500 (Â£425; $560) if they send their unvaccinated children to school. Children under six can be turned away. The new law came amid a surge in measles cases - but Italian officials say vaccination rates have improved since it was introduced. Under Italy's so-called Lorenzin law - named after the former health minister who introduced it - children must receive a range of mandatory immunisations before attending school. They include vaccinations for chickenpox, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella. Children up to the age of six years will be excluded from nursery and kindergarten without proof of vaccination under the new rules. Those aged between six and 16 cannot be banned from attending school, but their parents face fines if they do not complete the mandatory course of immunisations. The deadline for certification was due to be 10 March after a previous delay - but as it fell on a weekend, it was extended to Monday. ""Now everyone has had time to catch up,"" Health Minister Giulia Grillo told La Repubblica newspaper. Measles cases triple in Europe Vaccine deniers gaining ground YouTube takes ads off 'anti-vax' videos She had reportedly resisted political pressure from deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini to extend the deadline even further. Ms Grillo said the rules were now simple: ""No vaccine, no school"". Italian media report that regional authorities are handling the situation in a number of different ways. In Bologna, the local authority has sent letters of suspension to the parents of some 300 children, and a total of 5,000 children do not have their vaccine documentation up to date. In other areas there have been no reported cases, while still others have been given a grace period of a few days beyond the deadline. The new law was passed to raise Italy's plummeting vaccination rates from below 80% to the World Health Organisation's 95% target. On Monday - the last day for parents to provide documentation proving their children had been properly vaccinated - the Italian health authority released figures claiming a national immunisation rate at or very close to 95% for children born in 2015, depending on which vaccine was being discussed. The 95% threshold is the point at which ""herd immunity"" kicks in - when enough of the population is vaccinated for the spread of the disease to become unlikely, thereby protecting those who cannot be vaccinated. That includes babies too young to be vaccinated themselves, or those with medical conditions such as a compromised immune system. Last month, an eight-year-old recovering from cancer was unable to attend school in Rome due to his weak immune system. The child had spent months receiving treatment for leukaemia, but was at risk of infection because a proportion of pupils in the school had not been vaccinated - including several in the same class. Demonstrations against compulsory vaccination were held in Rome, 2017 The Lorenzin law, drafted by the previous government, had a tumultuous birth. When the current coalition came to power, it said it would drop mandatory immunisations although it later reversed its position. The two populist parties in power had faced accusations that they were pursuing anti-vaccination policies. Writing in a Facebook post on Monday, Ms Grillo admitted it ""is a law that, at the time of approval, we criticised for several reasons"" - and said that the law would be changed to include only those vaccinations that were necessary based on scientific data. The anti-vaccination movement has been growing globally in recent years, sparking alarm from the World Health Organization. A long-discredited paper by Andrew Wakefield was behind much of the scare, but rumours around immunisation have continued to spread, leading to public health risks as not enough people are immune to such diseases. Mr Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register after fraudulently claiming there was a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and autism and bowel disease in children. He made the claim based on the experiences of just 12 children, and no other study since has been able to replicate his results.

Knife crime: 'Schools need more help',"Responsibility for rising knife crime cannot be ""landed on schools in the absence of properly funded local services,"" says the head of Ofsted. Amanda Spielman says schools in London are not well enough supported when it comes to dealing with knife crime. Ms Spielman says that schools do not have the ability to address the complex societal problems that lie behind the rise in knife violence. She also says exclusions are not the root cause of the surge in knife crime. ""Children who carry knives almost invariably have complex problems that begin long before they are excluded,"" the watchdog says. In a report,Safeguarding children and young people in education from knife crime - lessons from London,external, Ofsted looks at how more than 100 schools, colleges, and pupil referral units (Prus) in the capital are protecting children from knife violence in school, as well as how they teach pupils to stay safe outside of school. The report, which follows a spate of fatal teenage stabbings, says knife crime needs to be tackled by various groups, including police, local authorities and policy makers. It also says serious violence on school grounds is ""extremely rare"". Excluded pupils 'sucked into knife crime' Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Ms Spielman says: ""Schools simply do not have the ability to counter the deep-seated societal problems behind the rise in knife crime. ""Some schools are valiantly trying to fund school-based early help services or other services that were once provided for free. ""But we cannot allow responsibility for this to be landed on schools in the absence of properly funded local services."" The Ofsted report says the common denominator among young people involved in knife violence is their vulnerability. ""Almost invariably, these children have experienced poverty, abuse or neglect or are living within troubled families,"" it says. ""They may also experience social exclusion due to factors such as their race or socio-economic background. ""School leaders also told us that those involved were also more likely to be low attainers academically compared with their peers."" Ms Spielman also says schools are worried about damaging their reputation if they talk about the issue of knife crime openly. ""Many school and college leaders we spoke to were trying to educate children about the dangers of knife crime and the risks of grooming and exploitation by gangs. ""However, some are concerned that if they do this they will be seen as a 'problem school', and subsequently avoided by parents."" The report says: schools have very different ways of dealing with knives and teaching children about the risks and head teachers need more guidance about what works schools have inconsistent approaches to involving the police and there is an overall lack of clarity on when this is necessary, meaning children at some schools are more likely to be criminalised for their actions more clarity is needed on ""managed moves"", when a child is moved from one school or Pru to another, and the Department for Education should collect data on these, as it does on exclusions. A spokesman for the government said: ""The issues surrounding knife crime, gang culture and bad behaviour at school are complicated. ""We should not draw a simple causal link from exclusions to crime - as Ofsted themselves argue. ""Any form of violence in a school is completely unacceptable and we have strengthened teachers' powers so they can take action, including searching pupils, if they suspect a pupil has brought a prohibited item - such as a knife - into school. ""No head teacher ever takes the decision to exclude a pupil lightly - but it is right that a school has the ability to permanently exclude when that last resort is needed."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the report highlighted the importance of early intervention. ""The government's policy of cuts has failed vulnerable children in particular and Ofsted have now said that this could be one of the factors driving the rise in knife crime,"" she said. ""Labour is committed to a public health approach to knife crime, which brings together schools and other public services along with increased police numbers to tackle knife crime from every angle."" Nickie Aiken, London Councils' executive member for schools and children's services, said: ""We need a complete rethink of how our Prus operate and work alongside our schools to support our young people. ""I'm concerned that secondary schools are increasingly sending difficult and damaged children to Prus. ""The whole offer needs to be changed. We should think of pupil referral units as places of respite where children go for short periods, always with the aspiration that they return to the normal school system."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT union, which represents school leaders,  said schools were part of the picture but ""certainly not the whole story"".

Third of under-30s snub smear tests,"This video can not be played Chloe Delevingne had a smear test live on the Victoria Derbyshire programme A third of women aged under 30 are snubbing invites to be tested for cervical cancer, health officials in Wales have warned. That is despite the disease being the most common cancer for younger women. Cervical Screening Wales said across all age groups, there were about 160 cases of the disease every year. But for those who have not been screened - the disease is caught at a much later stage, which often means poorer outcomes for patients. It has prompted the screening service to launch a new social media campaign on Tuesday under the title '#loveyourcervix'. All women in Wales are invited for smear tests from the age of 25 ""We know that women aged between 25 and 29 are the least likely age group to have their smear,"" explained Louise Dunk, who heads the screening programme in Wales. ""The reasons behind this are complex, but issues around embarrassment and body shame are commonly cited. ""We are calling for women to be more body-positive and love every part of themselves - even those parts they can't see like their cervix. ""And the best way to take care of their cervix is to attend for regular cervical screening."" HPV: 'Not rude or shameful' Actress vlogs on cancer screening fear Why are BAME girls less likely to get HPV jab? All woman in Wales from the age of 25 to 49 are invited to take part in the screening programme every three years, with those between 50 and 64 tested every five years. More than 99% of cervical cancers are caused by high-risk strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV). This video can not be played Cervical screening: 'It's free and less painful than a bikini wax Maria Dullaghan was 25 when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2010. She needed a full hysterectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy before being given the all clear in 2011. Miss Dullaghan had her first smear test at 21 and three years later a letter arrived telling her the next one was due. ""I put it in the drawer and forgot about it,"" said the 34-year-old from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire. ""Then in the summer of 2010 I had some cramping and bleeding. It took a few weeks for it to all hit me. ""I really wish I had that test done as soon as that letter came through. ""Go have it done, it's free and less painful than a bikini wax. It's five minutes every three years and can save your life."" A cervical cancer charity said it was ""highly concerning"" to see smear test attendance falling every year. ""We're supporting Cervical Screening Wales in their campaign to try and tackle the decline and ultimately reduce the number of cancer diagnoses and deaths among women in the country,"" said Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust. In September 2018, Wales became the first UK nation to fully adopt high-risk HPV testing as the first test done on every cervical screening sample, in a bid to identify at-risk individuals. Smear samples in Wales are now tested for high-risk strains of HPV - which is responsible for most cervical cancers The HPV tests are carried out, even though there has been a vaccination programme for all secondary school-aged girls has been in place since 2008. ""However, some cervical cancers are caused by types of HPV that the vaccine doesn't cover,"" said Dr Ardiana Gjini, from Public Health Wales. ""Therefore, it is still important for women who have received the HPV vaccine to attend for their cervical smear tests when they are invited."" Ms Dunk added: ""Cervical screening saves lives. It's as simple as that. ""By not making an appointment you are missing the chance of preventing cervical cancer from developing, or picking it up at an early stage when it is more treatable.""

UK economic growth remains sluggishThe economy expanded by 0.5% in January but three monthly growth remained weak.Business,"The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the three months to January, matching the growth of the previous three months. The report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a pick-up in activity in January when the economy expanded by 0.5%. The ONS said strength in IT, health services and wholesale trading offset falls in the manufacturing of metals and cars, and construction repair work. The increase in wholesale could indicate stockpiling ahead of Brexit. The total output of goods and services in the UK, or gross domestic product (GDP), grew by 0.2% in the three months to the end of January. The services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the private sector economy, grew by 0.5% on a rolling three-month basis, mainly driven by wholesale and retail trade. Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS said growth across the latest three months had ""remained weak"" with falls in the output of metal products, cars and construction repair work all dampening economic growth. However, he added that was offset by strong performances in wholesale, IT and health services. In January the economy staged a bit of a comeback, growing by 0.5% The services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the private sector economy, grew by 0.3% in January after a 0.2% fall in December. Construction, which accounts for about 6% of the economy, reversed December's fall to grow by 2.8% in January. Production and manufacturing output also both grew in January, having contracted in December. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG said the data confirmed growth momentum in the UK economy had ""stalled"". ""The first glimpse of GDP data for this year points to a UK economy hovering well below its growth potential, as we wait for the Brexit fog to dissipate. Ms Selfin said she expected growth to ""remain subdued in the short-term"". However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist with Capital Economics, said the numbers provided some reassurance that the UK economy is weathering a political crisis at home and a slowdown overseas ""pretty well"". ""Of course, the data may deteriorate in February and March if Brexit has caused consumers and firms to reach for the handbrake,"" he added. Clouds gathering over global economy UK economic growth slowest since 2012 Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""The service sector remains the main driver of UK growth on this rolling three-month measure, with industrial production and construction contracting. Despite a boost in January, the manufacturing sector remains an area of concern with significant cost pressures and moderating demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector. ""The lack of clarity on crucial aspects of how companies will operate after 29 March, as well as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, has led many firms having to take drastic action to safeguard their operations, which has resulted in unnecessary costs, diversion of resources and loss of business, subduing overall economic activity. It seems it depends on your point of view. Some experts think the increase in wholesale activity does signal that some businesses are building up stocks ahead of Brexit. KPMG's Ms Selfin said there was ""evidence that stockpiling in anticipation of Brexit has bolstered growth in some industries"". However, at Capital Economics Andrew Wishart said there was ""little evidence"" of stockbuilding, with output in the transport and storage sector falling in January and the three-month growth in imports easing off. The ONS was unable to comment on whether the growth was linked to UK manufacturers stockpiling. The uncomfortable truth is that the economy has lost speed. Growth of 0.2% across three months is a fraction of what the UK typically achieves. Brexit uncertainty appears to have hammered business investment, while growth in the Eurozone has fallen way short of expectations. Although the economy expanded by 0.5% in January alone, even the number crunchers who calculate these monthly estimates admit that they're volatile and need cautious treatment. And January's rebound was driven by manufacturing and construction. But surveys suggest recent industrial activity has been driven by speeding up production of finished goods ahead of Brexit rather than new orders; though the ONS numbers don't distinguish between these. And the rebound follows very weak months for manufacturing and construction - output across the last three months in both was flat. Total growth across the last three months was driven by services - in particular the wholesale retailing, again hinting at stockbuilding. The ""fog of Brexit"" may have actually inflated activity of late. Beyond that, growth is at best sluggish.

"Third of under-30s snub smear testsDespite being the most common cancer in younger women, the uptake for cervical screening is falling.Wales","This video can not be played Chloe Delevingne had a smear test live on the Victoria Derbyshire programme A third of women aged under 30 are snubbing invites to be tested for cervical cancer, health officials in Wales have warned. That is despite the disease being the most common cancer for younger women. Cervical Screening Wales said across all age groups, there were about 160 cases of the disease every year. But for those who have not been screened - the disease is caught at a much later stage, which often means poorer outcomes for patients. It has prompted the screening service to launch a new social media campaign on Tuesday under the title '#loveyourcervix'. All women in Wales are invited for smear tests from the age of 25 ""We know that women aged between 25 and 29 are the least likely age group to have their smear,"" explained Louise Dunk, who heads the screening programme in Wales. ""The reasons behind this are complex, but issues around embarrassment and body shame are commonly cited. ""We are calling for women to be more body-positive and love every part of themselves - even those parts they can't see like their cervix. ""And the best way to take care of their cervix is to attend for regular cervical screening."" HPV: 'Not rude or shameful' Actress vlogs on cancer screening fear Why are BAME girls less likely to get HPV jab? All woman in Wales from the age of 25 to 49 are invited to take part in the screening programme every three years, with those between 50 and 64 tested every five years. More than 99% of cervical cancers are caused by high-risk strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV). This video can not be played Cervical screening: 'It's free and less painful than a bikini wax Maria Dullaghan was 25 when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2010. She needed a full hysterectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy before being given the all clear in 2011. Miss Dullaghan had her first smear test at 21 and three years later a letter arrived telling her the next one was due. ""I put it in the drawer and forgot about it,"" said the 34-year-old from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire. ""Then in the summer of 2010 I had some cramping and bleeding. It took a few weeks for it to all hit me. ""I really wish I had that test done as soon as that letter came through. ""Go have it done, it's free and less painful than a bikini wax. It's five minutes every three years and can save your life."" A cervical cancer charity said it was ""highly concerning"" to see smear test attendance falling every year. ""We're supporting Cervical Screening Wales in their campaign to try and tackle the decline and ultimately reduce the number of cancer diagnoses and deaths among women in the country,"" said Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust. In September 2018, Wales became the first UK nation to fully adopt high-risk HPV testing as the first test done on every cervical screening sample, in a bid to identify at-risk individuals. Smear samples in Wales are now tested for high-risk strains of HPV - which is responsible for most cervical cancers The HPV tests are carried out, even though there has been a vaccination programme for all secondary school-aged girls has been in place since 2008. ""However, some cervical cancers are caused by types of HPV that the vaccine doesn't cover,"" said Dr Ardiana Gjini, from Public Health Wales. ""Therefore, it is still important for women who have received the HPV vaccine to attend for their cervical smear tests when they are invited."" Ms Dunk added: ""Cervical screening saves lives. It's as simple as that. ""By not making an appointment you are missing the chance of preventing cervical cancer from developing, or picking it up at an early stage when it is more treatable.""

Hawking inspires new 'black hole' 50p coin,"Prof Stephen Hawking died last March after decades as one of Britain's most recognisable scientists Prof Stephen Hawking has been honoured on a new 50p coin inspired by his pioneering work on black holes. The physicistdied last yearat the age of 76, having become one of the most renowned leaders in his field. He joins an elite group of scientists to have appeared on coins, including Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. Designer Edwina Ellis said: ""I wanted to fit a big black hole on the tiny coin and wish he was still here chortling at the thought."" Designer Edwina Ellis wanted to fit a black hole on to the coin She said she wanted to reflect the way he ""made difficult subjects accessible, engaging and relatable"", in particular on black holes. Prof Hawking's daughter Lucy visited the Royal Mint with her brother Tim to see the coins. She said: ""It is a great privilege to be featured on a coin and I hope my father would be pleased to be alongside Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin as scientists who have made it on to money."" Prof Hawking explained black holes in his best-selling book A Brief History Of Time. He once told the BBC he thought his discovery that black holes were not entirely black would be his ""greatest achievement"". Amputee Marine breaks Atlantic row record Sinkhole-prone city gets 3D map Oliver! chair found by Antiques Roadshow Stephen Hawking explained black holes in his best-seller A Brief History of Time At the age of 22 Prof Hawking was given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. The illness left him in a wheelchair and largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser, but he rose to serve as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University for 30 years. After his death on 14 March 2018,crowds lined the streetsto bid farewell. People can buy the commemorative coins from the Royal Mint's website, with prices starting at Â£10 for a brilliant uncirculated version, climbing to Â£795 for a gold proof coin.

Knife crime: 'Schools need more support',"Responsibility for rising knife crime cannot be ""landed on schools in the absence of properly funded local services,"" says the head of Ofsted. Amanda Spielman says schools in London are not well enough supported when it comes to dealing with knife crime. Ms Spielman says that schools do not have the ability to address the complex societal problems that lie behind the rise in knife violence. She also says exclusions are not the root cause of the surge in knife crime. ""Children who carry knives almost invariably have complex problems that begin long before they are excluded,"" the watchdog says. In a report,Safeguarding children and young people in education from knife crime - lessons from London,external, Ofsted looks at how more than 100 schools, colleges, and pupil referral units (Prus) in the capital are protecting children from knife violence in school, as well as how they teach pupils to stay safe outside of school. The report, which follows a spate of fatal teenage stabbings, says knife crime needs to be tackled by various groups, including police, local authorities and policy makers. It also says serious violence on school grounds is ""extremely rare"". Excluded pupils 'sucked into knife crime' Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Ms Spielman says: ""Schools simply do not have the ability to counter the deep-seated societal problems behind the rise in knife crime. ""Some schools are valiantly trying to fund school-based early help services or other services that were once provided for free. ""But we cannot allow responsibility for this to be landed on schools in the absence of properly funded local services."" The Ofsted report says the common denominator among young people involved in knife violence is their vulnerability. ""Almost invariably, these children have experienced poverty, abuse or neglect or are living within troubled families,"" it says. ""They may also experience social exclusion due to factors such as their race or socio-economic background. ""School leaders also told us that those involved were also more likely to be low attainers academically compared with their peers."" Ms Spielman also says schools are worried about damaging their reputation if they talk about the issue of knife crime openly. ""Many school and college leaders we spoke to were trying to educate children about the dangers of knife crime and the risks of grooming and exploitation by gangs. ""However, some are concerned that if they do this they will be seen as a 'problem school', and subsequently avoided by parents."" The report says: schools have very different ways of dealing with knives and teaching children about the risks and head teachers need more guidance about what works schools have inconsistent approaches to involving the police and there is an overall lack of clarity on when this is necessary, meaning children at some schools are more likely to be criminalised for their actions more clarity is needed on ""managed moves"", when a child is moved from one school or Pru to another, and the Department for Education should collect data on these, as it does on exclusions. A spokesman for the government said: ""The issues surrounding knife crime, gang culture and bad behaviour at school are complicated. ""We should not draw a simple causal link from exclusions to crime - as Ofsted themselves argue. ""Any form of violence in a school is completely unacceptable and we have strengthened teachers' powers so they can take action, including searching pupils, if they suspect a pupil has brought a prohibited item - such as a knife - into school. ""No head teacher ever takes the decision to exclude a pupil lightly - but it is right that a school has the ability to permanently exclude when that last resort is needed."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the report highlighted the importance of early intervention. ""The government's policy of cuts has failed vulnerable children in particular and Ofsted have now said that this could be one of the factors driving the rise in knife crime,"" she said. ""Labour is committed to a public health approach to knife crime, which brings together schools and other public services along with increased police numbers to tackle knife crime from every angle."" Nickie Aiken, London Councils' executive member for schools and children's services, said: ""We need a complete rethink of how our Prus operate and work alongside our schools to support our young people. ""I'm concerned that secondary schools are increasingly sending difficult and damaged children to Prus. ""The whole offer needs to be changed. We should think of pupil referral units as places of respite where children go for short periods, always with the aspiration that they return to the normal school system."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT union, which represents school leaders,  said schools were part of the picture but ""certainly not the whole story"". ""The apparent rise in violent crime amongst young people is the result of deep-seated problems of poverty, inequality and social alienation as well as cuts to police, local authority and school budgets,"" he said.

Solo rower's lost boat found in Norway,"Duncan Hutchison's boat was found in SÃ¸mna, Norway A hand-built wooden rowing boat has been found in Norway six months after it was abandoned off Land's End during an attempted Transatlantic crossing. Duncan Hutchison, from Lochinver, spent three years constructing the craft before attempting to row it from New York to his home in the west Highlands. He wasrescued in Septemberafter rowing more than half of his 3,000-mile (4,828 km) adventure. The boat was found in SÃ¸mna, a municipality north of Trondheim. The country has a link to the craft's name, Sleipnir, which is the name of an eight-legged horse from Norse mythology that could glide across the sea. It was spotted floating close to shore at the weekend and was hauled ashore. Mr Hutchison said he never had any doubts about Sleipnir's chances of survival in rough seas The Norwegians who found it were able to track down Mr Hutchison from the boat's registration number and personal items he was forced to leave behind. Among Mr Hutchison's belongings still inside the boat was a ball with a red hand print on it in the style of Wilson, a prop in the Tom Hanks film Cast Away. Mr Hutchison, who was rescued by a New York-bound tanker in bad weather, rough seas and after his power supply failed after 100 days at sea, is now making arrangements to have Sleipnir taken to Scotland. He said he was not surprised the boat survived after he was forced to abandon it. Mr Hutchison said: ""I never had any qualms about the Sleipner's survival at sea, even in the worst conditions. ""My only concern was that once it came ashore it might be smashed up against rocks. Thankfully the people who found it were able to take it ashore."" Duncan Hutchison and a feathered friend during his Atlantic challenge Mr Hutchison started the crossing in May Mr Hutchison's Cast Away-style Wilson was still inside Sleipner when it was found in Norway He added: ""I thought it might end up in Norway because of the Gulf Stream."" Mr Hutchison's has raised thousands of pounds for the charity Wateraid from his venture. He had been rescued earlier in his attempted crossing when he got into difficulty in stormy weather off New Jersey in the US. His boat with all his belongings was even lost for a time, before washing up on a beach, allowing him to resume his attempt.

Singapore bars Boeing 737 Max planes,"SilkAir's six Max 8 aircraft will remain grounded for now Singapore's Civil Aviation Authority has temporarily suspended the Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft from flying into and out of the country. The decision comes afteran Ethiopian Airlines Boeing Max 8 crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people on board. It was the second fatal accident involving that model in less than five months. Singapore's Changi Airport is the world's sixth busiest and a major hub connecting Asia to Europe and the US. But only a handful of airlines operate Max aircraft in and out of the country. Several airlines and regulators around the world have already grounded the Max 8 model following the crash. Singapore is believed to be the first country to ban all variants of the Max fleet of aircraft. The suspension went into effect from 14:00 local time (06:00 GMT). Which airlines use the Boeing 737 Max 8? If you are affected by this story emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Singapore's aviation authority said the affected airlines include SilkAir, which operates six Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, as well as China Southern Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Shandong Airlines and Thai Lion Air. It said it is working with airlines and Changi Airport to minimise the impact on passengers. Experts told the BBC that disruption was likely, however. Aviation consultant Ian Thomas said: ""This is sure to lead to significant flight cancellations and disruption to schedules as the airlines involved switch to other aircraft types (assuming they are available)."" The BBC's Karishma Vaswani, who is at Changi Airport, reports orderly scenes. Some flights have been cancelled but it is not known if the suspension is to blame. In the US, the country's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told airlines on Monday it believes Boeing's 737 Max 8 model to be airworthy, despite the two fatal crashes. This video can not be played The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza, at the scene, said there was a huge crater at the site of the crash The Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft are the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating. The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion.It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"",externalon 4 February, the airline said. SilkAir's six Max 8 aircraft will remain grounded for now Followinglast October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. US aviation officials have said the 737 Max 8 is airworthy and that it is too early to reach any conclusions or take any action. US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Monday said the FAA would ""take immediate and appropriate action"" if a defect was found in the Max 8. Boeing has confirmed that for the past few months it has been developing a ""flight control software enhancement"" for the aircraft. The delay that saved a man's life More about Boeing 737 Max 8 Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org and a member of the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee, nonetheless called for the plane to be grounded. ""The FAA's 'wait and see' attitude risks lives as well as the safety reputation of the US aviation industry,"" Mr Hudson said in a statement on Monday. There were people of more than 30 nationalities on the 10 March flight, including 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and nine Britons (two of whom were dual nationals travelling on non-British passports). Among the Canadians was a family of six, originally from India. Kosha Vaidya, 37, and her husband Prerit Dixit, 45 were taking their 14-year-old daughter Ashka and 13-year-old daughter Anushka to Nairobi - where Kosha was born - along with her parents, Pannagesh Vaidya, 73, and Hansini Vaidya, 67. There were also eight Italians, eight Chinese, eight Americans, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Germans, four Indians and four people from Slovakia on board.

Children's fatal fire 'most tragic case',"This video can not be played Horse-drawn procession for four children killed in fire The funeral has begun for four children who were killed in a house fire in Staffordshire. Riley Holt, eight, Keegan Unitt, six, Tilly Rose Unitt, four, and Olly Unitt, three, all died in Stafford on 5 February. The private funeral service was preceded by a procession though the Highfields estate where they lived. Police said a memorial service was being planned for a future date where the community would be welcomed. Although the funeral at Stafford Crematorium was for relatives and close friends only, the family suggested neighbours could show support by putting teddy bears or toys in their windows. (L-R) Keegan, Tilly Rose, Olly and Riley died in the blaze in the early hours of 5 February Soft toys were seen in windows in memory of the children Latest news from the West Midlands Mourners expressed their sadness and shock at the loss of such young lives. Steve, who did not want to give his last name, said his children had known some of the youngsters. He said: ""It's a horrendous situation... in general the public outcry has been the hardest thing to explain to the kids because they don't really understand."" Another man from Highfields, who did not give his name, said: ""I've come to pay my respects to the children. ""It's very, very sad. A tragedy. When we've found out what caused it, it'll be a relief to everyone."" BBC Radio Stoke reporter Jennie Aitken The wind and the rain did not stop the people of Highfields turning up to pay their respects to the children. The procession itself included a police escort with an empty hearse leading the way followed by two black horse-drawn carriages, each horse draped in purple. The first carriage was for Riley and Tilly Rose, their names in cream-coloured flowers on top of the glass carriage carrying their small white coffins. The second carriage was for Olly and Keegan, also with white coffins, and a number of limousines and plenty of cars followed. It takes your breath away seeing a procession like that, seeing those coffins so small, lives taken so, so soon. The blaze was the ""most tragic"" case that chief fire officer Becci Bryant has faced in 28 years' service. ""The magnitude of losing four children under the age of 10 is extraordinary,"" the Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service chief said. ""I am not afraid to say that before I drove home I needed to stop and have a cry about what I had seen and what the impact had been on the crews right then and there. ""I hope I never, and none of my staff ever, have to go through something like that again."" Chief Fire Officer Becci Bryant said the blaze was the most ""tragic"" she has seen How the children died remains""yet to be ascertained""butStaffordshire Police has ruled out an exploding boiler and cannabis growth as the cause of the fire. Ms Bryant said the fire service was continuing to support the police investigation. A 24-year-old woman and a man, 28, who were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligencehave been released while inquiries continue.

Life in jail for Jewish Museum murdererMehdi Nemmouche gunned down four people in Brussels after returning from fighting for IS in Syria.Europe,"Nemmouche (R) has not allowed himself to be photographed in the years since his arrest A Frenchman has been given a life sentence for killing four people in an anti-Semitic attack in Brussels in May 2014. Mehdi Nemmouche, 33, opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a handgun at the city's Jewish Museum. Three people died at the scene and one later in hospital. Nemmouche spent a year fighting in Syria for the Islamic State (IS) group before returning to Europe to carry out the attack. A man who helped plan the attack and supply weapons, Nacer Bendrer, was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Nemmouche and Bendrer were found guilty last weekafter a two-month-long trial involved apparent witness intimidation and testimony from former captives of IS in Syria. Bendrer, who is also French, told the court: ""I am ashamed to have crossed paths with this guy [Nemmouche]. He is not a man, he is a monster."" When asked to speak, Nemmouche reportedly said with a smirk: ""Life goes on."" Why known extremists can carry out terror attacks Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Nemmouche's lawyers tried to suggest that he had been framed in an elaborate conspiracy which blamed the murders on foreign intelligence agencies. But they produced no evidence to support the claim. Two Israeli tourists, a volunteer worker and a receptionist were killed in the attack on the museum. Who is Mehdi Nemmouche? He is believed by Belgian prosecutors to be the first European jihadist to return from war-torn Syria to carry out terror attacks in Europe. He was born into a family of Algerian origin in the northern French town of Roubaix. He was previously known to French authorities, having served five years in prison for robbery. He is said to have met Bendrer while in prison. Both have been described as ""radicalised"" prisoners. This file photo of Nemmouche was released in 2014 - and he has not been photographed at trial Nemmouche travelled to Syria in 2013 and stayed for one year, during which time he is believed to have fought for a jihadist group in the country's civil war. Investigators say that while there, he metNajim Laachraoui, who was a suicide bomber in the Brussels airport attack of March 2016, which killed 32 people. Four French journalists held hostage in Syria saythey were guarded by both Laachraoui and Nemmouche during their captivity. Nemmouche was extradited to Belgium to face charges connected to the museum shooting, but may also face trial in France over the allegations he was involved in holding the French hostages. Security was tight, matching that of the trial of jailed jihadist Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving member of the 2015 Paris attackers. Days after the trial began, a lawyer representing a witness reported his laptop and some paperwork on the case had been stolen from his office. A baseball bat and replica gun were left in their placeâ something prosecutors viewed as a threat. In the dock the next day, Nemmouche denounced the attempt at intimidation - and the witness, 81-year-old Chilean artist Clara Billeke Villalobos, went on to testify anyway. Firearms used in the attack were displayed in court as evidence Next came the orphaned daughters of Miriam and Emmanuel Riva, the Israeli tourists killed. Ayalet, 19, and Shira, 21, described a mother ""devoted to her family"" and an unassuming father who ""loved to travel"". Three weeks into proceedings, jurors were shown video of Nemmouche in custody after his arrest. Belgian newspaper Le Soir described it as showing an ""arrogant"" Nemmouche in front of police with a ""disdainful smile"", arms folded. Two of the French journalists held for nearly a year in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo appeared in court, pointing to Nemmouche as their captor. Nicolas Henin told the court Nemmouche was ""sadistic, playful and narcissistic"", while Didier Francois said he had beaten him dozens of times with a truncheon. Summing up, prosecutor Bernard Michel told the court Nemmouche was ""not simply radicalised but ultra-radicalised"". ""If attacking a museum with a combat weapon is not violent and savage then nothing will ever be violent and savage,"" he said. ""For the killer, for Mehdi Nemmouche, the identity of the victims mattered little,"" he added. ""The aim was simply that there should be victims. Everything was premeditated."" The closing argument from the defence was described by some as ""mind-boggling"", as it wove a web of conspiracy involving foreign intelligence agencies and assassination. Sebastien Courtoy, Nemmouche's lawyer, suggested that his client was recruited in Lebanon in January 2013 by Iranian or Lebanese intelligence to join the ranks of IS. But this claim went unsubstantiated. According to Mr Courtoy, the Jewish Museum murders were not an IS attack, but a ""targeted execution of Mossad agents"" - a reference to the Israeli intelligence agency, which he claimed the Israeli couple belonged to. The killing was carried out by an unknown person, he said. Nemmouche's lawyer Sebastien Courtoy laid out an alleged spy plot Yet judges investigating the museum attack last month told the court there was no evidence to support any link to Mossad.

Life in jail for Jewish Museum murderer,"Nemmouche (R) has not allowed himself to be photographed in the years since his arrest A Frenchman has been given a life sentence for killing four people in an anti-Semitic attack in Brussels in May 2014. Mehdi Nemmouche, 33, opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a handgun at the city's Jewish Museum. Three people died at the scene and one later in hospital. Nemmouche spent a year fighting in Syria for the Islamic State (IS) group before returning to Europe to carry out the attack. A man who helped plan the attack and supply weapons, Nacer Bendrer, was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Nemmouche and Bendrer were found guilty last weekafter a two-month-long trial involved apparent witness intimidation and testimony from former captives of IS in Syria. Bendrer, who is also French, told the court: ""I am ashamed to have crossed paths with this guy [Nemmouche]. He is not a man, he is a monster."" When asked to speak, Nemmouche reportedly said with a smirk: ""Life goes on."" Why known extremists can carry out terror attacks Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Nemmouche's lawyers tried to suggest that he had been framed in an elaborate conspiracy which blamed the murders on foreign intelligence agencies. But they produced no evidence to support the claim. Two Israeli tourists, a volunteer worker and a receptionist were killed in the attack on the museum. Who is Mehdi Nemmouche? He is believed by Belgian prosecutors to be the first European jihadist to return from war-torn Syria to carry out terror attacks in Europe. He was born into a family of Algerian origin in the northern French town of Roubaix. He was previously known to French authorities, having served five years in prison for robbery. He is said to have met Bendrer while in prison. Both have been described as ""radicalised"" prisoners. This file photo of Nemmouche was released in 2014 - and he has not been photographed at trial Nemmouche travelled to Syria in 2013 and stayed for one year, during which time he is believed to have fought for a jihadist group in the country's civil war.

US 'warns Germany to drop Huawei',"The US has told Germany it would curb intelligence sharing with Berlin if it allows Huawei to participate in its 5G mobile network. The warning came in a recent letter from the US ambassador to Germany seen by the Wall Street Journal. The US has been lobbying its allies to boycott Huawei due to national security risks. The firm has pushed back against claims it poses a security threat includingsuing the US government. US ambassador Richard Grenell said the US would not be able to keep the same level of co-operation with German security agencies if Germany allowed Huawei or other Chinese firms to participate in its next-generation 5G mobile network, the Wall Street Journal reported. The US cannot crush us, says Huawei boss Should we worry about Huawei? Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? In the letter to Germany's economics minister dated last Friday, Mr Grenell said secure communications systems are essential for defence and intelligence co-operation, and that firms like Huawei could compromise this. The warning marks an escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to convince allies to boycott the Chinese tech giant. The US, Australia and New Zealand have all blocked local firms from using Huawei to provide the technology for their 5G networks. Huawei has launched a more aggressive strategy in recent months to counter what it sees as an American ""smear"" campaign. Last week, itfiled a lawsuit against the US governmentover a ban that restricts federal agencies from using its products, arguing it is ""unconstitutional."" Huawei has also taken out ads in the foreign press and invited foreign journalists to visit its campuses. It told Americansin a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journalnot to ""believe everything you hear."" The US cannot crush us, says Huawei boss Should we worry about Huawei?

"Apology for ""pain"" of McGuinness award","An IRA bomb survivor has called on the mayor of San Francisco to rescind a posthumous award honouring Martin McGuinness's ""courageous service in the military"". Mary Hamilton said an apology from mayor London Breed has ""come too late"" for IRA victims. Mrs Hamilton was injured in the1972 Claudy bomb. Mr McGuinness has been awarded a Certificate of Honour, the equivalent to a ""freedom of the city"" award. Obituary: Martin McGuinness McGuinness' journey from IRA leader to meeting the Queen IRA victims criticised the honour, which also recognises the former IRA leader's role in the peace process. On Monday DUP leader Arlene Foster invited Ms Breed to Northern Ireland to see how ""terrorism still causes pain"". In a statement, the mayor explained that Mr McGuinness had been selected as one of five Grand Marshalls for the award. ""As part of San Francisco's annual St Patrick's Day festivities, the Mayor of San Francisco has traditionally provided Certificates of Honor to the Honorary Grand Marshalls selected by the United Irish Societies of San Francisco,"" she said. ""San Francisco values mean respect for the democratic process and non-violent political actions. ""The language on the Certificate of Honor should have taken more care to apply these values when reflecting the history of Mr McGuinness's life towards peacemaker and his role in the peace process that resulted in the Good Friday Agreement."" Ms Breed said she apologised for ""the pain this certificate has caused"". But Mrs Hamilton said the award to Mr McGuinness should be rescinded. Now an Ulster Unionist party councillor, the former deputy Mayor of Derry, whose brother-in-law George Hamilton was also shot and killed by the IRA in 1972, said she broke down when she heard about the award. Mrs Hamilton said she believed them Mayor of San Francisco, who signed off on the award, had been ill-informed. ""To me the mayor should have visited Northern Ireland to see the legacy that has been left behind,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She is among a number of IRA victims to criticise the award. The aftermath of the Claudy bombings in July 1972 Ann Travers said she was ""completely sickened"" by the honour. Her sister Mary was murdered by the IRA in Belfast in 1984. The target of the ambush was their father, Tom, a resident magistrate. He survived. ""There was nothing courageous about the IRA. As far as I am aware they were not a military organisation but a terrorist organisation. ""Martin McGuinness left behind as his legacy, people with a huge amount of hurt,"" she said. The Poppy Day bomb in Enniskillen in 1987 brought widespread condemnation Margaret Veitch, whose parents died in the IRA Enniskillen bombing, told theBelfast Telegraph,externalthe former deputy first minister, who died in 2017, had gone to his grave ""an unrepentant terrorist"". ""Terrorists are terrorists the world over, except in Northern Ireland where they are put into government and given awards,"" she said. She added: ""I don't know what's wrong with people that terrorists are now being honoured. Will San Francisco now be giving a posthumous honour to Osama bin Laden?"" Mrs Foster, the former first minister, has written to Andrew Whittaker, the British consul general in San Francisco, to pass on a letter to the mayor of San Francisco which details ""some of the IRA's activities"" and extends an invitation to visit Northern Ireland to ""find out first-hand from those who suffered from their terrorism."" In a statement, Mrs Foster said that Mr McGuinness ""undoubtedly played a very important role in the restoration of devolution"" in his later life but ""the earlier part of his life was one of violence"". Martin McGuiness served as Deputy First Minister with Arlene Foster as First Minister until he stood down in January 2017. She said Mr McGuinness was ""commander of the Provisional IRA Londonderry"" during car bomb attacks in Claudy and Coleraine as well as the murder of Patsy Gillespie who was ""used as human car bomb"". Mrs Foster said these attacks are ""likely to be unknown"" to the San Francisco mayor. Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie, a retired Army captain, also reacted angrily. He tweeted to the Democratic mayor of San Francisco: ""I fought shoulder to shoulder with your country after the 9/11 terrorist attack. Yet you honour terrorists who butchered men, women and children in mine. #ShameOnYou."" Mr McGuinness died at the age of 66 in 2017. He was second-in-command of the IRA in Derry at the time of Bloody Sunday. In 1997, he became MP for Mid Ulster, by which time he was  Sinn Fein's chief negotiator in the peace process. By 2007, he was Northern Ireland's deputy first minister standing alongside First Minister Ian Paisley. A Sinn FÃ©in spokesman said the San Francisco award was a ""welcome recognition of the life and legacy of Martin McGuinness"". ""Martin McGuinness made a colossal contribution to the peace process, Irish unity and reconciliation,"" the spokesman said.

'Legally binding' changes to EU deal agreed,"This video can not be played Theresa May: We have secured what MPs asked for Theresa May says she has secured ""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit deal, a day ahead of MPs voting on it. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned if the deal was voted down there was ""no third chance"". They spoke at a joint press conference in Strasbourg after a late meeting. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister's negotiations had ""failed"" and the announcements did not contain ""anything approaching the changes"" she had promised Parliament. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington announced the changes to the Commons shortly before the press conference, saying they would mean the EU ""cannot try to trap the UK in the [Irish] backstop indefinitely"". MPs respond to 'changes' in Brexit deal 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal Brexit Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Mrs May confirmed she would be opening the debate on Tuesday ahead of a so-called ""meaningful vote"" on her deal, which must be agreed by Parliament to come into force. Last time her deal was put to Parliament in January, she suffered an historic loss as it was voted down by a margin of 230. The PM also said her attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, would publish his legal advice on the changes to the deal before the vote. Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker gave a joint press conference after late night talks in Strasbourg By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Monday morning government blues have been replaced by Tuesday morning nervous hopes. The government does not suddenly expect its Brexit deal to be ushered through at speed, cheered on by well-wishers. It does, however, believe that Monday night's double act in Strasbourg by Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker puts it, to quote one cabinet minister, ""back in the races"". The extra assurances wrought from weeks of talks with the EU will move some of the prime minister's objectors from the ""no"" column to the ""yes"". Read Laura's blog here. Mrs May flew out to the European Parliament late on Monday with her Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay for last-ditch talks ahead of the vote. In the discussions with Mr Juncker and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, two documents were agreed by all parties, which Mr Lidington said would ""strengthen and improve"" both the withdrawal agreement from the EU and the political declaration on the future relationship. The first is a ""joint legally binding instrument"",externalon the withdrawal agreement. Mrs May said it could be used to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop - the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - indefinitely. The backstop has been criticised by some who believe it will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, but the bloc has said ""if used [it] will apply temporarily"". This video can not be played Lidington: Vote for ""improved"" deal or ""plunge this country into a political crisis"" The second is a ""joint statement"",externaladding to the political declaration - the statement in the deal about the UK and EU's future relationship - to commit to replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020. Another document will also be put forward by the government, known as a ""unilateral declaration"". The PM said this would outline the UK's position that there was nothing to prevent it from leaving the backstop arrangement if discussions on a future relationship with the EU break down and there is no prospect on an agreement. Mrs May said: ""MPs were clear that legal changes were needed to the backstop. Today we have secured legal changes. ""Now is the time to come together to back this improved Brexit deal and deliver on the instruction of the British people."" Mr Juncker also warned MPs that they would be putting everything at risk if they voted down the deal. ""In politics sometimes you get a second chance,"" he said. ""It is what we do with that second chance that counts. There will be no third chance."" He added: ""Let us speak crystal clear about the choice - it is this deal or Brexit might not happen at all."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Labour leader Mr Corbyn urged MPs to vote against the deal when it returns to the Commons on Tuesday. ""Since her Brexit deal was so overwhelmingly rejected, the prime minister has recklessly run down the clock, failed to effectively negotiate with the EU and refused to find common ground for a deal Parliament could support,"" he added. The Conservatives' partner in Parliament, the DUP, have been outspoken critics of the deal - especially the backstop. After the announcement, a spokesman said: ""These publications need careful analysis. We will be taking appropriate advice, scrutinising the text line by line and forming our own judgement."" Theresa May's deal to face a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament on Tuesday If it's rejected, a further vote has been promised for Wednesday on whether the UK should leave without a deal If that no-deal option is rejected, MPs could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU.

MPs to vote on May's Brexit deal,"This video can not be played PM Theresa May: ""This House risks no Brexit at all"" MPs are voting on Theresa May's Brexit deal after she made a final bid to convince them to back it. Battling a sore throat after late night talks with the EU, the prime minister urged MPs to vote for her ""improved deal"" or risk ""no Brexit at all"". But some leading Tory Brexiteers and the DUP, who keep her government in power, have rejected the deal. They say the legal assurances secured by the PM are not enough to prevent the UK being tied permanently to the EU. Reaction to May deal ahead of vote Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? The votes May needs for her Brexit deal Sir Bill Cash, a leading Brexiteer, said: ""In the light of our own legal analysis and others we do not recommend accepting the government's motion today."" Sir Bill was part of a panel of legally-trained Brexiteer MPs who examined the PM's revised deal, concluding that it did not deliver the binding changes MPs had demanded. Another Brexit-supporting Tory, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he had not yet decided which way to vote. Conservative MP Simon Clarke, leaving a meeting of Mr Rees-Mogg's European Research Group, said a ""majority"" of the group would vote against the deal. The DUP said in a statement that ""sufficient progress has not been achieved at this time"". Commons Speaker John Bercow did not select any of the amendments to the government motion that had been tabled by MPs. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn on PM's Brexit deal: ""Not one single word has changed"". With husband Philip watching from the public gallery, Mrs May made a final plea to MPs to ""come together"" and ""prove beyond all doubt that democracy comes before party, faction or personal ambition"". ""This is the moment and this is the time,"" she said. ""Back this motion and get the deal done, because only then can we get on with what we came here to do - what we were sent here to do. ""We cannot serve our country by overturning a democratic decision of the British people."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. MPs voted overwhelminglyto reject the PM's deal on 15 January by 432 votes to 202. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that ""after three months of running down the clock"" the prime minister had ""achieved not a single change to the withdrawal agreement"". He said it was the same ""bad deal"" MPs had rejected in January and Labour would be voting against it again because it ""risks people's living standards"", jobs and the NHS. As things stand the number of switchers seems far less than required to avoid another defeat for the prime minister. Last time out she was beaten by a record 230 votes. One cabinet minister guessed the number tonight might be around 150. Everyone is guessing still. But this looks like another dreadful day for Number 10, and another moment when doubts will be on display about not just the divorce deal with the EU, but about the prime minister's leadership too. Something has changed yes, but not enough. Read more from Laura here. Charles Walker, vice chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said defeat for the government in the vote later would lead to a general election. He told BBC Radio 4's World At One: ""If it doesn't go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks. ""It is not sustainable, the current situation in Parliament."" He added: ""She will lead us into that general election. We haven't got time for a leadership election."" Downing Street said: ""We are not preparing for and we do not want a general election."" This video can not be played Attorney General Geoffrey Cox: ""Let me make it clear. The legal risk... remains unchanged"" It comes after Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told MPs the legal risk of being tied to the EU after Brexit ""remains unchanged"". He added that the new assurances secured by the PM did ""reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained"" in the Irish backstop if talks on the two sides future relationship broke down due to ""bad faith"" by the EU. He defined ""bad faith"" as a ""pattern of refusing to accept reasonable proposals"" on the Irish backstop. But he said the question of whether a satisfactory post-Brexit deal on a permanent trading relationship can be reached remained ""a political judgment"" - and he said MPs should back the PM's deal. Inhis advice,external, Mr Cox said ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that if a post-Brexit trade agreement can not be reached due to ""intractable differences"", the UK would have ""no internationally lawful means"" of leaving the backstop without EU agreement. Ian Blackford accused the PM of 'laughing' during his speech Mrs May earlier addressed a meeting of Conservative MPs, in an effort to change the minds of those opposed to her deal. Conservative MPs leaving the meeting suggested half of those who voted against the deal last time will switch to support it later, said BBC's Chief Political Correspondent Vicky Young. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she believed the prime minister's deal would go through ""otherwise instability will follow which would be so unwelcome"". But Brexit-backing former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told MPs: ""I am afraid this deal has now reached the end of the road and if it is rejected tonight I hope that it will be put to bed."" He said the only option to preserve the UK's ""self-respect"" was to leave on 29 March, without Mrs May's agreement, and then negotiate a free trade deal. But the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that the idea of a ""transition period"" without the withdrawal agreement agreed with Mrs May was a ""dangerous illusion"" with no legal basis. Brexiteer Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns said the UK should leave the EU ""without a bad deal"", adding that the country needed to look ""beyond the borders of the EU"". This video can not be played Snap general election on the cards, says Conservative MP Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable told MPs Brexit will ""make this country poorer, weaker and less secure"" and called for people to have the final say in another referendum. And leading Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve warned ""we are about to do a serious and historic mistake"", describing Brexit as ""self-mutilation"". The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford urged the prime minister to ""extend Article 50 and bring forward another EU referendum"".

A joint statement about the UK and EU's future relationship,externalwhich commits to replacing the backstop with an alternative by December 2020. A ""unilateral declaration"",externalstating there is nothing to stop the UK from leaving the backstop if discussions on a future relationship with the EU break down and there is no prospect of an agreement. Many MPs fear the backstop, initially agreed by the UK government in December 2017, would keep the country in a customs arrangement with the EU indefinitely.
