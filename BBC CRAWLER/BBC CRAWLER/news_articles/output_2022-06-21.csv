Windrush statue to be unveiled at Waterloo Station,"This video can not be played WATCH: A Windrush monument is unveiled at Waterloo Station The Queen has praised the Windrush ""pioneers"" for their ""profound contribution"" to British life as a statue to them was unveiled. The monument, at Waterloo Station, pays tribute to the thousands of people who arrived in the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1971. It depicts a man, woman and child standing on top of suitcases and was revealed to mark Windrush Day. The government gave Â£1m to fund the statue, designed by Basil Watson. In a message to mark the occasion, signed Elizabeth R, the Queen said she hoped the statue would ""inspire present and future generations"" as she sent her ""warmest good wishes on this historic occasion"". Windrush Day marks the arrival of Caribbean immigrants to the shores of Britain on 22 June each year - the day HMT Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks in 1948. Windrush generation: Who are they and why are they facing problems? Windrush racism report must be published - lawyer Anger at Home Office over compensation progress The Queen's grandson the Duke of Cambridge helped to unveil the statue, alongside his wife the Duchess of Cambridge, and also paid tribute to the contributions of the Windrush generation, and their descendants to British life. ""Without you all Britain would simply not be what it is today,"" he said. ""I want to say a profound thank you to every member of that generation and the generations that have followed."" But Prince William also talked about how the ""past weighs heavily"" on the people of the Caribbean and the Windrush generation. He said members of the Windrush generation had been victims of racism when they arrived and said ""discrimination remains an all too familiar experience for black men and women in Britain in 2022"". The duke referred to the Windrush scandal, which broke in April 2018, and said it still ""rightly reverberates through the Caribbean community here in the UK"". The scandal, which saw members of the Windrush generation and their children wrongly detained and even deported,led to the UK government apologising for the deportation threats many faced. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, accompanied by Baroness Floella Benjamin, Windrush passengers Alford Gardner and John Richards and children at the unveiling of the National Windrush Monument at Waterloo Station Windrush passengers Alford Gardner and John Richards helped the royals to unveil the statue. Jamaican artist and sculptor Mr Watson has said he was""truly honoured"" to have been chosento create the monument. The government said the statue would ""create a permanent place of reflection and inspiration and be a visible statement of our shared history and heritage"". The Duke of Cambridge paid tribute to the ""profound contribution"" of the Windrush generation to the fabric of British life Earlier to mark Windrush Day, Prince William and Catherine met young British-Caribbean creatives at the Brixton House theatre in south London, with the duchess trying her hand at photography and the duke chatting to R&B musician Abdoulaziz Lelo Ndambi. They also met youth workers at Lambeth Council's Elevate programme and attended a workshop led by production agencies Iconic Steps and Oxygen Art. High-profile names, including actor Lenny Henry and poet Benjamin Zephaniah, have called for next year's Windrush Day to be a ""major national moment"" to mark the 75th anniversary. More than 100 leaders across different sectors have signed a joint letter, published in The Times, starting the one-year countdown to the milestone. The letter reads: ""This is not only black history - it is British history. It should be something we all know and commemorate."" Patrick Vernon, convenor of the Windrush 75 network, which is co-ordinating efforts over the next 12 months, said it was a piece of history ""every child should learn about at school"" and called for it to be commemorated as a major event. Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials after HMT Empire Windrush's arrival in 1948 But not everyone has been supportive of the unveiling of the statue with activist Prof Gus John describing it as ""a monument to unforgivable political illiteracy and an entrenched colonial mindset"". In an open letter to Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, dated 9 June, declining an invitation to the unveiling, he said the ""entire Windrush narrative distorts the history of Caribbean engagement with Britain and of Britain's relentless efforts to keep us out"". Vincent McBean, president of the West Indian Association of Service Personnel, supported the creation of the memorial but said it could have been located in a better place. ""In the heart of Brixton is Windrush Square, what would have been more befitting for it to have been put in the square,"" he said, adding that it had been Lambeth Council which had initially embraced those who arrived from the Caribbean. The government says the location was chosen because thousands of members of the Windrush generation passed through Waterloo Station on their way to start new lives across the UK. They are known as the Windrush generation, in reference to the HMT Empire Windrush, one of the ships that carried them to the UK to fill labour shortages, in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration. Under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. But thousands of the Windrush generation arrived in the UK as children and did not have official documentation.  Following immigration law changes in 2014, many were told they were in the UK illegally, despite living and working in the country for decades.

"Disabled fans treated like animals, hearing told","French police used tear gas and pepper spray on some supporters at the Champions League final in Paris Disabled Liverpool fans have told an inquiry they were ""treated like animals"" amid the chaotic scenes at the Champions League final in Paris. Supporters have described heavy-handed policing, organisational chaos and overcrowding at the game on 28 May. A disabled supporters' spokesman told the French Senate one wheelchair user had to be lifted over locked gates by fellow fans as she tried to escape. Ted Morris urged the French interior minister to resign over the event. French ministerGÃ©rald Darmanin previously saidonly the English fans posed problems outside the stadium. On Tuesday, Mr Morris, chairman of the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association, gave the French Senate his account of events outside the Paris stadium before the final. The match, which was eventually won by Real Madrid, was delayed when long queues of Liverpool fans built up outside the stadium in Paris. French police used tear gas and pepper spray on some supporters. Liverpool fans described heavy-handed policing, organisational chaos and overcrowding at the final Mr Darmanin said ""massive, industrial-scale"" ticket fraud had caused Liverpool fans to turn up en masse, and said that of about 30 arrests made at the Stade de France ""more than half concerned British citizens"". Mr Morris told the French Senate: ""With my wife, we love France and Paris, but you, Mr Darmanin, you lied and I ask you to withdraw your accusation. ""And if you have the decency to do so, I hope you have the decency to resign."" The French Senate heard about one wheelchair user who was lifted over locked gates by fellow fans as she tried to escape the melee. Another fan, an eight-year-old boy with autism became separated from his father, was later attacked after they had been reunited. Mr Morris said: ""A major catastrophe has been avoided. No power was able to come to the aid of the disabled supporters. ""Disabled fans were treated like animals. ""My wife and I did not care about the game any more at this stage,"" he continued. Chain of failures marred Paris final - inquiry France blames ticket fraud as police row rages Only English fans posed problems - French minister ""We left in the 86th minute and the steward told us we couldn't get out because some locals were still trying to go into the stadium. ""In the underpass - at the exit of the stadium under the gaze of the police, a few minutes later - locals attacked us and it was terrifying, especially for the disabled supporters. ""As we walked towards the station we hoped that the police would intervene. ""It was the worst football experience."" This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris Joe Blott, chair of the Spirit of Shankly supporters' group, accused police of operating on preconceived notions dating back to the 1980s in their handling of English supporters and insisted the use of tear gas on innocent fans was ""not necessary"". Mr Blott also urged the authorities to learn from their mistakes ahead of next year's Rugby World Cup in France and the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. He described the behaviour of Liverpool fans as ""exemplary"". ""We demand an apology and a retraction of the lies being told and for the supporters who will be travelling to the Rugby World Cup and to the Olympics, a fair investigation."" A French government report previously saida chain of failures had marred the event. They included lack of preparation for travelling fans, huge numbers of people without tickets or fake ones, and security failures at the stadium. The report does not apportion blame, but recommends improvements which the government says will be implemented.

Row over report into Commonwealth body's finances,"Commonwealth boss Baroness Scotland Baroness Scotland, Secretary General of the Commonwealth, is involved in a bitter dispute with some of the organisation's member states - only days before she asks them for a second term of office, the BBC has learned. The Commonwealth Secretariat - the administration led by Lady Scotland - is suppressing an independent review of its finances that is understood to contain criticisms of the way it has been run. Kevin Isaac, chairman of the Commonwealth Board of Governors - which represents all member states - said the decision by the secretariat to withhold the report was ""an affront"" to the board's authority. A spokesman for the secretariat said it had factual concerns about the report. In a letter, seen by the BBC, Mr Isaac, who is High Commissioner of St Kitts and Nevis in London, writes: ""The secretariat's decision to bar the chair access to the report is an affront to the mandate given to the chair by the board."" He adds: ""The chair regrets and challenges the position taken by the secretariat which demonstrates an indifference to the board's oversight authority"". The dispute comes as Commonwealth heads of government prepare to gather this week in Rwanda for a summit where they will decide if they want Lady Scotland to have a second term of office. Jamaica's foreign minister, Kamina Johnson Smith, is standing against the Labour peer and has the public backing of seven member states, including India and the UK. Commonwealth rejects Baroness Scotland automatic second term Row erupts in Commonwealth over pandemic summit UK suspends funding to Commonwealth Secretariat Seven things you might not know about the Commonwealth UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told MPs on Tuesday the UK was backing Ms Johnson Smith ""to ensure that the Commonwealth delivers for all its members in areas such as trade, investment and defending democracy"". Earlier this year the Commonwealth Board - which takes decisions on behalf of heads of government in between summits - asked Lady Scotland's secretariat to commission an independent review into the way the organisation was financed. According to Mr Isaac's letter, addressed to all 53 other Commonwealth governors, the review was designed to advise on ""how to put the secretariat on a more sustainable financial footing"". Some Commonwealth member states have reduced the amount of money they give to the secretariat, with total funding for the body falling over the past decade from about Â£50m to about Â£30m. Global accountancy firm Ernst & Young was commissioned to carry out the review and its report was finally delivered to the secretariat on 1 June. But since then the secretariat has refused to share the report with the board. When Mr Isaac asked why, a secretariat official told him: ""The secretariat's position remains that we are unable to share the report, but will do so as a matter of urgency after obtaining external advice to protect the position of the secretariat as contract manager."" Commonwealth sources say although the review was designed to look at ways of improving the secretariat's funding, they suspect it contains criticisms voiced by some high commissioners about the way the organisation has been run. In his letter, Mr Isaac says he understands the assessments of senior managers at the secretariat ""differ from certain perspectives or reflections contained"" within the report. He argues that because the board commissioned the report, the secretariat has no right to withhold it. He says that if the secretariat disagrees with aspects of the report, then it can say so in a separate addendum: ""It does not have the option not to release the report to the governors."" One Commonwealth insider said the report was being suppressed to ensure its contents were not made public while Lady Scotland was seeking re-election at the summit in Kigali. But allies of Lady Scotland dispute this assessment and have questioned the quality of the report. It is understood the Commonwealth Secretariat is taking legal advice about how to respond. A spokesperson for the secretariat said: ""The secretariat received this report late and, when we did receive the final version, we raised factual and other concerns with the consultant about the draft we received. ""We still have concerns and therefore we are obtaining external advice to protect the position of the secretariat as contract manager. We hope to resolve matters, hopefully amicably, as soon as possible."" Both Mr Isaac and Ernst & Young declined to comment.

Asda says some shoppers setting Â£30 limit at tills,"This video can not be played Asda chairman: Inflation is sparking a ""massive change in behaviour"" amongst shoppers Some Asda shoppers are asking cashiers to stop scanning items when the till total hits Â£30 as they try to cut costs, the supermarket's chairman says. As well as putting less in their baskets, Lord Rose said more customers were switching to budget ranges with people worried about rising prices. ""What we're seeing is a massive change in behaviour,"" he told the BBC. It comes after food and fuel costs soar, with UK  inflation, the rate at which prices rise,hitting 9.1% in May. Lord Rose said he saw the inflation rise coming last year like a ""train coming through a tunnel with a big flashing light on the top"". Now it's time to ""fasten our seatbelts"", he said. ""People are trading back. They are worried about spending,"" he said. ""They've got a limit that they've set out, too. They say Â£30 is one limit... and if they get to more than Â£30 then that's it, stop. It's the same with petrol."" Lord Rose said the country was facing some very tough times and urged the government to do more to help low income households. But the Treasury said it understood people were struggling with rising prices and it was makingcost of living payments of Â£1,200to those on the lowest incomes. Lord Rose also addressed government concerns thatsupermarkets were not passing on March's 5p per litre cut in fuel duty, insisting Asda price changes were ""done the same day"". Asda customers are trading down to budget ranges, the supermarket's chairman says The retail veteran has some 50 years of industry experience under his belt. He remembers the runaway inflation of the 1970s and said this bout of rising prices has come as a very nasty surprise for consumers. ""I'm of the generation that remembers what it was like last time. And once [inflation] gets hold, it's quite pernicious,"" he said. ""And it takes a long time to eradicate... We're in danger of being in a place that it's very difficult to extricate ourselves from. ""What's rather sad is that the country, the government, perhaps the Bank of England didn't see inflation coming quickly. They've now recognised that."" Why are prices rising so quickly? Food bills are set to soar by Â£380 this year Fuel cost: How to save petrol and diesel Asda has been tracking disposable income since the financial crisis in 2008 and is all too aware of the squeeze on consumers. Its latest data shows households had, on average, Â£44 less a week in discretionary income in May compared with a year ago - a fall of nearly 18%.  This is the amount of money left over after taxes and essential bills have been deducted and it is the third month in a row where disposable incomes have dropped to record levels. Like other supermarkets, Asda is having to grapple with its own soaring costs and decide how much of this to absorb and how much to pass on to shoppers. All the big grocers are in a battle to keep prices as low as possible on the most popular everyday items because they know customers will vote with their feet and shop around. The UK's third biggest grocer has expanded its cut price groceries with a new range, Just Essentials, covering some 300 products. It has also launched Dropped and Locked, an initiative to lower prices on 100 items and keep them at the same price for the rest of the year. ""We're doing everything we can. We've invested nearly Â£100m in the last month or so making sure customers get essentials at very, very attractive prices to try and help them,"" said Lord Rose. But will it be enough? Asda has recently been performing less well than its rivals. Lord Rose said he was not too worried about market share in the short and medium term. ""It goes up a bit, and down a bit, you'll see the monthly changes and that's always been the case in retail... We will do what we need to do to look after our customers,"" he said. ""Secondly, because we've had a change of ownership - my colleagues and I only took over the business a year ago -  we're doing things which we think will affect the long term of the business which will give customers a better Asda."" The Asda chairman and former M&S boss said he did not want to predict where food prices will get to by the end of the year but would like to see more government support for those most in need. ""I would urge them to do more for those people at the bottom end of the earnings income scale,"" he said. He suggested a VAT reduction or another reduction in fuel tax would be ""helpful"". He acknowledged the government now has a difficult balancing act between tackling rising prices without scuppering economic growth. But he knows what he would do. ""I would say the most important priority in the short term is to kill inflation, because once inflation gets embedded, it's very, very hard to kill. If it means we have to slow the economy down for a while, and it looks as if we are heading for a recession, then so be it."" A government spokesperson said its Â£37bn support package meant it would deliver a tax cut in July to save the typical employee more than Â£330 a year. It said people on Universal Credit would keep Â£1,000 more of what they earn and a 5p cut on fuel duty would save a typical family Â£100.

Watchdog blamed as energy firm failures push up bills,"Energy watchdog Ofgem has been accused of allowing an industry to develop on ""shaky foundations"" in which a series of supply companies collapsed. All billpayers will pay Â£94 more a year each to cover the Â£2.7bn cost of the failure of 28 suppliers which folded after wholesale prices soared. The National Audit Office (NAO) said Ofgem had allowed a market to develop that was vulnerable to large shocks. The regulator said it was already addressing the issues raised. Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""Ofgem's approach created an energy market built on shaky foundations. As a result, many companies simply collapsed under the shock of energy price increases. ""Once again, it's the public who has to pay for the mistakes of those charged with protecting them. It's unacceptable."" The result of last year's shock was that 2.4 million customers were automatically moved to a rival company when their own supplier collapsed. Typically, according to Citizens Advice, they had to pay an extra Â£30 a month for the duration of their original contract, as they were shifted to a more expensive tariff. In addition, the cost of these failures totalled Â£2.7bn - a tab which was spread across all billpayers in Britain, not just those of the failed companies. This is before taking into account the potentially multi-billion charge that households could face due tothe collapse of Bulb Energy, which is in special administration. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? The NAO said that Ofgem had decided on a ""low bar"" approach for allowing new domestic energy suppliers into the market to encourage competition and choice for customers after the market had been dominated by six big companies. The regulator had then introduced tighter rules for new entrants from 2019, but not for existing suppliers until 2021. As a result, many suppliers lacked the financial resilience to deal with the six-fold increase in wholesale prices seen last year, the NAO said. ""By allowing so many suppliers with weak finances to enter the market, and by failing to imagine that there could be a long period of volatility in energy prices, Ofgem allowed a market to develop that was vulnerable to large-scale shocks,"" said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO. ""Consumers have borne the brunt of supplier failures at a time when many households are already under significant financial strain having seen their bills go up to record levels. A supplier market must be developed that truly works for consumers,"" Mr Davies said. Ofgem is making changes after a review it commissioned came to many of the same conclusions. ""We are already working hard to address all of the issues raised,"" a spokesman for the regulator said. ""While the once-in-a-generation global energy price shock would have resulted in market exits under any regulatory framework, we have already been clear that suppliers and Ofgem's financial resilience regime were not robust enough. ""While no regulator can, or should, guarantee companies will not fail in the future, we will continue to take a whole-market approach to further strengthen the regulatory regime, ensuring a fair and robust market for consumers which keeps costs fair as we move away from fossils fuels and towards affordable, green, home-grown energy."" The NAO said concerns had been raised that Ofgem's reforms could limit new entrants and innovative ideas in the future. A typical household gas and electricity bill - governed by the energy price cap in England, Wales and Scotland has risen sharply, and now stands at about Â£2,000 a year. Analysts Cornwall Insight have predicted that the bill could hit about Â£3,000 a year this winter. How much are energy bills going up?

'Miracle' boy goes home after year in hospitalCairon Barry-Edwards was admitted after having a cardiac arrest at home aged six months.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"Cairon and mum Shantelle have spent a year at Southampton Children's Hospital A boy with a rare heart condition has defied doctors' expectations and gone home after spending a year in hospital. Cairon Barry-Edwards was six months old when he was admitted to Southampton Children's Hospital after having a cardiac arrest at home. Diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a rare disease of the heart muscle, his family was told to prepare for the worst.â¯ But after intensive treatment and a new drug regime he was cleared to go back home to Reading. The poorly youngster had been put on the heart transplant list and his mother was warned the chances of a successful outcome were very low.â¯â¯ Cairon's condition meant he was unable to gain weight so was fed directly through the veins, bypassing his digestive system and taking pressure off his heart. Cairon was admitted when he was six months old Cardiologist Dr Tara Bharucha opted to trial a new drug, called Entresto, which could be safely administered at home. She said: ""...Cairon is thought to be one of the first children under the age of one in the UK to receive it. ""When [he] first came to us he was a very poorly little boy but he has amazed us with his determination and strong will - he really is our little miracle.â¯"" Mum Shantelle, 40, did not leave her son's side since the day he was admitted, sleeping both on the wards and at Ronald McDonald House, which provides accommodation to families with children in hospital. She thanked hospital staff and added: ""It's been a crazy year, a bit of a blur really. ""I haven't been home for 12 months and I've only seen my other children Tafari and Ayanna, a handful of times, but you just have to go with it.â¯â¯ ""It wasn't an easy path to get here, but I always knew deep down that Cairon would be ok.â¯"" Cairon, now 18 months old, will continue to need care and may require a heart transplant as he grows but has returned home in time to celebrate his big brother's 17th birthday.â¯â¯ Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

Disruption for millions on rail strike's first day,"Some passengers faced lengthy journeys on the few rail services that remained Passengers across Britain faced journeys hours longer than usual and surging road traffic at the start of the largest rail strike in decades. The first of three strikes by the RMT union over cuts to jobs, conditions, real-terms pay and pensions left just one in five trains running. Boris Johnson urged the country to ""stay the course"" and resist pay rises in line with soaring inflation. RMT boss Mick Lynch said the union was ""leading the way"" over pay concerns. The RMT and railway employers are due to hold fresh talks on Wednesday aimed at resolving the dispute. But more strikes are scheduled for Thursday and Saturday. About 40,000 members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union working for Network Rail and 13 train operators walked out in the first of the three planned strikes. Half of all lines were closed and much of the country had no rail service at all, including most of Scotland and Wales, the whole of Cornwall and Dorset, and places such as Chester, Hull, Lincoln and Worcester. Which lines are affected by the rail strike? How much are rail workers paid? Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Many stations that are normally crammed with commuters were almost deserted except for union picket lines, as strikes also took place on London Underground lines on Tuesday. Commuters who made it into work by rail faced a dash for their last trains before the network shut down at 18:30 BST. Disruption is set to continue on Wednesday, because the lack of overnight staff is expected to delay the first trains by up to four hours in some places, and only about 60% of normal services are due to run. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""We need to get ready to stay the course"" Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines said by late morning, ""we'll be running a full service"" and it was expected that would continue throughout the day.""So, again, disruption - but far less disruption than today,"" he added. Mr Johnson - speaking at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday - said without modernisation to the industry, train operators risked going bust and passengers faced ever-increasing prices that could lead to them abandoning rail travel. ""I say this to the country as a whole, we need to get ready to stay the course,"" he said. ""Because these reforms, these improvements in the way we run our railways, are in the interests of the travelling public, they will help to cut costs for fare payers."" The prime minister said the strikes were ""so wrong and so unnecessary"", making it ""more difficult for people to get to work, risking people's appointments, making it more difficult for kids to sit exams - all sorts of unnecessary aggravations"". 'My stag do plans are in ruins due to strikes' 'Why I'm losing my wages to go on strike' Should public sector workers get bigger pay rises? Downing Street said the prime minister believed the government had to ""work within our means"" and resist calls for pay rises that would lead to greater inflation later. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%. Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - is currently 9% but the Bank of England forecasts it will reach about 11% in the autumn. Many stations that are normally crowded with commuters were almost deserted This video can not be played Watch: One striking RMT worker says ""enough is enough"" Mr Lynch apologised for the disruption to passengers, but accused the government, which owns Network Rail, of actively preventing employers and the RMT from reaching a settlement. He said members had shown ""outstanding unity"" as the union opposed plans for thousands of job cuts, changed working conditions and reduced pension benefits, along with making its pay demands. Mr Lynch said railway staff were ""leading the way"" for workers who were ""sick and tired of having their pay and conditions slashed"". ""Now is the time to stand up and fight for every single railway worker in this dispute that we will win,"" he said. Marta Kotlarek's sons Jakub and Michal have exams on two of the strike days Marta Kotlarek, from Holywell, Flintshire, says she has had to take time off work to drive her sons to their exams during the rail strike. Jakub, 16, and Michal, 18, usually take the train from Flint to school in Colwyn Bay. But with GCSE and A-level exams on the morning of the strikes on Tuesday and Thursday, they couldn't make the journey this week. ""This is a crucial year for them... they are a little bit worried,"" says Marta. She says there's no point in doing the hour-long round trip twice, so she's waiting around until they finish their exams before driving back to Holywell. As commuters switched from trains to cars to avoid the impact of the strike, some places saw long queues on the roads. Location technology firm TomTom said congestion levels at 11:00 BST were higher than at the same time last week in a number of urban areas. London congestion increased from 38% to 51%, in Cardiff it went up from 24% to 29% and Manchester saw a rise from 27% to 34%. The percentages reflect the additional time needed for journeys compared to free-flowing traffic. Bus stops were crowded as people sought alternative routes There were also long queues on outer London sections of the M1, M4, A4 and A40. But National Highways told the BBC that many parts of the motorway network have been quieter than a normal Tuesday, as employees took advantage of post-pandemic work-from-home policies.

Woman wins first Covid vaccine death compensation,"Zion's fiancÃ©e said he was healthy and exercised regularly A woman whose partner died after having an AstraZeneca jab has become the first person to receive compensation over a Covid vaccine death. Vikki Spit's former rock singer fiancÃ© Zion, 48, of Alston, Cumbria, fell ill eight days after he had his injection and died in May 2021. She was awarded the maximum settlement of Â£120,000 but said it was not enough. The 38-year-old said she had got into debt after losing Zion's earnings and should have had closer to Â£180,000. Ms Spit also said she had to wait too long for compensation under the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme 1979, and the amount had not kept track with inflation since the scheme was set up. Vaccine damage payments available to anyone who has become disabled as a result of having a vaccination and people can also apply on behalf of someone who has died. The scheme offers one-off, tax-free sums of up to Â£120,000 and while payments do not affect people's rights to take legal action, they can have implications for their benefits. Vikki Spit believes Zion may have lived if he had received treatment earlier Ms Spit called an ambulance for Zion when he began suffering ""excruciating"" headaches on 13 May last year and he died in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary six days later. His death certificate confirmed he died due to complications from the vaccine. However, it took the NHS Business Services Authority, the Newcastle-based administrators of the compensation scheme, until 17 June this year to make the award. Ms Spit is now calling on the government to increase the maximum pay-out to better reflect the loss of earnings that a person in their 40s would have made before their retirement. Is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine safe? She said: ""I am still heartbroken by the sudden loss of my partner of 21 years, and alongside this emotional trauma, I have also been faced with financial hardship as a result of the loss of Zion's contribution to household finances. ""There just isn't the proper financial aid coming from the government to support those who have lost family to the vaccine."" She also said the compensation did not take into account spiralling inflation. Ms Spit, who maintains she is not anti-vaccines, said paramedics deemed Zion was suffering from a migraine when they were called to their home. The writer and filmmaker suffered from a seizure a few days later and during surgery ""didn't wake up."" The couple had be due to get married last year after 21 years together She said Zion was fit and healthy and would have had a good chance of survival if he had received treatment earlier. His donated liver and kidneys helped save the lives of three people. James Bell, medical negligence partner at Hodge Jones and Allen, said: ""While I am glad that Vikki has been able to receive some restitution for the hardship she has faced as a result of Zion's death, the scheme simply isn't fit for purpose. ""Not only has the application process been lengthy and inefficient, but the compensation Vikki received fails to reflect and remediate the full economic impact of her fiancÃ©'s death.""

'Miracle' boy goes home after year in hospital,"Cairon and mum Shantelle have spent a year at Southampton Children's Hospital A boy with a rare heart condition has defied doctors' expectations and gone home after spending a year in hospital. Cairon Barry-Edwards was six months old when he was admitted to Southampton Children's Hospital after having a cardiac arrest at home. Diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a rare disease of the heart muscle, his family was told to prepare for the worst.â¯ But after intensive treatment and a new drug regime he was cleared to go back home to Reading. The poorly youngster had been put on the heart transplant list and his mother was warned the chances of a successful outcome were very low.â¯â¯ Cairon's condition meant he was unable to gain weight so was fed directly through the veins, bypassing his digestive system and taking pressure off his heart. Cairon was admitted when he was six months old Cardiologist Dr Tara Bharucha opted to trial a new drug, called Entresto, which could be safely administered at home. She said: ""...Cairon is thought to be one of the first children under the age of one in the UK to receive it. ""When [he] first came to us he was a very poorly little boy but he has amazed us with his determination and strong will - he really is our little miracle.â¯"" Mum Shantelle, 40, did not leave her son's side since the day he was admitted, sleeping both on the wards and at Ronald McDonald House, which provides accommodation to families with children in hospital. She thanked hospital staff and added: ""It's been a crazy year, a bit of a blur really. ""I haven't been home for 12 months and I've only seen my other children Tafari and Ayanna, a handful of times, but you just have to go with it.â¯â¯ ""It wasn't an easy path to get here, but I always knew deep down that Cairon would be ok.â¯"" Cairon, now 18 months old, will continue to need care and may require a heart transplant as he grows but has returned home in time to celebrate his big brother's 17th birthday.â¯â¯ Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

Wales hit by biggest rail strike in 30 years,"This video can not be played Fewer than 10% of normal services were running on Tuesday Rail passengers in Wales are dealing with the biggest strike in 30 years. Fewer than 10% of normal services were running, Network Rail confirmed, on the first of three days of industrial action across the UK. Last-minute talks between unions and rail bosses failed to broker a deal in a row over pay and proposed job losses. Commuters have been advised to avoid travelling by train as the few services that are running are likely to be full. In the Senedd on Tuesday First Minister Mark Drakeford accused UK government ministers of being absent in the talks. Some of his ministers showed theirsupport to RMT striking workers on Tuesday, after the first minister said he would not follow Sir Keir Starmer in asking colleagues to avoid pickets. Downing Street said the prime minister believes pay rises in line with inflation are""not feasible across the board"" now. The RMT union says workers are facing mass job cuts and many have not had a pay rise for years. Rail strike: The hens, vampires and Barry Manilow How train strike will affect passengers in Wales LIVE: Latest on the rail disruption Major Welsh company Admiral, with 7,000 staff in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, encouraged employees to work from home. Rhian Langham, of the insurance group, said: ""We've encouraged those who feel that they'll be unable to get to the office as planned to work from home to help limit the potential disruption to them and our customers."" Labour Senedd members including ministers Dawn Bowden, Julie Morgan and Mick Antoniw were among politicians supporting striking workers on Tuesday Bangor station in Gwynedd was deserted on Tuesday morning Picket lines have been set up at a number of stations, including at Swansea An RMT picket line at Cardiff Central station, including Shavanah Taj, general secretary of the Wales TUC Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price speaking to striking workers in Cardiff Teresa Davies from Ewloe in Flintshire, who has dementia, regularly uses the trains and is dog sitting for a friend in Powys at the moment. She was planning to return home this week. ""I need to go home tomorrow, it's making me quite anxious,"" she said. ""It's a two and a half hour drive each way."" ""I do travel a lot. I'm quite independent and I'm fine travelling but when things go wrong, when things don't go to plan it can make my dementia worse. I can get very anxious, it's not good,"" she said. Very few trains were running on Tuesday morning There are no trains west of Cardiff nor north of Merthyr Tydfil on strike days and aspecial timetable,externalfor 20 to 26 June has been published. There arelimited services on the valley lines,externalbetween Radyr and Treherbert, Aberdare and Merthyr Tydfil, which is owned and operated by Transport for Wales, with a rail replacement bus link between Radyr and Cardiff Central. Motorists had been warned to expected a surge in vehicles on the roads, and there were reports of slow traffic across Wales during the morning rush hour. Roads affected included the M4 eastbound near Magor, the A468 at Nantgarw and the A483 Wrexham bypass northbound. Morgan Stevens of Newport Bus said the company saw 10% more passengers compared to last Tuesday. He added that they were using double deckers for the busier regional routes such as Newport to Cardiff to cope with any increase in demand. Can I get a refund?Yes, if you cannot get your train due to strike action. Season-ticket holders can apply for a refund for the days affected. Find more infohere,external. Do I have to go to work or school?This is up to your individual employer or school, check with them. How can I plan my train journey?Use theNational Rail journey planner,external. Read morehere. Transport for Wales is not involved in the dispute, that includes guards, catering staff, signallers and track maintenance workers, but cannot run all its services as Network Rail maintains most track in Wales. The RMT union wants a pay rise of 7% to deal with the rising cost of living, but it says employers are offering a maximum of 3% on condition they also accept job cuts and changes to working practices. The RMT has threatened further action ""for as long as it takes to get a settlement"", potentially for six months or more. Steve Skelly of the RMT in Wales said it had had none of the assurances it wanted from either the UK government nor train companies. Mr Skelly said: ""The reality is that we've had no other option but to ballot our members for industrial action. For some of our members this has been the third year of a pay freeze."" UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has dismissed a call from the RMT for ministerial intervention and said negotiations should be between unions and employers. The Labour Party has also called on the government to step in. Welsh Conservatives' transport spokeswoman Natasha Asghar said: ""Whilst I support workers' right to strike, this rail walkout is set to cause huge disruption not just across Wales but the rest of the UK."" She urged unions to ""abandon the working practices of the 1950s, get round the table and use the changes in practices to give the staff a pay rise"". But Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said the UK government had ""chosen to promote conflict"". The Welsh government could face calls for inflation-proof pay rises from unions representing health and other public services workers. Mr Gething claimed the Welsh government's hands were tied by funding from Westminster. There would be ""real difficulty for all of us"" unless the Treasury provided the funding to increase wages in line with inflation, Mr Gething said. In 2020, it was estimated that only 3% of commuting in Wales was by rail. This compared to 10% on average across Britain and as high as 45% in London. In Wales, more than 80% of commuters still travel to work by car, which is higher than all English regions and Scotland, according to Department of Transport figures. But more of us are travelling for leisure - and that is at the heart of the dispute. Stuart Cole, professor of transport economics at the University of South Wales, said the three-day walkout was due in particular to a dispute over a seven-day working week. In the past, staff were given the option of not working on Sundays. But Prof Cole said the economics of the railways industry had changed, with the weekend now part of the working week. ""Railway demand for leisure travel is up by 50% compared with a reduction in commuting by 40%. That change in the market place shows the importance of that weekend working,"" Prof Cole told Radio Wales. How are the rail strikes affecting you?

Arrest in Pakistan over 1995 market murder in Wales,"Jaswant Singh Sandhu was shot and later died in hospital A man has been arrested in Pakistan in connection with a murder in Caerphilly county 27 years ago. Mohammad ""Bobby"" Basharat is suspected of killing market trader Jaswant Singh Sandhu in Blackwood in 1995. The National Crime Agency said the 49-year-old was found by Pakistan authorities under a false identity. Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said the man was brought before a local court in Islamabad and he has been remanded in custody. A floral tribute left in the market place, after the shooting in 1995 Mr Sandhu, a father-of-two, who had family in Wolverhampton, died in hospital after being shot with a pistol following a row on a clothes stall at a market, apparently about the price of T-shirts. The case in May 1995 featured on the BBC Crimewatch programme. Mr Basharat had lived in Oldham, Lancashire but worked at the market in south Wales three times a week. Sheikh Zubair Ahmad from the FIA told the BBC that he was declared a fugitive by UK police and his arrest came about after cooperation from the UK authorities. He had been running businesses including a recruitment agency in the city of Rawalpindi. Mohammad Basharat (left) pictured in custody According to the FIA official, he was from the Mirpur district of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and after coming to Pakistan he got a new ID card with the name of Zamir Ali, son of Muhammad Aslam. The FIA official said that Interpol officials had also been in contact with them and the extradition process was under way. A Gwent Police statement said: ""A 49-year-old man was arrested in Pakistan on suspicion of murder in connection with an investigation into the death of a man in Blackwood in 1995. ""Inquiries are ongoing and work continues, alongside the National Crime Agency and authorities in Pakistan, to secure his extradition to the UK where he may face further court proceedings.""

Are wild goats a positive or a plague for town?,"These Billies were out on the town early in the pandemic lockdown A row is brewing over whether to take action against a famous herd of roaming wild goats. The Kashmiri goats have lived on the Great Orme headland above Llandudno in Conwy for more than 100 years. However they have been described as a ""plague"" by residents tired of gardens being eaten, droppings left in the street and concerns over road safety. Others insists the goats are a key part of the area's character and should be protected. Conwy council said the goats are wild animals and there are no plans to intervene - at the moment. Fighting goats block supermarket car park Frisky male goats get stuck pursuing females Warning on the dangers of goat selfies The herd has long ventured into the town when food is scarce in spring. However, the goats have grown both in numbers and notoriety since the Covid pandemic. Their numbers spikedwhen the pandemic meant contraceptive jabs could not be givento the goats as usual. They made headlines aftermaking the most of the town's traffic-free roads at the start of lockdownand continue to be seen more regularly more often than usual in car parks, roundabouts and housing estates. ""We love the goats - but not in our gardens"", said Mrs Oliver For Phyl Oliver, 77, planning restrictions in the Liddell Park area mean she is unable to put up a permanent fence to protect the front garden she tended to while recovering from cancer. ""It's like having a plague of locusts or a plague of frogs,"" she said. ""I've had elderly people here weeping because the rose garden that their late husband built for them has been devoured. ""A garden isn't just plants - it's a lifelong hobby. It motivates you to get out and do something, and it's important for mental health [but] it's being taken off me. ""I'm stuck with temporary fences, goat manure and, quite honestly, I cannot be bothered coming out in the morning because I don't know what I'm going to face. ""We love the goats, they're beautiful, but we want them on the Great Orme please - not in people's gardens."" Some residents have taken to using netting to protect their gardens She is among several people to complain to the council, raising other issues such as road safety because the goats walk slowly across busy roads. The council insists the goats are not its responsibility but it has worked with organisations, such as Natural Resources Wales and the RSPCA, to control numbers bysending them elsewhere. However there are plenty of residents who believe the goats should be allowed to carry on roaming. This video can not be played What do people think of Llandudno's roaming wild goats? ""They are special part of Llandudno, everyone knows about them and where they might be hiding,"" said Ruby Williams. ""Locals were brought up with them and, in the main, people are fans. ""My driving has changed a lot since goats started becoming a regular feature in this part of town. ""They make me smile when they give you staring stern looks as they cross the road. ""Send them away? No, this is their home and visitors love them."" Did someone say all you can eat? Aberconwy MS Janet Finch Saunders said the goats were ""iconic"" but that she had received complaints.

"Union rejects Rolls Royce Â£2,000 living-cost bonus","A union representing Rolls-Royce workers has rejected the offer of a Â£2,000 one-off payment from the firm to help its staff with the rising cost of living. Of the 14,000 staff at Rolls-Royce who were eligible for the payment, 11,000 members are unionised. Unite said the offer ""falls far short of the real cost of living challenges which our members are experiencing"". But Rolls-Royce said the offer was ""fair"" and ""a good deal"" for staff. The lump sum, which was intended for junior management and shop floor staff, was due to begin being rolled out in August, starting with the 3,000 non-unionised staff before being paid to the remaining 11,000 unionised workers. Unite's regional secretary Paresh Patel said the union was still in negotiations with Rolls-Royce about the pay offer. News of the offer emerged on Monday night, and was later confirmed by Rolls-Royce. However, Unite said: ""The fact that Rolls-Royce has made this announcement in the way that it has certainly in our view undermines the trade union and the negotiating position that should be between the employer and the unions on this matter."" Rolls-Royce had also offered workers a 4% increase in pay, back-dated to March. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson had told the BBC it would be ""the highest annual pay rise for at least a decade"" for its shop floor staff. But Unite said it would also reject that offer of a 4% pay rise. There are ongoing discussions with unions about a pay settlement for 2022-2023, Rolls-Royce's spokesperson said, and the cost of living issue is to be a factor in those negotiations. In response to Unite's rejection of the offer, the spokesperson said: ""This is a good deal for our colleagues that is fair and competitive, with an immediate cash lump sum to help them through the current exceptional economic climate. ""We will continue to talk to our people."" Why are prices rising so quickly? When might the inflation rate come down? Meanwhile, around 115,000 Royal Mail workers are voting on strike action in a similar row over pay. The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents many Royal Mail staff, said it would be claiming for an ""inflation-based, no-strings pay award"", adding that Royal Mail's offer of a 2% pay award was ""miles away from where inflation is, totally inadequate"". Pay rates and measures to help UK staff have been increasing as businesses have been seeking to recruit and retain staff, after official figures showed there were fewer unemployed people than job vacancies for the first time since records began. Earlier this month,Lloyds Bank staff were offered a Â£1,000 lump sum to help with rising costs, after Unite the Union demonstrated outside its annual general meeting. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - currently stands at 9%, and is expected to increase again later this year. It seems one-off cost of living payments are gaining in popularity among employers - but are they a short-term fix to a long-term issue? The nature of inflation means that while the rate of price rises may slow next year, it is extremely unlikely that the cost of living will actually drop. Prices are almost certainly not going to fall. Yet, these payments are not embedded in future wages, unlike a regular pay increase. As employees continue to find it tough, will there be pressure on bosses to make these payments a permanent part of pay next year and beyond? There is undoubtedly an awareness among businesses that workers, particularly the lower-paid, need more financial help at the moment to cover their bills. But perhaps this eye-catching tactic of one-off payments is directed more at another issue - the retention and recruitment of staff. Rolls-Royce was badly impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic, which hit demand for its aircraft engines as international air travel ground to a halt. In 2020it announced plans to cut its global workforce by 9,000by the end of this year, with 3,000 of those jobs going in the UK. At the time it said it would take ""several years"" for the industry to recover from the pandemic. In the first year of Covid,Rolls-Royce made a loss of Â£4bnbecause of the collapse in air travel, however it returned to profit in 2021. Staff shortages are also putting pressure on firms to raise wages. Earlier this month, Morrisons said it would increase pay for its store workers as UK supermarkets battle for staff in the face of increasing competition in the sector. Rival chains Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have also announced pay rises for their workers this year.

LiveLiveAs it happened: 'We will win' - Union praises rail strikers but fresh talks due12 minutes ago,"The biggest train strike in 30 years has disrupted travel for millions, hit businesses and heightened anxiety for students trying to get to exams The RMT union says turnout at picket lines has been ""fantastic"" and shows ""we will win"" But rail bosses and the RMT now say they will hold fresh talks tomorrow Even if agreement is reached, this is unlikely to avert another strike on Thursday but a deal could halt Saturday's walkout Tens of thousands of rail staff are taking action over pay, redundancies and changes to working practices PM Boris Johnson has called on passengers to ""stay the course"" because proposed reforms are in their interest Some Labour MPs have joined picket lines in support, ignoring calls from party leadership to steer clear London Underground workers have also gone on strike in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses Edited by James Clarke Thanks for joining our live coverage of today's rail strikes. We're closing our coverage now, but here's a recap of the main developments:  Today's updates have been written by Alex Kleiderman, Marita Moloney, Thomas Mackintosh, Lauren Hirst, Catherine Evans, Andrew Humphrey, Craig Hutchison, Aoife Walsh, Sam Hancock and Jennifer McKiernan. The editors were Rob Corp, Nathan Williams, Marie Jackson and James Clarke. We'll be back with coverage of Thursday's strikes - pending the outcome of tomorrow's talks, perhaps...   The rail strike hasn't been all doom and gloom for commuters. That's according to Daniel Schofield, who sent us a picture from Fenchurch Street station in London while waiting for the last train home. ""Commuting has been a dream
today with the empty trains,"" he says. Weâve heard lots of stories today about people whose plans have been in disarray, but what about those who support the workers striking? Michelle Smit, fromSelby, North Yorkshire,told us earlier she was struggling to get to work inLeeds city centre. However, she said that despite her difficult commute, she had some sympathy with the workers on the picket line. ""Sometimes we've got to do what we've got to do."" Michelle Smit says she'll probably end up getting a taxi Electrical engineer Harry Charles, fromLewisham, south-east London,said similar. Despite his normal 10-minute journey to work by train toLondon Bridgetaking 90 minutes, Harry said he supported the action. ""I am with the employees who are striking because their money is not going up and the cost of everything is rising,"" he told the PA news agency. ""The strike has caused a lot of hassle for people but everyone wants be able to eat."" InManchester, Amber Zito, a canine hydrotherapist fromHolmfirth, West Yorkshire,suggested blame for the strike shouldn't be put on workers. ""I blame the government for the strike. I don't blame the people who work for train companies at all,"" she said while stuck at Manchester Piccadilly station. ""They are only trying to do what everyone wants for their job."" Commuters were seen running through stations today to catch the limited trains available Others were less sympathetic. Hospital food supply worker Marie, fromChingford, Essex,told the PA news agency she was forced to walk for 40 minutes fromLiverpool StreettoWaterloothis morning. ""There are loads of people who have worked right through the pandemic, myself included,"" she said. ""We can't go on strike just at the drop of a hat, so I don't have any sympathy."" Britons appeared divided over the strikes, with 37% in favour compared with 45% against, according to a snap YouGov survey. A separate poll of more than 2,300 people, by Savanta ComRes, suggested 58% thought the action was justified. The government maintains the issue must be resolved by the private train operators and the unions. Here is a selection of images from London stations on Tuesday evening, as services operate at a reduced capacity. A passenger runs to catch a train at Waterloo station before train service ends early. A person at an almost deserted Euston station in London this evening. Commuters rush to jump on a train at Waterloo station. Passengers rushing through Clapham Junction station during rush hour on Tuesday evening. The entrance to Westminster Tube station is closed to commuters. Paloma is disabled and trying to get home Andre Rhoden-PaulBBC News The strikes are forcing many passengers to either risk the railways or find an alternative route. Paloma Malia, from Durham, is wondering how easily she'll get back home from Manchester Airport this week. The retired mental health nurse, who is currently on a solo trip to Greece, has had her train home on Thursday cancelled. The 50-year-old, who has scoliosis, says she has since booked another train on the same day, but has been told she'll probably not be able to have wheelchair assistance at the train station because of staffing shortages. Also, there may not be anyone to help Paloma, who is unsteady on her feet, on to the train. ""It's going to be very hard, but I'm hoping that I can ask some kind people to help me,"" she says. Despite the impact on her travels, Paloma supports rail workers taking industrial action. ""The government haven't come to the table. I'm not going to blame the workers for striking,"" she says. The vast majority of train services across the south of England have been cancelled today and usually busy train stations have been deserted. Bournemouth will not see another South Western Railway service until Sunday - in fact, the only services the train operator will provide will be from Southampton to London. Portsmouth, Poole and Weymouth will also have none at all. People who did need to use the railways to travel say the few trains that did run were ""far quieter than usual"" and their journeys were ""challenging"". There are normally 35 trains departing from 06:00 BST that can get you from Reading to Paddington by 09:00 BST - today there were just four. And later in the day trains that were able to run on that line were disrupted and delayed when a person was struck by a train near Slough. Alice (l) is hoping her hen do in Manchester organised by Bethan (r) will go ahead this weekend The rail strike is complicating hen
do plans that Bethan Lewis from Dinas Powys in the Vale of Glamorgan has worked on
for months. She is organising a hen do for 11 to Manchester this weekend and
says the gathering is now up in the air. âWe're now asking people to find more money to potentially drive
up nowâ¦ as well as parking in the city centre which isn't ideal,â she says. Bride-to-be Alice Lally says she's been looking forward to the
weekend as it will be the first time she has gone away since her baby was born in October. ""I'm trying not to think about the worst, but it definitely makes
things a little bit more stressful. I think getting back will be hard
too."" Ricky
Oates has joined RMT workers on picket lines at two stations today, in support of the striking rail workers. âIâm registered as a disabled person,"" he tells the BBC. âI attended both rail picket lines in Bedford and
Milton Keynes this morning to show my support. ""They worked all through Covid and kept the country
running. And didnât really get thanks for it. Theyâre just asking for decent pay. âIt just makes me really upset that the government
has allowed this strike to take place when they could have averted this strike
on day one. âSome of the workers cried today, when I said I
had friends who had missed hospital appointments. âThey said they really donât want to strike but
have got no other option. To me, that really brought home the human side of it."" After a day of cancellations, Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines has warned anyone travelling tomorrow to be mindful of a slow start to the day. He tells the BBC: Tomorrow morning is going to be very heavily affected because the first trains in the morning will not be able to start up because people who'd normally be working the night shift won't be signing on for duty.  It's not all bad, though. Haines says by late morning, ""we'll be running a full service"" and it's expected that will continue throughout the day. ""So, again, disruption but far less disruption than today,"" he adds. Julia McCart from Glengormley,
Belfast, is travelling around the country following Barry Manilow on tour as
part of her 80th birthday celebrations. After seeing the singer perform
in Cardiff on Monday, she was due to travel to Newcastle on Tuesday where she
was set to meet him. The Barry Manilow fan then
planned to travel to a concert in Glasgow on Thursday and go back home to Belfast
on Friday. ""It has caused quite a bit of hassle,"" she says, especially as her flight from Belfast to Bristol was cancelled too, but it was nonetheless worth it."" The American crooner's hits include Could it be Magic, Mandy and Copacabana. ""To me and maybe to all of us fans, he's a great artist, a great showman and musician,"" Julia says. ""I've tried my best to follow him.â You can read more about people whose leisure plans have been affected by the strikes here David HendersonBBC Scotland Business and Transport Correspondent For now, regular commuters may choose to work from home. That may blunt the impact of this strike. But it worries rail bosses, who desperately want to see passenger
numbers return to where they were before the pandemic - from the 70% level we see right now. Rail strikes are
like trains. Wait long enough,
and three come along at the same time. ScotRail services
are already hit hard by industrial action from train drivers. They're set to vote
on a pay deal worth more than 5% in the coming weeks. Thousands of
Scotrail workers are also being offered a similar deal. If these are any
sort of benchmark, signallers will hold out for a more generous deal than the 3%
they're being offered by Network Rail. If that happens, it
could be a long, frustrating year on Scotland's railways. And much now
depends on Network Rail's owner, the UK government, which sets the limits for
any pay deal. Danny SavageNorth of England correspondent One York tea shop said they'd normally expect to be full, but had very few customers On a summer's day, people would normally be pouring out of York station into the city. Itâs arguably the most popular way for visitors to arrive. By lunchtime you could tell the difference. Outside tables which would usually be taken at pubs were empty and staff were commenting there was little tourism trade. Outside the railway station, foreign visitors were queueing for the National Express coach to Leeds or London. They were cutting short their stays by 24 hours to make sure they could get to their flights from Manchester or Heathrow. That meant they werenât spending money in York. York Dungeon was having a bit of a nightmare - rejigging the rota so staff local to the area could work the strike days and those who travel by train cover the days in between. This city can probably cope with a weekday outside of the school holidays like this - but Saturdayâs planned strike will hit York hard. Glastonbury Festival ticket-holders started arriving at Castle Cary Station today Castle Cary station in Somerset has been busier than many others, serving passengers travelling to theGlastonbury Festival. While more than half of the regular trains to Glastonbury have been cancelled due to the strike action, many services are specially-run trains to take ticket holders to the festival. Another music fan, Phil Rice, 49, has been trying to travel home from Liverpool toChippenhamin Wiltshire after attending an Eagles concert at Anfield stadium last night. ""I think I will have to get a train to Stafford, then on to Reading and then from Reading to Chippenham,"" he says. ""When I booked the tickets last week the staff at my local station said they had no concrete evidence the strike would go ahead.""  As train services come to a halt across the UK, rail workers and customers are reminded of the last time journeys dipped significantly - the coronavirus pandemic. The graphic shows how national lockdowns, and the near abandonment of public transport at the time, left train passenger numbers at theirlowest in many years. Back in April 2020, a month after the government announced the UK's first Covid lockdown, rail journeys in Britain were reported to be at about 5% of normal levels. Deserted St Austell railway station on the first of three days of strikes Passengers in the South West
have been heavily impacted by the rail strike, with
no services in Cornwall and a threadbare service in Devon. James Davis, from Great Western
Railway (GWR), says there will be ""no
trains west of Plymouth on strike days"" and ""on non-strike days
significantly reduced services where we are able to operate"". He says: ""In Devon and
Cornwall we are more reliant on Network Rail signallers to be able to move
trains, which is why Devon and Cornwall are more adversely affected than other
parts of our network."" Tamsin Melville, BBC Radio Cornwall politics reporter, says St Austell railway station in
Cornwall, pictured, was ""like tumbleweed"". ""I'm on the platform which
is completely deserted,"" she says. One would-be passenger, Andrew,
turned up to the station expecting trains. ""I thought the strike was
all in London,"" he says. ""I was going to Penzance to
paint somebody's house and now it looks like I won't be going all week."" But he says he
supports the strike. The Sidmouth Literary Festival in Devon, which was due to start tomorrow, has been rescheduled because of the strikes. Jennifer McKiernanBBC London Passengers say it's been ""like lockdown again"" as Tube and rail services are left empty because of today's strikes. Many have switched to cycling but one woman says she was almost knocked off her bike multiple times due to the heavy traffic on the roads. Others walked miles to get to where they needed to be. This video can not be played Navigating London on a day of London Underground and national rail strikes A meeting of
  the Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR) has been told of the impact
  of the UK-wide rail strikes on Scotland. Deputy First
  Minister John Swinney was joined by Transport Secretary
  Michael Matheson and transport minister Jenny Gilruth to hear the latest. Gilruth has already written to the UK government calling for a swift
  resolution to the dispute. The SGoRR has been
  up and running since this morning and will operate  until Sunday
  evening to monitor the impact and co-ordinate ministers' response. Deputy First Minister John Swinney is confident that the mitigations that can be taken are being taken in Scotland. The meeting heard about extra preparedness around major events including theRoyal Highland Show, freight mitigation plans from major retailers to keep supermarkets stocked and wider resilience plans. Speaking after chairing the meeting, Mr Swinney said the lack of action from the UK government was a ""dereliction of duty"" and accused it of deliberately inflaming the situation, causing misery for the travelling public. Seryn's family has forked out Â£500 in hotel bills so she can sit her A-levels Eighteen-year-old Seryn, fromTonbridge, usually gets the train into London to go to school. This week her family have had to pay Â£500 in hotel bills so she can stay in the capital and sit her A-levels. ""If I went to a friend's house that would be the only other option and I didn't want to do that because me and my parents decided that I wouldn't be able to have a good night's sleep before my exam,"" say Seryn. Tourists aren't immune from the travel woes either. Skot Barnett and his fiancÃ© Andy Jalfon from New Zealand are visiting family inEast Grinstead. ""We were just going to use public transport for everything this week, and now it's a massive challenge,"" says Skot. ""We're here for another week and have events planned today in the West End and we are trying to see other family."" Skot Barnett and his fiancÃ© Andy Jalfon, from New Zealand, are visiting family Rail services will continue to be disrupted on Wednesday, even though it's not one of the three planned strike days. There will be reduced train services on many lines tomorrow due to the knock-on effects of today's strike, while the London Underground should return to normal by mid-morning. Here's what you need to know before planning your journey: How many trains will run tomorrow? Only around 60% of the 20,000 normal weekday services will be able to operate. Why are timetables not returning to normal if there's no strike planned? Walkouts by signallers and control room staff who would usually work overnight from Tuesday night into Wednesday morning mean trains will leave depots later than normal, delaying the start of services. What time do trains normally leave depots? Between around 03:00 BST and 04:00 BST. What time do passenger services usually begin? Between around 05:00 BST and 06:00 BST. How will that change tomorrow? Trains can only be taken out of depots when signallers on daytime shifts start work at around 06:00 BST to 6:30 BST and no passenger services will run before 06:30 BST. How long will the start of services be delayed? It is expected to take up to four hours in some locations. How quickly will services gather pace? In London, services will increase quickly as trains do not have to travel long distances from depots to stations but it will take several hours in remote locations. Will services eventually return to normal tomorrow? Network Rail said that ""even during the day the service will stay thinner"" than usual. What about Thursday? It will be a similar picture to today. Around 20% of services will run and just half of lines will be open, only between 07:30 BST and 18:30 BST. Is there any chance strikes planned for Thursday and Saturday will be called off? No negotiations are taking place so passengers are being urged to check with train operators for updates to services. Alice HopkinsReporting from Shepherd's Bush, west London Jamaican artist Shaggy is due to be performing in west London later tonight despite the Tube and rail strikes. The 02 Shepherd's Bush Empire theatre is served by the Central line, Hammersmith & City and Circle lines which are all disrupted. So, I decided to take a bus from central London to see how long it would take to get to the venue. My journey from Regent Street to Shepherd's Bush took longer than normal - the biggest wait was for the bus to arrive. It was a fairly slow crawl out of central London - then near Notting Hill and Lancaster Gate was quite normal, constantly moving and not in gridlock traffic. Staff don't expect people to queue for Shaggy but it is still going ahead as planned they don't intend to cancel it because of the strikes. The advice from 02 Shepherd's Bush Empire theatre staff is for any Shaggy fans planning on attending the concert to check their journeys before they travel. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Disruption for millions on rail strike's first dayThe PM urges the nation to resist high pay rises but the rail union says it is ""leading the way"".","Some passengers faced lengthy journeys on the few rail services that remained Passengers across Britain faced journeys hours longer than usual and surging road traffic at the start of the largest rail strike in decades. The first of three strikes by the RMT union over cuts to jobs, conditions, real-terms pay and pensions left just one in five trains running. Boris Johnson urged the country to ""stay the course"" and resist pay rises in line with soaring inflation. RMT boss Mick Lynch said the union was ""leading the way"" over pay concerns. The RMT and railway employers are due to hold fresh talks on Wednesday aimed at resolving the dispute. But more strikes are scheduled for Thursday and Saturday. About 40,000 members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union working for Network Rail and 13 train operators walked out in the first of the three planned strikes. Half of all lines were closed and much of the country had no rail service at all, including most of Scotland and Wales, the whole of Cornwall and Dorset, and places such as Chester, Hull, Lincoln and Worcester. Which lines are affected by the rail strike? How much are rail workers paid? Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Many stations that are normally crammed with commuters were almost deserted except for union picket lines, as strikes also took place on London Underground lines on Tuesday. Commuters who made it into work by rail faced a dash for their last trains before the network shut down at 18:30 BST. Disruption is set to continue on Wednesday, because the lack of overnight staff is expected to delay the first trains by up to four hours in some places, and only about 60% of normal services are due to run. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""We need to get ready to stay the course"" Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines said by late morning, ""we'll be running a full service"" and it was expected that would continue throughout the day.""So, again, disruption - but far less disruption than today,"" he added. Mr Johnson - speaking at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday - said without modernisation to the industry, train operators risked going bust and passengers faced ever-increasing prices that could lead to them abandoning rail travel. ""I say this to the country as a whole, we need to get ready to stay the course,"" he said. ""Because these reforms, these improvements in the way we run our railways, are in the interests of the travelling public, they will help to cut costs for fare payers."" The prime minister said the strikes were ""so wrong and so unnecessary"", making it ""more difficult for people to get to work, risking people's appointments, making it more difficult for kids to sit exams - all sorts of unnecessary aggravations"". 'My stag do plans are in ruins due to strikes' 'Why I'm losing my wages to go on strike' Should public sector workers get bigger pay rises? Downing Street said the prime minister believed the government had to ""work within our means"" and resist calls for pay rises that would lead to greater inflation later. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%. Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - is currently 9% but the Bank of England forecasts it will reach about 11% in the autumn. Many stations that are normally crowded with commuters were almost deserted This video can not be played Watch: One striking RMT worker says ""enough is enough"" Mr Lynch apologised for the disruption to passengers, but accused the government, which owns Network Rail, of actively preventing employers and the RMT from reaching a settlement. He said members had shown ""outstanding unity"" as the union opposed plans for thousands of job cuts, changed working conditions and reduced pension benefits, along with making its pay demands. Mr Lynch said railway staff were ""leading the way"" for workers who were ""sick and tired of having their pay and conditions slashed"". ""Now is the time to stand up and fight for every single railway worker in this dispute that we will win,"" he said. Marta Kotlarek's sons Jakub and Michal have exams on two of the strike days Marta Kotlarek, from Holywell, Flintshire, says she has had to take time off work to drive her sons to their exams during the rail strike. Jakub, 16, and Michal, 18, usually take the train from Flint to school in Colwyn Bay. But with GCSE and A-level exams on the morning of the strikes on Tuesday and Thursday, they couldn't make the journey this week. ""This is a crucial year for them... they are a little bit worried,"" says Marta. She says there's no point in doing the hour-long round trip twice, so she's waiting around until they finish their exams before driving back to Holywell. As commuters switched from trains to cars to avoid the impact of the strike, some places saw long queues on the roads. Location technology firm TomTom said congestion levels at 11:00 BST were higher than at the same time last week in a number of urban areas. London congestion increased from 38% to 51%, in Cardiff it went up from 24% to 29% and Manchester saw a rise from 27% to 34%. The percentages reflect the additional time needed for journeys compared to free-flowing traffic. Bus stops were crowded as people sought alternative routes There were also long queues on outer London sections of the M1, M4, A4 and A40. But National Highways told the BBC that many parts of the motorway network have been quieter than a normal Tuesday, as employees took advantage of post-pandemic work-from-home policies.

"Disabled fans treated like animals, hearing toldLiverpool supporters accuse the French interior minister of lying about the behaviour of English fans.","French police used tear gas and pepper spray on some supporters at the Champions League final in Paris Disabled Liverpool fans have told an inquiry they were ""treated like animals"" amid the chaotic scenes at the Champions League final in Paris. Supporters have described heavy-handed policing, organisational chaos and overcrowding at the game on 28 May. A disabled supporters' spokesman told the French Senate one wheelchair user had to be lifted over locked gates by fellow fans as she tried to escape. Ted Morris urged the French interior minister to resign over the event. French ministerGÃ©rald Darmanin previously saidonly the English fans posed problems outside the stadium. On Tuesday, Mr Morris, chairman of the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association, gave the French Senate his account of events outside the Paris stadium before the final. The match, which was eventually won by Real Madrid, was delayed when long queues of Liverpool fans built up outside the stadium in Paris. French police used tear gas and pepper spray on some supporters. Liverpool fans described heavy-handed policing, organisational chaos and overcrowding at the final Mr Darmanin said ""massive, industrial-scale"" ticket fraud had caused Liverpool fans to turn up en masse, and said that of about 30 arrests made at the Stade de France ""more than half concerned British citizens"". Mr Morris told the French Senate: ""With my wife, we love France and Paris, but you, Mr Darmanin, you lied and I ask you to withdraw your accusation. ""And if you have the decency to do so, I hope you have the decency to resign."" The French Senate heard about one wheelchair user who was lifted over locked gates by fellow fans as she tried to escape the melee. Another fan, an eight-year-old boy with autism became separated from his father, was later attacked after they had been reunited. Mr Morris said: ""A major catastrophe has been avoided. No power was able to come to the aid of the disabled supporters. ""Disabled fans were treated like animals. ""My wife and I did not care about the game any more at this stage,"" he continued. Chain of failures marred Paris final - inquiry France blames ticket fraud as police row rages Only English fans posed problems - French minister ""We left in the 86th minute and the steward told us we couldn't get out because some locals were still trying to go into the stadium. ""In the underpass - at the exit of the stadium under the gaze of the police, a few minutes later - locals attacked us and it was terrifying, especially for the disabled supporters. ""As we walked towards the station we hoped that the police would intervene. ""It was the worst football experience."" This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris Joe Blott, chair of the Spirit of Shankly supporters' group, accused police of operating on preconceived notions dating back to the 1980s in their handling of English supporters and insisted the use of tear gas on innocent fans was ""not necessary"". Mr Blott also urged the authorities to learn from their mistakes ahead of next year's Rugby World Cup in France and the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. He described the behaviour of Liverpool fans as ""exemplary"". ""We demand an apology and a retraction of the lies being told and for the supporters who will be travelling to the Rugby World Cup and to the Olympics, a fair investigation."" A French government report previously saida chain of failures had marred the event. They included lack of preparation for travelling fans, huge numbers of people without tickets or fake ones, and security failures at the stadium. The report does not apportion blame, but recommends improvements which the government says will be implemented.

Nine in 10 trains cancelled in Scotland,"The normally bustling Queen Street station in Glasgow has been quiet all day Railway stations have been virtually deserted as the first of three 24-hour rail strikes hits services in Scotland. ScotRail has cancelled 90% of its services while cross-border services were also badly affected. About 40,000 Network Rail staff are believed to have walked out at midnight on Tuesday in a dispute over pay, working conditions and redundancies. Last-ditch talks between the RMT union and Network Rail failed on Monday. It is thought thousands of regular passengers chose to work from home rather than attempt to commute on a vastly-reduced service. Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretary, blamed the ""dead hand"" of government for the dispute, saying ministers did not allow employers to negotiate freely. Live: Biggest national rail strike for 30 years begins PM calls for 'compromise' to end rail strike Which ScotRail trains will run during the strike? Major rail strikes to go ahead after talks fail UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said ""outdated unions"" were ""opposing progress"". Scotland's Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth urged the UK government to do more to end the stand-off. Further strikes are scheduled to take place on Thursday and Saturday but services are likely to be delays and cancellations even on non-strike days. ScotRail said there would be ""significant disruption across the country"" on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday caused by the staggered reopening of Network Rail signal boxes. As the first day of strike action unfolded: People were advised to plan ahead and only travel by rail if necessary Businesses said they were already feeling an impact on their takings The Scottish hospitality sector fears it could lose Â£50m in a week First Bus said it would try to run more buses ""where possible"" But the operator said it currently has a shortage of about 300 drivers Businesses in Scotland have been bracing themselves for an impact on their takings as a result of the strike. Leon Thompson, from UK Hospitality Scotland, predicted the sector was set for ""in excess of Â£50m of losses"" this week. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""We're looking at a situation where our fragile businesses are trying to move towards recovery. So it's a very, very difficult week. ""We're talking about businesses which have had two years of restrictions and lockdowns in place, which have severely impacted their ability to trade. ""They are carrying unprecedented levels of debt and they really need to have a good summer. Now this industrial action, which is essentially going to wipe out all business this week, is a real concern."" This is a major strike by any measure. It's the biggest pay dispute on the railways for 30 years. Almost 90% of Scottish services have had to be cancelled. No trains are running outside Scotland's central belt - so there's not a single service for Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness, the north or west coast. Only five ScotRail routes see any trains at all, and even these will be limited. All this underlines the crucial role played by signallers employed by Network Rail, whose strike action has crippled the railways. When they don't work, rail lines grind to a halt. It means disruption for rail passengers. But a fair number we've spoken to voice sympathy for the signallers' pay demand. The cost of living crisis and soaring inflation affect all but a lucky few. So when rail workers demand a pay rise, that chimes with some passengers - even those whose journeys are disrupted. But if the strike action drags on for weeks or months, will they be quite so understanding? For now, regular commuters may choose to work from home. That may blunt the impact of this strike. But it worries rail bosses, who desperately want to see passenger numbers return to where they were before the pandemic - from the 70% level we see right now. ScotRail services are already hit hard by industrial action from train drivers. They are set to vote on a pay deal worth more than 5% in the coming weeks. Thousands of ScotRail workers are also being offered a similar deal. If these are any sort of benchmark, signallers will hold out for a more generous deal than the 3% they are being offered by Network Rail. If that happens, it could be a long, frustrating year on Scotland's railways. And much now depends on Network Rail's owner, the UK government, who set the limits for any pay deal. Richard Muir, deputy chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said a lack of reliable public transport ""has a direct affect on our economy and the businesses that rely on it"". One of Scotland's main bus operators, First Bus, said it was prepared for increased demand on strike days but a shortage of 300 drivers meant its ability to provide extra services would be ""significantly limited"". Its managing director Duncan Cameron told BBC Scotland that despite still not being back to pre-pandemic levels, bus travel ""massively overweighs rail use across the country"", carrying passengers on about 74% of public transport journeys. He said: ""It will be difficult for rail users over the coming days with no rail running, but given those margins we believe we can accommodate those who want to move to bus, and where possible we will introduce additional vehicle capacity to do that."" Only a few people were at the usually packed Central Station in Glasgow National Express said coaches were also in high demand but warned it was not possible for the firm to match the demand of the rail network. ""We do expect and are prepared to be busy but also recommend that customers allow plenty of time when planning their journey,"" a spokesman said. This dispute between the RMT union and the companies which run Britain's railway centres on pay, job losses and changes to workers' terms and conditions. ScotRail staff are not invovled but the train operator, which was nationalised on 1 April, relies on Network Rail workers to operate signal boxes and maintain the track across the UK. The RMT said Network Rail's plans to cut 2,500 jobs would put safety at risk and has warned that strikes could continue over the next six months. Network Rail Scotland spokesman Nick King said: ""We are still keen to reach a resolution with the union, postpone further strike action if we can, but any deal that is done has to be fair on both our workers and on the taxpayer, who ultimately funds Network Rail's operations."" There was a picket line at Glasgow Central Station on Tuesday On Monday, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the House of Commons that rail workers were endangering their livelihoods by taking industrial action. He said the UK government had plans for rail reform and a more ""agile, flexible workforce - not one that strikes every time someone suggests a change to the railways"". Jenny Gilruth, Scotland's cabinet secretary for transport, called on Mr Shapps ""to seek a resolution to this dispute, as quickly as possible, for the benefit of staff and passengers alike"". Gordon Martin, RMT organiser, told BBC Scotland they had been ""forced"" to take strike action. ""This is of the UK government's making,"" he said. ""We have been forced into this as a defensive measure. Our members' jobs and livelihoods are at risk here. ""More importantly, the safety of the rail infrastructure is at risk and safety in railway stations and on trains is at risk.""

Rail strike costs remote hotel 75% of bookings,"This video can not be played Hotelier Scott Meikle says this week's rail strike has been devastating for his business Hospitality bosses reliant on guests using the rail network saythe first 24-hour train strikehas already sparked a flood of cancellations. Scott Meikle owns The Moor of Rannoch Restaurant and Rooms which sits next to Rannoch train station, 40 miles down a single-track road from Pitlochry. He had 24 room bookings this week until news of the strike cut that to six. More cancellations over the summer would be ""devastating"" for business, Mr Meikle said. About 40,000 Network Rail staff have walked out in a dispute over pay, working conditions and redundancies. Mr Meikle told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""With the prospect of trains not being able to run, there is no viable alternative to get to us. ""The West Highland Line is a fantastic scenic route which goes through this vast wilderness of Rannoch Moor and we are right in the centre. So the railways play a huge part in getting our guests to us. Nine in 10 trains cancelled as rail strike begins 'Rail strikes have lost us Â£500,000 of bookings' Live: Biggest national rail strike for 30 years begins ""The cancellations have already started and have been affecting us for the last few days. A lot of our guests are travelling and touring around Scotland and using the train lines is a vital part of their journey. ""That means guests who have been travelling for the last few days now find that they can't travel on - or home - from wherever they have been across Scotland."" About 70% of guests at Rannoch Moor Restaurant and Rooms arrive and leave by train Rail passengers have been warned to expect serious disruption as the first of three 24-hour rail strikes hits services in Scotland. ScotRail has cancelled 90% of its services while cross-border services are also likely to be badly affected. The result has serious financial implications for hotel owners such as Mr Meikle, who normally sees about 70% of his guests arrive and leave by train. ""As soon as there is disruption on the railways, it really does cause a huge problem,"" he said. ""Not just for us, but business across the Highlands and across Scotland. ""We are constantly promoting sustainable and environmentally-friendly travel. But for communities like us, there is no real viable alternative. The railway is a vital part of the infrastructure. ""We open five days a week and we have five rooms, so for this block we had 24 [separate bookings] and at one point we went down to just six rooms. So huge levels of cancellations because guests cannot physically get to us."" Mr Meikle's business sits next to the remote Rannoch railway station in Highland Perthshire The threat of continued disruption is a crippling blow to a sector still trying to recover from the effects of the pandemic. Mr Meikle said: ""Communities like ours, and hospitality in particular, were significantly hit by Covid and various lockdowns. ""There was very little we could during those periods - we can't do a home delivery service or home boxes, it's just not physically possible. ""So the sector across Highland Perthshire and the Highlands was really looking forward to a very busy summer with good bookings, but a lot of that has now been thrown into disarray.""

Woman wins first Covid vaccine death compensationVikki Spit had a year-long wait for compensation after her fiancÃ© died following an AstraZeneca jab.,"Zion's fiancÃ©e said he was healthy and exercised regularly A woman whose partner died after having an AstraZeneca jab has become the first person to receive compensation over a Covid vaccine death. Vikki Spit's former rock singer fiancÃ© Zion, 48, of Alston, Cumbria, fell ill eight days after he had his injection and died in May 2021. She was awarded the maximum settlement of Â£120,000 but said it was not enough. The 38-year-old said she had got into debt after losing Zion's earnings and should have had closer to Â£180,000. Ms Spit also said she had to wait too long for compensation under the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme 1979, and the amount had not kept track with inflation since the scheme was set up. Vaccine damage payments available to anyone who has become disabled as a result of having a vaccination and people can also apply on behalf of someone who has died. The scheme offers one-off, tax-free sums of up to Â£120,000 and while payments do not affect people's rights to take legal action, they can have implications for their benefits. Vikki Spit believes Zion may have lived if he had received treatment earlier Ms Spit called an ambulance for Zion when he began suffering ""excruciating"" headaches on 13 May last year and he died in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary six days later. His death certificate confirmed he died due to complications from the vaccine. However, it took the NHS Business Services Authority, the Newcastle-based administrators of the compensation scheme, until 17 June this year to make the award. Ms Spit is now calling on the government to increase the maximum pay-out to better reflect the loss of earnings that a person in their 40s would have made before their retirement. Is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine safe? She said: ""I am still heartbroken by the sudden loss of my partner of 21 years, and alongside this emotional trauma, I have also been faced with financial hardship as a result of the loss of Zion's contribution to household finances. ""There just isn't the proper financial aid coming from the government to support those who have lost family to the vaccine."" She also said the compensation did not take into account spiralling inflation. Ms Spit, who maintains she is not anti-vaccines, said paramedics deemed Zion was suffering from a migraine when they were called to their home. The writer and filmmaker suffered from a seizure a few days later and during surgery ""didn't wake up."" The couple had be due to get married last year after 21 years together She said Zion was fit and healthy and would have had a good chance of survival if he had received treatment earlier. His donated liver and kidneys helped save the lives of three people. James Bell, medical negligence partner at Hodge Jones and Allen, said: ""While I am glad that Vikki has been able to receive some restitution for the hardship she has faced as a result of Zion's death, the scheme simply isn't fit for purpose. ""Not only has the application process been lengthy and inefficient, but the compensation Vikki received fails to reflect and remediate the full economic impact of her fiancÃ©'s death.""

EasyJet Spain cabin crew set to strike in July,"Unions have called for EasyJet cabin crew based in Spain to strike for nine days in July as part of a dispute over pay. The walk-out would add to passenger woes as airlines struggle to cope with demand after Covid restrictions lifted. EasyJet has already had to cancel thousands of flights this summer because of staff shortages at Gatwick. Meanwhile, Heathrow Airport isstill clearing piles of baggage which led to 5,000 flight cancellationson Monday. EasyJet and Spanish union USO have been holding talks on cabin crew pay since February, but are now in a ""deadlock situation"", the union said. It has called a series of 24-hour strikes,externalthroughout July which could affect British holidaymakers. Union members working from El Prat in Barcelona, Malaga and Palma de Mallorca will walk out from 1-3 July, 15-17 July and 29-31 July, the union said. Are you concerned about your summer holiday? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Miguel Galan, USO general secretary for EasyJet Malaga, said flight attendants want a 40% increase in their basic salaries. He said that Spanish cabin crew pay is not on a par with their French or German counterparts. EasyJet's Spanish crew get basic pay of â¬950 per month (Â£816), the union said, which excludes bonuses and extra pay. The BBC understands that basic pay typically makes up 60% of EasyJet workers' salaries, with the remaining 40% dependent on factors including how many flights the crew work. The USO union, which says it represents 80% of the 450 EasyJet staff based in Spain, still hopes an agreement can be reached to avoid the strikes during a meeting with management on Tuesday, Mr Galan said. According to the European Trade Union Institute,striking is a fundamental right in Spain,external, and strikes affecting one company can be called by unions, worker representatives or workers themselves. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Why are so many flights being cancelled? EasyJet said it pays cabin crew ""competitive"" rates, and it was ""extremely disappointed"" about the call to strike action. ""Should the industrial action go ahead there could be some disruption to our flying programme to and from Malaga, Palma and Barcelona during the strike period,"" the budget airline said. ""But at this stage, EasyJet plans to operate its full schedule and we would like to reassure customers that we will do everything possible to minimise any disruption."" UK holidaymakers have faced flight cancellations and delays in recent months as airlines and airports struggle to cope with increased demand after cutting workers during Covid lockdowns. On Monday EasyJet said it would cancel flights between July and September after Gatwick Airport said it will reduce the number of flights during the peak summer period due to staff shortages. Also on Monday around 30 flights carrying up to 5,000 passengers were cancelled at Heathrow Airport due to baggage-handling problems. On Tuesday Heathrow said the backlog, which the BBC understands numbers thousands of bags, was ""clearing up"". The baggage system has been ""back up and working"" since the weekend, a spokeswoman said, adding that ""bags are being sent to their destinations"". Meanwhile, the Department for Transport (DfT) said legislation had been put before Parliament to allow a one-off amnesty on airport slots rules. Slots allow airlines to land planes, use the airport infrastructure, and then take off again. Airlines normally need to use slots a certain number of times per season to be able to keep them but the government said it would allow airlines to hand back summer slots they do not think they can use. The DfT said the change would help prevent last-minute cancellations, while Airlines UK, which represents the industry, said it would ""help build greater resilience into operations this summer"". Chief executive Tim Alderslade said airlines would ""continue to work with ministers and the whole aviation eco-system to ensure the summer peak runs as smoothly as possible for our passengers"". 5,000 people hit by Heathrow flight cancellations Gatwick cuts summer flights after staff shortages Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs What happens if TikTok is banned?

UN sexual abuse claims 'must be investigated'Some staff who tried to expose alleged abuse and wrongdoing say they were penalised or even sacked.,"Purna Sen: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it?'"" Claims of sexual abuse and corruption at the United Nations should urgently be investigated by an independent panel, an ex-senior UN member has said. Purna Sen's comments follow a BBC investigation which revealed the sackings of a number of UN staff who tried to expose alleged wrongdoing. Ms Sen said the UN should ""step up"" and adopt any suggestions made by a panel. A spokesperson for the UN told the BBC it was focused on ensuring that people felt safe to report abuse. The BBC documentary,The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN, details allegations of corruption, management turning a blind eye to wrongdoing and sexual abuse. Staff members who tried to report allegations told the BBC they had been penalised after speaking out - and some were sacked. In the film, Ms Sen - who was appointed spokeswoman on harassment, assault and discrimination in 2018 - said there were women at the UN who had been ""approached, accosted and raped"". The more men were allowed to get away with it, she said, ""the more they will keep doing it"". She has told BBC Newsnight that she is not surprised by the ""deeply upsetting"" testimonies. ""It suggests that sometimes the protection of the senior folk within each organisation matters more than the absence of harm to those who aren't powerful. ""It means there is a real tension within an organisation which not only upholds and advocates for human rights, but is actually the birthplace of most of these human rights - yet it hasn't learned to bring them home to the people who work for that organisation."" Ms Sen said she wanted UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres to appoint a diverse external panel to consider staff experiences and recommend a focused set of actions. In a statement, Mr Guterres' office said it remained open to any external review of its efforts ""to combat misconduct of any kind"". The spokesman for the UN Secretary General, Stephane Dujarric, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the secretary general had ""taken this extremely seriously since he came into office"". ""We continue to do whatever we can to support victims and are focused on improving the systems and ensuring that people feel safe to report abuse,"" he added. When asked about external oversight, Mr Dujarric said: ""There is full transparency and we have an internal independent body that reports to the member states of the UN General Assembly."" ""We are not afraid of any scrutiny,"" he said, adding that ""we are doing whatever we can to break this climate of fear"". The United Nations has a protected legal status and senior staff have diplomatic immunity from all national laws. This is granted to the organisation to protect it from interference when doing its work. But the UN says it not granted for the personal benefit of staff, so does not protect those who commit crimes such as sexual assault. UN headquarters in New York, 2021 All staff complaints have to be addressed internally. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) handles the most serious allegations, including claims of criminality, but has no legal authority. The BBC was handed a secret recording which suggests the OIOS is not always effective. It features Ben Swanson, director of the investigations division, addressing a staff meeting. He says a senior UN female member of staff had come to him in tears, describing how an assistant secretary general had put his hand down her trousers. The UN has a number of assistant secretary generals. In the recording, Mr Swanson states that he told the secretary general and other senior officials of the sexual assault allegation - but was quickly shut down. ""So I tried to tell this story and I got... I was cut dead,""he can be heard saying. He added that the woman was discouraged from reporting her alleged assault and told it wouldn't do any good to speak up since the man in question was a ""favoured son"". ""I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top,"" says Peter Gallo Peter Gallo - the whistleblower who shared the audio recording - told the documentary: ""I spent four years as an investigator in the UN headquarters in New York. And as a result of that experience, I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top."" After hearing his account, Ms Sen said: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it? My zero-tolerance policy means we have to act.' Instead we get an account of 'No, we're not going there.'"" The office of the UN Secretary General says it remains committed to ""sanctioning any staff, junior or senior, found to have engaged in sexual harassment"". Martina Bostrom, a former senior advisor for UNAIDS, told the BBC she was also a victim of sexual harassment at work. ""Sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment in the UN happens in headquarters, it happens Monday to Friday. It happens during regular work hours, it happens everywhere,"" she said. Martina Brostrom: ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go"" She said she was targeted by Luiz Loures, UNAIDS deputy executive director and an assistant secretary general, who she described as being ""sleazy"" and known for his inappropriate behaviour. During a work event in Bangkok in 2015, she said he forcibly kissed and groped her in a lift as they left a meeting, before trying to drag her towards his room. ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go. I had to block myself with the elevator door to be able to stay in because I was afraid I was seeing that long corridor,"" she said. ""My brain was obviously working very, very, quickly and dreading what could happen."" Martina launched a formal complaint and spoke to UN investigators. The UN and UNAIDS ""retaliated in very mean and hurtful ways,"" she said. ""That's very painful because it's almost like being violated all over again. It's like they don't give you a chance to breathe."" In 2018, Luiz Loures retired from the UN and was thanked for ""his 22 years of dedicated service"". He told the BBC: ""I have never harassed nor assaulted anyone. The accusations made are unfounded."" The UN said: ""Allegations of harassment against Dr Loures were investigated,"" but at this time it was ""not in a position to comment on the veracity of these claims"". In August 2021 Martina received a letter from the UN that accepted that she was ""sexually harassed over a protracted period of time"" but, in regard to the allegation she was sexually assaulted in 2015, they concluded ""something traumatic happened to you consistent with your account of the situation"", but the findings ""did not meet the evidentiary standards"". Watch now on BBC iPlayer:The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN- or at 21:00 on Tuesday 21 June on BBC Two. Ms Sen said Martina's case was symptomatic of a wider problem at the UN. She told the documentary that an ""astonishing"" third of UN staff said they had experienced sexual harassment while working, but that the vast majority of cases had not been reported. ""What we do know about cases is just the tip of the iceberg and, this is a really important point, people feel there will be adverse consequences for reporting, they will be retaliated against. ""If I had been attacked or sexually assaulted, I would likely not have reported it. I would not put myself through that process."" UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres In a statement, the office of UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said there had been ""major improvements to fighting the scourge of sexual harassment, from which no organisation is immune"". It said measures included hiring female investigators to look into allegations, a hotline for staff to report misconduct and better training of senior management. But, speaking to BBC Newsnight, Ms Sen said accounts in the documentary suggested the UN had not fulfilled its promises of zero-tolerance and had ""a lot further to go"". ""Whether it's corruption, fraud, sexual harassment, [UN staff] feel they can't progress even to making a report, that the complaints are initially dismissed far too early. They're not given alternative procedures and appeals access,"" she said. ""The UN has certainly addressed some of the big failures it had before, but it hasn't gone far enough. I have seen things that are very troubling - that can and should be addressed as a matter of urgency, not just in words, but in deeds.""

Macron rejects prime minister's offer to resign,"The ÃlysÃ©e palace said Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne's offer to resign was rejected by President Macron on Tuesday French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected a resignation offer from the prime minister he appointed, saying instead that the government must ""stay on task and act"". Elisabeth Borne was criticised by some commentators after Mr Macron's coalition lost its majority on Sunday. Her future looked under threat after the result, which left the president needing to secure support from rivals. He is set to meet his political opponents for rare talks on Tuesday. But neither Marine Le Pen's far-right nor Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon's left-green alliance are keen to work with Mr Macron's centrist government, which is 44 seats shy of a majority and desperately trying to avoid political paralysis. The ÃlysÃ©e palace said Ms Borne formally offered to resign on Tuesday morning, submitting a letter to Mr Macron - the head of state - who turned it down. Mr Macron refused the offer ""so that the government can remain on task and act"", the ÃlysÃ©e palace said, adding that he would seek ""constructive solutions"" to ending the deadlock that threatens his agenda during his second term. It is customary for the French prime minister to offer to resign following parliamentary elections. Often, the president will simply reappoint the same person so that he or she can begin constructing a new government. But the situation is different this time, as Mr Macron is telling Ms Borne to stay in office with the same cabinet without resigning. It is probably an effort to buy time, analysts suggest, adding that at some point, a new government will be formed which may or may not have Ms Borne at its head. France's far right and left both make breakthroughs What now for Macron after poll setback? Meanwhile, party representatives will visit the ÃlysÃ©e Palace for high-level talks on Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts say the president may be eyeing a deal with the right-wing Republicans. The party confirmed that its leader, Christian Jacob, would attend the talks. But prospects of a deal appeared dim in the run-up to the talks, as Mr Jacob hit out at Mr Macron in an interview with France Inter radio. ""He's the one who's been arrogant and now he calls for help,"" he said. ""We are very clear on our stance, we are in the opposition to Emmanuel Macron and will remain there,"" he added. Ms Le Pen will take part but Mr MÃ©lenchon will not, the AFP news agency reports. Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure and Communist Party boss Fabien Roussel, members of the Nupes left-wing alliance, will also meet Mr Macron. Having no clear majority in the National Assembly is likely to make it far harder for Mr Macron to implement his agenda during his second five-year term. He has laid out a series of plans to tackle the spiralling cost of living, including food vouchers and enhanced benefits. Another big reform is gradually raising the retirement age from 62 to 65, which has proved unpopular with much of the electorate. Opponents from the right and left aim to resist the president's programme of reforms, although Ms Le Pen's National Rally has said it may back measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis if their own proposals are adopted.

Fifth of neurologist's patients misdiagnosed,"Dr Michael Watt worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital as a neurologist Almost 20% of patients seen by neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt were given a wrong diagnosis, a report has found. A review of 927 of Dr Watt's high-risk patients found 181 people received a diagnosis described as ""not secure"", Health Minister Robin Swann said. He was speaking as the Belfast Trust announced the recall of a further 209 neurology patients seen and discharged by Dr Watt between 1996 and 2012. This is the third such recall. Dr Watt was at the centre of Northern Ireland'sbiggest patient recalllinked to his work at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital. Mr Swann said he had met patients and families affected by the recall in October last year. ""While this report is statistical in nature, it deals with individuals, their families and their experiences,"" he said. ""I know that many will have had their confidence in our health service shaken and I remain committed to helping restore it."" Mr Swann ""unreservedly apologised"" to those patients who have been affected. ""I also want to acknowledge that in announcing a further recall, more patients will be affected,"" he said. ""It is deeply regrettable that this experience should happen to any of our patients and it is even more so when I consider the total number of patients involved."" In May 2018, the Belfast Trust recalled 2,500 patients for review after concerns were raised about the clinical work carried out by Dr Watt. This was followed by a further 1,044 patients who were recalled in November 2018. The RQIA regulatory body is also conducting a review into patient deaths. An independent inquiry was elevated to a statutory public inquiry late last year but has yet to start hearing evidence. Those affected by this latest recall were seen and discharged between 1996, when Dr Watt began his career, and 2012 and who are taking certain prescribed medications for specific neurological conditions. The Belfast Trust said those affected would have received a letter asking them to set up a telephone review to ascertain whether the medication is appropriate for their condition. Extra clinics have been set up to facilitate face-to-face interviews where necessary. Belfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack said she was ""truly sorry"" over the further recall. ""I absolutely understand that this will cause worry and anxiety to a number of people and their families and I am deeply sorry for that,"" she said. ""I also accept this next stage may be very difficult for those patients who have already been reviewed and whose diagnoses may have been changed as a result of our two previous recalls. ""Again, I want to express the trust's sincere regret for all the hurt and pain caused over the last number of years and for the harm that has undoubtedly been done. ""It is absolutely imperative that we put right any past wrongs and while this is painful, it is vital we assure ourselves that former patients, now discharged and who are taking very specific medication, are taking it for the correct reasons."" Neurologist Watt no longer Belfast Trust employee Neurology inquiry concerns not unique, says chair Ulster Independent Clinic and Hillsborough Private Clinic are recalling 57 and 10 former patients respectively. Separately, the trust also reviewed case notes of 66 patients who had a blood patch procedure under the care of Dr Watt and who did not have a clinical review as part of the recall process. It found that for 45 patients there was no clinical evidence to support that a blood patch was required. And, for 46 patients the care was unsatisfactory and fell below the standard expected by the trust. ""We are deeply sorry for this and for the undue hurt these patients experienced,"" the trust added. Colm Gildernew, who chairs the health scrutiny committee at Stormont. described it as a scandal that has caused immense distress. ""The neurology inquiry has revealed again more examples of a lack of transparency, deficits in governance arrangements and accountability within the health service,"" he said. The Sinn FÃ©in assembly member asked what lessons had been learned? Meanwhile DUP assembly member Pam Cameron, deputy chair of the committee, asked about a timetable and scale of resource for financial redress for those entitled to compensation. Mr Swann could not provide a definitive date but added: ""Redress payments will be paid because this is a failure of our systems that has to be corrected."" Neurology inquiry concerns not unique, says chair Neurologist Watt no longer Belfast Trust employee Neurology patient recall report published Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs What happens if TikTok is banned?

Brewdog approached Heineken about partial sale,"James Watt has said his aim is to float the company on the stock market Brewdog's CEO James Watt was involved in preliminary discussions about a potential sale of part of the firm to rivals Heineken, the BBC has learned. Leaked emails from 2018 reveal he told Heineken he was ""open to being more pragmatic in our views on independence"". He previously criticised craft brewers for ""selling out"" to bigger companies. Brewdog said the BBC's reporting had demonstrated ""vindictive scrutiny and malicious criticism"" of the beer firm. The beer company has not directly responded to the new disclosures. The BBC understands the Heineken discussions did not progress beyond the preliminary stage. Brewdog chief accused of inappropriate behaviour Brewdog flouted US laws over beer imports Brewdog boss sorry for staff 'pain' as vows review The Ellon-based company has trailblazed a crowdfunding model since it was launched in Fraserburgh in 2007 by Mr Watt and co-founder Martin Dickie. More than Â£100m has been raised by around 200,000 ""equity punks"", or shareholders. In January 2022, a BBC Disclosure programme,The Truth About Brewdog, detailed claims of a toxic workplace and inappropriate behaviour by the CEO. Mr Watt denied behaving inappropriately and apologised to anyone who has felt uncomfortable because of his behaviour. Brewdog has submitted a complaint about the programme to the broadcasting regulator, Ofcom. The new BBC Scotland six-part podcast, Good Ship Brewdog, is nowavailable on BBC Sounds. It features claims that: Heineken walked away because Brewdog's valuation of the company was ""outrageous"" TSG, Brewdog's US private equity partner, believed Mr Watt's valuation goal of the company was ""not realistic"" Contributors to the BBC Disclosure documentary felt intimidated by legal threats and people they suspected were private investigators The HR company Wiser, which carried out Brewdog's culture review, broke its promise to keep a former employee's interview anonymous Mr Watt has consistently said his aim is to float the company on the stock market, also known as an initial public offering (IPO). The BBC understands that in late 2018, investment bankers representing Brewdog approached Heineken, the world's second biggest brewer, to discuss an alternative to IPO - the possibility of selling a stake to Heineken. Documents show that Mr Watt met senior Heineken representatives, and later wrote to the then European president of Heineken, Stefan Orlowski. Mr Watt told him that Brewdog was ""open to exploring potential strategic partnerships"" if it could be ""better for the long-term of our business than an IPO"". Mr Watt also told Mr Orlowski that Brewdog was ""open to being more pragmatic in our views on independence"". Mr Watt had previously been highly critical of other craft brewers who had sold stakes to Heineken. Accusing them of ""selling out"", he announced BrewDog would no longer stock Lagunitas or Beavertown after they sold stakes to Heineken in 2015 and 2018 respectively. The BBC has previously revealed that Mr Watt had purchased about Â£500,000 worth of shares in the Dutch beer giant in 2017. Mr Watt has said he no longer holds the shares and only bought them to help with negotiations about a potential distribution deal with Heineken, which fell through. A source close to the discussions in 2018 told the BBC that Heineken walked away before negotiations properly got under way because the valuation BrewDog had put on the company was ""outrageous"". The source said: ""It was so outrageous, in his price idea, that we said well this is going nowhere. The guy [James Watt] doesn't know what he's talking about."" Brewdog did not respond to questions about this. Heineken declined to comment. Brewdog was founded by Martin Dickie (left) and James Watt The leaked documents also appear to give some insight into past internal tensions with Brewdog's funding partner. US private equity giant TSG bought a 22% stake in the company in 2017, with Mr Watt and his co-founder Mr Dickie making nearly Â£100m between them in the deal. TSG took two seats on the Brewdog board as a result. Documents from around late 2018 show that TSG seemed to be unhappy with aspects of how the company was being run. TSG appeared to suggest a recent board meeting had been a ""low point"" and was ""sloppy, free ranging"" with ""no discussion on real business topics"". TSG appeared to be worried about a shortfall of earnings. The documents also suggest TSG believed Mr Watt was ""spending aggressively"", that he was ""desperately trying to create growth stories in order to reach an unattainable valuation"", and that his valuation goal was ""not realistic"". Brewdog recently said that a manager of Goldman Sachs valued the company at more than Â£1.8bn. TSG declined to comment. BrewDog did not respond to questions about this. Rob McKay said private investigators visited one of his former colleagues The BBC Disclosure programme The Truth About Brewdog was broadcast in January 2022. A number of the former BrewDog staff who featured in the programme have told the new podcast that they have felt threatened or intimidated since. Former Brewdog worker Rob McKay said private investigators from a company called Integritas, who said they were working for James Watt, visited a former colleague of his in an attempt, he says, ""to dig dirt"". He said: ""My experience was that someone who worked with me in the past got in touch to say that private investigators had approached them and asked about their working relationship with me. ""They had been given information that as a manager that I was bad to work for, that I was responsible for a toxic workplace, which I know that not to be the case."" Rob said he found it ""unsettling"" and added: ""You'd be thinking well if that's what they're doing now what can it be next? ""Who are they speaking to now? Where are they going to pop up next?"" Several of the ex-Brewdog USA workers who featured in the programme were either visited or contacted by a couple calling themselves Joe and Anna, whom they suspected to be private investigators.  The pair had obtained work and home addresses as well as telephone numbers. The couple had said they were working for an unnamed potential ""third party investor"" and had wanted to speak to them about their experience. They had refused to give surnames, and told some they should get in touch if they wanted to ""financially hurt"" Mr Watt. Dylan Gray, a former bar manager, told the BBC in January that he would schedule certain female staff so they would not be working when Mr Watt was visiting, and schedule more men at nights to ensure female staff were not left alone. Dylan's claims have been strongly contested by Mr Watt. His lawyer told the BBC that a detailed analysis of staff schedules and payroll record proved Mr Gray's claims were false. He was messaged and visited at his workplace by Anna but was immediately suspicious. Dylan Gray suspected he had been visited by private investigators. He said: ""I mean it definitely put me on edgeâ¦"" He said they came to the office of his new employer and added it was as if ""they were trying to interrogate me. And then the fact that they were going to other co-worker's homes, asking them questions, again [it] made me a little bit unsettled."" Dylan Gray said he suspected the pair were private investigators. He said: ""I just think that they were trying to figure out what we ultimately knew, if we were holding backâ¦ or not telling the truth basically."" Six other contributors to the film, including current Brewdog employee Kayla McGuire, were visited by the couple. Kayla says they told her they were tourists. The BBC contacted Joe and Anna, but they refused to say who they worked for. They declined to confirm or deny they were working for Brewdog. Shortly after the BBC contacted them, their mobile phone number was disconnected. The BBC has been unable to verify who Joe and Anna were working for. Brewdog did not respond to questions about this. Dylan has also has received legal letters from lawyers representing Brewdog, accusing him of lying and demanding he retracts his testimony. He stands by his account, but says he feels bullied by Brewdog. He added: ""Being bullied by someone who has a lot more power than me, it's concerning. I did want to speak up but it is scary sometimes to think about you're going against someone who's worth millions of dollars. It's not something people do every day."" In June 2021 a group of former employees calling themselves Punk With Purpose wrote an open letter to Brewdog, accusing Mr Watt of presiding over a toxic culture of fear. Part of Brewdog's response to this was to commission an independent review by the London HR firm Wiser, which published in December 2021. The Wiser Report, the company says, was a ""detailed and comprehensive"" review that presents a ""radically different  picture"" to the one painted by the people the BBC spoke to for its investigation. Brewdog referenced the report many times in its correspondence with the BBC as evidence that its culture problems were behind it. Charlotte Cook had been given a guarantee of anonymity Former Brewdog brewer Charlotte Cook, who claims she suffered misogynistic abuse when working there, had been singled out by Mr Watt and Brewdog for criticism after the documentary. They accused her of having an ""extreme and documented antipathy"" towards the CEO. She spoke to the Wiser review, and said she had believed her interview had gone well. Wiser had given all participants a written guarantee of anonymity. Later, Charlotte submitted a data protection request to Wiser, who were obliged to provide all the information they held about her. This included an extract of an email, which appeared to be from Wiser to Brewdog on the day of her interview. The extract named Charlotte and provided a summary of the interview. The documents suggest Wiser was communicating directly with Brewdog before and after her interview, despite the promise of anonymity. Charlotte said: ""I think it's one of the grossest betrayals of trust that you could possibly do. I engaged with that in good faith and, you know, it appears that they just had absolutely no intention of keeping it anonymous at all."" Neither Wiser or Brewdog responded to the BBC's questions about this. Brewdog did provide a statement, in which it said: ""The BBC's relentless vindictive scrutiny and malicious criticism of Brewdog is utterly disproportionate. ""It beggars belief the BBC would repeat the same false allegations that are subject to an ongoing Ofcom complaint. ""The BBC has demonstrated it will simply ignore any response we may choose to give, in clear breach of its charter obligations. ""This is not responsible journalism. It is perfectly obvious that the BBC is being misled and is choosing to rely on a handful of individuals involved in a concerted campaign to do our business and its founder damage."" Mr Watt has retained the support of the Brewdog board. In May, the CEO announced he was givinga fifth of his personal stake in the companyto staff and that 50% of bar profits would be shared among team members.

Food bills are set to soar by Â£380 this year,"The average annual grocery bill in the UK is set to rise by Â£380 this year, according to research firm Kantar. That means shoppers could be paying on average an extra Â£32 a month for food and other groceries. Back in April, the firm predicted the cost of the average annual supermarket shop would go up by Â£271 in 2022. The upward revision shows ""just how sharp price increases have been recently and the impact inflation is having on the sector"", said Kantar. The survey also showed grocery prices rose by 8.3% over the past four weeks, the highest rate in 13 years. ""The inflation number makes for difficult reading and shoppers will be watching budgets closely as the cost-of-living crisis takes its toll,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Official figures for April showed overall inflation - the increase in prices over time - was running at  9% a year in the UK - the highest rate for 40 years. The Bank of England has warned inflation might exceed 11% later this year as the prices of fuel and food put pressure on household budgets. The latest inflation figures for May are due to be published on Wednesday. Why are prices rising so quickly? Warning food prices to rise quickly over summer UK interest rates hit highest level for 13 years Overall supermarket sales are declining, down by 1.9% in the 12 weeks to the 12 June - the smallest fall since October 2021. Mr McKevitt said: ""The sector hasn't been in growth since April 2021 as it measures up against the record sales seen during the pandemic. However, these latest numbers show the market is to an extent returning to pre-Covid norms as we begin comparisons with post-lockdown times."" Kantar said that online sales have continued to fall as lockdown restrictions eased, recording the 12th consecutive monthly fall to leave digital orders down nearly 9% in June. It said this could be the result of people looking to further cut costs by "" avoiding delivery charges"" though it added that the recent good weather may be encouraging more people to take a trip to the supermarket. Value ranges The researchers also found shoppers are switching from branded items, sales of which are down by 1%, to supermarkets' own-label products. ""Sales of these lines, which are often cheaper, have risen by 2.9%, boosted by Aldi and Lidl's strong performances, both of whom have extensive own-label repertoires,"" said Mr McKevitt. ""We can also see consumers turning to value ranges, such as Asda Smart Price, Co-op Honest Value and Sainsbury's Imperfectly Tasty, to save money and together all value own-label lines grew by 12%."" Lidl was the fastest growing supermarket over the 12 weeks with sales up by 9.5%: Morrisons saw the biggest fall with sales down by 7.2%. One bright spot was the jump in spending in the week leading up to the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations at the beginning of June. Alcohol and ice cream sales rose by about a third compared with the 2022 average. Kantar said many people madethe official Jubilee pudding, the lemon Swiss roll and Amaretti trifle,which pushed up sales of lemon curd by 16%, fresh cream by 58%, Swiss rolls by 18% and custard by 9%.

Easyjet Spain cabin crew set to strike in July,"Unions have called for EasyJet cabin crew based in Spain to strike for nine days in July as part of a dispute over pay. The walk-out would add to passenger woes as airlines struggle to cope with demand after Covid restrictions lifted. EasyJet has already had to cancel thousands of flights this summer because of staff shortages at Gatwick. Meanwhile, Heathrow Airport isstill clearing piles of baggage which led to 5,000 flight cancellationson Monday. EasyJet and Spanish union USO have been holding talks on cabin crew pay since February, but are now in a ""deadlock situation"", the union said. It has called a series of 24-hour strikes,externalthroughout July which could affect British holidaymakers. Union members working from El Prat in Barcelona, Malaga and Palma de Mallorca will walk out from 1-3 July, 15-17 July and 29-31 July, the union said. Are you concerned about your summer holiday? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Miguel Galan, USO general secretary for EasyJet Malaga, said flight attendants want a 40% increase in their basic salaries. He said that Spanish cabin crew pay is not on a par with their French or German counterparts. EasyJet's Spanish crew get basic pay of â¬950 per month (Â£816), the union said, which excludes bonuses and extra pay. The BBC understands that basic pay typically makes up 60% of EasyJet workers' salaries, with the remaining 40% dependent on factors including how many flights the crew work. The USO union, which says it represents 80% of the 450 EasyJet staff based in Spain, still hopes an agreement can be reached to avoid the strikes during a meeting with management on Tuesday, Mr Galan said. According to the European Trade Union Institute,striking is a fundamental right in Spain,external, and strikes affecting one company can be called by unions, worker representatives or workers themselves. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Why are so many flights being cancelled? EasyJet said it pays cabin crew ""competitive"" rates, and it was ""extremely disappointed"" about the call to strike action. ""Should the industrial action go ahead there could be some disruption to our flying programme to and from Malaga, Palma and Barcelona during the strike period,"" the budget airline said. ""But at this stage, EasyJet plans to operate its full schedule and we would like to reassure customers that we will do everything possible to minimise any disruption."" UK holidaymakers have faced flight cancellations and delays in recent months as airlines and airports struggle to cope with increased demand after cutting workers during Covid lockdowns. On Monday EasyJet said it would cancel flights between July and September after Gatwick Airport said it will reduce the number of flights during the peak summer period due to staff shortages. Also on Monday around 30 flights carrying up to 5,000 passengers were cancelled at Heathrow Airport due to baggage-handling problems. On Tuesday Heathrow said the backlog, which the BBC understands numbers thousands of bags, was ""clearing up"". The baggage system has been ""back up and working"" since the weekend, a spokeswoman said, adding that ""bags are being sent to their destinations"". Meanwhile, the Department for Transport (DfT) said legislation had been put before Parliament to allow a one-off amnesty on airport slots rules. Slots allow airlines to land planes, use the airport infrastructure, and then take off again. Airlines normally need to use slots a certain number of times per season to be able to keep them but the government said it would allow airlines to hand back summer slots they do not think they can use. The DfT said the change would help prevent last-minute cancellations, while Airlines UK, which represents the industry, said it would ""help build greater resilience into operations this summer"". Chief executive Tim Alderslade said airlines would ""continue to work with ministers and the whole aviation eco-system to ensure the summer peak runs as smoothly as possible for our passengers"". 5,000 people hit by Heathrow flight cancellations Gatwick cuts summer flights after staff shortages Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs What happens if TikTok is banned?

One person in hospital after tower block blaze,"Smoke damage at Queensdale Crescent A tower block fire in west London, less than a mile (1.6km) from Grenfell Tower, was started by an electric bike battery malfunctioning as it charged. Resident Liiban Shakat feared he was ""going to die"" when his friend woke him and led him to a guest bedroom engulfed in flames on the 12th floor. He described how his friend's ""mouth was black because he inhaled so much smoke"" and needed hospital treatment. About 60 firefighters were sent to the Shepherd's Bush fire at 09:23 BST. London Ambulance Service confirmed paramedics assessed two more people at the scene in Queensdale Crescent. The scorched windows of Mr Shakat's home at the Stebbing House flats, less than a mile (1.6km) from Grenfell Tower where a fire claimed 72 lives in 2017, can clearly be seen. About 30 residents evacuated the building before the fire service arrived Mr Shakat, 38, said the fire started in his guest bedroom where his friend, who was staying for several days, had been charging an e-bike battery. Speaking to reporters outside the building and still wearing his macawis, a traditional Somali style of pyjamas, he said: ""[My friend] was in the room that caught on fire. He was in the bed. His mouth was black because he inhaled so much smoke."" The friend woke Mr Shakat and led him to the fire and, half-awake, he rushed to pour a bucket of water over the burning debris, which Mr Shakat said had made the fire worse. ""Something was coming from the bike, smoke, so he unplugged it. Now the debris, the plastic, the fire caught the whole place, the windows the bed,"" Mr Shakat, who had lived in the building for 20 years, said through a translator. Allow Twitter content?

He ran to try and escape the building and alert his neighbours by knocking on nearby doors on the 12th floor, and at least 30 residents fled the building as plumes of black smoke were seen billowing out of windows. Mr Shakat claimed no fire alarm had sounded but a spokesman for the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (LBHF), which manages the building, said the fire alarm in his flat definitely did work but Mr Shakat did not hear it because he was outside the building. The spokesman added the flats had all been fitted with the ""highest-rated fire doors on the market"" and ""compartmentalisation worked"" in keeping the fire contained to one flat. The block contains 180 flats, he added, and there were six residents with Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (Peeps) who were helped to safety by firefighters. Jonathan Stone, the council's building safety manager, said fire safety measures taken by the local authorities had ""prevented another Grenfell"". The scorched windows of the flat can clearly be seen An LFB spokesman said 30 residents had left the block before LFB arrived, but added ""generally"" it was ""safer to remain in your flat"" because ""we don't want people necessarily going into smoke-filed corridors"". Station commander David Bracewell, who was at the scene, said: ""Three people from the affected flat left before the brigade arrived. A number of other residents evacuated the building. Firefighters led six residents to safety via an internal staircase."" An LFB spokesperson said the fire was under control by 11:00. Kensington MP Felicity Buchan tweeted: ""Very concerning to hear about the high rise fire at Queensdale Crescent in Shepherds Bush.""

UN sexual abuse claims 'must be investigated',"Purna Sen: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it?'"" Claims of sexual abuse and corruption at the United Nations should urgently be investigated by an independent panel, an ex-senior UN member has said. Purna Sen's comments follow a BBC investigation which revealed the sackings of a number of UN staff who tried to expose alleged wrongdoing. Ms Sen said the UN should ""step up"" and adopt any suggestions made by a panel. A spokesperson for the UN told the BBC it was focused on ensuring that people felt safe to report abuse. The BBC documentary,The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN, details allegations of corruption, management turning a blind eye to wrongdoing and sexual abuse. Staff members who tried to report allegations told the BBC they had been penalised after speaking out - and some were sacked. In the film, Ms Sen - who was appointed spokeswoman on harassment, assault and discrimination in 2018 - said there were women at the UN who had been ""approached, accosted and raped"". The more men were allowed to get away with it, she said, ""the more they will keep doing it"". She has told BBC Newsnight that she is not surprised by the ""deeply upsetting"" testimonies. ""It suggests that sometimes the protection of the senior folk within each organisation matters more than the absence of harm to those who aren't powerful. ""It means there is a real tension within an organisation which not only upholds and advocates for human rights, but is actually the birthplace of most of these human rights - yet it hasn't learned to bring them home to the people who work for that organisation."" Ms Sen said she wanted UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres to appoint a diverse external panel to consider staff experiences and recommend a focused set of actions. In a statement, Mr Guterres' office said it remained open to any external review of its efforts ""to combat misconduct of any kind"". The spokesman for the UN Secretary General, Stephane Dujarric, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the secretary general had ""taken this extremely seriously since he came into office"". ""We continue to do whatever we can to support victims and are focused on improving the systems and ensuring that people feel safe to report abuse,"" he added. When asked about external oversight, Mr Dujarric said: ""There is full transparency and we have an internal independent body that reports to the member states of the UN General Assembly."" ""We are not afraid of any scrutiny,"" he said, adding that ""we are doing whatever we can to break this climate of fear"". The United Nations has a protected legal status and senior staff have diplomatic immunity from all national laws. This is granted to the organisation to protect it from interference when doing its work. But the UN says it not granted for the personal benefit of staff, so does not protect those who commit crimes such as sexual assault. UN headquarters in New York, 2021 All staff complaints have to be addressed internally. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) handles the most serious allegations, including claims of criminality, but has no legal authority. The BBC was handed a secret recording which suggests the OIOS is not always effective. It features Ben Swanson, director of the investigations division, addressing a staff meeting. He says a senior UN female member of staff had come to him in tears, describing how an assistant secretary general had put his hand down her trousers. The UN has a number of assistant secretary generals. In the recording, Mr Swanson states that he told the secretary general and other senior officials of the sexual assault allegation - but was quickly shut down. ""So I tried to tell this story and I got... I was cut dead,""he can be heard saying. He added that the woman was discouraged from reporting her alleged assault and told it wouldn't do any good to speak up since the man in question was a ""favoured son"". ""I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top,"" says Peter Gallo Peter Gallo - the whistleblower who shared the audio recording - told the documentary: ""I spent four years as an investigator in the UN headquarters in New York. And as a result of that experience, I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top."" After hearing his account, Ms Sen said: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it? My zero-tolerance policy means we have to act.' Instead we get an account of 'No, we're not going there.'"" The office of the UN Secretary General says it remains committed to ""sanctioning any staff, junior or senior, found to have engaged in sexual harassment"". Martina Bostrom, a former senior advisor for UNAIDS, told the BBC she was also a victim of sexual harassment at work. ""Sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment in the UN happens in headquarters, it happens Monday to Friday. It happens during regular work hours, it happens everywhere,"" she said. Martina Brostrom: ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go"" She said she was targeted by Luiz Loures, UNAIDS deputy executive director and an assistant secretary general, who she described as being ""sleazy"" and known for his inappropriate behaviour. During a work event in Bangkok in 2015, she said he forcibly kissed and groped her in a lift as they left a meeting, before trying to drag her towards his room. ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go. I had to block myself with the elevator door to be able to stay in because I was afraid I was seeing that long corridor,"" she said. ""My brain was obviously working very, very, quickly and dreading what could happen."" Martina launched a formal complaint and spoke to UN investigators. The UN and UNAIDS ""retaliated in very mean and hurtful ways,"" she said. ""That's very painful because it's almost like being violated all over again. It's like they don't give you a chance to breathe."" In 2018, Luiz Loures retired from the UN and was thanked for ""his 22 years of dedicated service"". He told the BBC: ""I have never harassed nor assaulted anyone. The accusations made are unfounded."" The UN said: ""Allegations of harassment against Dr Loures were investigated,"" but at this time it was ""not in a position to comment on the veracity of these claims"". In August 2021 Martina received a letter from the UN that accepted that she was ""sexually harassed over a protracted period of time"" but, in regard to the allegation she was sexually assaulted in 2015, they concluded ""something traumatic happened to you consistent with your account of the situation"", but the findings ""did not meet the evidentiary standards"". Watch now on BBC iPlayer:The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN- or at 21:00 on Tuesday 21 June on BBC Two. Ms Sen said Martina's case was symptomatic of a wider problem at the UN. She told the documentary that an ""astonishing"" third of UN staff said they had experienced sexual harassment while working, but that the vast majority of cases had not been reported. ""What we do know about cases is just the tip of the iceberg and, this is a really important point, people feel there will be adverse consequences for reporting, they will be retaliated against. ""If I had been attacked or sexually assaulted, I would likely not have reported it. I would not put myself through that process."" UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres In a statement, the office of UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said there had been ""major improvements to fighting the scourge of sexual harassment, from which no organisation is immune"". It said measures included hiring female investigators to look into allegations, a hotline for staff to report misconduct and better training of senior management. But, speaking to BBC Newsnight, Ms Sen said accounts in the documentary suggested the UN had not fulfilled its promises of zero-tolerance and had ""a lot further to go"". ""Whether it's corruption, fraud, sexual harassment, [UN staff] feel they can't progress even to making a report, that the complaints are initially dismissed far too early. They're not given alternative procedures and appeals access,"" she said. ""The UN has certainly addressed some of the big failures it had before, but it hasn't gone far enough. I have seen things that are very troubling - that can and should be addressed as a matter of urgency, not just in words, but in deeds.""

What lines are affected?,"Rail travel has been disrupted this week by industrial action, including an overtime ban which continues on Friday. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef walked out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prompting widespread cancellations. The six-day overtime ban, which started on Bank Holiday Monday and runs until Saturday, will continue to have an impact on some services. Drivers from 16 train operating companies staged walkouts on different days this week. The services affected included LNER, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express, c2c, Greater Anglia, Great Northern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, South Western Railway main line and Island Line, Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains. The overtime ban also means drivers have not been accepting any extra shifts, which they say are crucial to the smooth running of the rail network. National Rail said train timetables were likely to be affected. Passengers are advised tocheck before they travel.,external Rail passengers with advance tickets can get refunds if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled due to strikes.â¯â¯ If passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if part of the journey is cancelled. Season ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, canclaim 100% compensation for strike dates,external. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is seeking better pay for its members. It says drivers are being asked to accept worse working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Strike action began in July 2022 but no formal talks have taken place between the two sides since April 2023, when the most recent pay deal was rejected. The offer, described as ""risible"" by Aslef, included 4% pay rises two years in a row, on the condition drivers accepted changes to training and negotiated new work patterns. Train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of the financial challenges they are facing and to ensure fairness to taxpayers. The body which negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, the Rail Delivery Group, says it continues to ""seek a fair agreement"". Unions need to re-ballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action. Currently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. In November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff,voted to accept a pay offer. This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 and job security guarantees. Talks over future pay deals and working practices will continue. A new law meanstrain companies can require enough staff to work on strike daysto run 40% of services. The Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels ""if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service"". PM 'disappointed' as new rail strike law not used However, industry insiders told the BBC that applying the new rules was complicated. One source said it meant co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time. The Rail Delivery Group, a membership organisation of Britain's train operating companies, said the minimum services levels law was a potential tool but not a ""silver bullet"". Unions strongly oppose it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says median pay for ""train and tram drivers"" is just under Â£59,000. Train companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to Â£65,000. The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919,according to the ONS.,external If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is Â£39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff. Will you be affected by the strikes?

Rail strike has cost our hotel 75% of bookings,"This video can not be played Hotelier Scott Meikle says this week's rail strike has been devastating for his business Hospitality bosses reliant on guests using the rail network saythe first 24-hour train strikehas already sparked a flood of cancellations. Scott Meikle owns The Moor of Rannoch Restaurant and Rooms which sits next to Rannoch train station, 40 miles down a single-track road from Pitlochry. He had 24 room bookings this week until news of the strike cut that to six. More cancellations over the summer would be ""devastating"" for business, Mr Meikle said. About 40,000 Network Rail staff have walked out in a dispute over pay, working conditions and redundancies. Mr Meikle told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""With the prospect of trains not being able to run, there is no viable alternative to get to us. ""The West Highland Line is a fantastic scenic route which goes through this vast wilderness of Rannoch Moor and we are right in the centre. So the railways play a huge part in getting our guests to us. Nine in 10 trains cancelled as rail strike begins 'Rail strikes have lost us Â£500,000 of bookings' Live: Biggest national rail strike for 30 years begins ""The cancellations have already started and have been affecting us for the last few days. A lot of our guests are travelling and touring around Scotland and using the train lines is a vital part of their journey. ""That means guests who have been travelling for the last few days now find that they can't travel on - or home - from wherever they have been across Scotland."" About 70% of guests at Rannoch Moor Restaurant and Rooms arrive and leave by train Rail passengers have been warned to expect serious disruption as the first of three 24-hour rail strikes hits services in Scotland. ScotRail has cancelled 90% of its services while cross-border services are also likely to be badly affected. The result has serious financial implications for hotel owners such as Mr Meikle, who normally sees about 70% of his guests arrive and leave by train. ""As soon as there is disruption on the railways, it really does cause a huge problem,"" he said. ""Not just for us, but business across the Highlands and across Scotland. ""We are constantly promoting sustainable and environmentally-friendly travel. But for communities like us, there is no real viable alternative. The railway is a vital part of the infrastructure. ""We open five days a week and we have five rooms, so for this block we had 24 [separate bookings] and at one point we went down to just six rooms. So huge levels of cancellations because guests cannot physically get to us."" Mr Meikle's business sits next to the remote Rannoch railway station in Highland Perthshire The threat of continued disruption is a crippling blow to a sector still trying to recover from the effects of the pandemic. Mr Meikle said: ""Communities like ours, and hospitality in particular, were significantly hit by Covid and various lockdowns. ""There was very little we could during those periods - we can't do a home delivery service or home boxes, it's just not physically possible. ""So the sector across Highland Perthshire and the Highlands was really looking forward to a very busy summer with good bookings, but a lot of that has now been thrown into disarray.""

Union calls for talks with ministers branded a stunt,"Calls for the government to get involved in rail strike negotiations have been dismissed as a stunt by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Only 20% of trains are understood to be running during strikes as Boris Johnson urged commuters to ""stay the course"". Mick Lynch, secretary general of the RMT union, said talks collapsed on Monday after a compulsory redundancy notice was issued. Millions of passengers in England, Wales and Scotland face disruption. Passengers are being advised to avoid all but essential travel, after staff at Network Rail and 13 rail operators walked out at midnight. Further strikes are planned for Thursday and Saturday. Trains that do run will start later and finish much earlier than usual - between 07:30 and 18:30. The RMT is striking over what it calls ""an aggressive agenda"" of cuts to jobs, conditions, pay and pensions. This video can not be played RMT chief Mick Lynch says negations with Network Rail ""can't get past first base"" Mr Lynch told the BBC's Today programme: ""We're sorry for that [disruption to people's lives], we don't want that to happen."" He added that Network Rail had issued a statutory notice of redundancy on Monday ""rather than revise their current proposals."" He added the government, which owns Network Rail, had been actively preventing employers and the union from reaching a settlement, although ministers have denied they played a role in talks. But Mr Shapps said he does not meet with unions as that was for employers to do, describing calls for him to come to the negotiating table ""a stunt"" and said there was a ""pay offer on the table, the door is open"". He told the BBC Breakfast: ""The reality is they're using it as a camouflage for the fact they've walked out of the talks that they should be in with their employers."" This video can not be played Watch: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps rejects calls to meet with union leaders The transport secretary added he would change the law in the next two months to permit workers with transferable skills to do a role left vacant by a striking worker. He said: ""It means that if some person is sat in Network Rail's control room and they're sat at a screen, at the moment they may not move to another screen even though they're fully qualified to do so, without union permission for example. ""This makes no sense. It's not the way that any normal business or organisation would operate. ""You're changing what is called agency, but it actually will allow us to have transferrable skills from within Network Rail."" Speaking at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the strikes as ""causing significant disruption and inconvenience""making it more difficult for people to get to work, risking peoples' appointments and making it more difficult for children to sit exams. ""I want to emphasise to everybody this morning why I think those strikes are so wrong and unnecessary."" He added: ""We need, I'm afraid, everybody - and I say this to the country as a whole - we need to get ready to stay the course. ""To stay the course, because these reforms, these improvements in the way we run our railways are in the interests of the travelling public, they will help to cut costs for farepayers up and down the country."" Which lines are affected? How much are rail workers paid? Agency staff could cover strikes under law change 'My stag do plans are in ruins due to strikes' The RMT union is asking for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the rising cost of living, but it says employers have offered a maximum of 3% - on condition they also accept job cuts and changes to working practices. This video can not be played Watch: Rail users are braced for days of disruption The Bank of England has forecast that inflation is set to hit 11% in the autumn, with prices rising at the fastest rate for 40 years. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Christine Jardine, told BBC Breakfast: ""People have been let down; police, health workers, students and children with exams this morning, teachers thinking how are they going get into schools. It's not good enough."" CEO of Network Rail, Andrew Haines, said the government ""has not been the constraining factor in negotiations"" and, for the right deal ""we could go above"" the 3% pay rise. I'm typing this heading east, when I need to head west. Like millions of others, my journey today is a bit of a long winded bodge job. But I'm lucky, at least it looks possible. You've probably read, heard or seen the language from the RMT union and the language from the government. For now, at least, neither side want to budge. And plenty at Westminster expect plenty more strikes, and not just on the railways. What we are seeing are the symptoms of a collision between the economics and politics of the last decade or so, dating back to the financial crisis, and the reality of now: this post Covid, war in Europe world. In other words, workers in much of the private and particularly the public sector were already feeling squeezed before this crunch. Sluggish wage growth at best, and for many real terms cuts. The government then spent big time during the pandemic. Next, Covid and the war in Ukraine led to accelerating prices. Now ministers fear big public sector pay deals would not only be vastly expensive, but could make the big problem with price rises â inflation â worse. Read more. Mr Lynch said industrial action would run ""as long as it needs to"", saying the strikes could last months if a deal was not reached. Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh earlier accused Mr Shapps of not giving train operating companies ""any mandate to negotiate"", saying the talks were a ""sham"". Although ScotRail and Transport for Wales are not part of the dispute, services in Scotland and Wales are also affected because they rely on Network Rail staff. ScotRail said 90% of trains will be cancelled during the three days of industrial action.

Stay the course over rail strike disruption - PM,"Some passengers faced lengthy journeys on the few rail services that remained Passengers across Britain faced journeys hours longer than usual and surging road traffic at the start of the largest rail strike in decades. The first of three strikes by the RMT union over cuts to jobs, conditions, real-terms pay and pensions left just one in five trains running. Boris Johnson urged the country to ""stay the course"" and resist pay rises in line with soaring inflation. RMT boss Mick Lynch said the union was ""leading the way"" over pay concerns. The RMT and railway employers are due to hold fresh talks on Wednesday aimed at resolving the dispute. But more strikes are scheduled for Thursday and Saturday. About 40,000 members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union working for Network Rail and 13 train operators walked out in the first of the three planned strikes. Half of all lines were closed and much of the country had no rail service at all, including most of Scotland and Wales, the whole of Cornwall and Dorset, and places such as Chester, Hull, Lincoln and Worcester. Which lines are affected by the rail strike? How much are rail workers paid? Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Many stations that are normally crammed with commuters were almost deserted except for union picket lines, as strikes also took place on London Underground lines on Tuesday. Commuters who made it into work by rail faced a dash for their last trains before the network shut down at 18:30 BST. Disruption is set to continue on Wednesday, because the lack of overnight staff is expected to delay the first trains by up to four hours in some places, and only about 60% of normal services are due to run. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""We need to get ready to stay the course"" Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines said by late morning, ""we'll be running a full service"" and it was expected that would continue throughout the day.""So, again, disruption - but far less disruption than today,"" he added. Mr Johnson - speaking at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday - said without modernisation to the industry, train operators risked going bust and passengers faced ever-increasing prices that could lead to them abandoning rail travel. ""I say this to the country as a whole, we need to get ready to stay the course,"" he said. ""Because these reforms, these improvements in the way we run our railways, are in the interests of the travelling public, they will help to cut costs for fare payers."" The prime minister said the strikes were ""so wrong and so unnecessary"", making it ""more difficult for people to get to work, risking people's appointments, making it more difficult for kids to sit exams - all sorts of unnecessary aggravations"". 'My stag do plans are in ruins due to strikes' 'Why I'm losing my wages to go on strike' Should public sector workers get bigger pay rises? Downing Street said the prime minister believed the government had to ""work within our means"" and resist calls for pay rises that would lead to greater inflation later. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%. Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - is currently 9% but the Bank of England forecasts it will reach about 11% in the autumn. Many stations that are normally crowded with commuters were almost deserted This video can not be played Watch: One striking RMT worker says ""enough is enough"" Mr Lynch apologised for the disruption to passengers, but accused the government, which owns Network Rail, of actively preventing employers and the RMT from reaching a settlement. He said members had shown ""outstanding unity"" as the union opposed plans for thousands of job cuts, changed working conditions and reduced pension benefits, along with making its pay demands. Mr Lynch said railway staff were ""leading the way"" for workers who were ""sick and tired of having their pay and conditions slashed"". ""Now is the time to stand up and fight for every single railway worker in this dispute that we will win,"" he said. Marta Kotlarek's sons Jakub and Michal have exams on two of the strike days Marta Kotlarek, from Holywell, Flintshire, says she has had to take time off work to drive her sons to their exams during the rail strike. Jakub, 16, and Michal, 18, usually take the train from Flint to school in Colwyn Bay. But with GCSE and A-level exams on the morning of the strikes on Tuesday and Thursday, they couldn't make the journey this week. ""This is a crucial year for them... they are a little bit worried,"" says Marta. She says there's no point in doing the hour-long round trip twice, so she's waiting around until they finish their exams before driving back to Holywell. As commuters switched from trains to cars to avoid the impact of the strike, some places saw long queues on the roads. Location technology firm TomTom said congestion levels at 11:00 BST were higher than at the same time last week in a number of urban areas. London congestion increased from 38% to 51%, in Cardiff it went up from 24% to 29% and Manchester saw a rise from 27% to 34%. The percentages reflect the additional time needed for journeys compared to free-flowing traffic. Bus stops were crowded as people sought alternative routes There were also long queues on outer London sections of the M1, M4, A4 and A40. But National Highways told the BBC that many parts of the motorway network have been quieter than a normal Tuesday, as employees took advantage of post-pandemic work-from-home policies.

People being treated after tower block blaze,"Smoke damage at Queensdale Crescent A tower block fire in west London, less than a mile (1.6km) from Grenfell Tower, was started by an electric bike battery malfunctioning as it charged. Resident Liiban Shakat feared he was ""going to die"" when his friend woke him and led him to a guest bedroom engulfed in flames on the 12th floor. He described how his friend's ""mouth was black because he inhaled so much smoke"" and needed hospital treatment. About 60 firefighters were sent to the Shepherd's Bush fire at 09:23 BST. London Ambulance Service confirmed paramedics assessed two more people at the scene in Queensdale Crescent. The scorched windows of Mr Shakat's home at the Stebbing House flats, less than a mile (1.6km) from Grenfell Tower where a fire claimed 72 lives in 2017, can clearly be seen. About 30 residents evacuated the building before the fire service arrived Mr Shakat, 38, said the fire started in his guest bedroom where his friend, who was staying for several days, had been charging an e-bike battery. Speaking to reporters outside the building and still wearing his macawis, a traditional Somali style of pyjamas, he said: ""[My friend] was in the room that caught on fire. He was in the bed. His mouth was black because he inhaled so much smoke."" The friend woke Mr Shakat and led him to the fire and, half-awake, he rushed to pour a bucket of water over the burning debris, which Mr Shakat said had made the fire worse. ""Something was coming from the bike, smoke, so he unplugged it. Now the debris, the plastic, the fire caught the whole place, the windows the bed,"" Mr Shakat, who had lived in the building for 20 years, said through a translator. Allow Twitter content?

He ran to try and escape the building and alert his neighbours by knocking on nearby doors on the 12th floor, and at least 30 residents fled the building as plumes of black smoke were seen billowing out of windows. Mr Shakat claimed no fire alarm had sounded but a spokesman for the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (LBHF), which manages the building, said the fire alarm in his flat definitely did work but Mr Shakat did not hear it because he was outside the building. The spokesman added the flats had all been fitted with the ""highest-rated fire doors on the market"" and ""compartmentalisation worked"" in keeping the fire contained to one flat. The block contains 180 flats, he added, and there were six residents with Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (Peeps) who were helped to safety by firefighters. Jonathan Stone, the council's building safety manager, said fire safety measures taken by the local authorities had ""prevented another Grenfell"". The scorched windows of the flat can clearly be seen An LFB spokesman said 30 residents had left the block before LFB arrived, but added ""generally"" it was ""safer to remain in your flat"" because ""we don't want people necessarily going into smoke-filed corridors"". Station commander David Bracewell, who was at the scene, said: ""Three people from the affected flat left before the brigade arrived. A number of other residents evacuated the building. Firefighters led six residents to safety via an internal staircase."" An LFB spokesperson said the fire was under control by 11:00. Kensington MP Felicity Buchan tweeted: ""Very concerning to hear about the high rise fire at Queensdale Crescent in Shepherds Bush.""

"Rolls Royce to give staff Â£2,000 living-cost bonusMore than 14,000 workers could get a one-off sum after firm holds talks with union.","A union representing Rolls-Royce workers has rejected the offer of a Â£2,000 one-off payment from the firm to help its staff with the rising cost of living. Of the 14,000 staff at Rolls-Royce who were eligible for the payment, 11,000 members are unionised. Unite said the offer ""falls far short of the real cost of living challenges which our members are experiencing"". But Rolls-Royce said the offer was ""fair"" and ""a good deal"" for staff. The lump sum, which was intended for junior management and shop floor staff, was due to begin being rolled out in August, starting with the 3,000 non-unionised staff before being paid to the remaining 11,000 unionised workers. Unite's regional secretary Paresh Patel said the union was still in negotiations with Rolls-Royce about the pay offer. News of the offer emerged on Monday night, and was later confirmed by Rolls-Royce. However, Unite said: ""The fact that Rolls-Royce has made this announcement in the way that it has certainly in our view undermines the trade union and the negotiating position that should be between the employer and the unions on this matter."" Rolls-Royce had also offered workers a 4% increase in pay, back-dated to March. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson had told the BBC it would be ""the highest annual pay rise for at least a decade"" for its shop floor staff. But Unite said it would also reject that offer of a 4% pay rise. There are ongoing discussions with unions about a pay settlement for 2022-2023, Rolls-Royce's spokesperson said, and the cost of living issue is to be a factor in those negotiations. In response to Unite's rejection of the offer, the spokesperson said: ""This is a good deal for our colleagues that is fair and competitive, with an immediate cash lump sum to help them through the current exceptional economic climate. ""We will continue to talk to our people."" Why are prices rising so quickly? When might the inflation rate come down? Meanwhile, around 115,000 Royal Mail workers are voting on strike action in a similar row over pay. The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents many Royal Mail staff, said it would be claiming for an ""inflation-based, no-strings pay award"", adding that Royal Mail's offer of a 2% pay award was ""miles away from where inflation is, totally inadequate"". Pay rates and measures to help UK staff have been increasing as businesses have been seeking to recruit and retain staff, after official figures showed there were fewer unemployed people than job vacancies for the first time since records began. Earlier this month,Lloyds Bank staff were offered a Â£1,000 lump sum to help with rising costs, after Unite the Union demonstrated outside its annual general meeting. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - currently stands at 9%, and is expected to increase again later this year. It seems one-off cost of living payments are gaining in popularity among employers - but are they a short-term fix to a long-term issue? The nature of inflation means that while the rate of price rises may slow next year, it is extremely unlikely that the cost of living will actually drop. Prices are almost certainly not going to fall. Yet, these payments are not embedded in future wages, unlike a regular pay increase. As employees continue to find it tough, will there be pressure on bosses to make these payments a permanent part of pay next year and beyond? There is undoubtedly an awareness among businesses that workers, particularly the lower-paid, need more financial help at the moment to cover their bills. But perhaps this eye-catching tactic of one-off payments is directed more at another issue - the retention and recruitment of staff. Rolls-Royce was badly impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic, which hit demand for its aircraft engines as international air travel ground to a halt. In 2020it announced plans to cut its global workforce by 9,000by the end of this year, with 3,000 of those jobs going in the UK. At the time it said it would take ""several years"" for the industry to recover from the pandemic. In the first year of Covid,Rolls-Royce made a loss of Â£4bnbecause of the collapse in air travel, however it returned to profit in 2021. Staff shortages are also putting pressure on firms to raise wages. Earlier this month, Morrisons said it would increase pay for its store workers as UK supermarkets battle for staff in the face of increasing competition in the sector. Rival chains Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have also announced pay rises for their workers this year.

Patients being treated after tower block blaze,"Smoke damage at Queensdale Crescent A tower block fire in west London, less than a mile (1.6km) from Grenfell Tower, was started by an electric bike battery malfunctioning as it charged. Resident Liiban Shakat feared he was ""going to die"" when his friend woke him and led him to a guest bedroom engulfed in flames on the 12th floor. He described how his friend's ""mouth was black because he inhaled so much smoke"" and needed hospital treatment. About 60 firefighters were sent to the Shepherd's Bush fire at 09:23 BST. London Ambulance Service confirmed paramedics assessed two more people at the scene in Queensdale Crescent. The scorched windows of Mr Shakat's home at the Stebbing House flats, less than a mile (1.6km) from Grenfell Tower where a fire claimed 72 lives in 2017, can clearly be seen. About 30 residents evacuated the building before the fire service arrived Mr Shakat, 38, said the fire started in his guest bedroom where his friend, who was staying for several days, had been charging an e-bike battery. Speaking to reporters outside the building and still wearing his macawis, a traditional Somali style of pyjamas, he said: ""[My friend] was in the room that caught on fire. He was in the bed. His mouth was black because he inhaled so much smoke."" The friend woke Mr Shakat and led him to the fire and, half-awake, he rushed to pour a bucket of water over the burning debris, which Mr Shakat said had made the fire worse. ""Something was coming from the bike, smoke, so he unplugged it. Now the debris, the plastic, the fire caught the whole place, the windows the bed,"" Mr Shakat, who had lived in the building for 20 years, said through a translator. Allow Twitter content?

He ran to try and escape the building and alert his neighbours by knocking on nearby doors on the 12th floor, and at least 30 residents fled the building as plumes of black smoke were seen billowing out of windows. Mr Shakat claimed no fire alarm had sounded but a spokesman for the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (LBHF), which manages the building, said the fire alarm in his flat definitely did work but Mr Shakat did not hear it because he was outside the building. The spokesman added the flats had all been fitted with the ""highest-rated fire doors on the market"" and ""compartmentalisation worked"" in keeping the fire contained to one flat. The block contains 180 flats, he added, and there were six residents with Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (Peeps) who were helped to safety by firefighters. Jonathan Stone, the council's building safety manager, said fire safety measures taken by the local authorities had ""prevented another Grenfell"". The scorched windows of the flat can clearly be seen An LFB spokesman said 30 residents had left the block before LFB arrived, but added ""generally"" it was ""safer to remain in your flat"" because ""we don't want people necessarily going into smoke-filed corridors"". Station commander David Bracewell, who was at the scene, said: ""Three people from the affected flat left before the brigade arrived. A number of other residents evacuated the building. Firefighters led six residents to safety via an internal staircase."" An LFB spokesperson said the fire was under control by 11:00. Kensington MP Felicity Buchan tweeted: ""Very concerning to hear about the high rise fire at Queensdale Crescent in Shepherds Bush.""

UN sexual abuse claims 'must be investigated'Some staff who tried to expose alleged abuse and wrongdoing say they were penalised or even sacked.World,"Purna Sen: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it?'"" Claims of sexual abuse and corruption at the United Nations should urgently be investigated by an independent panel, an ex-senior UN member has said. Purna Sen's comments follow a BBC investigation which revealed the sackings of a number of UN staff who tried to expose alleged wrongdoing. Ms Sen said the UN should ""step up"" and adopt any suggestions made by a panel. A spokesperson for the UN told the BBC it was focused on ensuring that people felt safe to report abuse. The BBC documentary,The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN, details allegations of corruption, management turning a blind eye to wrongdoing and sexual abuse. Staff members who tried to report allegations told the BBC they had been penalised after speaking out - and some were sacked. In the film, Ms Sen - who was appointed spokeswoman on harassment, assault and discrimination in 2018 - said there were women at the UN who had been ""approached, accosted and raped"". The more men were allowed to get away with it, she said, ""the more they will keep doing it"". She has told BBC Newsnight that she is not surprised by the ""deeply upsetting"" testimonies. ""It suggests that sometimes the protection of the senior folk within each organisation matters more than the absence of harm to those who aren't powerful. ""It means there is a real tension within an organisation which not only upholds and advocates for human rights, but is actually the birthplace of most of these human rights - yet it hasn't learned to bring them home to the people who work for that organisation."" Ms Sen said she wanted UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres to appoint a diverse external panel to consider staff experiences and recommend a focused set of actions. In a statement, Mr Guterres' office said it remained open to any external review of its efforts ""to combat misconduct of any kind"". The spokesman for the UN Secretary General, Stephane Dujarric, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the secretary general had ""taken this extremely seriously since he came into office"". ""We continue to do whatever we can to support victims and are focused on improving the systems and ensuring that people feel safe to report abuse,"" he added. When asked about external oversight, Mr Dujarric said: ""There is full transparency and we have an internal independent body that reports to the member states of the UN General Assembly."" ""We are not afraid of any scrutiny,"" he said, adding that ""we are doing whatever we can to break this climate of fear"". The United Nations has a protected legal status and senior staff have diplomatic immunity from all national laws. This is granted to the organisation to protect it from interference when doing its work. But the UN says it not granted for the personal benefit of staff, so does not protect those who commit crimes such as sexual assault. UN headquarters in New York, 2021 All staff complaints have to be addressed internally. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) handles the most serious allegations, including claims of criminality, but has no legal authority. The BBC was handed a secret recording which suggests the OIOS is not always effective. It features Ben Swanson, director of the investigations division, addressing a staff meeting. He says a senior UN female member of staff had come to him in tears, describing how an assistant secretary general had put his hand down her trousers. The UN has a number of assistant secretary generals. In the recording, Mr Swanson states that he told the secretary general and other senior officials of the sexual assault allegation - but was quickly shut down. ""So I tried to tell this story and I got... I was cut dead,""he can be heard saying. He added that the woman was discouraged from reporting her alleged assault and told it wouldn't do any good to speak up since the man in question was a ""favoured son"". ""I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top,"" says Peter Gallo Peter Gallo - the whistleblower who shared the audio recording - told the documentary: ""I spent four years as an investigator in the UN headquarters in New York. And as a result of that experience, I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top."" After hearing his account, Ms Sen said: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it? My zero-tolerance policy means we have to act.' Instead we get an account of 'No, we're not going there.'"" The office of the UN Secretary General says it remains committed to ""sanctioning any staff, junior or senior, found to have engaged in sexual harassment"". Martina Bostrom, a former senior advisor for UNAIDS, told the BBC she was also a victim of sexual harassment at work. ""Sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment in the UN happens in headquarters, it happens Monday to Friday. It happens during regular work hours, it happens everywhere,"" she said. Martina Brostrom: ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go"" She said she was targeted by Luiz Loures, UNAIDS deputy executive director and an assistant secretary general, who she described as being ""sleazy"" and known for his inappropriate behaviour. During a work event in Bangkok in 2015, she said he forcibly kissed and groped her in a lift as they left a meeting, before trying to drag her towards his room. ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go. I had to block myself with the elevator door to be able to stay in because I was afraid I was seeing that long corridor,"" she said. ""My brain was obviously working very, very, quickly and dreading what could happen."" Martina launched a formal complaint and spoke to UN investigators. The UN and UNAIDS ""retaliated in very mean and hurtful ways,"" she said. ""That's very painful because it's almost like being violated all over again. It's like they don't give you a chance to breathe."" In 2018, Luiz Loures retired from the UN and was thanked for ""his 22 years of dedicated service"". He told the BBC: ""I have never harassed nor assaulted anyone. The accusations made are unfounded."" The UN said: ""Allegations of harassment against Dr Loures were investigated,"" but at this time it was ""not in a position to comment on the veracity of these claims"". In August 2021 Martina received a letter from the UN that accepted that she was ""sexually harassed over a protracted period of time"" but, in regard to the allegation she was sexually assaulted in 2015, they concluded ""something traumatic happened to you consistent with your account of the situation"", but the findings ""did not meet the evidentiary standards"". Watch now on BBC iPlayer:The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN- or at 21:00 on Tuesday 21 June on BBC Two. Ms Sen said Martina's case was symptomatic of a wider problem at the UN. She told the documentary that an ""astonishing"" third of UN staff said they had experienced sexual harassment while working, but that the vast majority of cases had not been reported. ""What we do know about cases is just the tip of the iceberg and, this is a really important point, people feel there will be adverse consequences for reporting, they will be retaliated against. ""If I had been attacked or sexually assaulted, I would likely not have reported it. I would not put myself through that process."" UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres In a statement, the office of UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said there had been ""major improvements to fighting the scourge of sexual harassment, from which no organisation is immune"". It said measures included hiring female investigators to look into allegations, a hotline for staff to report misconduct and better training of senior management. But, speaking to BBC Newsnight, Ms Sen said accounts in the documentary suggested the UN had not fulfilled its promises of zero-tolerance and had ""a lot further to go"". ""Whether it's corruption, fraud, sexual harassment, [UN staff] feel they can't progress even to making a report, that the complaints are initially dismissed far too early. They're not given alternative procedures and appeals access,"" she said. ""The UN has certainly addressed some of the big failures it had before, but it hasn't gone far enough. I have seen things that are very troubling - that can and should be addressed as a matter of urgency, not just in words, but in deeds.""

Transport at crossroads as strikes hit London,"London has already faced three 24-hour Tube strikes this year A Tube strike is bad enough on its own, but combine it with a rail strike and you can see why it is expected to be the largest strike since 1989. Disruption this week will be huge. So why are there strikes? At the heart of both of these disputes is the government wanting both Transport for London (TfL) and Network Rail to change and make savings. That will involve cuts and changes to working practices. Why are savings necessary? The government says the impact of the pandemic means transport needs to reshape itself to deal with the new reality. The government claims a wider shift towards working from home has resulted in about ""25% fewer ticket sales"" on trains. It also says the taxpayer has had to step in to keep the railways running ""at a cost of Â£16bn, equivalent to Â£600 per household"". However, the modernising agenda on the railways is not new and has been going on for many years. Just look at what the government tried to doon Southern Trains in 2016by removing the guard and getting the driver to close the doors. There were many, many strikes, and eventually commuters could not rely on Southern for a service. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? Do Tube strikes work in the working from home age? Other transport commentators also say the reduction in passenger numbers is a red herring, with numbers having returned to somewhere near pre-pandemic levels. Coupled into this dispute on the trains is the demand by unions for a pay rise. The rail industry is essentially nationalised at the moment, as franchises have gone and rail operators are paid a 2% fee to run trains on National Rail contracts. Any pay rises will have to be agreed with the Treasury, but government-owned Network Rail (NR) has been told to reduce its spending by Â£2bn. NR wants to modernise working practices and introduce multi-skilled maintenance teams and flexible rostering. In the background to all this the government is looking to change the rail industry andlaunch Great British Railways (GBR). GBR would have a bigger oversight role than NR's maintenance role and will also oversee the contracting of services through concessions. So the timing from the unions is deliberate and could shape that new organisation and future savings. Similarly on the Tube, the government told TfL tomake savings of Â£400m a year as part of its pandemic bailout. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan agreed to make savings, including reviewing pensions, with TfL currently paying about Â£360m into the pension fund per year. Some in government think that the scheme is too expensive and needs to be more ""financially sustainable"". TfL also wants to lose 600 posts, which it says can be done through people retiring and leaving, and without compulsory redundancies. There is a long, long way to go in both these disputes. The wider picture is that the industry is at crossroads and how it is shaped will depend on how these disputes are resolved. The warning from history is that the Southern dispute lasted for 18 months. Follow BBC London onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

We're closing our coverage now, but here's a recap of the main developments:  Today's updates have been written by Alex Kleiderman, Marita Moloney, Thomas Mackintosh, Lauren Hirst, Catherine Evans, Andrew Humphrey, Craig Hutchison, Aoife Walsh, Sam Hancock and Jennifer McKiernan. The editors were Rob Corp, Nathan Williams, Marie Jackson and James Clarke. We'll be back with coverage of Thursday's strikes - pending the outcome of tomorrow's talks, perhaps...   The rail strike hasn't been all doom and gloom for commuters. That's according to Daniel Schofield, who sent us a picture from Fenchurch Street station in London while waiting for the last train home. ""Commuting has been a dream
today with the empty trains,"" he says. Weâve heard lots of stories today about people whose plans have been in disarray, but what about those who support the workers striking? Michelle Smit, fromSelby, North Yorkshire,told us earlier she was struggling to get to work inLeeds city centre. However, she said that despite her difficult commute, she had some sympathy with the workers on the picket line. ""Sometimes we've got to do what we've got to do."" Michelle Smit says she'll probably end up getting a taxi Electrical engineer Harry Charles, fromLewisham, south-east London,said similar. Despite his normal 10-minute journey to work by train toLondon Bridgetaking 90 minutes, Harry said he supported the action. ""I am with the employees who are striking because their money is not going up and the cost of everything is rising,"" he told the PA news agency. ""The strike has caused a lot of hassle for people but everyone wants be able to eat."" InManchester, Amber Zito, a canine hydrotherapist fromHolmfirth, West Yorkshire,suggested blame for the strike shouldn't be put on workers. ""I blame the government for the strike. I don't blame the people who work for train companies at all,"" she said while stuck at Manchester Piccadilly station. ""They are only trying to do what everyone wants for their job."" Commuters were seen running through stations today to catch the limited trains available Others were less sympathetic. Hospital food supply worker Marie, fromChingford, Essex,told the PA news agency she was forced to walk for 40 minutes fromLiverpool StreettoWaterloothis morning. ""There are loads of people who have worked right through the pandemic, myself included,"" she said. ""We can't go on strike just at the drop of a hat, so I don't have any sympathy."" Britons appeared divided over the strikes, with 37% in favour compared with 45% against, according to a snap YouGov survey. A separate poll of more than 2,300 people, by Savanta ComRes, suggested 58% thought the action was justified. The government maintains the issue must be resolved by the private train operators and the unions. Here is a selection of images from London stations on Tuesday evening, as services operate at a reduced capacity. A passenger runs to catch a train at Waterloo station before train service ends early. A person at an almost deserted Euston station in London this evening.

The entrance to Westminster Tube station is closed to commuters. Paloma is disabled and trying to get home Andre Rhoden-PaulBBC News The strikes are forcing many passengers to either risk the railways or find an alternative route. Paloma Malia, from Durham, is wondering how easily she'll get back home from Manchester Airport this week. The retired mental health nurse, who is currently on a solo trip to Greece, has had her train home on Thursday cancelled. The 50-year-old, who has scoliosis, says she has since booked another train on the same day, but has been told she'll probably not be able to have wheelchair assistance at the train station because of staffing shortages. Also, there may not be anyone to help Paloma, who is unsteady on her feet, on to the train. ""It's going to be very hard, but I'm hoping that I can ask some kind people to help me,"" she says. Despite the impact on her travels, Paloma supports rail workers taking industrial action. ""The government haven't come to the table. I'm not going to blame the workers for striking,"" she says. The vast majority of train services across the south of England have been cancelled today and usually busy train stations have been deserted. Bournemouth will not see another South Western Railway service until Sunday - in fact, the only services the train operator will provide will be from Southampton to London. Portsmouth, Poole and Weymouth will also have none at all. People who did need to use the railways to travel say the few trains that did run were ""far quieter than usual"" and their journeys were ""challenging"". There are normally 35 trains departing from 06:00 BST that can get you from Reading to Paddington by 09:00 BST - today there were just four. And later in the day trains that were able to run on that line were disrupted and delayed when a person was struck by a train near Slough. Alice (l) is hoping her hen do in Manchester organised by Bethan (r) will go ahead this weekend The rail strike is complicating hen
do plans that Bethan Lewis from Dinas Powys in the Vale of Glamorgan has worked on
for months. She is organising a hen do for 11 to Manchester this weekend and
says the gathering is now up in the air. âWe're now asking people to find more money to potentially drive
up nowâ¦ as well as parking in the city centre which isn't ideal,â she says. Bride-to-be Alice Lally says she's been looking forward to the
weekend as it will be the first time she has gone away since her baby was born in October. ""I'm trying not to think about the worst, but it definitely makes
things a little bit more stressful. I think getting back will be hard
too."" Ricky
Oates has joined RMT workers on picket lines at two stations today, in support of the striking rail workers. âIâm registered as a disabled person,"" he tells the BBC. âI attended both rail picket lines in Bedford and
Milton Keynes this morning to show my support. ""They worked all through Covid and kept the country
running. And didnât really get thanks for it. Theyâre just asking for decent pay. âIt just makes me really upset that the government
has allowed this strike to take place when they could have averted this strike
on day one. âSome of the workers cried today, when I said I
had friends who had missed hospital appointments. âThey said they really donât want to strike but
have got no other option. To me, that really brought home the human side of it."" After a day of cancellations, Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines has warned anyone travelling tomorrow to be mindful of a slow start to the day. He tells the BBC: Tomorrow morning is going to be very heavily affected because the first trains in the morning will not be able to start up because people who'd normally be working the night shift won't be signing on for duty.  It's not all bad, though. Haines says by late morning, ""we'll be running a full service"" and it's expected that will continue throughout the day. ""So, again, disruption but far less disruption than today,"" he adds. Julia McCart from Glengormley,
Belfast, is travelling around the country following Barry Manilow on tour as
part of her 80th birthday celebrations. After seeing the singer perform
in Cardiff on Monday, she was due to travel to Newcastle on Tuesday where she
was set to meet him. The Barry Manilow fan then
planned to travel to a concert in Glasgow on Thursday and go back home to Belfast
on Friday. ""It has caused quite a bit of hassle,"" she says, especially as her flight from Belfast to Bristol was cancelled too, but it was nonetheless worth it."" The American crooner's hits include Could it be Magic, Mandy and Copacabana. ""To me and maybe to all of us fans, he's a great artist, a great showman and musician,"" Julia says. ""I've tried my best to follow him.â You can read more about people whose leisure plans have been affected by the strikes here David HendersonBBC Scotland Business and Transport Correspondent For now, regular commuters may choose to work from home. That may blunt the impact of this strike. But it worries rail bosses, who desperately want to see passenger
numbers return to where they were before the pandemic - from the 70% level we see right now. Rail strikes are
like trains. Wait long enough,
and three come along at the same time. ScotRail services
are already hit hard by industrial action from train drivers. They're set to vote
on a pay deal worth more than 5% in the coming weeks. Thousands of
Scotrail workers are also being offered a similar deal. If these are any
sort of benchmark, signallers will hold out for a more generous deal than the 3%
they're being offered by Network Rail. If that happens, it
could be a long, frustrating year on Scotland's railways. And much now
depends on Network Rail's owner, the UK government, which sets the limits for
any pay deal. Danny SavageNorth of England correspondent One York tea shop said they'd normally expect to be full, but had very few customers On a summer's day, people would normally be pouring out of York station into the city. Itâs arguably the most popular way for visitors to arrive. By lunchtime you could tell the difference. Outside tables which would usually be taken at pubs were empty and staff were commenting there was little tourism trade. Outside the railway station, foreign visitors were queueing for the National Express coach to Leeds or London. They were cutting short their stays by 24 hours to make sure they could get to their flights from Manchester or Heathrow. That meant they werenât spending money in York. York Dungeon was having a bit of a nightmare - rejigging the rota so staff local to the area could work the strike days and those who travel by train cover the days in between. This city can probably cope with a weekday outside of the school holidays like this - but Saturdayâs planned strike will hit York hard. Glastonbury Festival ticket-holders started arriving at Castle Cary Station today Castle Cary station in Somerset has been busier than many others, serving passengers travelling to theGlastonbury Festival. While more than half of the regular trains to Glastonbury have been cancelled due to the strike action, many services are specially-run trains to take ticket holders to the festival. Another music fan, Phil Rice, 49, has been trying to travel home from Liverpool toChippenhamin Wiltshire after attending an Eagles concert at Anfield stadium last night. ""I think I will have to get a train to Stafford, then on to Reading and then from Reading to Chippenham,"" he says. ""When I booked the tickets last week the staff at my local station said they had no concrete evidence the strike would go ahead.""  As train services come to a halt across the UK, rail workers and customers are reminded of the last time journeys dipped significantly - the coronavirus pandemic. The graphic shows how national lockdowns, and the near abandonment of public transport at the time, left train passenger numbers at theirlowest in many years. Back in April 2020, a month after the government announced the UK's first Covid lockdown, rail journeys in Britain were reported to be at about 5% of normal levels. Deserted St Austell railway station on the first of three days of strikes Passengers in the South West
have been heavily impacted by the rail strike, with
no services in Cornwall and a threadbare service in Devon. James Davis, from Great Western
Railway (GWR), says there will be ""no
trains west of Plymouth on strike days"" and ""on non-strike days
significantly reduced services where we are able to operate"". He says: ""In Devon and
Cornwall we are more reliant on Network Rail signallers to be able to move
trains, which is why Devon and Cornwall are more adversely affected than other
parts of our network."" Tamsin Melville, BBC Radio Cornwall politics reporter, says St Austell railway station in
Cornwall, pictured, was ""like tumbleweed"". ""I'm on the platform which
is completely deserted,"" she says. One would-be passenger, Andrew,
turned up to the station expecting trains. ""I thought the strike was
all in London,"" he says. ""I was going to Penzance to
paint somebody's house and now it looks like I won't be going all week."" But he says he
supports the strike. The Sidmouth Literary Festival in Devon, which was due to start tomorrow, has been rescheduled because of the strikes. Jennifer McKiernanBBC London Passengers say it's been ""like lockdown again"" as Tube and rail services are left empty because of today's strikes. Many have switched to cycling but one woman says she was almost knocked off her bike multiple times due to the heavy traffic on the roads. Others walked miles to get to where they needed to be. This video can not be played Navigating London on a day of London Underground and national rail strikes A meeting of
  the Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR) has been told of the impact
  of the UK-wide rail strikes on Scotland. Deputy First
  Minister John Swinney was joined by Transport Secretary
  Michael Matheson and transport minister Jenny Gilruth to hear the latest. Gilruth has already written to the UK government calling for a swift
  resolution to the dispute. The SGoRR has been
  up and running since this morning and will operate  until Sunday
  evening to monitor the impact and co-ordinate ministers' response. Deputy First Minister John Swinney is confident that the mitigations that can be taken are being taken in Scotland. The meeting heard about extra preparedness around major events including theRoyal Highland Show, freight mitigation plans from major retailers to keep supermarkets stocked and wider resilience plans. Speaking after chairing the meeting, Mr Swinney said the lack of action from the UK government was a ""dereliction of duty"" and accused it of deliberately inflaming the situation, causing misery for the travelling public. Seryn's family has forked out Â£500 in hotel bills so she can sit her A-levels Eighteen-year-old Seryn, fromTonbridge, usually gets the train into London to go to school. This week her family have had to pay Â£500 in hotel bills so she can stay in the capital and sit her A-levels. ""If I went to a friend's house that would be the only other option and I didn't want to do that because me and my parents decided that I wouldn't be able to have a good night's sleep before my exam,"" say Seryn. Tourists aren't immune from the travel woes either. Skot Barnett and his fiancÃ© Andy Jalfon from New Zealand are visiting family inEast Grinstead. ""We were just going to use public transport for everything this week, and now it's a massive challenge,"" says Skot. ""We're here for another week and have events planned today in the West End and we are trying to see other family."" Skot Barnett and his fiancÃ© Andy Jalfon, from New Zealand, are visiting family Rail services will continue to be disrupted on Wednesday, even though it's not one of the three planned strike days. There will be reduced train services on many lines tomorrow due to the knock-on effects of today's strike, while the London Underground should return to normal by mid-morning. Here's what you need to know before planning your journey: How many trains will run tomorrow? Only around 60% of the 20,000 normal weekday services will be able to operate. Why are timetables not returning to normal if there's no strike planned? Walkouts by signallers and control room staff who would usually work overnight from Tuesday night into Wednesday morning mean trains will leave depots later than normal, delaying the start of services. What time do trains normally leave depots? Between around 03:00 BST and 04:00 BST. What time do passenger services usually begin? Between around 05:00 BST and 06:00 BST. How will that change tomorrow? Trains can only be taken out of depots when signallers on daytime shifts start work at around 06:00 BST to 6:30 BST and no passenger services will run before 06:30 BST. How long will the start of services be delayed? It is expected to take up to four hours in some locations. How quickly will services gather pace? In London, services will increase quickly as trains do not have to travel long distances from depots to stations but it will take several hours in remote locations. Will services eventually return to normal tomorrow? Network Rail said that ""even during the day the service will stay thinner"" than usual. What about Thursday? It will be a similar picture to today. Around 20% of services will run and just half of lines will be open, only between 07:30 BST and 18:30 BST. Is there any chance strikes planned for Thursday and Saturday will be called off? No negotiations are taking place so passengers are being urged to check with train operators for updates to services. Alice HopkinsReporting from Shepherd's Bush, west London Jamaican artist Shaggy is due to be performing in west London later tonight despite the Tube and rail strikes. The 02 Shepherd's Bush Empire theatre is served by the Central line, Hammersmith & City and Circle lines which are all disrupted. So, I decided to take a bus from central London to see how long it would take to get to the venue. My journey from Regent Street to Shepherd's Bush took longer than normal - the biggest wait was for the bus to arrive. It was a fairly slow crawl out of central London - then near Notting Hill and Lancaster Gate was quite normal, constantly moving and not in gridlock traffic. Staff don't expect people to queue for Shaggy but it is still going ahead as planned they don't intend to cancel it because of the strikes. The advice from 02 Shepherd's Bush Empire theatre staff is for any Shaggy fans planning on attending the concert to check their journeys before they travel. Â© 2025 BBC.

Macron to meet rival parties after losing majority,"The ÃlysÃ©e palace said Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne's offer to resign was rejected by President Macron on Tuesday French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected a resignation offer from the prime minister he appointed, saying instead that the government must ""stay on task and act"". Elisabeth Borne was criticised by some commentators after Mr Macron's coalition lost its majority on Sunday. Her future looked under threat after the result, which left the president needing to secure support from rivals. He is set to meet his political opponents for rare talks on Tuesday. But neither Marine Le Pen's far-right nor Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon's left-green alliance are keen to work with Mr Macron's centrist government, which is 44 seats shy of a majority and desperately trying to avoid political paralysis. The ÃlysÃ©e palace said Ms Borne formally offered to resign on Tuesday morning, submitting a letter to Mr Macron - the head of state - who turned it down. Mr Macron refused the offer ""so that the government can remain on task and act"", the ÃlysÃ©e palace said, adding that he would seek ""constructive solutions"" to ending the deadlock that threatens his agenda during his second term. It is customary for the French prime minister to offer to resign following parliamentary elections. Often, the president will simply reappoint the same person so that he or she can begin constructing a new government. But the situation is different this time, as Mr Macron is telling Ms Borne to stay in office with the same cabinet without resigning. It is probably an effort to buy time, analysts suggest, adding that at some point, a new government will be formed which may or may not have Ms Borne at its head. France's far right and left both make breakthroughs What now for Macron after poll setback? Meanwhile, party representatives will visit the ÃlysÃ©e Palace for high-level talks on Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts say the president may be eyeing a deal with the right-wing Republicans. The party confirmed that its leader, Christian Jacob, would attend the talks. But prospects of a deal appeared dim in the run-up to the talks, as Mr Jacob hit out at Mr Macron in an interview with France Inter radio. ""He's the one who's been arrogant and now he calls for help,"" he said. ""We are very clear on our stance, we are in the opposition to Emmanuel Macron and will remain there,"" he added. Ms Le Pen will take part but Mr MÃ©lenchon will not, the AFP news agency reports. Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure and Communist Party boss Fabien Roussel, members of the Nupes left-wing alliance, will also meet Mr Macron. Having no clear majority in the National Assembly is likely to make it far harder for Mr Macron to implement his agenda during his second five-year term. He has laid out a series of plans to tackle the spiralling cost of living, including food vouchers and enhanced benefits. Another big reform is gradually raising the retirement age from 62 to 65, which has proved unpopular with much of the electorate. Opponents from the right and left aim to resist the president's programme of reforms, although Ms Le Pen's National Rally has said it may back measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis if their own proposals are adopted.

The woman who could upend US abortion rights,"Lynn Fitch may be the lawyer to end Roe v Wade Millions of women in the US will lose the legal right to abortion, after the Supreme Court overturned a 50-year-old ruling that legalised it nationwide. Before the court's ruling was made public, BBC News looked at the woman whose case brought about the historic decision. In September 2021, Mississippi's chief legal officer sat down for an interview with Pro-Life Weekly, a Catholic television programme featuring anti-abortion activists. Lynn Fitch looked how she almost always does during public appearances: dyed-blonde hair blow-dried straight and neat, tasteful jewellery and a monochrome suit, this time in powder blue. The attorney general was there to celebrate. The United States Supreme Court had just announced the date it would hear her state's challenge to Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that has, for the nearly 50 years since, served as a nationwide guarantee to abortion access. The case, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, centres on a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, even in cases of rape or incest. Under Ms Fitch's direction, the state asked the Supreme Court to uphold the law and slash the landmark Roe v Wade decision in the process. A ruling is expected this month. A leaked draft suggests it is likely that Mississippi's ban will be upheld, paving the way for other states to also outlaw abortion. Ms Fitch - who declined to be interviewed - had argued that overturning Roe v Wade would be ""game-changing"", ""uplifting"" women by eliminating what she described as a false choice between family and career. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said on Pro-Life Weekly. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" If she wins the case, and Roe v Wade falls, some 40 million women may lose access to abortion, pro-choice advocates warn. It could also make Ms Fitch, a single working parent of three, a Republican superstar and poster-child for her own argument: modern women don't need abortion to have it all. Ms Fitch is facing off against Jackson Women's Health Organisation - the last remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi Abortion was not always an animating theme of Ms Fitch's political career. When she first took public office, as Mississippi state treasurer in 2011, she pushed for legislation that would guarantee men and women were paid equally. Her convictions were shaped in many ways by her upbringing, and her experiences as a single mother, says Hayes Dent, a long-time friend and colleague, who ran her first political campaign. When Mr Dent first met Ms Fitch, she had just been named executive director of the Mississippi State Personnel Board, a state agency, by then-governor Haley Barbour. Mr Dent was immediately impressed. ""Having been around every major political figure in Mississippi for 40 years, I could just tell: she's going to run,"" Mr Dent said. ""And when she pulls that trigger, she's going to be successful."" It wasn't for another couple of years that she did, launching a campaign for state treasurer. When he launched her first political campaign, for state treasurer in 2011, ""she was an underdog,"" said Austin Barbour, a national GOP strategist and the nephew of former Governor Barbour. Mr Dent, who had kept tabs on Ms Fitch, reached out to her in the middle of that 2011 cycle and asked to come on board her campaign. ""I said 'Look, I think you can win this race,'"" he recalled. She accepted. The two would drive the length of the state in a day, making a handful of different stops and placing fundraiser calls in the hours between. ""Her attitude was 'what is the task at hand,'"" Mr Dent said. ""It'd be like 'Look, we've gotta go to the tobacco spitting festival.' And she'd do great! She wouldn't spit tobacco, but she was great."" The only reason Ms Fitch would turn down a campaign event was her kids, cutting out early to make a school basketball game or parent-teacher conference. She was a natural campaigner, but fundraising lagged. Mr Dent drove to northern Mississippi to ask her father for a personal donation. Attorney General Fitch may become a hero on the political right Bill Fitch still lived in Holly Springs, the small, rural town near the state's northern edge where Ms Fitch spent most of her childhood. Her father had inherited land on the historic Galena Plantation and used the sprawling 8,000-acre property to restore the family farm, turning it into a premier quail hunting destination. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and Mississippi governors Barbour and Phil Bryant, became frequent guests. Visitors of Fitch Farms could elect to stay in the former home of Confederate general and first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Nathan Bedford Forrest, which Mr Fitch had bought and transported onto the property. Ms Fitch has told local media of ""special"" childhood memories at her father's farm, riding horses and hunting quail. As a teenager, she was the ""prototypical popular girl"", Mr Dent said. ""Leader, cheerleader, athletic, the whole nine yards,"" he said. She went to the University of Mississippi, joined a sorority and graduated with a degree in business administration and later in law. When Mr Dent drove to her father's farm to make his pitch for a campaign donation, he said it painly: ""I told him if I left there with a big cheque, she was going to win"". She won, and then won again four years later, securing a second term as state treasurer. In this office, she targeted state debt, expanded access to financial education in the state, and advocated for equal pay laws (Mississippi remains the only state that does not ensure equal pay for equal work between men and women). Rifts split America's abortion 'ground zero' state US Democrats' bid for federal abortion law fails And she developed her knack for connecting to voters, leaning on both her Holly Springs upbringing and an apparent ease in the public eye. In interviews and campaign videos, Ms Fitch looks preternaturally poised. She makes easy eye contact, her speech slow and relaxed, often thanking God and her family for the opportunity to serve her state. ""Rural roots matter to voters in this state,"" said Mr Barbour, the Republican strategist. ""And she's very likeable, she just is."" Ms Fitch also helped bolster her conservative credentials with her support for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, leading Mississippi's Women for Trump coalition in 2016. When Mr Trump was in Jackson for a campaign rally, she sat in the front row. Two years later, Ms Fitch announced she would make a bid for Mississippi Attorney General - an office that had never been held by a woman. But she wasn't the underdog this time, gliding to victory in November 2019 with nearly 60% of the vote on a promise to uphold ""conservative values and principles"". Ms Fitch, pictured in white to the right of Mr Trump, led Mississippi's Women for Trump coalition in 2016 As a devoted Republican in a solidly Republican state, where Ms Fitch stood on abortion was taken as given, even if she didn't run on it. Across the country, about 60% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to data from the Pew Research Centre. But among Mississippi Republicans, nearly 70% believe abortion should illegal in all or most cases. ""You don't run in Mississippi, you don't run in rural conservative states and not want to see Roe v Wade overturned,"" said Mr Barbour, the Republican strategist. ""It's just ingrained"". The abortion ban before the Supreme Court was passed by Mississippi's state legislature in 2018, two years before Ms Fitch took office as Attorney General. The law, which bans abortions outright after 15 weeks, was immediately challenged in court on behalf of Jackson Women's Health Organization, Mississippi's last remaining abortion clinic. A federal district court struck down the ban, saying it was unconstitutional. In 2019, an appeals court upheld this decision. But in June 2020, five months into the job, Attorney General Fitch petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the 15-week ban. The court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, accepted and heard the case in December of last year. Now, she's known nationally as the lawyer expected to topple Roe v Wade. At times, Ms Fitch has said her state is merely making an argument for the rule of law: asking the Supreme Court to turn over abortion policymaking to the states. But more often, she says the case is about women's empowerment. Roe v Wade, she has said, made women believe they had to pick: family or career, not both. ""The court in Roe pitted women against our children, and woman against woman,"" she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. The choice is misleading and paternalistic, argued Ms Fitch. It's a position seemingly drawn from her own life: a single mother who has ascended to the highest levels of state office, while remaining devoted to her children and grandchildren. ""Being a single mom has sort of dominated her thought process, and her life experience,"" Mr Dent said. ""I think that's one of the reasons she feels so strongly about this"". In a world without Roe v Wade, Ms Fitch said during a television interview last year, ""babies will be saved"" and mothers ""get a chance to really redirect their lives. They have all these new and different opportunities that they didn't have 50 years ago"". Ms Fitch has said women will be empowered by abortion bans Pro-choice activists have accused Ms Fitch of using feminist language to cover over an inherently anti-feminist policy. Her arguments lean ""heavily into false claims that they are 'empowering women'"", said Dina Montemarano, research director for NARAL Pro-Choice America. This tactic, Ms Montemarano said, is often used by anti-abortion activists to assert control over women's bodies and violate their fundamental freedoms. In an opening brief submitted to the Supreme Court, Ms Fitch wrote of ""sweeping policy advancements [which] now promote women's full pursuit of both career and family"". But in a counter-argument submitted to the Supreme Court, 154 economists warned that this optimism was ""premature and false"". ""Mississippi's celebration of parental leave policies is particularly bizarre, as the United States is one of only two countries without a national paid maternity leave policy,"" the economists wrote. Mississippi, specifically, has no state laws mandating paid family leave. It is the poorest state in the nation and has the highest rates of bothinfant mortality,externaland child poverty. But if Roe is indeed thrown out, Ms Fitch will return to Mississippi a conservative hero. ""I'm 99% sure she will run for attorney general again,"" Mr Dent said. ""And based on how the last three years have gone, it's hard for me to imagine she'll have any Republican opposition this time"". There are also early rumblings that she may one day run for governor. She has not yet commented on this speculation. If she wins, Ms Fitch would be the first female governor in Mississippi's history.

Chris Mason: Parties struggle with politics of pain,"The rail strike is on. Perhaps you're reading this in a long queue for the bus. Or packed on to one of the few trains that is running. The RMT trade union reckons the whole thing has been ""manufactured"" by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Mr Shapps claims it has been ""created by the unions."" So what will happen next, both on the railways and in the wider economy? Rail union says ministers prevented strike deal When is the rail strike and which trains are running? The government insists there is no point it getting directly involved in this dispute, arguing that you have to go back decades to find a cabinet minister involved in negotiations with a trade union. Sources also point out there have been around 60 meetings between the industry and the RMT on the fine details of the dispute, and the transport secretary wouldn't be saying anything different were he involved. As soon as next week we can expect ministers to introduce what is known as secondary legislation, a bolt-on to existing laws, that will allow people with the necessary transferrable skills to fill gaps left by striking workers. The plan from ministers in the longer term is a new law that requires a ""minimum service"" to be provided when there are public transport strikes, a promise the Conservatives made in their last election manifesto. In other words, the government is defiant - and so is the RMT. Labour argues all of this is a sign of government failure, but it finds itself in an awkward spot too. That's because, while the government has condemned the strikes, Labour is more careful in its language. It says it wishes the strikes weren't happening, but doesn't condemn them. Labour's Kate Osborne says she'll defy the leadership by picketing with RMT members And now a row is brewing because a note sent to shadow ministers by the party leadership says: ""Please be reminded that frontbenchers including PPSs should not be on picket lines."" A PPS is a parliamentary private secretary, an assistant to a frontbencher, but someone expected to toe the party line. ""Please speak to all the members of your team to remind them of this and confirm with me that you have done so,"" the note goes on. But Labour MP Kate Osborne, herself a PPS, has tweeted: ""Come what may, I will be on a picket line supporting workers tomorrow."" The general secretary of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, added: ""To instruct Labour MPs not to be on picket lines with workers speaks volumes. It's time to decide whose side you're on."" The context here, on the railways and in the wider economy, is Covid. Passenger numbers are down by a fifth, and an expensive fifth if you are a train operating company. Commuters and business travellers, who pay a premium to travel at peak times, are not travelling as much. For that reason, ministers argue, change is inevitable. But the union says it is absurd that there is full employment and yet falling wages. Which brings us to the bigger picture. Prices are rising at a speed not seen in 40 years. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, has said wages in the private and public sector can't keep up with these price rises, or inflation will get worse. The judgement of ministers, in other words, is the only way this gets better in the medium term is for the majority of people to feel poorer in the short term. That's quite a thing for a senior minister to say: Having less money now is a price worth paying for things getting better sooner. What will Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have to say? AsPaul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies puts it,external, ""the question for government is how to distribute the pain, across people and across time, not how to avoid it altogether. ""That's not possible. Different interest groups will, entirely understandably, fight their corner. But we can't all win."" Ministers are currently trying to work out how to sell this not entirely palatable message. We can expect a joint speech from the prime minister and the chancellor in the first couple of weeks of next month. It currently has the working title of A Plan for a Stronger Economy, but they've got to decide precisely what they want to say in it. ""One struggles to work out what their economic policy actually is,"" one former minister tells me. ""You need to look like you know what you want to do. ""They have lots of ideas, but it mustn't look random. And it does look random at the moment."" One idea that has been kicked around in recent weeks is return of those Covid-era Downing Street news conferences, perhaps every fortnight, with ministers, slides, graphs and experts. So alongside the chancellor might be an official from the Office for National Statistics, for instance. The rationale is that this would allow ministers to ""level with people"", which is government speak for telling us bad news.

UN whistleblowing complaints 'dismissed too early',"Purna Sen: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it?'"" Claims of sexual abuse and corruption at the United Nations should urgently be investigated by an independent panel, an ex-senior UN member has said. Purna Sen's comments follow a BBC investigation which revealed the sackings of a number of UN staff who tried to expose alleged wrongdoing. Ms Sen said the UN should ""step up"" and adopt any suggestions made by a panel. A spokesperson for the UN told the BBC it was focused on ensuring that people felt safe to report abuse. The BBC documentary,The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN, details allegations of corruption, management turning a blind eye to wrongdoing and sexual abuse. Staff members who tried to report allegations told the BBC they had been penalised after speaking out - and some were sacked. In the film, Ms Sen - who was appointed spokeswoman on harassment, assault and discrimination in 2018 - said there were women at the UN who had been ""approached, accosted and raped"". The more men were allowed to get away with it, she said, ""the more they will keep doing it"". She has told BBC Newsnight that she is not surprised by the ""deeply upsetting"" testimonies. ""It suggests that sometimes the protection of the senior folk within each organisation matters more than the absence of harm to those who aren't powerful. ""It means there is a real tension within an organisation which not only upholds and advocates for human rights, but is actually the birthplace of most of these human rights - yet it hasn't learned to bring them home to the people who work for that organisation."" Ms Sen said she wanted UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres to appoint a diverse external panel to consider staff experiences and recommend a focused set of actions. In a statement, Mr Guterres' office said it remained open to any external review of its efforts ""to combat misconduct of any kind"". The spokesman for the UN Secretary General, Stephane Dujarric, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the secretary general had ""taken this extremely seriously since he came into office"". ""We continue to do whatever we can to support victims and are focused on improving the systems and ensuring that people feel safe to report abuse,"" he added. When asked about external oversight, Mr Dujarric said: ""There is full transparency and we have an internal independent body that reports to the member states of the UN General Assembly."" ""We are not afraid of any scrutiny,"" he said, adding that ""we are doing whatever we can to break this climate of fear"". The United Nations has a protected legal status and senior staff have diplomatic immunity from all national laws. This is granted to the organisation to protect it from interference when doing its work. But the UN says it not granted for the personal benefit of staff, so does not protect those who commit crimes such as sexual assault. UN headquarters in New York, 2021 All staff complaints have to be addressed internally. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) handles the most serious allegations, including claims of criminality, but has no legal authority. The BBC was handed a secret recording which suggests the OIOS is not always effective. It features Ben Swanson, director of the investigations division, addressing a staff meeting. He says a senior UN female member of staff had come to him in tears, describing how an assistant secretary general had put his hand down her trousers. The UN has a number of assistant secretary generals. In the recording, Mr Swanson states that he told the secretary general and other senior officials of the sexual assault allegation - but was quickly shut down. ""So I tried to tell this story and I got... I was cut dead,""he can be heard saying. He added that the woman was discouraged from reporting her alleged assault and told it wouldn't do any good to speak up since the man in question was a ""favoured son"". ""I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top,"" says Peter Gallo Peter Gallo - the whistleblower who shared the audio recording - told the documentary: ""I spent four years as an investigator in the UN headquarters in New York. And as a result of that experience, I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top."" After hearing his account, Ms Sen said: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it? My zero-tolerance policy means we have to act.' Instead we get an account of 'No, we're not going there.'"" The office of the UN Secretary General says it remains committed to ""sanctioning any staff, junior or senior, found to have engaged in sexual harassment"". Martina Bostrom, a former senior advisor for UNAIDS, told the BBC she was also a victim of sexual harassment at work. ""Sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment in the UN happens in headquarters, it happens Monday to Friday. It happens during regular work hours, it happens everywhere,"" she said. Martina Brostrom: ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go"" She said she was targeted by Luiz Loures, UNAIDS deputy executive director and an assistant secretary general, who she described as being ""sleazy"" and known for his inappropriate behaviour. During a work event in Bangkok in 2015, she said he forcibly kissed and groped her in a lift as they left a meeting, before trying to drag her towards his room. ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go. I had to block myself with the elevator door to be able to stay in because I was afraid I was seeing that long corridor,"" she said. ""My brain was obviously working very, very, quickly and dreading what could happen."" Martina launched a formal complaint and spoke to UN investigators. The UN and UNAIDS ""retaliated in very mean and hurtful ways,"" she said. ""That's very painful because it's almost like being violated all over again. It's like they don't give you a chance to breathe."" In 2018, Luiz Loures retired from the UN and was thanked for ""his 22 years of dedicated service"". He told the BBC: ""I have never harassed nor assaulted anyone. The accusations made are unfounded."" The UN said: ""Allegations of harassment against Dr Loures were investigated,"" but at this time it was ""not in a position to comment on the veracity of these claims"". In August 2021 Martina received a letter from the UN that accepted that she was ""sexually harassed over a protracted period of time"" but, in regard to the allegation she was sexually assaulted in 2015, they concluded ""something traumatic happened to you consistent with your account of the situation"", but the findings ""did not meet the evidentiary standards"". Watch now on BBC iPlayer:The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN- or at 21:00 on Tuesday 21 June on BBC Two. Ms Sen said Martina's case was symptomatic of a wider problem at the UN. She told the documentary that an ""astonishing"" third of UN staff said they had experienced sexual harassment while working, but that the vast majority of cases had not been reported. ""What we do know about cases is just the tip of the iceberg and, this is a really important point, people feel there will be adverse consequences for reporting, they will be retaliated against. ""If I had been attacked or sexually assaulted, I would likely not have reported it. I would not put myself through that process."" UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres In a statement, the office of UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said there had been ""major improvements to fighting the scourge of sexual harassment, from which no organisation is immune"". It said measures included hiring female investigators to look into allegations, a hotline for staff to report misconduct and better training of senior management. But, speaking to BBC Newsnight, Ms Sen said accounts in the documentary suggested the UN had not fulfilled its promises of zero-tolerance and had ""a lot further to go"". ""Whether it's corruption, fraud, sexual harassment, [UN staff] feel they can't progress even to making a report, that the complaints are initially dismissed far too early. They're not given alternative procedures and appeals access,"" she said. ""The UN has certainly addressed some of the big failures it had before, but it hasn't gone far enough. I have seen things that are very troubling - that can and should be addressed as a matter of urgency, not just in words, but in deeds.""

Nine in 10 trains cancelled as rail strike begins,"The normally bustling Queen Street station in Glasgow has been quiet all day Railway stations have been virtually deserted as the first of three 24-hour rail strikes hits services in Scotland. ScotRail has cancelled 90% of its services while cross-border services were also badly affected. About 40,000 Network Rail staff are believed to have walked out at midnight on Tuesday in a dispute over pay, working conditions and redundancies. Last-ditch talks between the RMT union and Network Rail failed on Monday. It is thought thousands of regular passengers chose to work from home rather than attempt to commute on a vastly-reduced service. Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretary, blamed the ""dead hand"" of government for the dispute, saying ministers did not allow employers to negotiate freely. Live: Biggest national rail strike for 30 years begins PM calls for 'compromise' to end rail strike Which ScotRail trains will run during the strike? Major rail strikes to go ahead after talks fail UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said ""outdated unions"" were ""opposing progress"". Scotland's Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth urged the UK government to do more to end the stand-off. Further strikes are scheduled to take place on Thursday and Saturday but services are likely to be delays and cancellations even on non-strike days. ScotRail said there would be ""significant disruption across the country"" on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday caused by the staggered reopening of Network Rail signal boxes. As the first day of strike action unfolded: People were advised to plan ahead and only travel by rail if necessary Businesses said they were already feeling an impact on their takings The Scottish hospitality sector fears it could lose Â£50m in a week First Bus said it would try to run more buses ""where possible"" But the operator said it currently has a shortage of about 300 drivers Businesses in Scotland have been bracing themselves for an impact on their takings as a result of the strike. Leon Thompson, from UK Hospitality Scotland, predicted the sector was set for ""in excess of Â£50m of losses"" this week. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""We're looking at a situation where our fragile businesses are trying to move towards recovery. So it's a very, very difficult week. ""We're talking about businesses which have had two years of restrictions and lockdowns in place, which have severely impacted their ability to trade. ""They are carrying unprecedented levels of debt and they really need to have a good summer. Now this industrial action, which is essentially going to wipe out all business this week, is a real concern."" This is a major strike by any measure. It's the biggest pay dispute on the railways for 30 years. Almost 90% of Scottish services have had to be cancelled. No trains are running outside Scotland's central belt - so there's not a single service for Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness, the north or west coast. Only five ScotRail routes see any trains at all, and even these will be limited. All this underlines the crucial role played by signallers employed by Network Rail, whose strike action has crippled the railways. When they don't work, rail lines grind to a halt. It means disruption for rail passengers. But a fair number we've spoken to voice sympathy for the signallers' pay demand. The cost of living crisis and soaring inflation affect all but a lucky few. So when rail workers demand a pay rise, that chimes with some passengers - even those whose journeys are disrupted. But if the strike action drags on for weeks or months, will they be quite so understanding? For now, regular commuters may choose to work from home. That may blunt the impact of this strike. But it worries rail bosses, who desperately want to see passenger numbers return to where they were before the pandemic - from the 70% level we see right now. ScotRail services are already hit hard by industrial action from train drivers. They are set to vote on a pay deal worth more than 5% in the coming weeks. Thousands of ScotRail workers are also being offered a similar deal. If these are any sort of benchmark, signallers will hold out for a more generous deal than the 3% they are being offered by Network Rail. If that happens, it could be a long, frustrating year on Scotland's railways. And much now depends on Network Rail's owner, the UK government, who set the limits for any pay deal. Richard Muir, deputy chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said a lack of reliable public transport ""has a direct affect on our economy and the businesses that rely on it"". One of Scotland's main bus operators, First Bus, said it was prepared for increased demand on strike days but a shortage of 300 drivers meant its ability to provide extra services would be ""significantly limited"". Its managing director Duncan Cameron told BBC Scotland that despite still not being back to pre-pandemic levels, bus travel ""massively overweighs rail use across the country"", carrying passengers on about 74% of public transport journeys. He said: ""It will be difficult for rail users over the coming days with no rail running, but given those margins we believe we can accommodate those who want to move to bus, and where possible we will introduce additional vehicle capacity to do that."" Only a few people were at the usually packed Central Station in Glasgow National Express said coaches were also in high demand but warned it was not possible for the firm to match the demand of the rail network. ""We do expect and are prepared to be busy but also recommend that customers allow plenty of time when planning their journey,"" a spokesman said. This dispute between the RMT union and the companies which run Britain's railway centres on pay, job losses and changes to workers' terms and conditions. ScotRail staff are not invovled but the train operator, which was nationalised on 1 April, relies on Network Rail workers to operate signal boxes and maintain the track across the UK. The RMT said Network Rail's plans to cut 2,500 jobs would put safety at risk and has warned that strikes could continue over the next six months. Network Rail Scotland spokesman Nick King said: ""We are still keen to reach a resolution with the union, postpone further strike action if we can, but any deal that is done has to be fair on both our workers and on the taxpayer, who ultimately funds Network Rail's operations."" There was a picket line at Glasgow Central Station on Tuesday On Monday, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the House of Commons that rail workers were endangering their livelihoods by taking industrial action. He said the UK government had plans for rail reform and a more ""agile, flexible workforce - not one that strikes every time someone suggests a change to the railways"". Jenny Gilruth, Scotland's cabinet secretary for transport, called on Mr Shapps ""to seek a resolution to this dispute, as quickly as possible, for the benefit of staff and passengers alike"". Gordon Martin, RMT organiser, told BBC Scotland they had been ""forced"" to take strike action. ""This is of the UK government's making,"" he said. ""We have been forced into this as a defensive measure. Our members' jobs and livelihoods are at risk here. ""More importantly, the safety of the rail infrastructure is at risk and safety in railway stations and on trains is at risk.""

"Rolls Royce staff to get Â£2,000 payment","A union representing Rolls-Royce workers has rejected the offer of a Â£2,000 one-off payment from the firm to help its staff with the rising cost of living. Of the 14,000 staff at Rolls-Royce who were eligible for the payment, 11,000 members are unionised. Unite said the offer ""falls far short of the real cost of living challenges which our members are experiencing"". But Rolls-Royce said the offer was ""fair"" and ""a good deal"" for staff. The lump sum, which was intended for junior management and shop floor staff, was due to begin being rolled out in August, starting with the 3,000 non-unionised staff before being paid to the remaining 11,000 unionised workers. Unite's regional secretary Paresh Patel said the union was still in negotiations with Rolls-Royce about the pay offer. News of the offer emerged on Monday night, and was later confirmed by Rolls-Royce. However, Unite said: ""The fact that Rolls-Royce has made this announcement in the way that it has certainly in our view undermines the trade union and the negotiating position that should be between the employer and the unions on this matter."" Rolls-Royce had also offered workers a 4% increase in pay, back-dated to March. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson had told the BBC it would be ""the highest annual pay rise for at least a decade"" for its shop floor staff. But Unite said it would also reject that offer of a 4% pay rise. There are ongoing discussions with unions about a pay settlement for 2022-2023, Rolls-Royce's spokesperson said, and the cost of living issue is to be a factor in those negotiations. In response to Unite's rejection of the offer, the spokesperson said: ""This is a good deal for our colleagues that is fair and competitive, with an immediate cash lump sum to help them through the current exceptional economic climate. ""We will continue to talk to our people."" Why are prices rising so quickly? When might the inflation rate come down? Meanwhile, around 115,000 Royal Mail workers are voting on strike action in a similar row over pay. The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents many Royal Mail staff, said it would be claiming for an ""inflation-based, no-strings pay award"", adding that Royal Mail's offer of a 2% pay award was ""miles away from where inflation is, totally inadequate"". Pay rates and measures to help UK staff have been increasing as businesses have been seeking to recruit and retain staff, after official figures showed there were fewer unemployed people than job vacancies for the first time since records began. Earlier this month,Lloyds Bank staff were offered a Â£1,000 lump sum to help with rising costs, after Unite the Union demonstrated outside its annual general meeting. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - currently stands at 9%, and is expected to increase again later this year. It seems one-off cost of living payments are gaining in popularity among employers - but are they a short-term fix to a long-term issue? The nature of inflation means that while the rate of price rises may slow next year, it is extremely unlikely that the cost of living will actually drop. Prices are almost certainly not going to fall. Yet, these payments are not embedded in future wages, unlike a regular pay increase. As employees continue to find it tough, will there be pressure on bosses to make these payments a permanent part of pay next year and beyond? There is undoubtedly an awareness among businesses that workers, particularly the lower-paid, need more financial help at the moment to cover their bills. But perhaps this eye-catching tactic of one-off payments is directed more at another issue - the retention and recruitment of staff.

PM calls for 'compromise' to end rail strike,"Calls for the government to get involved in rail strike negotiations have been dismissed as a stunt by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Only 20% of trains are understood to be running during strikes as Boris Johnson urged commuters to ""stay the course"". Mick Lynch, secretary general of the RMT union, said talks collapsed on Monday after a compulsory redundancy notice was issued. Millions of passengers in England, Wales and Scotland face disruption. Passengers are being advised to avoid all but essential travel, after staff at Network Rail and 13 rail operators walked out at midnight. Further strikes are planned for Thursday and Saturday. Trains that do run will start later and finish much earlier than usual - between 07:30 and 18:30. The RMT is striking over what it calls ""an aggressive agenda"" of cuts to jobs, conditions, pay and pensions. This video can not be played RMT chief Mick Lynch says negations with Network Rail ""can't get past first base"" Mr Lynch told the BBC's Today programme: ""We're sorry for that [disruption to people's lives], we don't want that to happen."" He added that Network Rail had issued a statutory notice of redundancy on Monday ""rather than revise their current proposals."" He added the government, which owns Network Rail, had been actively preventing employers and the union from reaching a settlement, although ministers have denied they played a role in talks. But Mr Shapps said he does not meet with unions as that was for employers to do, describing calls for him to come to the negotiating table ""a stunt"" and said there was a ""pay offer on the table, the door is open"". He told the BBC Breakfast: ""The reality is they're using it as a camouflage for the fact they've walked out of the talks that they should be in with their employers."" This video can not be played Watch: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps rejects calls to meet with union leaders The transport secretary added he would change the law in the next two months to permit workers with transferable skills to do a role left vacant by a striking worker. He said: ""It means that if some person is sat in Network Rail's control room and they're sat at a screen, at the moment they may not move to another screen even though they're fully qualified to do so, without union permission for example. ""This makes no sense. It's not the way that any normal business or organisation would operate. ""You're changing what is called agency, but it actually will allow us to have transferrable skills from within Network Rail."" Speaking at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the strikes as ""causing significant disruption and inconvenience""making it more difficult for people to get to work, risking peoples' appointments and making it more difficult for children to sit exams. ""I want to emphasise to everybody this morning why I think those strikes are so wrong and unnecessary."" He added: ""We need, I'm afraid, everybody - and I say this to the country as a whole - we need to get ready to stay the course. ""To stay the course, because these reforms, these improvements in the way we run our railways are in the interests of the travelling public, they will help to cut costs for farepayers up and down the country."" Which lines are affected? How much are rail workers paid? Agency staff could cover strikes under law change 'My stag do plans are in ruins due to strikes' The RMT union is asking for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the rising cost of living, but it says employers have offered a maximum of 3% - on condition they also accept job cuts and changes to working practices. This video can not be played Watch: Rail users are braced for days of disruption The Bank of England has forecast that inflation is set to hit 11% in the autumn, with prices rising at the fastest rate for 40 years. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Christine Jardine, told BBC Breakfast: ""People have been let down; police, health workers, students and children with exams this morning, teachers thinking how are they going get into schools. It's not good enough."" CEO of Network Rail, Andrew Haines, said the government ""has not been the constraining factor in negotiations"" and, for the right deal ""we could go above"" the 3% pay rise. I'm typing this heading east, when I need to head west. Like millions of others, my journey today is a bit of a long winded bodge job. But I'm lucky, at least it looks possible. You've probably read, heard or seen the language from the RMT union and the language from the government. For now, at least, neither side want to budge. And plenty at Westminster expect plenty more strikes, and not just on the railways. What we are seeing are the symptoms of a collision between the economics and politics of the last decade or so, dating back to the financial crisis, and the reality of now: this post Covid, war in Europe world. In other words, workers in much of the private and particularly the public sector were already feeling squeezed before this crunch. Sluggish wage growth at best, and for many real terms cuts. The government then spent big time during the pandemic. Next, Covid and the war in Ukraine led to accelerating prices. Now ministers fear big public sector pay deals would not only be vastly expensive, but could make the big problem with price rises â inflation â worse. Read more. Mr Lynch said industrial action would run ""as long as it needs to"", saying the strikes could last months if a deal was not reached. Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh earlier accused Mr Shapps of not giving train operating companies ""any mandate to negotiate"", saying the talks were a ""sham"". Although ScotRail and Transport for Wales are not part of the dispute, services in Scotland and Wales are also affected because they rely on Network Rail staff. ScotRail said 90% of trains will be cancelled during the three days of industrial action.

UN whistleblowing complaints 'dismissed far too early',"Purna Sen: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it?'"" Claims of sexual abuse and corruption at the United Nations should urgently be investigated by an independent panel, an ex-senior UN member has said. Purna Sen's comments follow a BBC investigation which revealed the sackings of a number of UN staff who tried to expose alleged wrongdoing. Ms Sen said the UN should ""step up"" and adopt any suggestions made by a panel. A spokesperson for the UN told the BBC it was focused on ensuring that people felt safe to report abuse. The BBC documentary,The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN, details allegations of corruption, management turning a blind eye to wrongdoing and sexual abuse. Staff members who tried to report allegations told the BBC they had been penalised after speaking out - and some were sacked. In the film, Ms Sen - who was appointed spokeswoman on harassment, assault and discrimination in 2018 - said there were women at the UN who had been ""approached, accosted and raped"". The more men were allowed to get away with it, she said, ""the more they will keep doing it"". She has told BBC Newsnight that she is not surprised by the ""deeply upsetting"" testimonies. ""It suggests that sometimes the protection of the senior folk within each organisation matters more than the absence of harm to those who aren't powerful. ""It means there is a real tension within an organisation which not only upholds and advocates for human rights, but is actually the birthplace of most of these human rights - yet it hasn't learned to bring them home to the people who work for that organisation."" Ms Sen said she wanted UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres to appoint a diverse external panel to consider staff experiences and recommend a focused set of actions. In a statement, Mr Guterres' office said it remained open to any external review of its efforts ""to combat misconduct of any kind"". The spokesman for the UN Secretary General, Stephane Dujarric, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the secretary general had ""taken this extremely seriously since he came into office"". ""We continue to do whatever we can to support victims and are focused on improving the systems and ensuring that people feel safe to report abuse,"" he added. When asked about external oversight, Mr Dujarric said: ""There is full transparency and we have an internal independent body that reports to the member states of the UN General Assembly."" ""We are not afraid of any scrutiny,"" he said, adding that ""we are doing whatever we can to break this climate of fear"". The United Nations has a protected legal status and senior staff have diplomatic immunity from all national laws. This is granted to the organisation to protect it from interference when doing its work. But the UN says it not granted for the personal benefit of staff, so does not protect those who commit crimes such as sexual assault. UN headquarters in New York, 2021 All staff complaints have to be addressed internally. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) handles the most serious allegations, including claims of criminality, but has no legal authority. The BBC was handed a secret recording which suggests the OIOS is not always effective. It features Ben Swanson, director of the investigations division, addressing a staff meeting. He says a senior UN female member of staff had come to him in tears, describing how an assistant secretary general had put his hand down her trousers. The UN has a number of assistant secretary generals. In the recording, Mr Swanson states that he told the secretary general and other senior officials of the sexual assault allegation - but was quickly shut down. ""So I tried to tell this story and I got... I was cut dead,""he can be heard saying. He added that the woman was discouraged from reporting her alleged assault and told it wouldn't do any good to speak up since the man in question was a ""favoured son"". ""I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top,"" says Peter Gallo Peter Gallo - the whistleblower who shared the audio recording - told the documentary: ""I spent four years as an investigator in the UN headquarters in New York. And as a result of that experience, I believe the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top."" After hearing his account, Ms Sen said: ""Why is the secretary general not saying, 'This is outrageous, what do we do about it? My zero-tolerance policy means we have to act.' Instead we get an account of 'No, we're not going there.'"" The office of the UN Secretary General says it remains committed to ""sanctioning any staff, junior or senior, found to have engaged in sexual harassment"". Martina Bostrom, a former senior advisor for UNAIDS, told the BBC she was also a victim of sexual harassment at work. ""Sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment in the UN happens in headquarters, it happens Monday to Friday. It happens during regular work hours, it happens everywhere,"" she said. Martina Brostrom: ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go"" She said she was targeted by Luiz Loures, UNAIDS deputy executive director and an assistant secretary general, who she described as being ""sleazy"" and known for his inappropriate behaviour. During a work event in Bangkok in 2015, she said he forcibly kissed and groped her in a lift as they left a meeting, before trying to drag her towards his room. ""I pleaded with him to stop, let me go. I had to block myself with the elevator door to be able to stay in because I was afraid I was seeing that long corridor,"" she said. ""My brain was obviously working very, very, quickly and dreading what could happen."" Martina launched a formal complaint and spoke to UN investigators. The UN and UNAIDS ""retaliated in very mean and hurtful ways,"" she said. ""That's very painful because it's almost like being violated all over again. It's like they don't give you a chance to breathe."" In 2018, Luiz Loures retired from the UN and was thanked for ""his 22 years of dedicated service"". He told the BBC: ""I have never harassed nor assaulted anyone. The accusations made are unfounded."" The UN said: ""Allegations of harassment against Dr Loures were investigated,"" but at this time it was ""not in a position to comment on the veracity of these claims"". In August 2021 Martina received a letter from the UN that accepted that she was ""sexually harassed over a protracted period of time"" but, in regard to the allegation she was sexually assaulted in 2015, they concluded ""something traumatic happened to you consistent with your account of the situation"", but the findings ""did not meet the evidentiary standards"". Watch now on BBC iPlayer:The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN- or at 21:00 on Tuesday 21 June on BBC Two. Ms Sen said Martina's case was symptomatic of a wider problem at the UN. She told the documentary that an ""astonishing"" third of UN staff said they had experienced sexual harassment while working, but that the vast majority of cases had not been reported. ""What we do know about cases is just the tip of the iceberg and, this is a really important point, people feel there will be adverse consequences for reporting, they will be retaliated against. ""If I had been attacked or sexually assaulted, I would likely not have reported it. I would not put myself through that process."" UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres In a statement, the office of UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said there had been ""major improvements to fighting the scourge of sexual harassment, from which no organisation is immune"". It said measures included hiring female investigators to look into allegations, a hotline for staff to report misconduct and better training of senior management. But, speaking to BBC Newsnight, Ms Sen said accounts in the documentary suggested the UN had not fulfilled its promises of zero-tolerance and had ""a lot further to go"". ""Whether it's corruption, fraud, sexual harassment, [UN staff] feel they can't progress even to making a report, that the complaints are initially dismissed far too early. They're not given alternative procedures and appeals access,"" she said. ""The UN has certainly addressed some of the big failures it had before, but it hasn't gone far enough. I have seen things that are very troubling - that can and should be addressed as a matter of urgency, not just in words, but in deeds.""

"Rolls Royce staff to get Â£2,000 paymentMore than 14,000 workers could get a one-off sum after firm holds talks with union.Business","A union representing Rolls-Royce workers has rejected the offer of a Â£2,000 one-off payment from the firm to help its staff with the rising cost of living. Of the 14,000 staff at Rolls-Royce who were eligible for the payment, 11,000 members are unionised. Unite said the offer ""falls far short of the real cost of living challenges which our members are experiencing"". But Rolls-Royce said the offer was ""fair"" and ""a good deal"" for staff. The lump sum, which was intended for junior management and shop floor staff, was due to begin being rolled out in August, starting with the 3,000 non-unionised staff before being paid to the remaining 11,000 unionised workers. Unite's regional secretary Paresh Patel said the union was still in negotiations with Rolls-Royce about the pay offer. News of the offer emerged on Monday night, and was later confirmed by Rolls-Royce. However, Unite said: ""The fact that Rolls-Royce has made this announcement in the way that it has certainly in our view undermines the trade union and the negotiating position that should be between the employer and the unions on this matter."" Rolls-Royce had also offered workers a 4% increase in pay, back-dated to March. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson had told the BBC it would be ""the highest annual pay rise for at least a decade"" for its shop floor staff. But Unite said it would also reject that offer of a 4% pay rise. There are ongoing discussions with unions about a pay settlement for 2022-2023, Rolls-Royce's spokesperson said, and the cost of living issue is to be a factor in those negotiations. In response to Unite's rejection of the offer, the spokesperson said: ""This is a good deal for our colleagues that is fair and competitive, with an immediate cash lump sum to help them through the current exceptional economic climate. ""We will continue to talk to our people."" Why are prices rising so quickly? When might the inflation rate come down? Meanwhile, around 115,000 Royal Mail workers are voting on strike action in a similar row over pay. The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents many Royal Mail staff, said it would be claiming for an ""inflation-based, no-strings pay award"", adding that Royal Mail's offer of a 2% pay award was ""miles away from where inflation is, totally inadequate"". Pay rates and measures to help UK staff have been increasing as businesses have been seeking to recruit and retain staff, after official figures showed there were fewer unemployed people than job vacancies for the first time since records began. Earlier this month,Lloyds Bank staff were offered a Â£1,000 lump sum to help with rising costs, after Unite the Union demonstrated outside its annual general meeting. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - currently stands at 9%, and is expected to increase again later this year. It seems one-off cost of living payments are gaining in popularity among employers - but are they a short-term fix to a long-term issue? The nature of inflation means that while the rate of price rises may slow next year, it is extremely unlikely that the cost of living will actually drop. Prices are almost certainly not going to fall. Yet, these payments are not embedded in future wages, unlike a regular pay increase. As employees continue to find it tough, will there be pressure on bosses to make these payments a permanent part of pay next year and beyond? There is undoubtedly an awareness among businesses that workers, particularly the lower-paid, need more financial help at the moment to cover their bills. But perhaps this eye-catching tactic of one-off payments is directed more at another issue - the retention and recruitment of staff. Rolls-Royce was badly impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic, which hit demand for its aircraft engines as international air travel ground to a halt. In 2020it announced plans to cut its global workforce by 9,000by the end of this year, with 3,000 of those jobs going in the UK.

Major rail strikes to go ahead after talks fail,"This video can not be played Watch: Mick Lynch, RMT general-secretary: ""This dispute has been manufactured by Shapps"" Passengers in England, Scotland and Wales face severe disruption after last-ditch talks failed to stop the biggest rail strikes in 30 years. Thousands of staff at Network Rail and 13 rail operators are due to walk out on Tuesday, affecting most major lines. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT rail union, blamed the ""dead hand"" of government, saying ministers did not allow employers to negotiate freely. The transport secretary said ""outdated unions"" were ""opposing progress"". Grant Shapps said about 20% of services were expected to run during the strikes on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, focusing on key workers, main population centres and critical freight routes. Services are expected to be affected from Monday evening, with disruption continuing on non-strike days this week. This video can not be played WATCH: Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps speaking in the House of Commons: ""Strikes created by the unions"" The RMT, which represents rail workers ranging from catering staff to signallers, is calling for a pay rise of at least 7%. The union said employers have only offered 2%, with the possibility of 1% more, on the condition that workers accept proposed job cuts and changes to working practices. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said ""no strike is inevitable until the moment it begins"", but urged passengers to travel by train only if necessary. Aspecial train timetable,externalfor 20 to 26 June was published on Friday. A strike willalso take place across the London Underground on Tuesday. Live: Train strikes to go ahead after last-ditch talks fail Which lines will be affected by the strike? How much are rail workers paid? Talks were held on Monday afternoon to avert the strikes but the sides remained deadlocked, Mr Lynch said, accusing the government of interfering to prevent a deal. ""What we've come to understand is the dead hand of this Tory government is all over this dispute and the fingerprints of Grant Shapps and the DNA of [chancellor] Rishi Sunak are all over the problems on the railway,"" he said. ""Until they allow these employers to negotiate freely I can't see we're going to get a resolution."" He said staff were faced with thousands of job cuts, reduced pensions, worse terms and conditions, and a cut in real-terms pay as inflation soars. Mr Lynch said there was also a plan to close every ticket office in Britain. The Department for Transport said no final decision had been made, but said it was ""absurd"" to suggest it wanted to close every booking office. 'I'm set to lose hundreds thanks to rail strikes' The transport secretary has denied the government intervened in the dispute, saying ""no minsters have ever been involved directly in these strike negotiations"" and only the employers and union could reach an agreement. In the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the government could no longer tolerate rail unions using their right to strike ""without any regard for how the rights of others are disrupted"". He said minimum service legislation, which requires train companies to maintain a base level of service even during strikes, was part of the solution. The short answer to this is yes. The transport secretary says he does not want to get involved in a dispute between the RMT on one side and Network Rail and the train operating companies (TOCs) on the other, but the interaction between the two employers means the government has a pivotal role. According to government officials, Network Rail is in theory able to offer a higher pay settlement than the 3% they are currently offering by shuffling their large and complex overall budget. However, the government accepts that any pay offer to Network Rail employees would set the bar for a settlement for the train operating companies. Since the government is now also standing as the financial backstop to the Covid-ravaged train operating companies, that could frustrate its stated ambition of putting the rail industry on a sustainable financial footing given that revenues for the train companies are still languishing just above half their pre-pandemic levels. The government may not be in the room but it is at the table. Mr Shapps told MPs rail unions were preventing the industry from updating ""obsolete working practices"", such as voluntary Sunday working - which he blamed for the cancellation of 170 trains before the Euro 2020 final last year. He said it was ""factually incorrect"" to say the strike is about a pay freeze and said reforms for the railways would include a ""decent annual pay rise"" for staff. ""It's about outdated unions opposing progress, progress that will secure the future of the railway,"" he said. Addressing union members directly, he said: ""Your union bosses have got you striking under false pretences and, rather than protecting your jobs, they are actually endangering them and the railway's future."" Labour said that if the strikes go ahead, they will represent a ""catastrophic failure of leadership"" by ministers. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said of Mr Shapps: ""Not only has he been boycotting the talks, he's tied the hands of those at the table."" She said Mr Shapps had not given train operating companies ""any mandate to negotiate"" and the talks were ""a sham, because ministers have set them up to fail"". Network Rail says the last trains between many major cities are expected to depart over the course of Monday afternoon, before more than 40,000 rail workers walk out. The strike begins at 00:01 BST on Tuesday. Although ScotRail and Transport for Wales are not involved in the dispute, train services will be disrupted as the railways rely on Network Rail staff. ScotRailsaid 90% of trains will be cancelledduring the three days of strike action. The reduced timetable will be in place until Sunday, with just 20% of usual services running on strike days. Trains that do run will start later and finish much earlier than usual - between 07:30 and 18:30. South Western Railway,externalsaid it will run a ""severely reduced timetable"" on strike days, with significant sections of the network closed and a very limited service between 07:15 and 18:30 BST on some routes for those who have to travel. Great Western Railway,externalwill only operate 30% of its usual timetabled services on strike days and about 50% on non-strike days. West Midlands Railway,external, which will run a limited service on a small number of routes, urged customers to travel only if it is essential and if ""no other transport option is available"". Knock-on disruption is expected on the roads, with motorists being warned to expected a surge in traffic. Motoring group the AA says drivers in Scotland and Wales should expect to face long queues as most railway lines will be closed. The M74, M8 and A9 in Scotland and the M4, A55, A5, and A483 in Wales could see severe traffic, it says. The RAC says major city routes and those serving the home counties are likely to see some of the biggest increases in traffic volumes. The strikes will affect a number of events including school exams and thefirst Glastonbury Festival for three years. Can I get a refund?Yes, if you cannot get your train due to strike action. Season-ticket holders can apply for a refund for the days affected. Find more infohere,external. Do I have to go to work or school?This is up to your individual employer or school, check with them. How can I plan my train journey?Use theNational Rail journey planner,external. Read morehere. Leaders at 13 trade unions and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) have jointly written to Mr Shapps urging him to ""help deliver a fair resolution"". The Labour Party has also called on the government to step in. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said nobody took strike action lightly but argued low-paid rail staff such as caterers and cleaners had been left with ""no other option"". ""It's insulting to ask them to take yet another real-terms pay cut when rail companies took Â£500m in profits during the pandemic,"" she said. Rail Delivery Group chair Steve Montgomery said that passenger numbers were at 80% of pre-pandemic levels and the industry wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"". Meanwhile,under new legislation the government is expectedto introduce this week, employers would be able to replace striking workers with agency staff. The new law, which is likely to come into force from mid-July, has been criticised by the Trades Union Congress and the recruitment industry for undermining the right to strike and creating safety risks.

PM urges 'sensible compromise' to end rail strike,"Calls for the government to get involved in rail strike negotiations have been dismissed as a stunt by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Only 20% of trains are understood to be running during strikes as Boris Johnson urged commuters to ""stay the course"". Mick Lynch, secretary general of the RMT union, said talks collapsed on Monday after a compulsory redundancy notice was issued. Millions of passengers in England, Wales and Scotland face disruption. Passengers are being advised to avoid all but essential travel, after staff at Network Rail and 13 rail operators walked out at midnight. Further strikes are planned for Thursday and Saturday. Trains that do run will start later and finish much earlier than usual - between 07:30 and 18:30. The RMT is striking over what it calls ""an aggressive agenda"" of cuts to jobs, conditions, pay and pensions. This video can not be played RMT chief Mick Lynch says negations with Network Rail ""can't get past first base"" Mr Lynch told the BBC's Today programme: ""We're sorry for that [disruption to people's lives], we don't want that to happen."" He added that Network Rail had issued a statutory notice of redundancy on Monday ""rather than revise their current proposals."" He added the government, which owns Network Rail, had been actively preventing employers and the union from reaching a settlement, although ministers have denied they played a role in talks. But Mr Shapps said he does not meet with unions as that was for employers to do, describing calls for him to come to the negotiating table ""a stunt"" and said there was a ""pay offer on the table, the door is open"". He told the BBC Breakfast: ""The reality is they're using it as a camouflage for the fact they've walked out of the talks that they should be in with their employers.""

He said: ""It means that if some person is sat in Network Rail's control room and they're sat at a screen, at the moment they may not move to another screen even though they're fully qualified to do so, without union permission for example. ""This makes no sense. It's not the way that any normal business or organisation would operate. ""You're changing what is called agency, but it actually will allow us to have transferrable skills from within Network Rail."" Speaking at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the strikes as ""causing significant disruption and inconvenience""making it more difficult for people to get to work, risking peoples' appointments and making it more difficult for children to sit exams. ""I want to emphasise to everybody this morning why I think those strikes are so wrong and unnecessary."" He added: ""We need, I'm afraid, everybody - and I say this to the country as a whole - we need to get ready to stay the course. ""To stay the course, because these reforms, these improvements in the way we run our railways are in the interests of the travelling public, they will help to cut costs for farepayers up and down the country."" Which lines are affected? How much are rail workers paid? Agency staff could cover strikes under law change 'My stag do plans are in ruins due to strikes' The RMT union is asking for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the rising cost of living, but it says employers have offered a maximum of 3% - on condition they also accept job cuts and changes to working practices. This video can not be played Watch: Rail users are braced for days of disruption The Bank of England has forecast that inflation is set to hit 11% in the autumn, with prices rising at the fastest rate for 40 years. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Christine Jardine, told BBC Breakfast: ""People have been let down; police, health workers, students and children with exams this morning, teachers thinking how are they going get into schools. It's not good enough."" CEO of Network Rail, Andrew Haines, said the government ""has not been the constraining factor in negotiations"" and, for the right deal ""we could go above"" the 3% pay rise. I'm typing this heading east, when I need to head west. Like millions of others, my journey today is a bit of a long winded bodge job. But I'm lucky, at least it looks possible. You've probably read, heard or seen the language from the RMT union and the language from the government. For now, at least, neither side want to budge. And plenty at Westminster expect plenty more strikes, and not just on the railways. What we are seeing are the symptoms of a collision between the economics and politics of the last decade or so, dating back to the financial crisis, and the reality of now: this post Covid, war in Europe world. In other words, workers in much of the private and particularly the public sector were already feeling squeezed before this crunch. Sluggish wage growth at best, and for many real terms cuts. The government then spent big time during the pandemic. Next, Covid and the war in Ukraine led to accelerating prices. Now ministers fear big public sector pay deals would not only be vastly expensive, but could make the big problem with price rises â inflation â worse. Read more. Mr Lynch said industrial action would run ""as long as it needs to"", saying the strikes could last months if a deal was not reached. Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh earlier accused Mr Shapps of not giving train operating companies ""any mandate to negotiate"", saying the talks were a ""sham"". Although ScotRail and Transport for Wales are not part of the dispute, services in Scotland and Wales are also affected because they rely on Network Rail staff. ScotRail said 90% of trains will be cancelled during the three days of industrial action.
