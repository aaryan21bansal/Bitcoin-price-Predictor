Soaring temperatures prompt wildfire warnings,"An amber extreme heat warning has come into force, with temperatures forecast to hit 37C (99F) in some parts of the UK over the next four days. The Met Office alert for southern and central England and parts of Wales runs from midnight on Thursday until Sunday. It has also issued its highest alert for fire severity over the weekend, warning there is an ""exceptional"" risk of blazes spreading in many places. The highest temperature on Thursday was 34.2C, at Wiggonholt in West Sussex. Firefighters have urged the public to help them prevent fires. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Jonathan Smith said he wanted to avoid scenes in July ""where people lost their homes and livelihoods"". ""In the first week of August last year, we attended 42 grassland and wildland fires, the same week this year we've attended 340,"" he said. ""Please don't barbecue in open spaces or balconies, throw your rubbish away safely and put your cigarettes out properly."" Mr Smith also warned people against using barbecues on balconies, saying they could lead to hot ash moving ""very quickly"". In some areas, wildfires have broken out due to the heat. In Ryton, Gateshead, firefighters spent more than 24 hours tackling a fire which started in a field. While the record-breaking temperatures seen in July, when the mercurytopped 40C (104F) for the first time, are not expected this week, the heat in some areas could get close to local or regional records. ""Temperatures won't be as high. But the big difference with this current heatwave is that it's much more prolonged,"" said BBC Weather forecaster Matt Taylor. ""We've already seen temperatures above 30C every day this week - Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday - and that will continue until Sunday."" Temperatures could reach 35C and peak at 37C in some areas between the Midlands and London, he added. They are also forecast to stay above 33C in some parts of south Wales over the next few days. St Athan recorded a high of 33.2C on Thursday. The high temperatures and dry conditions have also been causing problems across Europe - withmore than 1,000 firefighters battling a ""monster"" wildfire in Francethat has destroyed nearly 7,000 hectares of forest. The Met Office's fire severity index, which assesses how severe a blaze could become, is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. This will rise to ""exceptional"" - the highest level of risk - for parts of England and Wales by the weekend, whilea warning for ""very high"" risk of wildfiresacross southern and eastern Scotland has been put in place until Monday.

'Significant' wildfires but fire services 'coping' This video can not be played WATCH: Weather presenter Stav Danaos explains why the UK is facing an amber heat warning The period between January and June this year wasthe driest in England in 46 years, prompting warnings about the effects on agriculture, nature and wildlife. More than three inches of extra rain, in addition to what would normally be expected, is needed to overcome the dry conditions in parts of southern England, but no rain is forecast any time soon. Analysis by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology found low or even exceptionally low river flows and groundwater levels were likely to continue for the next three months in southern England and Wales. Water companies are being urged to protect essential supplies into a dry autumn, and three firms have already implemented hosepipe bans.

The company, with 15 million customers across London and the Thames Valley,was forced on Wednesday to hand out bottled waterfor residents in the village of Northend in Oxfordshire after supplies were disrupted due to a technical issue at a local reservoir. Elsewhere, drinks breaks are to be implemented during Premier League fixtures this weekend to help footballers in the hot weather. Water levels have severely dropped exposing the unseen trees and rocks at Cornwall's largest lake and reservoir, Colliford Lake Water companies have faced criticism for bringing in hosepipe bans while just under 3 billion litres (660 million gallons) of water is lost to leaks every day in England and Wales - equivalent to 1,180 Olympic swimming pools. Stuart Colville from Water UK said there were ""hundreds of people out today and across the week"" fixing leaks, adding that leakage was currently at its lowest level on record. He said it was a ""constant battle"" fixing leaks, particularly in hot and dry conditions when soil dries, moves and puts pressure on pipes ""causing additional bursts"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Colville said it was looking ""increasingly inevitable"" that the Environment Agency would declare a drought in England. An official droughtis expected to be declared on Friday,according to water industry insiders, meaning the Environment Agency would have more control over water supply. TheWales Drought Liaison group,including environment, health and water professionals, is also looking at the effect of the prolonged dry weather. One farmer in Horsham, Sussex said it had been ""an exceptional year"" and described his land as being like a ""Sussex savannah"". Speaking on BBC Radio 2, David Exwood emphasised the ""extreme risk"" of taking barbecues into the countryside - explaining how hard and dry the ground was. The extreme heat may also cause disruption to train services, but it is not expected to be on the same scale as seen in July. Network Rail is not bringing in a country-wide blanket speed restriction, but some local services might have restrictions with concerns rail temperatures could reach 55C or higher. Meanwhile, people are being advised to look out for those who are older or vulnerable, as well as young children, after the UK Health Security Agency issued a heat health alert until Sunday for parts of central, southern and northern England. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

"Energy profits are not evil, says Truss","Liz Truss has defended earnings at energy companies amid soaring price rises, saying profits should not be considered ""dirty and evil"". The Tory leadership hopeful said windfall taxes on profits - urged by some to fund help for households - were about ""bashing business"". She said cutting taxes was the best way to help with living costs over winter. But rival Rishi Sunak said millions would be left at risk of destitution without more energy payments. He has proposed spending billions of pounds on further payments to pensioners and the low paid over winter, arguing tax cuts won't help them enough. Mr Sunak has alsowritten in The Times,externalto confirm he would be willing to borrow to fund these costs as a ""last resort"", if they could not be found through ""savings across Whitehall"" or cuts to government spending. Meanwhile Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said new cost-of-living policies will be ""ready to go"" when the new prime minister takes office on 5 September. Speaking on a visit to the Airbus factory in Broughton in north Wales, Mr Zahawi told broadcasters: ""We're looking at all the options of what additional help we need to bring in later on in the winter months."" The BBC has been told one option could include expanding the windfall tax on energy companies. The current windfall tax - also called the energy profits levy - applies only to oil and gas firms, but there has been speculation about extending it to electricity generators. How best to respond to surging energy prices has become a key battleground in the contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. Meet the overseas Tories picking the next PM How high will my energy bill go? Rishi Sunak vows more support for energy costs Energy has come to dominate the contest in recent days, after prices wereforecast to riseto more than Â£4,000 per year next year for typical households. Energy companies have posted bumper profits in recent months amid soaring gas and oil prices, prompting calls to tax them further to help with rising bills. Earlier this month, BP reported its biggest quarterly profit in 14 years - $8.45bn (Â£6.9bn) - while Shell posted a record profit of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak introduced a 25% windfall tax to the profits of the oil and gas sector since the end of May. But speaking at a hustings in Cheltenham, Ms Truss said she ""absolutely"" did not support windfall taxes, calling it a ""Labour idea"". ""It's all about bashing business and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public,"" the foreign secretary added. A windfall tax is a one-off charge imposed by a government on a company, designed to target firms that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for. Asked about public perceptions of record profits, she added: ""I don't think profit is a dirty word, and the fact it's become a dirty word in our society is a massive problem. ""Now, of course, the energy giants, if they're in an oligopoly, should be held to account, and I would make sure they're rigorously held to account. ""But the way we bandy the word around 'profit' (as if) it's something that's dirty and evil, we shouldn't be doing that as Conservatives."" Labour has called for the windfall tax to be backdated a further three months to January, arguing it would raise an extra Â£1.9bn for energy support schemes. The party has suggested it could fund its plan for prepay energy customers to be charged the same as those paying by direct debit. It says thehigher price cap for prepaid gas and electricitycould mean 4.5m households paying Â£184 more than those who pay by direct debit between this October and next March. Labour has said it would align the caps for the two payment methods to stop those on prepayment meters paying ""over the odds"". The party has billed the announcement as the first stage of a winter energy plan it is expected to unveil in the coming days. The Liberal Democrats have also called for the windfall tax to be extended, to pay for their plan toscrap October's expected energy price cap rise. Rishi Sunak says more direct energy payments are needed over the winter Ms Truss's comments come amid increasingly bitter exchanges between the leadership rivals over their respective plans to help people over the winter. The foreign secretary has said her plan to reverse National Insurance rises and scrapping green energy bills will help families and boost the economy. But also speaking at the Cheltenham hustings, Mr Sunak said tax cuts would ""leave millions of incredibly vulnerable people at risk of destitution"". He added that pensioners ""don't have the ability to go out and work more hours"" and were ""already dipping into their savings in retirement"". ""If we don't provide direct support to millions of vulnerable pensioners, it will be a moral failure of this party and the country will never ever forgive us."" He has pledged to make extra payments to vulnerable groups this winter, on top of the Â£15bn package of payments he announced as chancellor in May. Mr Sunak has said he is prepared to borrow to fund his plan, but this can be kept to a minimum through ""efficiency savings"" across government. Writing in The Times, he said the cost looked to be in ""the low to middle billions"", adding: ""But I'm realistic. It could be more."" He said this may mean having make ""tough choices"" to ""stop or pause some things in government"", as supporting people in the coming months ""has to be the first priority"". Mr Sunak said: ""But I will also be honest. If it requires some limited and temporary, one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter, I'm prepared to do that."" Elsewhere in the debate: Liz Truss said she wanted to see more fracking where supported by local communities, and labelled solar panels on agricultural land ""depressing"" She also ruled out holding a general election before 2024, and said she would review how water regulators operate if she enters No 10 Rishi Sunak said he has messaged and called Boris Johnson since quitting his cabinet, but ""unsurprisingly he hasn't returned my calls"" He also said he was ""very nervous"" about his rival's plan to change the remit of the Bank of England BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soar Shell profits nearly triple as oil prices surge What is the windfall tax on oil and gas firms?

Can you refuse to work?,"Construction workers will endure soaring temperatures over the next few days An amber extreme heat health warning has been issued for large parts of England from Thursday, with temperatures set to soar to 35C (95F) in some areas. This is the second such alert in recent weeks. The Met Office said while conditions would be below record highs, this heatwave could last longer. A heatwave is defined as: above average temperatures sustained for three days or more. So what does that mean for people going to work in the heat? No law in the UK says a given temperature is too hot or too cold to work. Butguidance from,externalthe Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a workplace's temperature must be ""reasonable"" with ""clean and fresh air"". In cold weather, it says you shouldn't be asked to work in less than 16C - or 13C if the job is mostly physical. But it doesn't mention a top temperature. A number of MPs recently backed a campaign for alegal upper limit of 30C in most workplaces,external- or 27C for those doing strenuous work - but there's no sign of legislation on that for now. What do heatwaves do to the body and who is at risk? Whether your employer accepts that it's too hot to go to work is ""a matter for them"", according to Mark Scoggins, solicitor advocate at Fisher Scoggins Waters. ""The HSE won't issue any guidance on that and they shouldn't,"" he adds. But theHealth and Safety at Work Act,externalmeans bosses are generally responsible for employees' welfare. The Unite union says employers have ""a legal and moral duty to ensure workers' health is not damaged during the current hot weather"". And following the heatwave in July, the HSE has said employers should be responding to the changing environment by planning adaptations such as ventilation and air conditioning. The HSE encourages staff to talk to their bosses if the workplace isn't comfortable. The HSE says employers should let staff work flexibly where possible - shifting their hours to minimise working at the hottest times of day. Relaxing formal dress codes and moving workstations away from hot places or out of direct sunlight can also help. Where possible, windows should be opened, radiators should be switched off, and fans or air-conditioning units should be available. The TUC, the umbrella body for the UK's trades unions, says businesses should let office staff work from home or adjust their hours to avoid rush-hour travel. If you are working from home, close curtains to block out the sun, and in the morning and evening open windows on opposite sides of your home, to let hot air out and cold air in. Use a fan to encourage airflow. How to keep your cool when the office heats up How air conditioning changed the world The Unite union says manual workers are particularly vulnerable. ""Employers should consider rescheduling work to cooler times of the day, and provide cooling areas such as shade or air-conditioned rest rooms. ""If workers show any signs of heat exhaustion, the employer should immediately ensure they stop work and are allowed to recover, without loss of pay."" Watch out for heat exhaustion and heatstroke Wildfires broke out in several locations in July stretching fire service resources But Justin Sullivan, chair of the Construction Industry Council chair, says building sites' operating hours are often limited by planning laws designed to minimise their impact on surrounding communities. So starting early or finishing late isn't always an option. However, he agrees that all workers should have access to water, protective clothing and shade. Some materials, like paint and concrete, can't be used on extremely hot days as the heat causes the materials to fail. He says all site managers have temperature gauges, and switch workers to different jobs where possible. Lifeguards are especially important in hot weather, when more people are tempted to swim, but they also need to look after themselves. All lifeguards should have cold water, a wide-brimmed hat, a long-sleeved top, polarised sunglasses, a high factor sunscreen and access to shade, according to Jo Talbot from the Royal Life Saving Society UK. They should also have regular breaks. There is no official advice in place instructing you not to travel. Some disruption to transport services is likely, although not on the scale of the last heatwave. Network Rail says it is not planning blanket speed restrictions because temperatures are not predicted to hit their trigger point, although temperatures could be high enough to prompt ""spot"" speed restrictions. Railway tracks get a lot hotter than the air temperature; during the last period of hot weather hundreds of trains were cancelled and delayed. At airports in July the scorching heat also impacted runways causing disruption. National Highways is advising drivers to plan their journeys over the next few days in advance and carry out basic checks to ensure vehicles are roadworthy before setting off, including keeping coolant and engine oil topped up. Keep children out of sun as heatwave hits - NHS How does sunscreen work? Tips for sleeping in the heat There are some simple things individuals can do to make the heat more bearable. Dr Anna Mavrogianni, who researches sustainable building and urban design at University College London, says as well as avoiding direct sunlight and opening windows, it can help toswitch off electrical equipment that's not in use, like photocopiers. Light-coloured clothing is cooler than dark, as it absorbs less heat. Choose looser-fitting garments made from natural materials like cotton and linen, which are more breathable. To stay hydrated, drink water before you feel thirsty, and avoid heavy meals which require more digestion, in turnproducing more body heat.

Rishi Sunak says more direct energy payments are needed over the winter Ms Truss's comments come amid increasingly bitter exchanges between the leadership rivals over their respective plans to help people over the winter. The foreign secretary has said her plan to reverse National Insurance rises and scrapping green energy bills will help families and boost the economy. But also speaking at the Cheltenham hustings, Mr Sunak said tax cuts would ""leave millions of incredibly vulnerable people at risk of destitution"". He added that pensioners ""don't have the ability to go out and work more hours"" and were ""already dipping into their savings in retirement"". ""If we don't provide direct support to millions of vulnerable pensioners, it will be a moral failure of this party and the country will never ever forgive us."" He has pledged to make extra payments to vulnerable groups this winter, on top of the Â£15bn package of payments he announced as chancellor in May. Mr Sunak has said he is prepared to borrow to fund his plan, but this can be kept to a minimum through ""efficiency savings"" across government. Writing in The Times, he said the cost looked to be in ""the low to middle billions"", adding: ""But I'm realistic. It could be more."" He said this may mean having make ""tough choices"" to ""stop or pause some things in government"", as supporting people in the coming months ""has to be the first priority"". Mr Sunak said: ""But I will also be honest. If it requires some limited and temporary, one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter, I'm prepared to do that."" Elsewhere in the debate: Liz Truss said she wanted to see more fracking where supported by local communities, and labelled solar panels on agricultural land ""depressing"" She also ruled out holding a general election before 2024, and said she would review how water regulators operate if she enters No 10 Rishi Sunak said he has messaged and called Boris Johnson since quitting his cabinet, but ""unsurprisingly he hasn't returned my calls"" He also said he was ""very nervous"" about his rival's plan to change the remit of the Bank of England BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soar Shell profits nearly triple as oil prices surge What is the windfall tax on oil and gas firms?

Sainsbury's and Tesco drop disposable barbecues,"Co-op is to temporarily stop selling disposable barbecues in all its stores because of the heatwave. It joins other supermarket chains, including Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco, which have dropped the product during the current dry weather. Fire brigades have warned of the risk of blazes in ""tinderbox conditions"". The Met Office's fire severity index, which assesses how severe a blaze could become, is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. On Friday, parts of south-west, southern, central and eastern England were moved to drought status. Soaring temperatures prompt wildfire warnings Is your postcode area vulnerable to high heat? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires Last year, Co-op removed disposable barbecues from its stores within one mile of national parks to help prevent wildfires. On Friday the supermarket said in a statement: ""As a precautionary measure due to the extreme hot weather, we've removed instant BBQs from sale in all Co-op stores until further notice."" Morrisons made a similar announcement earlier in the day, saying: ""In light of the long dry spell in the UK this summer we are temporarily removing disposable barbecues from all stores until further notice."" It comes after it said it would stop selling the items in its stores near national parks in March. Sainsbury's said its policy was a precautionary measure, but did not say how long it would continue. Tesco said the move was temporary and once weather conditions allow, disposable barbecues will be made available again. Last week, Marks and Spencer said it wanted to ""help protect open spaces and reduce the risk of fires""by removing the single use portable barbecues from sale, while Ocado also took the same step. Aldi and Waitrose had already stopped sales back in March, due to the burden on the environment more generally, including the impact of the single use plastic, metal and card. Co-op says it does not sell disposable barbecues close to UK national parks. The UK is in the middle of its second heatwave this summer. In July temperatures broke records, rising above 40C and are forecast to hit 37C (99F) again in some parts of the UK over the next four days. Fire services are warning of ""tinderbox conditions"" and have asked people not to use barbecues in high risk places, such as balconies and on dry grass, after a steep increase in the number of call-outs.

Lack of monkeypox jabs pauses rollout in Brighton,"People have queued at clinics in recent weeks to receive a vaccination The monkeypox vaccine rollout has stalled in Brighton after stocks of the jab ran out, the BBC understands. Local MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said only those with an existing appointment will be vaccinated until further stocks arrive. He also raised concerns the rollout could be paused in other areas. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said 100,000 doses are due to arrive in September and urged people to be aware of symptoms. The latest UKHSA figures show there have been 69 cases of monkeypox in Brighton to date, the highest number of cases outside of London. After a briefing with the agency, Brighton Kemptown MP Mr Russell-Moyle told the BBC he was told there are only around 5,000 vaccines left in the UK. Another source, who did not wish to be named, confirmed the details of the briefing. A spokeswoman for the UKHSA said she was unable to provide a comment on whether or not clinics would be pausing vaccinations. It is understood remaining stocks of the jab will be allocated to local sexual health services in the coming days, but that Brighton will not receive more vaccines until the end of next month. LGBT groups demand more action on monkeypox What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? We have 100,000 monkeypox vaccine doses - minister Mr Russell-Moyle said: ""I've already spoken to people in the area who feel worried, scared and that they've missed out. They feel that they're being put at risk, and that their enjoyment of the summer is being put at risk by bad organisation from the government."" Sources have told the BBC that low stocks of the vaccine are also set to impact other parts of the country in the coming days. It is understood that those who already have an appointment will still receive a vaccine, but that after the current 5,000 remaining vaccines have been allocated to local sexual health clinics, no further jabs will be available until the end of September. It comes aftersimilar claims in Scotland. Mr Russell-Moyle added: ""My understanding is that  if you are not vaccinated in the next couple of weeks, then it will be too late and you'll have to wait until September"". The latest figures from the UK Health Security Agency show that there have been 2,914 confirmed cases of monkeypox since the start of the year. According to NHS England figures, more than 25,000 people have so far received a vaccine. Currently about 75% of monkeypox cases are in London, which is where the majority of vaccines have been targeted, but numbers outside the city are also increasing. Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle told the BBC his constituency would not receive more supplies until the end of September The UK government has bought stocks of smallpox vaccine to guard against monkeypox. Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low. The global outbreak of monkeypox has meant a surge in demand for the vaccine. However, stocks are limited as until recently the disease had not spread widely outside of countries where the virus is endemic. On Wednesday, Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at UKHSA, told the BBC the agency had moved early to procure over 150,000 doses of the smallpox vaccine from the global manufacturer. Around 50,000 of these have been received to date and made available to the NHS for distribution across the country. ""The remaining approximately 100,000 doses is expected to arrive in the UK in September. The thousands of vaccines administered by the NHS to date among those at highest risk of exposure should have a significant impact on the transmission of the virus,"" she said. Countries around the world, including the UK, are suddenly scrabbling to get hold of the vaccine. It was originally designed for a more deadly disease - smallpox - and only limited stockpiles are kept in case of bio-terrorism. Every dose now being given to tackle an unprecedented monkeypox outbreak is being manufactured first and there is large demand around the world. So the idea that everyone at risk could be vaccinated immediately has always been a fantasy. Even the United States, with its huge buying power, has a shortage. Another 100,000 doses will arrive in the UK late next month. Until then doses have been distributed around the country and health officials are assessing how long current supplies will last. Exactly which parts of the UK - or all of it - will run out and for how long is being calculated and should be announced soon. September feels a long way off if you're at risk of catching monkeypox, but the reassuring news is that the number of new infections is already starting to level off.

Families left feeling helpless in search for homes,"Sara and her partner Steve were told having a baby was putting them at a disadvantage when searching for a rental property Families searching for somewhere to rent have said they are left feeling ""helpless"" because of high prices, lack of supply and discrimination. Emma Ceris Williams, 36, from Llandudno, Conwy county, said she faced being homeless by the end of September. Sara Hobday, 32, from Cardiff, said she had ""never felt so low"" and could not find anywhere ""because she has a baby"". Shelter Cymru said ""discrimination was seen blatantly"" across Wales. The Welsh government said more affordable homes would be available in the private sector during its next term and any agent or landlord who ""unfairly discriminated"" against tenants faced losing their licence. Average house price highest ever in Wales Mum asked landlord to evict her as rent rises Mother-of-two Ms Williams said she felt ""physically helpless"" as she faced eviction from her rental property in September. She and her partner Lee were handed their eviction notice by their landlord of 11 years in July - a three bedroom house they pay Â£550 a month for. ""We quickly realised that there wasn't anywhere, the prices were absolutely ridiculous,"" she said. ""I think there was one that was Â£1,600 [a month], and there are ones that are like Â£2,300 in this area, all my wages would be gone and the everything else [bills and living costs] would be my partner's wages and then what? ""We'd be left with nothing."" Emma said she faces homelessness if she doesn't find somewhere by the end of September Ms Williams considered moving to England in the hope that prices would be cheaper. But her daughter, April, lives withunilateral cerebellar hypoplasia,external- a rare neurological condition - and the ""last thing I want is to move my five-year-old from her school"", while her  son Theo, 14, is starting his GCSEs in September. ""I've tried everything, I've spoken to the homelessness prevention team, filled out a form to say what my situation is, I've spoken to the council, and estate agents - I feel physically helpless,""she told BBC Cymru Fyw. Ms Hobday and her partner Steve were told last December that their family would need to leave their rented property as the landlord wanted to sell. After eight months of searching, Ms Hobday said being told that having a baby was putting them at a disadvantage was ""the worst part"". ""If we did manage to get a viewing, we'd put in an application and the applications were very often not accepted on the basis that we have a child - which I find absolutely mind-blowing that it's even legal to do that. ""I've never been so rejected in all my life, the impact on my mental health was so much so that I don't think I even understand how bad it could get."" House prices are at their highest ever in Wales - Â£240,000 on average, according to the Principality building society's latest figures. That means that more and more people are being forced to try and rent but because of the rapid increase in the number of people searching, there are not enough places to meet the demand. In addition, many landlords in Wales have decided to sell their properties because ofnew legislation coming into force in December. Thomas Williams said rental properties were now going within days, rather than weeks Thomas Williams, director of Maison estate agents, said he had seen a ""big change"" since the pandemic, with high demand leading to people being ready to pay above asking price, leading to greater competition with landlords facing ""difficult decisions"" and people missing out. ""We would market a property for roughly a week to two weeks on the past for a rental property, now we're finding that we're getting enough inquiries after advertising for just half a day to a day."" Mr Williams added that in the market they were in, they are not allowed to discriminate. ""We do work very hard in order to make sure that we do it in a fair basis, but unfortunately there is very often very little to distinguish people, which means that our decision is made very hard."" Young people living in vans, tiny homes and containers Student nurse down to her last pound Heddyr Gregory said Shelter Cymru is seeing more and more people being discriminated against when looking to try and rent Heddyr Gregory from Shelter Cymru said: ""We see there are more and more people wanting to rent privately, but unable to do so because there's a competition war going on. ""We have seen in research that we did last year, about 75,000 people were discriminated against when they tried to find their current home. This was because of their ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion or disability. ""We also regularly see discrimination in the form of unlawful 'No DSS' policies, which indirectly discriminate against women and disabled people -  and even discrimination based on people having pets or children."" The Welsh government said: ""Every landlord and agent in Wales must sign up to the Rent Smart Wales Code of Practice which clearly states that any prospective or existing tenant must not be discriminated against - any landlord or agent who unfairly discriminates against tenants risks losing their licence. ""Our Leasing Scheme Wales will increase access to affordable homes in the private rented sector, and we will provide 20,000 low carbon social homes for rent during this government term.""

In a statement, his family said: ""John was a loving husband, father of six, brother, uncle and grandfather to his family, and was a much-loved member of the community. ""John loved the outdoors, was a keen motorcyclist and, as a loved father, shared his activities with his family."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said everyone in Scotland would be thinking of the communities affected. Speaking as she visited a church group in Forfar, Angus, on Thursday, she said: ""The kind of incidents that happened yesterday would have been horrific and devastating in any part of the country. ""But the kind of communities we're talking about here are small, close-knit communities and that sense of devastation will be felt even more acutely."" This video can not be played Attacks around Skye have had a ""significant impact"", say police In a briefing on Thursday, Ch Supt Conrad Trickett said the thoughts of Police Scotland were with the families and communities affected by the incidents. He said the 32-year-old woman and 63-year-old man were seriously injured and remained in hospital. And he confirmed that the gun fired in the incidents was a licensed firearm owned by the person who discharged it. Ch Supt Trickett said he wished to reassure the public that the incidents had been dealt with swiftly and professionally by local officers. He said: ""Serious incidents which were witnessed yesterday are extremely rare and I would like to further reassure the local communities that they were dealt with and there is no further threat to local people. ""Local officers who live and work in these communities brought the situation to as swift a conclusion as possible and I thank everyone involved, including colleagues from the Scottish Ambulance Service, for their outstanding efforts in responding to what was a distressing series of incidents."" Police were called to an initial incident in Tarskavaig on Wednesday morning Ch Supt Trickett added: ""The investigation, being led by Police Scotland's major investigation team, is complex and challenging and I would also like to thank the local communities for their understanding and co-operation as we work through our inquiries. ""Given the size of the investigation and the fact we are dealing with a number of different sites, the considerable police presence will remain for the near future. Police from across Skye and also from Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow responded and 50 officers remain in the area. They were initially called to a report of a 32-year-old woman being injured at a property in Tarskavaig, on Skye, shortly before 09:00 on Wednesday. Police were also called to another a property in Teangue on Skye Officers were then called to an incident about eight miles away (13km) in Teangue where police said a gun was fired and Mr MacKinnon died. At about 10:00 police were called to an incident in Dornie, near Kyle of Lochalsh on the west Highland mainland, where a gun was also fired. Keith MacKenzie, of the West Highland Free Press newspaper, said Mr MacKinnon's death was a shock to the local area of Sleat. He said: ""There is a feeling of sadness for the MacKinnon family having lost a father, brother and husband, and just someone who was a friend to so many people. It is going to hit the community very, very hard."" 09:00 Wednesday: Police are called to a property in Tarskavaig after reports of a woman having been seriously injured. She is taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow for treatment 09:30: A gun is fired at a property eight miles (13km) away in Teangue. Police later say John MacKinnon, 47, died at the scene 10:00: Police are called to Dornie - about 26 miles (42km) from Teangue after reports of a gun being fired at property. John Don Mackenzie and Fay Mackenzie are injured - Mr Mackenzie seriously 17:54: Police Scotland say a 39-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incidents Ian Blackford, SNP MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, described it as a ""very, very dark period"" for Skye and Lochalsh. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""These are small communities where everybody tends to know everyone and there is a real sense of shock."" Mr Blackford praised the response of the emergency services and Highland Council to the incidents. Kate Forbes, Scottish finance secretary and MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said close-knit communities had been ""shattered to our core"". John Finlayson, Highland councillor for Skye and Raasay, said his thoughts were with families and communities affected. Mr Finlayson said: ""I've never known tragedy like this and there's two communities that have been affected here - one on Skye and one on the mainland. ""So, it's a sad day, it's a tragic day, and it's a very tough day for us all."" Hamish Fraser, of Broadford and Strath community council on Skye, said the events of Wednesday were unheard of in living memory and the shockwaves would be felt across local communities for weeks and months. The rescue operation saw multiple ambulances, air ambulances and special rapid retrieval emergency teams, which are only summoned for incidents in rural locations when people are in critical need of medical attention. Police were later called to an incident in Dornie, near Kyle of Lochalsh By Isla Todd, BBC Reporter in Skye The west coast and Skye is known more as a tourist destination than a crime scene. Speaking to locals in Dornie, where one of the incidents took place, it was clear it was a tight-knit and close community. Residents told me there's a sense of safety living here, with many confessing they don't always lock their doors at night. In Skye, there is shock around the violence of the incidents with residents left reeling by the emerging details of what happened. A local Free Church minister told me he was opening the church this evening for anyone who needs to talk, find their faith, or come together as a community.

LiveLiveUS attorney general asks judge to unseal Trump warrant7 minutes ago,"US Attorney General Merrick Garland has given a statement about the search of Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago He said the Department of Justice has asked a federal court to unseal the warrant which authorised the search A judge must now decide if it's in the public interest to release the confidential document Trump has until Friday to object to the motion - he could also choose to release the details of the warrant himself Garland revealed that he personally approved the warrant for Monday's search by FBI agents The attorney general also fiercely defended both his department and FBI amid criticism from the former president Edited by Gareth Evans We're closing our live coverage of US Attorney General Merrick Garland's press conference in Washington. But before we go, here's a look back at the key developments:  You can read our news story here. Thanks for joining us. Judge Bruce Reinhart, who will oversee the unsealing process, has ordered the Justice Department to serve a copy of its motion to unseal the warrant documents immediately. The Justice Department then must report back to the court and say whether Trump opposes the motion by 15:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Friday. What does this mean? That the warrant documents could be unsealed as soon as tomorrow afternoon, unless Trump stands in the way. Katty KayUS special correspondent In a time of rampant conspiracy theories, there is even more
need to clear up what the Justice Department was looking for in Mar-a-Lago and
why it took the unprecedented step of searching the home of a former president. But it is highly unusual for the department to reveal
information about ongoing investigations and the attorney general said he was only
pushing to unseal the search warrant because he takes threats against members
of the FBI seriously. However, it is hard to see what could be in that warrant that
would change the minds of Trump's base, who firmly believe the state is out to
get the former president. As ever, when it comes to all things Trump, most minds in
America are already made up. Needless to say, none of this is normal. It is certainly not how
American law enforcement usually operates. Bernd DebusmannReporting from Washington The motion to unseal the warrant is a ""strong
showing"" from the justice department that a crime may have taken place, according to
a former federal prosecutor. Kevin McMunigal, a former prosecutor and law professor
at Case Western Reserve University, told the BBC that the motion could be an
effort to fight back against the notion that the search was a ""fishing
expedition"" by the FBI. ""The affidavit is what the judge relied on. It's not enough to get a conviction, but it's a strong showing that there
was a crime,"" he said. ""It's not an easy thing to get."" He also added that it is ""unusual"" that officials
reportedly visited Mar-a-Lago to discuss the issue with the Trump team ahead of
the search warrant being carried out. US media reported that Jay Bratt, the chief of the counter-intelligence
and export control section at the justice department, sat down with Trump's
lawyers in early June. The department has not confirmed Bratt's visit and it is unclear why he
would be involved. ""One possibility is that they went and tried to get [the
Trump team] to give them the documents back, short of doing a search
warrant,"" McMunigal said. ""Or it could be that by
doing that, they got some admission from Trump or other folks that they have
stuff or were claiming that they have a right to keep it. It will be
interesting to see if he [Bratt] is quoted in the affidavit."" The former president has been posting on his social media platform Truth Social. ""My attorneys and representatives were
co-operating fully, and very good relationships had been established,"" he wrote a short while ago. ""The government could have had whatever they
wanted, if we had it."" The search of his Florida home on Monday reportedly involved boxes of confidential and classified records from his time in office. ""They asked us to put an additional lock on a
certain area - DONE! Everything was fine... and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided,"" he wrote. In another post, Trump claims that FBI agents who executed the search went through his wife's cupboards and ""rummaged through her clothing and personal items"". Attorney General Merrick Garland defended the FBI agents who carried out the search in his brief remarks, describing them as ""dedicated, patriotic public servants"". According to court documents, a judge must respond to the justice department's motion to unseal the Mar-a-Lago search warrant by 25 August. Donald Trump's lawyers, however, already have a copy of the warrant and could, if they choose, release it to the public at any time. For this reason, it's still unclear exactly when - and how - the search warrant could be unsealed. The Department of Justice has filed a motion to unseal documents related to the search of Donald Trump's home - but what does that mean? Unsealing judicial materials means making them available to the public and the press. Court documents are typically kept sealed for confidentiality reasons - in this case, it involves a search executed at the residence of a former US president. At his news conference a short while ago, Attorney General Merrick Garland noted this investigation - like many others that his department has carried out - was being conducted ""out of the public eye"". But, he said, Trump not only issued a public statement confirming the search on Monday, but it has also attracted significant interest in the days since. A federal court must now balance out the intense public attention to the search with Trump's interest in keeping the information confidential. If the court decides that releasing the search warrant and related documents would not ""impair court functions or harm legitimate privacy interests"" - it will make the warrant materials public. The motion
to unseal allows, however, for former President
Trump to object and effectively block the warrant from being made public. John SudworthNorth America Correspondent The unprecedented search of a former presidentâs home has rocked the US political landscape. And so, the US newsrooms tuned in to Merrick Garlandâs press conference with baited breath, and with all the main TV networks rolling on the live-shot of the empty podium. What would this intervention mean? At first glance, not a lot. There was no detail about what the search warrant contained, what was found, or whether it was â as media reports have suggested â an inside Trump source that provided the FBI with the key information. But not nothing either. The attorney general revealed he had personally authorised the search warrant. And he said that the DOJ is seeking a court order to have the warrant and the list of items taken from Mar-a-Lago made public. Prosecutors donât tend to reveal their cards in public during an ongoing investigation â something Garland made clear was for good reason. But the accusations from the Republican movement - and from Donald Trump himself, of course - that the department is being weaponised by the Democrats, have been damaging. And without any formal statement, it's a narrative thatâs been
left largely unchallenged. This was Garland insisting that far from being an assault on the law, the search was the law taking its proper course. Here's what we've learned: It's a short statement, with the US attorney general wrapping up by saying more information will made available at the appropriate time. A flurry of reporters attempt to get in questions as he walks off stage, but he turns to reply: ""This is all I can say at this time."" And that's the end of the statement. In his remarks, Garland said that attacks on the professionalism of the FBI in the wake of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant were unfounded. He added that he would ""not stand by silently"" while their integrity was questioned. Garland calls FBI and Justice Department employees ""dedicated, patriotic public servants"" who carry out their work at ""great personal risk"".  This video can not be played Merrick Garland: I personally approved Mar-a-Lago search warrant Garland says he personally approved the decision to seek the search warrant used at Mar-a-Lago. The justice department does not take such a decision lightly, he says. ""Less intrusive means"" than a search are used where possible, he adds. Attorney General Merrick Garland says he has asked a judge to unseal the search warrant used at Mar-a-Lago. It is his first public confirmation of the search. He explains that there is ""substantial public interest in this matter"". US Attorney General Merrick Garland has just arrived to address the media. We'll update you with the latest. We're still waiting for the US attorney general's press conference - it was due to begin about 25 minutes ago. As soon as it starts we'll bring you the latest - and you can also watch along at the top of this page. To obtain a search warrant - as happened at Mar-a-Lago on Monday - the FBI must go through a number of steps, with the ultimate aim of convincing a judge that there is ""probable cause"" that a crime has been committed. To do so, federal authorities - in this case, the FBI - must present a judge with a written affidavit which outlines the evidence they have and the reason a search is needed. In many cases, the judge seeks additional information and questions agents under oath about the evidence being presented. A judge will only sign the search warrant when satisfied that enough evidence exists that a federal crime took place. In the aftermath of the Mar-a-Lago search, several former agents and officials noted that executing a warrant on a former president's residence would likely have to be approved at the highest levels of the Justice Department. That department is led by US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Since March 2021, Merrick Garland, 69, has been
the US attorney general - the highest law enforcement officer in the government and the principal adviser to the president on all legal issues. In this position, Garland leads the Justice
Department which has responsibilities ranging from counter-narcotics enforcement and running the Bureau of Prisons to
counter-intelligence and white-collar crime investigations. During his tenure, Garland, a former federal
prosecutor, has overseen a number of high-profile civil rights investigations
and overseen efforts to combat hate crimes, as well as the sprawling Justice
Department investigation into the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol. While we're still not sure what the US attorney general's statement will be about, a White House official has just said they were not given advanced notice of it. The White House also said earlier this week that President Biden was not given advance warning of the Mar-a-Lago search. Donald Trump in New York City on 10 August Former President Donald Trump reacted angrily to the search warrant, saying it was ânot necessary or appropriateâ and characterising it as a political âwitch-huntâ. âSuch an assault could only take place in broken, Third-world countries,â he said in a statement following the search. âSadly, America has become one of those countries, corrupt at a level not seen before.â A number of Republican officials officials have publicly spoken in defence of Trump after the search, including his former Vice-President Mike Pence. In a series of Tweets, Pence - who distanced himself from Trump amid speculation he may launch a 2024 presidential run - said he shares âdeep concernâ over the âunprecedentedâ search of Trumpâs property. Exterior of Mar-a-Lago on 9 August On Monday, the FBI executed a search warrant at former President Donald Trumpâs Florida home in Mar-a-Lago. The search warrant was reportedly linked to an investigation into the handling of classified and sensitive material. Various US media outlets have reported that Trump, a Republican, allegedly removed classified records from the White House and took them to Mar-a-Lago. According to Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer for Trump, between 30 and 40 gloved FBI agents and 10 to 15 vehicles - including a rental truck - took part in the search. So far, neither the FBI or Department of Justice have commented. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

LiveLiveUS attorney general asks judge to unseal Trump warrant19 minutes ago,"US Attorney General Merrick Garland has given a statement about the search of Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago He said the Department of Justice has asked a federal court to unseal the warrant which authorised the search A judge must now decide if it's in the public interest to release the confidential document Trump has until Friday to object to the motion - he could also choose to release the details of the warrant himself Garland revealed that he personally approved the warrant for Monday's search by FBI agents The attorney general also fiercely defended both his department and FBI amid criticism from the former president Edited by Gareth Evans We're closing our live coverage of US Attorney General Merrick Garland's press conference in Washington. But before we go, here's a look back at the key developments:  You can read our news story here. Thanks for joining us. Judge Bruce Reinhart, who will oversee the unsealing process, has ordered the Justice Department to serve a copy of its motion to unseal the warrant documents immediately. The Justice Department then must report back to the court and say whether Trump opposes the motion by 15:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Friday. What does this mean? That the warrant documents could be unsealed as soon as tomorrow afternoon, unless Trump stands in the way. Katty KayUS special correspondent In a time of rampant conspiracy theories, there is even more
need to clear up what the Justice Department was looking for in Mar-a-Lago and
why it took the unprecedented step of searching the home of a former president. But it is highly unusual for the department to reveal
information about ongoing investigations and the attorney general said he was only
pushing to unseal the search warrant because he takes threats against members
of the FBI seriously. However, it is hard to see what could be in that warrant that
would change the minds of Trump's base, who firmly believe the state is out to
get the former president. As ever, when it comes to all things Trump, most minds in
America are already made up. Needless to say, none of this is normal. It is certainly not how
American law enforcement usually operates. Bernd DebusmannReporting from Washington The motion to unseal the warrant is a ""strong
showing"" from the justice department that a crime may have taken place, according to
a former federal prosecutor. Kevin McMunigal, a former prosecutor and law professor
at Case Western Reserve University, told the BBC that the motion could be an
effort to fight back against the notion that the search was a ""fishing
expedition"" by the FBI. ""The affidavit is what the judge relied on. It's not enough to get a conviction, but it's a strong showing that there
was a crime,"" he said. ""It's not an easy thing to get."" He also added that it is ""unusual"" that officials
reportedly visited Mar-a-Lago to discuss the issue with the Trump team ahead of
the search warrant being carried out. US media reported that Jay Bratt, the chief of the counter-intelligence
and export control section at the justice department, sat down with Trump's
lawyers in early June. The department has not confirmed Bratt's visit and it is unclear why he
would be involved. ""One possibility is that they went and tried to get [the
Trump team] to give them the documents back, short of doing a search
warrant,"" McMunigal said. ""Or it could be that by
doing that, they got some admission from Trump or other folks that they have
stuff or were claiming that they have a right to keep it. It will be
interesting to see if he [Bratt] is quoted in the affidavit."" The former president has been posting on his social media platform Truth Social. ""My attorneys and representatives were
co-operating fully, and very good relationships had been established,"" he wrote a short while ago. ""The government could have had whatever they
wanted, if we had it."" The search of his Florida home on Monday reportedly involved boxes of confidential and classified records from his time in office. ""They asked us to put an additional lock on a
certain area - DONE! Everything was fine... and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided,"" he wrote.

Warnings as UK swimming pool closures revealed,"This video can not be played Watch: Children in Falmouth learning life-saving skills in the sea Swimmers across the UK have lost access to more than 60 public pools in the last three years, BBC News has found. Freedom of Information requests to UK councils revealed 65 pools had closed, either temporarily or permanently, in the three years to March 2022. Ukactive said a lack of staff, rising energy costs and chemical shortages had created a ""perfect storm"" for centres. Greg Whyte, a board member at the organisation, said the closures were an ""absolute health and welfare disaster"". Ukactive, which represents gyms and leisure centres, said centres had only just started to recover following closures during the Covid-19 pandemic. It warned there was a risk of more permanent closures before the end of the year. The BBC found about one in six local authorities had lost at least one pool on a permanent or temporary basis, as of March 2022. Some of them had been closed for good, while others are closed for refurbishment with no fixed reopening date. Others are now only accessible for private hire or swimming clubs. Pools inEssex,BedfordshireandStaffordshirehave all blamed chlorine shortages for their recent closures. Your device may not support this visualisation The West Midlands and Scotland saw the most closures, with eight each. But the West Midlands was hardest hit compared with the overall number of pools available in 2019. In the West Midlands, the region saw the number of pools fall from 105 to 97, while in Scotland it decreased from 219 to 211. At the time of the responses - from 360 local authorities out of 374 across the UK - some 1,335 publicly-funded pools were open. Olympic and Commonwealth champion Adam Peaty has been vocal in asking for more government support to keep pools open - especially for children. He told the BBC: ""The government really needs to work harder to get [to] these kids and give them accessibility"". Edie Caris, 15, has been an artistic swimmer for several years and spends between six and eight hours training. Previously, her family lived around a 15-minute drive away from her training pool in Halifax. However, this has shut and Edie now trains in Bradford, with some teammates travelling almost an hour to training. While there are other pools on the outskirts of Halifax, her club says there isn't enough available swimming time for them to use the facilities. ""It's sometimes not viable for parents to drive that far, so we've lost a lot of members,"" said Edie. ""We used to have about 115 members and we've lost about 60 members, so that's become quite a challenge getting a team together to compete."" Edie Caris spends between six and eight hours training in the pool as an artistic swimmer The closed pool in Halifax is due to be replaced, but Edie is concerned that it won't provide the same level of facilities. ""It's not going to be suitable for us to train, it's not going to be suitable for the diving club, so they're getting rid of a lot of clubs which were quite unique to Halifax. ""It just makes me feel a bit upset."" Ukactive said two million children left primary school unable to swim in the past year. ""The legacy of that goes on and on,"" added Mr Whyte, a former British Olympian. ""Those non-swimming children become non-swimming adults, they then have their own children and non-swimming parents have non-swimming children."" The hidden dangers of summertime swims Funeral funds raised for drowned lake swimmer Swimming pool to close due to chlorine shortage The body's chief executive, Huw Edwards, said there were other health risks related to closing pools. ""Two million children learn to swim in our pools every year and leisure centres provide 66% of our cancer prehab and rehab services, which clearly shows that lives are at stake if they close,"" he said. ""Our members have laid out the evidence to the government, which now has a duty to support the survival of our gyms, pools and leisure centres through a package of financial and legislative measures that ensures their survival and growth."" ""Public leisure facilities are disproportionately relied on by those on lower incomes,"" said Gerald Vernon-Jackson, chair of the Local Government Association's Culture, Tourism and Sport Board. ""Councils are working incredibly hard to prevent centres from closing, and understand that many people are facing rising individual costs, so have no desire to increase prices if it can be avoided."" However, he added that rising energy costs would potentially impact on future decisions about whether new facilities open. A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Sport and Media said: ""The government has provided an unprecedented Â£1bn of public money to ensure the survival of the grassroots, professional sport and leisure sectors. ""This includes the Â£100m National Leisure Centre Recovery Fund which secured the survival and reopening of more than 1,100 swimming pools all over the country. ""On top of this Sport England, the government's funding agency, has provided over Â£8.5m to swimming and diving projects, and over Â£16m to Swim England since 2017."" But among the losses are stories of people working together to save their local pool. Emma Tudge has led a campaign to keep the pool open in her community in Wadebridge in Cornwall. ""It really has caught the imagination of people locally to keep this place open,"" she said. ""It's essential for local schoolchildren to learn to swim, and also for our lifeguards locally who are working the beaches all summer long to have a place where they can train. ""I'm really excited that it's genuinely going to be a centre that helps the whole community.""

But before we go, here's a look back at the key developments:  You can read our news story here. Thanks for joining us. Judge Bruce Reinhart, who will oversee the unsealing process, has ordered the Justice Department to serve a copy of its motion to unseal the warrant documents immediately. The Justice Department then must report back to the court and say whether Trump opposes the motion by 15:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Friday. What does this mean? That the warrant documents could be unsealed as soon as tomorrow afternoon, unless Trump stands in the way. Katty KayUS special correspondent In a time of rampant conspiracy theories, there is even more
need to clear up what the Justice Department was looking for in Mar-a-Lago and
why it took the unprecedented step of searching the home of a former president. But it is highly unusual for the department to reveal
information about ongoing investigations and the attorney general said he was only
pushing to unseal the search warrant because he takes threats against members
of the FBI seriously. However, it is hard to see what could be in that warrant that
would change the minds of Trump's base, who firmly believe the state is out to
get the former president. As ever, when it comes to all things Trump, most minds in
America are already made up. Needless to say, none of this is normal. It is certainly not how
American law enforcement usually operates. Bernd DebusmannReporting from Washington The motion to unseal the warrant is a ""strong
showing"" from the justice department that a crime may have taken place, according to
a former federal prosecutor. Kevin McMunigal, a former prosecutor and law professor
at Case Western Reserve University, told the BBC that the motion could be an
effort to fight back against the notion that the search was a ""fishing
expedition"" by the FBI. ""The affidavit is what the judge relied on. It's not enough to get a conviction, but it's a strong showing that there
was a crime,"" he said. ""It's not an easy thing to get."" He also added that it is ""unusual"" that officials
reportedly visited Mar-a-Lago to discuss the issue with the Trump team ahead of
the search warrant being carried out. US media reported that Jay Bratt, the chief of the counter-intelligence
and export control section at the justice department, sat down with Trump's
lawyers in early June. The department has not confirmed Bratt's visit and it is unclear why he
would be involved. ""One possibility is that they went and tried to get [the
Trump team] to give them the documents back, short of doing a search
warrant,"" McMunigal said. ""Or it could be that by
doing that, they got some admission from Trump or other folks that they have
stuff or were claiming that they have a right to keep it. It will be
interesting to see if he [Bratt] is quoted in the affidavit."" The former president has been posting on his social media platform Truth Social. ""My attorneys and representatives were
co-operating fully, and very good relationships had been established,"" he wrote a short while ago. ""The government could have had whatever they
wanted, if we had it."" The search of his Florida home on Monday reportedly involved boxes of confidential and classified records from his time in office. ""They asked us to put an additional lock on a
certain area - DONE! Everything was fine... and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided,"" he wrote. In another post, Trump claims that FBI agents who executed the search went through his wife's cupboards and ""rummaged through her clothing and personal items"". Attorney General Merrick Garland defended the FBI agents who carried out the search in his brief remarks, describing them as ""dedicated, patriotic public servants"". According to court documents, a judge must respond to the justice department's motion to unseal the Mar-a-Lago search warrant by 25 August. Donald Trump's lawyers, however, already have a copy of the warrant and could, if they choose, release it to the public at any time. For this reason, it's still unclear exactly when - and how - the search warrant could be unsealed. The Department of Justice has filed a motion to unseal documents related to the search of Donald Trump's home - but what does that mean? Unsealing judicial materials means making them available to the public and the press. Court documents are typically kept sealed for confidentiality reasons - in this case, it involves a search executed at the residence of a former US president. At his news conference a short while ago, Attorney General Merrick Garland noted this investigation - like many others that his department has carried out - was being conducted ""out of the public eye"". But, he said, Trump not only issued a public statement confirming the search on Monday, but it has also attracted significant interest in the days since. A federal court must now balance out the intense public attention to the search with Trump's interest in keeping the information confidential. If the court decides that releasing the search warrant and related documents would not ""impair court functions or harm legitimate privacy interests"" - it will make the warrant materials public. The motion
to unseal allows, however, for former President
Trump to object and effectively block the warrant from being made public. John SudworthNorth America Correspondent The unprecedented search of a former presidentâs home has rocked the US political landscape. And so, the US newsrooms tuned in to Merrick Garlandâs press conference with baited breath, and with all the main TV networks rolling on the live-shot of the empty podium. What would this intervention mean? At first glance, not a lot. There was no detail about what the search warrant contained, what was found, or whether it was â as media reports have suggested â an inside Trump source that provided the FBI with the key information. But not nothing either. The attorney general revealed he had personally authorised the search warrant. And he said that the DOJ is seeking a court order to have the warrant and the list of items taken from Mar-a-Lago made public. Prosecutors donât tend to reveal their cards in public during an ongoing investigation â something Garland made clear was for good reason. But the accusations from the Republican movement - and from Donald Trump himself, of course - that the department is being weaponised by the Democrats, have been damaging. And without any formal statement, it's a narrative thatâs been
left largely unchallenged. This was Garland insisting that far from being an assault on the law, the search was the law taking its proper course. Here's what we've learned: It's a short statement, with the US attorney general wrapping up by saying more information will made available at the appropriate time. A flurry of reporters attempt to get in questions as he walks off stage, but he turns to reply: ""This is all I can say at this time."" And that's the end of the statement. In his remarks, Garland said that attacks on the professionalism of the FBI in the wake of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant were unfounded. He added that he would ""not stand by silently"" while their integrity was questioned. Garland calls FBI and Justice Department employees ""dedicated, patriotic public servants"" who carry out their work at ""great personal risk"".  This video can not be played Merrick Garland: I personally approved Mar-a-Lago search warrant Garland says he personally approved the decision to seek the search warrant used at Mar-a-Lago. The justice department does not take such a decision lightly, he says. ""Less intrusive means"" than a search are used where possible, he adds. Attorney General Merrick Garland says he has asked a judge to unseal the search warrant used at Mar-a-Lago. It is his first public confirmation of the search. He explains that there is ""substantial public interest in this matter"". US Attorney General Merrick Garland has just arrived to address the media. We'll update you with the latest. We're still waiting for the US attorney general's press conference - it was due to begin about 25 minutes ago. As soon as it starts we'll bring you the latest - and you can also watch along at the top of this page. To obtain a search warrant - as happened at Mar-a-Lago on Monday - the FBI must go through a number of steps, with the ultimate aim of convincing a judge that there is ""probable cause"" that a crime has been committed. To do so, federal authorities - in this case, the FBI - must present a judge with a written affidavit which outlines the evidence they have and the reason a search is needed. In many cases, the judge seeks additional information and questions agents under oath about the evidence being presented. A judge will only sign the search warrant when satisfied that enough evidence exists that a federal crime took place. In the aftermath of the Mar-a-Lago search, several former agents and officials noted that executing a warrant on a former president's residence would likely have to be approved at the highest levels of the Justice Department. That department is led by US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Since March 2021, Merrick Garland, 69, has been
the US attorney general - the highest law enforcement officer in the government and the principal adviser to the president on all legal issues. In this position, Garland leads the Justice
Department which has responsibilities ranging from counter-narcotics enforcement and running the Bureau of Prisons to
counter-intelligence and white-collar crime investigations. During his tenure, Garland, a former federal
prosecutor, has overseen a number of high-profile civil rights investigations
and overseen efforts to combat hate crimes, as well as the sprawling Justice
Department investigation into the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol. While we're still not sure what the US attorney general's statement will be about, a White House official has just said they were not given advanced notice of it. The White House also said earlier this week that President Biden was not given advance warning of the Mar-a-Lago search. Donald Trump in New York City on 10 August Former President Donald Trump reacted angrily to the search warrant, saying it was ânot necessary or appropriateâ and characterising it as a political âwitch-huntâ. âSuch an assault could only take place in broken, Third-world countries,â he said in a statement following the search. âSadly, America has become one of those countries, corrupt at a level not seen before.â A number of Republican officials officials have publicly spoken in defence of Trump after the search, including his former Vice-President Mike Pence. In a series of Tweets, Pence - who distanced himself from Trump amid speculation he may launch a 2024 presidential run - said he shares âdeep concernâ over the âunprecedentedâ search of Trumpâs property. Exterior of Mar-a-Lago on 9 August On Monday, the FBI executed a search warrant at former President Donald Trumpâs Florida home in Mar-a-Lago. The search warrant was reportedly linked to an investigation into the handling of classified and sensitive material. Various US media outlets have reported that Trump, a Republican, allegedly removed classified records from the White House and took them to Mar-a-Lago. According to Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer for Trump, between 30 and 40 gloved FBI agents and 10 to 15 vehicles - including a rental truck - took part in the search. So far, neither the FBI or Department of Justice have commented. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

People can't wait for energy help - Citizens AdviceThe charity voices concerns of delaying support for households bracing themselves for energy bill hikes.Business,"Many households cannot wait for the government to decide whether more support will be given to cope with energy bills, Citizens Advice has said. The charity said it made more food bank referrals and crisis support in July than it had in 2019 and 2020 combined. The warning comes afterthe energy regulator said billscould start to rise at the end of this month, more than five weeks earlier than thought. A government meeting on Thursday with energy firms yielded no firm action. With the Conservative Party leader and thus new Prime Minister not due to be announced until 5 September, charities say time is running out to help people already feeling the pinch of prices, which are rising at the fastest rate for 40 years. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, alongside Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, met with bosses from a number of companies including EDF, E.On, Scottish Power and National Grid to discuss help for households. However the meeting failed to produce any immediate concrete help for consumers, with Mr Johnson acknowledging any ""significant fiscal decisions"" would be be a matter for his successor. An industry source told the BBC it was ""increasingly clear that big decisions need to be made but we don't have a government capable of making them till the end of the leadership race"". Another added: ""It was striking that BP and Shell weren't in the room. The amount of their excess profits is symmetrical with the size of the problem we are facing. It feels inevitable that they will have to be part of the solution - ie increase or reform the windfall tax."" Energy crisis is on scale of pandemic - Martin Lewis Energy bills forecast to hit over Â£4,200 a year Both BP and Shell recently reported record profits fuelled by higher prices for oil and gas, which have risen sharply due to the war in Ukraine,prompting calls for a further windfall tax on firms. In recent months, Russia has reduced supplies to Europe following the invasion and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. To date, the government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills - but the amount was decided before price forecasts surged. Mr Johnson said the government would ""keep urging the electricity sector to continue working on ways we can ease the cost of living pressures"". This weekhousehold energy billswere forecast to reach Â£4,200 in 2023. ""Many people cant wait another day for the government to decide what support is needed this winter,"" said Abby Jitendra, principle policy manager at Citizens Advice. ""We need the government to step in as soon as possible to help the people on the lowest incomes. Every day that the government delays telling us what the plan will be this winter, every day we see the price of forecast going up is another day of worry for people."" Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the ""vacuum at the heart of government"" was causing distress for millions. He said while it was usual for customers on direct debit plans to pay more in the summer to even out higher winter usage, energy firms should ""not be pre-loading"" ahead of the price cap kicking in and ""when it is unclear what action the government will take to support families"". A new limit for the maximum price of gas and electricity a supplier can charge customers for energy usage in England, Scotland and Wales,known as the energy price cap, is due to be announced at the end of August and come into effect in October. Analysts have predicted a typical bill to rise to Â£3,582 from October. On Thursday, one consultancy, Auxilione, predicted a typical household could be paying Â£5,000 a year by next April. The energy regulator Ofgem has warned it is possible for some customers with direct debits to start paying more before new price caps kick in. It said direct debits are usually charged in a way so that customers build up credit during the warmer summer months when usage is lower, to spread out the cost of using more energy in the colder months. Any rises in bills ahead of October would be to help spread the cost of higher energy use in the winter months, Ofgem said. Customers can ask for their excess credit to be returned at any time and can contact their suppliers to change how their direct debit is spread.

With the Conservative Party leader and thus new Prime Minister not due to be announced until 5 September, charities say time is running out to help people already feeling the pinch of prices, which are rising at the fastest rate for 40 years. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, alongside Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, met with bosses from a number of companies including EDF, E.On, Scottish Power and National Grid to discuss help for households. However the meeting failed to produce any immediate concrete help for consumers, with Mr Johnson acknowledging any ""significant fiscal decisions"" would be be a matter for his successor. An industry source told the BBC it was ""increasingly clear that big decisions need to be made but we don't have a government capable of making them till the end of the leadership race"". Another added: ""It was striking that BP and Shell weren't in the room. The amount of their excess profits is symmetrical with the size of the problem we are facing. It feels inevitable that they will have to be part of the solution - ie increase or reform the windfall tax."" Energy crisis is on scale of pandemic - Martin Lewis Energy bills forecast to hit over Â£4,200 a year Both BP and Shell recently reported record profits fuelled by higher prices for oil and gas, which have risen sharply due to the war in Ukraine,prompting calls for a further windfall tax on firms. In recent months, Russia has reduced supplies to Europe following the invasion and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. To date, the government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills - but the amount was decided before price forecasts surged. Mr Johnson said the government would ""keep urging the electricity sector to continue working on ways we can ease the cost of living pressures"". This weekhousehold energy billswere forecast to reach Â£4,200 in 2023. ""Many people cant wait another day for the government to decide what support is needed this winter,"" said Abby Jitendra, principle policy manager at Citizens Advice. ""We need the government to step in as soon as possible to help the people on the lowest incomes. Every day that the government delays telling us what the plan will be this winter, every day we see the price of forecast going up is another day of worry for people."" Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the ""vacuum at the heart of government"" was causing distress for millions. He said while it was usual for customers on direct debit plans to pay more in the summer to even out higher winter usage, energy firms should ""not be pre-loading"" ahead of the price cap kicking in and ""when it is unclear what action the government will take to support families"". A new limit for the maximum price of gas and electricity a supplier can charge customers for energy usage in England, Scotland and Wales,known as the energy price cap, is due to be announced at the end of August and come into effect in October. Analysts have predicted a typical bill to rise to Â£3,582 from October. On Thursday, one consultancy, Auxilione, predicted a typical household could be paying Â£5,000 a year by next April. The energy regulator Ofgem has warned it is possible for some customers with direct debits to start paying more before new price caps kick in. It said direct debits are usually charged in a way so that customers build up credit during the warmer summer months when usage is lower, to spread out the cost of using more energy in the colder months. Any rises in bills ahead of October would be to help spread the cost of higher energy use in the winter months, Ofgem said. Customers can ask for their excess credit to be returned at any time and can contact their suppliers to change how their direct debit is spread.

NHS IT supplier held to ransom by hackers,"A cyber-attack on a major IT provider of the NHS has been confirmed as a ransomware attack. Advanced, which provides digital services like patient check-in and NHS 111, says it may take three to four weeks to fully recover. Ransomware hackers take control of IT systems, steal data and demand a payment from victims to recover. The NHS insists that disruption is minimal, but Advanced would not say whether NHS data had been stolen. The Birmingham-based firm says it first spotted the hack at 07:00 BST on 4 August and immediately took steps to contain the hackers. It is now working to restore services. The company refused to say if it was in negotiations with hackers or paying a ransom to them. In a statement, it said: ""We are rebuilding and restoring impacted systems in a separate and secure environment."" This video can not be played Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work? An NHS England spokesperson said: ""While Advanced has confirmed that the incident impacting their software is ransomware, the NHS has tried and tested contingency plans in place including robust defences to protect our own networks, as we work with the National Cyber Security Centre to fully understand the impact.

Sainsbury's stops sale of disposable barbecues,"Co-op is to temporarily stop selling disposable barbecues in all its stores because of the heatwave. It joins other supermarket chains, including Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco, which have dropped the product during the current dry weather. Fire brigades have warned of the risk of blazes in ""tinderbox conditions"". The Met Office's fire severity index, which assesses how severe a blaze could become, is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. On Friday, parts of south-west, southern, central and eastern England were moved to drought status. Soaring temperatures prompt wildfire warnings Is your postcode area vulnerable to high heat? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires Last year, Co-op removed disposable barbecues from its stores within one mile of national parks to help prevent wildfires. On Friday the supermarket said in a statement: ""As a precautionary measure due to the extreme hot weather, we've removed instant BBQs from sale in all Co-op stores until further notice."" Morrisons made a similar announcement earlier in the day, saying: ""In light of the long dry spell in the UK this summer we are temporarily removing disposable barbecues from all stores until further notice."" It comes after it said it would stop selling the items in its stores near national parks in March. Sainsbury's said its policy was a precautionary measure, but did not say how long it would continue. Tesco said the move was temporary and once weather conditions allow, disposable barbecues will be made available again. Last week, Marks and Spencer said it wanted to ""help protect open spaces and reduce the risk of fires""by removing the single use portable barbecues from sale, while Ocado also took the same step. Aldi and Waitrose had already stopped sales back in March, due to the burden on the environment more generally, including the impact of the single use plastic, metal and card. Co-op says it does not sell disposable barbecues close to UK national parks. The UK is in the middle of its second heatwave this summer. In July temperatures broke records, rising above 40C and are forecast to hit 37C (99F) again in some parts of the UK over the next four days. Fire services are warning of ""tinderbox conditions"" and have asked people not to use barbecues in high risk places, such as balconies and on dry grass, after a steep increase in the number of call-outs.

Olympic champion Muirhead retires from curling,"This video can not be played 'It's nice to go out at the top' Olympic champion Eve Muirhead has retired from curling, saying she hopes her career successes showed ""girls that being sweaty is cool"". The 32-year-old Scot, who is also European and world mixed doubles champion, described it as ""the hardest decision of my life"". She does not know ""what's next for me"" - but more media work is a possibility. ""I have had such a stellar season, it's always nice to go out on the top,"" Muirhead told BBC Scotland. ""I felt this was the time to hang up my curling shoes from elite level. I'm excited about the future, but I'm also scared - but it's a good scared."" Muirhead's journey from career-threatening surgery to Olympic gold Perth-born Muirhead led the Great Britain women's team that won gold at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. As skip, she claimed an elusive gold medal in China at the fourth time of asking, the pinnacle of a career during which she became Scotland's most decorated ever curler. In 2014, she was the youngest skip to win an Olympic medal as her team claimed bronze. For Scotland, Muirhead won the European Championships three times and claimed a sixth world mixed doubles title earlier this year alongside Bobby Lammie. She was made an MBE in 2020 and gained further recognition for her services to curling in the most recent Queen's Birthday Honours this year when she was appointed an OBE. Muirhead hopes she leaves British and Scottish curling ""in a good place"" and that she has helped show females that physical fitness is not only good for fitness ""but your mental side as well"". ""There were times when I was young when I didn't want to do PE,"" she said. ""There were times when I lied that I didn't have my PE kit because it wasn't a cool thing to do."" Muirhead said it would be hard to give up training daily for sport but had taken ""a lot of time to make sure I made the right decision"". ""There's life on the other side of curling and that's what I want to explore,"" she said. ""The dream scenario would be I enjoy a lot of the media side of it and I've been lucky to be involved with 5 Live at the golf - and it's a sport I'm very interested in. There are a few options out there for me."" SportScotland chief executive Stewart Harris praised Muirhead's ""unparalleled"" impact on curling in her homeland, adding: ""Eve's 11 gold medals in Olympic Games, World Championships and European Championships are a true testament to her dedication to curling over these years.""

The Russian billionaire daring to criticise Putin,"Boris Mints is one of a few rich Russian businesspeople to speak out against Russia's invasion of Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin. The majority of high-profile people in the country have remained silent over the war, avoiding criticism of the Kremlin. There is one simple explanation, according to Mr Mints: ""They are all afraid."" The Kremlin has a reputation for cracking down on outspoken critics of President Putin with the content on Russian news channels controlled. Unauthorised protests have also been banned in the country since 2014. Mr Mints said ""any person"" who openly criticises Putin ""has grounds to worry about personal safety"". However, in an interview conducted over email, he told the BBC: ""I have no intention to live in a bomb shelter, as Mr Putin does."" The 64-year-old, who built his wealth through investment company O1 Group, which he founded in 2003 and then sold in 2018, said that in Russia the ""usual way"" to punish a business owner for their ""intolerance"" towards the regime was to ""open a fabricated criminal case against their business"". ""Such criminal cases will affect not only the business owners themselves, but also their family and employees,"" he said. ""Any business leader independent from [Putin] is seen as a threat as he or she may be capable of financing opposition or cultivating protest - as such, those people are seen as Putin's enemies and, therefore, as enemies of the state,"" he added. It is a situation Mr Mints has first-hand experience of, having first spoken out publicly against President Putin's policies in 2014 after Crimea was annexed from Ukraine. Mr Mints felt he needed to leave Russia in 2015 for the UK ""in the context of growing crackdown on political opposition"", with Boris Nemtsov being shot dead that year. Secret hit squad linked to murdered Putin rival In fear or in jail: Telling the truth in Russia Navalny: Russia's jailed but vociferous Putin critic Mr Nemtsov was a fierce adversary of President Putin.His murder in 2015 is the highest-profile political killing since Mr Putin came to power.The authorities deny any involvement. Two years later, Mr Mints' former investment company O1 Group ""found itself in an open conflict against Central Bank of Russia"", he said, with legal proceedings starting across several different jurisdictions. ""When things like this start to happen, it is a clear signal that one should leave the country immediately,"" he said. He remains the subject of current legal action by the Kremlin. It is because of such action that Mr Mints suggests the ""bravest step available"" for wealthy Russians who dislike Mr Putin is to ""go silently into exile"", citingthe case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky,who was once Russia's wealthiest man, but was jailed for almost a decade on charges of fraud and tax evasion which, he says, were politically motivated. Boris Mints worked for Boris Yeltsin's (right) government, but was sacked by Vladimir Putin (left) days into his tenure Two of the country's most prominent oligarchs Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska stopped short of direct criticism of Mr Putin when they made separate calls for peace in Ukraine. Mr Fridman, a billionaire banker, saidany personal remarks could be a risk not just to himself but also to staff and colleagues. However, Mr Mints has been joined by Russian tycoonOleg Tinkov, founder of Tinkoff Bank and former owner of cycling team Tinkoff-Saxo, in lambasting the invasion. Mr Mints called President Putin's actions ""vile"", saying the invasion was ""the most tragic event in recent history, not only of Ukraine and Russia, but globally"". He also compared it to Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Russian tycoon lambasts country's 'massacre' Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Oligarch who said sanctions won't help is frozen out ""This war is a result of madness and hunger for power of a single person, Vladimir Putin, supported by his inner circle,"" said Mr Mints, who was chairman of one of the largest pension asset managers in Russia until 2018. The BBC has contacted the Kremlin for comment. Mr Mints was first introduced to Mr Putin in the early 1990s but only properly spoke with him on 2 January 2000, two days after Mr Putin was appointed acting president of Russia. Mr Mints, who worked under former Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, was keen to discuss his plans to reform local government to grow Russia's democracy into the 21st Century. ""Mr Putin listened to my suggestions without commenting or arguing. The following day, Putin sacked me,"" he said. He knew then that Mr Putin's vision for his country was ""miles away"" from the previous administration's. Leaving politics, Mr Mints started a stock brokerage for individual clients three years later. Mr Mints has not been sanctioned by the UK government, unlike other Russian businessmen who have been identified as having close links to the Kremlin. However, his name did appear on aso-called ""Putin list""released by the US in 2018. Out of 210 names, 114 of them were listed as being in the government or linked to it, or key businessmen. The other 96, which included Mr Mints,were listed as oligarchs,externalapparently determined more by the fact they were worth more than $1bn (Â£710m) at the time, rather than their close ties to the Kremlin. The father-of-four made Forbes' world billionaires list in 2017 with a total wealth of $1.3bn, before he dropped off in 2018. Boris Mints has criticised his country's invasion of Ukraine But he dismissed suggestions that he was an oligarch. ""Not every Russian entrepreneur is pro-Putin, and likewise neither is every wealthy Russian person an 'oligarch',"" he said. ""In Russia, the term means a business leader who is very connected to Putin and most of whose wealth, or the profits of their businesses, depend on co-operation with the Russian state. ""Russia is not only an oilfield with an aluminium mine in the centre,"" he added. ""It is a country of 140 million people. People there as everywhere else have their needs and these needs are not at all different from those here in the West."" Now living in the UK, Mr Mints, a keen art collector, feels comfortable without the need for extra security to keep himself and his family safe in Britain, and has no current ambition to move back to Russia.

John MacKinnon, 47, died after a gun was fired ata property in Teangue, on Skye, on Wednesday morning. A 32-year-old woman had earlier been injured in an incident about eight miles away (13km) in Tarskavaig.

In a statement, his family said: ""John was a loving husband, father of six, brother, uncle and grandfather to his family, and was a much-loved member of the community. ""John loved the outdoors, was a keen motorcyclist and, as a loved father, shared his activities with his family."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said everyone in Scotland would be thinking of the communities affected. Speaking as she visited a church group in Forfar, Angus, on Thursday, she said: ""The kind of incidents that happened yesterday would have been horrific and devastating in any part of the country. ""But the kind of communities we're talking about here are small, close-knit communities and that sense of devastation will be felt even more acutely."" This video can not be played Attacks around Skye have had a ""significant impact"", say police In a briefing on Thursday, Ch Supt Conrad Trickett said the thoughts of Police Scotland were with the families and communities affected by the incidents. He said the 32-year-old woman and 63-year-old man were seriously injured and remained in hospital. And he confirmed that the gun fired in the incidents was a licensed firearm owned by the person who discharged it. Ch Supt Trickett said he wished to reassure the public that the incidents had been dealt with swiftly and professionally by local officers. He said: ""Serious incidents which were witnessed yesterday are extremely rare and I would like to further reassure the local communities that they were dealt with and there is no further threat to local people. ""Local officers who live and work in these communities brought the situation to as swift a conclusion as possible and I thank everyone involved, including colleagues from the Scottish Ambulance Service, for their outstanding efforts in responding to what was a distressing series of incidents."" Police were called to an initial incident in Tarskavaig on Wednesday morning Ch Supt Trickett added: ""The investigation, being led by Police Scotland's major investigation team, is complex and challenging and I would also like to thank the local communities for their understanding and co-operation as we work through our inquiries. ""Given the size of the investigation and the fact we are dealing with a number of different sites, the considerable police presence will remain for the near future. Police from across Skye and also from Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow responded and 50 officers remain in the area. They were initially called to a report of a 32-year-old woman being injured at a property in Tarskavaig, on Skye, shortly before 09:00 on Wednesday. Police were also called to another a property in Teangue on Skye Officers were then called to an incident about eight miles away (13km) in Teangue where police said a gun was fired and Mr MacKinnon died. At about 10:00 police were called to an incident in Dornie, near Kyle of Lochalsh on the west Highland mainland, where a gun was also fired. Keith MacKenzie, of the West Highland Free Press newspaper, said Mr MacKinnon's death was a shock to the local area of Sleat. He said: ""There is a feeling of sadness for the MacKinnon family having lost a father, brother and husband, and just someone who was a friend to so many people. It is going to hit the community very, very hard."" 09:00 Wednesday: Police are called to a property in Tarskavaig after reports of a woman having been seriously injured. She is taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow for treatment 09:30: A gun is fired at a property eight miles (13km) away in Teangue.

John Don Mackenzie and Fay Mackenzie are injured - Mr Mackenzie seriously 17:54: Police Scotland say a 39-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incidents Ian Blackford, SNP MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, described it as a ""very, very dark period"" for Skye and Lochalsh. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""These are small communities where everybody tends to know everyone and there is a real sense of shock."" Mr Blackford praised the response of the emergency services and Highland Council to the incidents. Kate Forbes, Scottish finance secretary and MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said close-knit communities had been ""shattered to our core"". John Finlayson, Highland councillor for Skye and Raasay, said his thoughts were with families and communities affected. Mr Finlayson said: ""I've never known tragedy like this and there's two communities that have been affected here - one on Skye and one on the mainland. ""So, it's a sad day, it's a tragic day, and it's a very tough day for us all."" Hamish Fraser, of Broadford and Strath community council on Skye, said the events of Wednesday were unheard of in living memory and the shockwaves would be felt across local communities for weeks and months. The rescue operation saw multiple ambulances, air ambulances and special rapid retrieval emergency teams, which are only summoned for incidents in rural locations when people are in critical need of medical attention. Police were later called to an incident in Dornie, near Kyle of Lochalsh By Isla Todd, BBC Reporter in Skye The west coast and Skye is known more as a tourist destination than a crime scene. Speaking to locals in Dornie, where one of the incidents took place, it was clear it was a tight-knit and close community. Residents told me there's a sense of safety living here, with many confessing they don't always lock their doors at night. In Skye, there is shock around the violence of the incidents with residents left reeling by the emerging details of what happened. A local Free Church minister told me he was opening the church this evening for anyone who needs to talk, find their faith, or come together as a community.

NHS IT services held hostage by ransomware hackersIts IT provider says it may take three or four weeks to fully recover from the cyber-attack.Technology,"A cyber-attack on a major IT provider of the NHS has been confirmed as a ransomware attack. Advanced, which provides digital services like patient check-in and NHS 111, says it may take three to four weeks to fully recover. Ransomware hackers take control of IT systems, steal data and demand a payment from victims to recover. The NHS insists that disruption is minimal, but Advanced would not say whether NHS data had been stolen. The Birmingham-based firm says it first spotted the hack at 07:00 BST on 4 August and immediately took steps to contain the hackers. It is now working to restore services. The company refused to say if it was in negotiations with hackers or paying a ransom to them. In a statement, it said: ""We are rebuilding and restoring impacted systems in a separate and secure environment."" This video can not be played Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work? An NHS England spokesperson said: ""While Advanced has confirmed that the incident impacting their software is ransomware, the NHS has tried and tested contingency plans in place including robust defences to protect our own networks, as we work with the National Cyber Security Centre to fully understand the impact. ""The public should continue to use NHS services as normal, including NHS 111 for those who are unwell, although some people will face longer waits than usual. ""As ever, if it is an emergency, please call 999."" An NHS psychiatrist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC the attack left his team ""making clinical decisions nearly blind"". ""If a new patient came to us, we weren't able to read their history or know very much about them,"" he said. ""The [local] trust are doing their best at setting up an alternative system, they've got a way that we can look at some historical notes now, and have set up another system to mean that we can input new notes. ""But there's still basically a week's worth of notes that we can't access. We've been told to be ready for it to not be up and running for who knows how long."" At the end of last week, family doctors in London were warned by NHS England they could see an increased number of patients sent to them by NHS 111 because of the ""significant technical issue"", industry magazine Pulse reported. Advanced initially said that only a ""small number of servers"" had been affected and that it might be able to recover in a week. Products which have been affected include Adastra, which is used by NHS 111 service, and Caresys and Carenotes, which provide the backbone for care home services like patient notes and visitor booking. The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, says it is working with Advanced to help it recover. A spokesman said: ""Ransomware is the key cyber-threat facing the UK, and all organisations should take immediate steps to limit risk by following our advice on how to put in place robust defences to protect their networks."" Ransomware hackers are usually financially motivated and part of large, professionally run criminal gangs that target companies and demand hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of pounds in ransom in the form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While it is hard to trace where the gangs are based, analysis suggests that 74% of all money made through ransomware attacks in 2021went to Russia-linked hackers.

"Revenge porn blackmailer who took Â£90,000 jailed","Zehshan Mahmood, 30, threatened to share intimate pictures and videos of two women, police say A man who threatened to share intimate pictures and videos of two women and blackmailed them has been jailed. Zehshan Mahmood, from Preston, admitted two counts of blackmail and three counts of disclosing sexual photos or films with intent to cause distress. Two victims sent the 30-year-old nearly Â£90,000 over three years to avoid the images being shared but he posted some of them online anyway, police said. Mahmood was sentenced to seven years and three months. During the trial at Preston Crown Court one victim told of how she had disclosed private pictures and videos to Mahmood in 2017. In January 2018, he told her that he was in financial difficulty and pressured her to send him money. Later he contacted her on Instagram under an alias and threatened her - demanding that she send him more money or he would share the private pictures and videos online, police said. He also made threats against her family so she sent Mahmood around Â£20,000. The second victim told the court she had disclosed to Mahmood an intimate sexual experience she had with a boyfriend. Mahmood then claimed he had a video of the incident and demanded Â£7,000 from her or he would send the video to her family and friends. In addition, Mahmood demanded that the victim send intimate pictures, videos and texts of a sexual nature. If she did not do this, he threatened to increase the fee, the court heard. The defendant told the victim that he needed money to stop the videos from being published and the blackmail was part of his involvement in an organised crime group. Detectives said Mahmood later created more fake Instagram accounts, which he used to message the victim and convince her that his claim was real so that she would continue sending sexual content and money to him. The victim sent Mahmood in excess of Â£66,000 over three years. Despite the money handed over, Mahmood posted the videos he had received of the victim online and encouraged users to share it, police said. Mahmood was arrested in February 2021 as part of a joint effort between Greater Manchester Police and Lancashire Police. Det Con Luke Brundrett said he had ""operated a web of lies and manipulated the victims to get exactly what he wanted, when he wanted"", adding that the sentence was ""much deserved"".

'We never knew our home was on the scammers' list',"Kay and Ben live on an Oldham street where almost every resident has been targeted by the scam Thousands of households have had their addresses unknowingly used by crime gangs to register bogus companies, a BBC investigation has revealed. BBC Radio 4's You and Yoursfound about 150,000 had been registered and in some streets, every home had been targeted. The residents have then had to deal with overdrafts, loans, insurance demands and credit card debts. A Companies House spokesman said there were currently ""no legal powers to verify or validate"" a firm's details. Most of those affected have been targeted by organised crime gangs, who have registered companies at addresses across the whole of the UK. The homeowners only found out when post from Companies House, HMRC and banks arrived addressed to the businesses. One street in Oldham saw companies set up at almost all the addresses on a single day. They all had cleaning, build, construct or deliver in the title, they all had a single director and they were all set up on 27 May this year. Kay and Ben, who live on the street, said they first started to get letters from various parties about a company at their address by the end of May. Kay said she had ""rung every single one of them and said this company is not at this address"", but had not yet heard if any details had been changed by those sending out the letters. She said she was told to report it to Companies House, but that agency had written to her to inform her that those who had registered the firm would be given 28 days to object before her address was removed. ""We've lived in this house since it was built, so we know full well that this hasn't just been a mistake,"" she said. ""This had been purposely done."" David, from Oxford, began to worry when he started receiving letters addressed to a name he did not recognise One of their neighbours, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had had letters about more than one company being registered to her address. ""I had two letters from Inland Revenue, which I put back in the postbox with 'not at this address' on and I had four from Companies House,"" she said. ""Companies House made me fill in a form, which was a load of rigmarole, and I'm still waiting to hear from them. ""I just sent them a council tax bill and hoped that was enough."" David, who lives in Oxford, was similarly targeted. He said he began to worry when he started receiving letters addressed to a name he did not recognise. ""We started returning them with 'not known at this address', but they kept coming,"" he said. He said the company director named on the letters then received documents from Companies House, correspondence from HMRC ""and then offers of bank accounts from finance companies that have not done any checking for money laundering or fraud"". New property register aims to stop money laundering Companies House rejects 800 potentially offensive names Fake directors plan to combat money laundering A search of the Companies House website revealed his neighbours had also had their addresses used to register bogus firms without their knowledge. David said he was ""horrified"" at the extent of the scam, adding: ""It did seem to me that the rules that Companies House operates under would encourage huge numbers of these."" He added that Companies House needed to change ""their basic rules and check the legitimacy of a company's registered address"" and start to take immediate action whenever a problem is identified. The process of registering a company is a straightforward one, as it costs Â£12 to register a firm and takes about 20 minutes. Usually, the company will be able to operate within 24 hours and there are no checks on who has made the registration. Financial crime expert Graham Barrow said it was ""quite hard to describe how bad and how enormous this problem is"". He believes about a fifth of all the companies set up in the UK in the last year were fraudulent. All of them have one thing in common; no economic value. A spokesman said Companies House was aware of the issue and ""recognises the difficulties faced by those affected"" He said they were being set up to fleece either banks or government institutions such as HMRC, and leaving innocent homeowners with bills they could never have seen coming. ""It's a common misunderstanding that people think Companies House is some sort of regulated government organisation,"" he said. ""It's a register which was set up in 1844 to be a register of companies and it has absolutely zero mandate to do any checking on any of the information."" He said the current system was ""madness"" and ""completely the wrong way round"". ""It should be check on the way in, not on the way out. ""I know it is only Â£12 [to register], but it's a lot of time and effort and people don't do that for the sake of their health, they're doing it for a very specific and criminal reason."" If you have been affected by this scam and would like to share your story, contact You and Yours by email atyouandyours@bbc.co.uk,external. The Companies House spokesman said it carried out checks to ensure filings were complete, but ""at present, the Registrar of Companies has no legal powers to verify or validate the information which is delivered to her"". ""Provided a document appears to meet the requirement to be properly delivered, the Registrar must register it,"" he said. He said Companies House was aware of the misuse of the register and ""recognises the difficulties faced by those affected by this"". ""Where potential criminal activity is identified, Companies House works closely with law enforcement agencies to refer matters and support investigations,"" he said. He added that to help tackle this type of abuse, the government had recently consulted on ""significantly enhancing the role and powers of the Registrar"" and had ""publisheda White Paper outlining reforms,external"". ""In combination, they will significantly strengthen the Registrar's ability to know who is forming and running companies and will allow her to query information companies send her where she has reason to believe it is suspicious, misleading or fraudulent,"" he said. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said the UK had ""some of the strongest controls in the world to combat money laundering, and it's vital that we continue to upgrade our governance to crack down on criminals"". He said the forthcoming Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill would help to ""prevent fraudulent appointments by introducing identity verification"" and give Companies House powers to ""check, challenge and decline any dubious information"". He added that the changes would ensure ""any fraudulent addresses can be struck off"" and ""relieve householders whose addresses have been hijacked from suffering further through a lengthy administrative or court process"".

"Burglary, robbery and theft victims denied justice","Most victims of burglary, robbery and theft in England and Wales are not being given the justice they deserve, the police watchdog says. Her majesty's chief inspector of constabulary, Andy Cooke, calls current low charge rates ""unacceptable and unsustainable"". Some forces tackle these crimes well - but many do not, his report says. One car-theft victim told BBC News officers had closed his case within 24 hours, without visiting the scene. Stefan Borson says his Â£82,000 Range Rover car was stolen from outside his home, in the early evening on Valentine's Day. He notified the police immediately, found pictures of the theft on his own security camera, and waited for officers to be in touch. Stefan Borson (R) told BBC News his six-month-old Range Rover had been stolen from outside his home, in London He was therefore astonished to receive a letter, dated the next day, telling him: ""We are sorry to say that with the evidence and leads available, it is unlikely that it would be possible to identify those responsible. ""We have therefore closed this case."" CCTV footage from Stefan's home shows the Range Rover just before it was stolen They had not called round, Stefan says, and it would be unlikely they had visited the crime scene without knocking on the door. They did not check his or his neighbours' cameras or the vehicle's tracking record as it was driven away. ""I'm not sure on what basis they could have said they've investigated all potential leads,"" he adds. Woman tracks down her own stolen car before police Liquid-with-code could help reduce home burglaries The crimes least likely to be solved The report, based on findings from force inspections by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) in 2021-22, highlights while some tackle these crimes effectively, others: miss opportunities to identify and catch offenders, at all stages from when a crime is first reported fail to give victims advice on crime-scene preservation during the initial call - in 71% of the cases examined lack investigative capacity and experience, made worse by a national detective shortage fail to supervise investigations properly - in a third of cases The report comes soon afterthe most recent Home Office figures,externalshowed just 6.3% of robbery offences and 4.1% of thefts in England and Wales resulted in charges, in the year to March. Too often forces' digital, forensic, technological and analytical capability is not good enough to let them carry out thorough investigations, the report says. They must improve their approach to serious acquisitive crime - offences such as personal robbery, theft from a person, theft of and from a motor vehicles and domestic burglary. And by March 2023, all police forces must ensure: burglary, theft and robbery crime scenes are managed according to national standards investigations are effectively supervised and directed ""Burglary, robbery and theft are not minor crimes,"" Mr Cooke says. ""There needs to be a concerted drive to address this issue because it directly affects the public's confidence in the police's ability to keep them safe."" A lack of experienced officers too often means these crimes are investigated poorly and inadequately supervised, ""often because supervisors themselves are inexperienced and overstretched"", he says. And many detectives feel ""disengaged and devalued and frustrated that they can't give the quality of service that the victims deserve"". One woman told BBC News in May she was threatened with a crowbar after feeling forced to track down her own car after it was stolen National Police Chiefs' Council acquisitive crime lead Deputy Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman said they would look at the findings in detail ""and work to assist forces in implementing improvements"". ""We absolutely recognise how invasive and traumatic it is to be a victim of these serious offences,"" she added. College of Policing chief executive Chief Constable Andy Marsh said the report was ""absolutely right to recommend the full adoption of existing national standards"". ""Only by taking a consistent approach will we fully protect the public and not let burglars off the hook,"" he added. How have you been affected by any of the issues raised here?

"Era of â¬10 flights is over, says Ryanair boss","Ryanair won't be offering flights at rock bottom prices any more thanks to the soaring cost of fuel, the budget airline's boss has admitted. Chief executive Michael O'Leary says the era of the â¬10 ticket is over. The airline's average fare would rise from around â¬40 (Â£33.75) last year to roughly â¬50 over the next five years, he told the BBC. But he says he believes people will continue to fly frequently, despite the rising cost of living. ""There's no doubt that at the lower end of the marketplace, our really cheap promotional fares - the one euro fares, the â¬0.99 fares, even the â¬9.99 fares - I think you will not see those fares for the next number of years,"" Mr O'Leary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The rise in fuel costs that is pushing up air fares, is also raising household energy bills, eating into people's disposable incomes. But the airline boss said, despite that, he expects customers to seek out lower-cost options rather than cut back on flights. ""We think people will continue to fly frequently. But I think people are going to become much more price sensitive and therefore my view of life is that people will trade down in their many millions."" As airfares have become cheaper in recent decades, the number of flights taken has risen, with more people taking short breaks abroad, on top of an annual holiday. Airlines like Ryanair, Easyjet, Vueling and Wizz Air have competed to offer low-cost no-frills services. Commercial flights now account for about 2.4% of global CO2 emissions, and the sector is facing pressure to reduce its impact on the climate, including campaigns to persuade people to switch to rail and road travel. However, Mr O'Leary argued road transport and shipping were bigger contributors of CO2 overall, and said the focus on reducing emissions from air travel was ""misplaced"". He said Ryanair was investing in more fuel efficient aircraft, but that greater reductions in fossil fuel use would come from the switch from petrol and diesel to electric road vehicles. Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? Ryanair hits out at airports: 'They had one job' Ryanair boss wants post-Brexit immigration rethink In the wake of the Covid pandemic, which severely disrupted international travel, people have proved eager to get back on board flights. But as demand for air travel has bounced back, staff shortages at airlines and airports have lead to delays and cancellations, in the UK and abroad. Some passengers have been forced to wait for hours, or reschedule travel at the last minute. Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had managed the situation better than other airlines because it had been ""part lucky and part brave"" in its decision to start recruiting and training cabin crew and pilots last November when the Omicron variant was still affecting international travel. In the first six months of 2022, Ryanair cancelled 0.3% of flights, compared with British Airways' total of 3.5%, and Easyjet's 2.8%, according to air travel consultancy OAG. Mr O'Leary said he had ""very little sympathy"" for the airports, saying they knew schedules months in advance and that security staff, which are the responsibility of the airports, required less training than pilots. He accused Heathrow, which has capped the number of passengers coming to the airport over the summer, of ""mismanagement"". Mr O'Leary said he was ""hopeful"" the problems at UK airports would be resolved by next summer, but said Brexit could continue to create challenges when recruiting staff. Heathrow has previously defended the cap, saying it was necessary to provide a reliable and safe service. Publishing its latest traffic figures on Thursday the airport said the cap was working and that July had seen ""improvements to passenger experience"" - with fewer last minute cancellations and better aircraft punctuality and baggage handling. It said 88% of passengers were now clearing security in 20 minutes or less. It added that 1,300 people had been hired at the airport since last November, and that ""security resource is back at pre-pandemic levels"". The Airports Operators Association has said airports in general have been recruiting staff since late last year and most passengers are now travelling with no, or minimal, disruption. Ryanair is based in Dublin, but operates hundreds of routes in and out of the UK. Britain's departure from the EU had proved to be a ""disaster for the free movement of labour"" Mr O'Leary said said and called on the government to ""be honest and own up"" that it was the cause of worker shortages. The UK labour market was ""fundamentally broken"" Mr O'Leary said and argued it was time for the UK to consider reversing ""some of the stupidity of Brexit"". He said the priority for the next UK prime minister should be to sign a free trade deal with the EU, including free movement of labour.

"Â£90,000 revenge porn blackmailer jailed","Zehshan Mahmood, 30, threatened to share intimate pictures and videos of two women, police say A man who threatened to share intimate pictures and videos of two women and blackmailed them has been jailed. Zehshan Mahmood, from Preston, admitted two counts of blackmail and three counts of disclosing sexual photos or films with intent to cause distress. Two victims sent the 30-year-old nearly Â£90,000 over three years to avoid the images being shared but he posted some of them online anyway, police said. Mahmood was sentenced to seven years and three months. During the trial at Preston Crown Court one victim told of how she had disclosed private pictures and videos to Mahmood in 2017. In January 2018, he told her that he was in financial difficulty and pressured her to send him money. Later he contacted her on Instagram under an alias and threatened her - demanding that she send him more money or he would share the private pictures and videos online, police said. He also made threats against her family so she sent Mahmood around Â£20,000. The second victim told the court she had disclosed to Mahmood an intimate sexual experience she had with a boyfriend. Mahmood then claimed he had a video of the incident and demanded Â£7,000 from her or he would send the video to her family and friends. In addition, Mahmood demanded that the victim send intimate pictures, videos and texts of a sexual nature. If she did not do this, he threatened to increase the fee, the court heard. The defendant told the victim that he needed money to stop the videos from being published and the blackmail was part of his involvement in an organised crime group. Detectives said Mahmood later created more fake Instagram accounts, which he used to message the victim and convince her that his claim was real so that she would continue sending sexual content and money to him. The victim sent Mahmood in excess of Â£66,000 over three years. Despite the money handed over, Mahmood posted the videos he had received of the victim online and encouraged users to share it, police said. Mahmood was arrested in February 2021 as part of a joint effort between Greater Manchester Police and Lancashire Police. Det Con Luke Brundrett said he had ""operated a web of lies and manipulated the victims to get exactly what he wanted, when he wanted"", adding that the sentence was ""much deserved"".

Disney overtakes Netflix in battle for subscribers,"Disney will launch a new ad-supported streaming service in the US in December, as it overtakes Netflix in the race for subscribers. The firm said it had 221.1 million subscriptions across its three streaming platforms as of 2 July. That contrasts with rival Netflix which has been losing customers. But Disney warned that its loss of streaming rights for cricket in India would reduce its subscriber growth compared to previous forecasts. The firm, which also owns general audience television platform Hulu and the sports-focused ESPN+, said demand for its Disney+ product remained strong. Young people cut back on video streaming services Netflix trials charging $2.99 for shared accounts Amazon raises Prime subscription price Pandemic lockdowns provided a boost to streaming services like Disney, but the easing of Covid restrictions doesn't seem to be preventing it attracting new customers. The company added 14.4 million Disney+ accounts in the quarter, many of them outside of the US - far more than analysts had expected. Later this year it will launch a new ad-funded service, which will still be charged at the current subscription rate of $7.99. The charge for the ad-free service will rise to $10.99 per month. The firm plans to launch its ad-funded service outside the US next year. Executives said they do not expect the rise in prices to put off customers over the long term. The firm is also seeing strong interest from companies hoping to advertise on the new service, they said. ""We are in a position of strength with record upfront advertising commitment,"" chief executive Bob Chapek told analysts in a conference call to discuss the firm's financial results. Disney's subscriber gains have come at a hefty cost, with its streaming business losing $1.1bn in the quarter. Executives said they expect losses to peak this year, In the meantime, a strong rebound in attendance at its theme parks since the worst of the pandemic has provided the firm with a large financial cushion. Total revenues in the April-June period jumped 26% from last year, pushing profits to $1.5bn. Shares in the company jumped more than 6% in after-hours trade after the firm shared its results. Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, called it a ""pivotal moment in the streaming wars"" saying Disney had more room to grow than arch-rival Netflix. Netflix lost nearly one million accounts in the most recent quarter, putting its membership total at 220.67 million. That is just behind Disney at more than 221 million subscriptions. Disney counts each subscription to a streaming platform separately, meaning customers who pay for more than one service are counted more than once. ""[The results] firmly underline my belief that Disney is at a different phase of growth to Netflix,"" said Mr Pescatore. ""There are still millions of users to acquire as it continues to expand into new markets and rolls out new blockbuster shows.""

'I was put in a children's home 250 miles from my family',"Many vulnerable young people from across the UK have ended up in children's homes in Blackpool in the past few years. But the approach - in part because of a national shortage of places elsewhere - is raising concerns. Thanks to the pandemic, staycation tourists have flocked back to the Lancashire resort over the past two summers. Alongside the familiar Pleasure Beach and amusement arcades is a smart new California-style beach cafe. But few visitors will have noticed that, at the same time, Blackpool has taken on a new status - as an epicentre of children's homes. Blackpool already has the highest proportion of its own children in care in England - but with property in the resort town being relatively cheap, and with a surge in the national demand for places, some local providers have expanded rapidly. BBC analysis of the latest Ofsted data shows of the 39 children's homes in the two Blackpool parliamentary constituencies, 29 have been registered only since 2016. As a result, children have been sent from across the country to children's homes in Blackpool and adjacent areas. Jade, 21, from London, was placed in a home just outside the town when she was 16 and stayed there for 18 months. Jade kept away from the centre of Blackpool at night She recalls how she ""burst out in tears"" when she arrived because her family were hundreds of miles away. ""I'm thinking: 'How am I going to see my mum? How am I going to see my sisters?' I didn't even have a phone at this point."" Blackpool is one of the most deprived towns in England and a focus of the Johnson government's levelling-up agenda. Behind the seafront are shabby streets of run-down houses. Rates of mental illness and drug abuse are high.According to the Health Foundation,external, both men and women in Blackpool have the lowest healthy life expectancy in the UK. During her time in the resort, Jade learned to avoid the town centre at night, when she says she would see drunks and drug users. ""In the summertime it's nice, it's touristy - but night-time hits and it's a different land,"" she says. ""It's a kind of chaos, not fun chaos - it's [a case of] be aware, be very vigilant."" Clive Grunshaw, the former Labour Lancashire Police and Crime Commissioner, warns that Blackpool was not the right place to send vulnerable young people from other parts of the country. He says there is a ""significant demand"" for drugs in the town and that so-called county lines gangs from Merseyside, Manchester, even London, send operatives to sell there - using ""extreme violence"" to control their share of the trade. The young people in children's homes have often already been in traumatic situations, he says. ""And then you leave them unsupported in a place where there could be issues of anti-social behaviour and criminality, the last role models you'd like to see them mix with."" Joe was also sent to a children's home in the heart of Blackpool aged 16. He describes himself back then as ""a tiny kid"". Though he was from Preston, only 20 miles away, he says he felt very isolated and unsafe by the sea. He recalls there were five other children's homes near the one in which he lived. He says the area was full of ""crackheads, prostitutes and drugs"" and he was frequently attacked. ""I've been jumped, I've been chased, I've had knives pulled on meâ¦ I've had everything done to me."" Joe says he felt unsafe in Blackpool Erin, who is now 18, was in a different home not far from Joe's. She says some of the girls being looked after with her would take drugs and sleep with older men. ""I was just so paranoid. I didn't go out by myself, ever,"" she adds. Almost all the children's homes in Blackpool are run by private companies. Increasingly, such companies own and manage homes across England. Children remain the responsibility of their local authority, but the homes look after the young people day-to-day. The fact that so many children are being moved far away from their neighbourhoods should ""ring alarm bells"", says Katharine Sacks-Jones, CEO of Become, the national charity for children in care and young care leavers. But Blackpool Council has no control over how many children are placed in the town from other authorities - or how far from home they are. Although it is starting flex the powers it does have. The council must grant planning permission to new homes for children up to the age of 16, and, in recent years, with ever more applications, local residents have started to object strongly. In 2019 for example, in a road in the north of the town, local company Outbound Care applied for permission to turn a semi-detached bungalow into a care home for two young people. Local people protested. One neighbour wrote they were ""absolutely distraught"" at the thought of young displaced people with ""behavioural problems"" living so close them. The application was withdrawn but two more followed, with neighbours objecting on each occasion. At the same time, Blackpool Council decided to change its planning rules. A child on a bike near Blackpool Pleasure Beach It refused to approve new applications within 400 metres of existing children's homes. The policy however - formally adopted in 2021 - may only cover Ofsted-registered homes as the council does not need to be notified about supported accommodation for looked after children and care leavers aged 16-17. The town's head of planning said it was important to ""try and stem the flow of vulnerable youngsters into the borough from outside"". That sentiment has been echoed by the Conservative MP for Blackpool North and Cleveleys, Paul Maynard - the most outspoken local critic of the local ""proliferation"" of children's homes. He was one of those who objected to Outbound Care's plans to change the bungalow in north Blackpool into a children's home. Outbound Care was only incorporated in 2017, according to Companies House records. Ofsted data shows it has five children's homes  in the Blackpool area - one was registered in 2017, four in 2019. But by far the biggest operator in the Blackpool area is Sandcastle Care, which was originally founded in 2003 - but taken over in 2015 by a local entrepreneur, Darren Yates. Darren Yates (left) has a love of horse racing ""If you're talking about children's homes [in Blackpool], people think Sandcastle immediately,"" says Mr Maynard. He says the care provider has been successful in its own terms but he questions whether the company has benefitted the town or the young, vulnerable residents of its homes. Darren Yates, a joiner turned property developer and racehorse owner, expanded Sandcastle Care from three homes to 53 - almost all in Blackpool and adjacent areas - before selling the company to Waterland Private Equity. Specialist accountant Andrew Rome estimates the sale price would have been about Â£20m. Mr Yates resigned from the boards of Sandcastle's holding companies last year. We twice asked Mr Yates for an interview to discuss the rapid expansion of Sandcastle Care and local opposition to some of the homes. He didn't respond. The great majority of Sandcastle homes are rated ""good"" or ""outstanding"" by Ofsted and the company told us it was ""committed to serving the best interests of the young people"" entrusted into its care. It said 70% of the children it cares for at the moment are from local authorities in the north-west of England. Joe, Jade and Erin were not in homes run by Sandcastle or Outbound Care. While Ofsted data shows five new homes were opened in Blackpool in the financial year from 2021, the council told us its new policy of tighter planning rules is now having an effect. In a statement it said that ""so far this year we have not received any applications for new homes."" âWe tried 225 childrenâs homes, none would take herâ âAbuse, assault, profitâ - childcare staff speak out Children 'not kept safe' at council-run home Mr Maynard says he welcomes the council's efforts, though he's concerned the policy may drive children's homes' applications into adjacent areas with similar housing stock. Part of his constituency spreads out several miles north from Blackpool. ""I would urge councils from outside Blackpool to think twice over sending their children here merely because that's where the capacity happens to be. ""They clearly have the interests of those vulnerable young people first and foremost in their minds - find the right location for them."" But it's hard for councils to do that when they have little, if any choice. Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, says there needs to be control and oversight over who can own and run children's homes. She adds: ""We have companies now in the market who really don't have very much interest in childcare, sometimes buying and selling homes or groups of homes quite rapidly and building groups of homes in specific areas that aren't necessarily where the children who most need those places live or even close to where they live."" Ofsted's latest report on the sector, published last month, said there was a significant shortage of places in children's homes and that some children were living ""in places where their needs couldn't be met"". The Department for Education said it was working closely with Ofsted to explore additional new powers that would strengthen its regulatory ability. The government will also respond later this year to recommendations on revising legislation to improve market oversight from both the Independent Care Review and the Competition and Markets Authority.

Extreme heat alert in place for parts of UK,"An amber extreme heat warning has come into force, with temperatures forecast to hit 37C (99F) in some parts of the UK over the next four days. The Met Office alert for southern and central England and parts of Wales runs from midnight on Thursday until Sunday. It has also issued its highest alert for fire severity over the weekend, warning there is an ""exceptional"" risk of blazes spreading in many places. The highest temperature on Thursday was 34.2C, at Wiggonholt in West Sussex. Firefighters have urged the public to help them prevent fires. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Jonathan Smith said he wanted to avoid scenes in July ""where people lost their homes and livelihoods"". ""In the first week of August last year, we attended 42 grassland and wildland fires, the same week this year we've attended 340,"" he said. ""Please don't barbecue in open spaces or balconies, throw your rubbish away safely and put your cigarettes out properly."" Mr Smith also warned people against using barbecues on balconies, saying they could lead to hot ash moving ""very quickly"". In some areas, wildfires have broken out due to the heat. In Ryton, Gateshead, firefighters spent more than 24 hours tackling a fire which started in a field. While the record-breaking temperatures seen in July, when the mercurytopped 40C (104F) for the first time, are not expected this week, the heat in some areas could get close to local or regional records. ""Temperatures won't be as high. But the big difference with this current heatwave is that it's much more prolonged,"" said BBC Weather forecaster Matt Taylor. ""We've already seen temperatures above 30C every day this week - Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday - and that will continue until Sunday."" Temperatures could reach 35C and peak at 37C in some areas between the Midlands and London, he added. They are also forecast to stay above 33C in some parts of south Wales over the next few days. St Athan recorded a high of 33.2C on Thursday. The high temperatures and dry conditions have also been causing problems across Europe - withmore than 1,000 firefighters battling a ""monster"" wildfire in Francethat has destroyed nearly 7,000 hectares of forest. The Met Office's fire severity index, which assesses how severe a blaze could become, is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. This will rise to ""exceptional"" - the highest level of risk - for parts of England and Wales by the weekend, whilea warning for ""very high"" risk of wildfiresacross southern and eastern Scotland has been put in place until Monday.

'Significant' wildfires but fire services 'coping' This video can not be played WATCH: Weather presenter Stav Danaos explains why the UK is facing an amber heat warning The period between January and June this year wasthe driest in England in 46 years, prompting warnings about the effects on agriculture, nature and wildlife. More than three inches of extra rain, in addition to what would normally be expected, is needed to overcome the dry conditions in parts of southern England, but no rain is forecast any time soon. Analysis by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology found low or even exceptionally low river flows and groundwater levels were likely to continue for the next three months in southern England and Wales. Water companies are being urged to protect essential supplies into a dry autumn, and three firms have already implemented hosepipe bans.

The company, with 15 million customers across London and the Thames Valley,was forced on Wednesday to hand out bottled waterfor residents in the village of Northend in Oxfordshire after supplies were disrupted due to a technical issue at a local reservoir. Elsewhere, drinks breaks are to be implemented during Premier League fixtures this weekend to help footballers in the hot weather. Water levels have severely dropped exposing the unseen trees and rocks at Cornwall's largest lake and reservoir, Colliford Lake Water companies have faced criticism for bringing in hosepipe bans while just under 3 billion litres (660 million gallons) of water is lost to leaks every day in England and Wales - equivalent to 1,180 Olympic swimming pools. Stuart Colville from Water UK said there were ""hundreds of people out today and across the week"" fixing leaks, adding that leakage was currently at its lowest level on record. He said it was a ""constant battle"" fixing leaks, particularly in hot and dry conditions when soil dries, moves and puts pressure on pipes ""causing additional bursts"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Colville said it was looking ""increasingly inevitable"" that the Environment Agency would declare a drought in England. An official droughtis expected to be declared on Friday,according to water industry insiders, meaning the Environment Agency would have more control over water supply. TheWales Drought Liaison group,including environment, health and water professionals, is also looking at the effect of the prolonged dry weather. One farmer in Horsham, Sussex said it had been ""an exceptional year"" and described his land as being like a ""Sussex savannah"". Speaking on BBC Radio 2, David Exwood emphasised the ""extreme risk"" of taking barbecues into the countryside - explaining how hard and dry the ground was. The extreme heat may also cause disruption to train services, but it is not expected to be on the same scale as seen in July. Network Rail is not bringing in a country-wide blanket speed restriction, but some local services might have restrictions with concerns rail temperatures could reach 55C or higher. Meanwhile, people are being advised to look out for those who are older or vulnerable, as well as young children, after the UK Health Security Agency issued a heat health alert until Sunday for parts of central, southern and northern England. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change.

"'Every day it doesn't rain, the pressure mounts'","David Barton says it's been a dry winter, spring and summer on his farm David Barton's fields on his farm in Gloucestershire should be green and full of grazing cattle. Instead the grass has turned yellow, the land is bone-dry, and many of the crops that feed his cows have died. ""Every day that it doesn't rain, every day that it's hot and dry, the pressure mounts,"" he says. As England and Wales enter a heatwave forecast to last until Sunday, these are challenging times for farmers. Experts warn that the extreme weather like the hot and dry conditions in July will inevitably lead to smaller harvests in the UK. This in turn will make the food we buy in the supermarkets even more expensive. This shrivelled seedling should have been feed for David's cows for next winter David, aged 54, is the third generation of his family to work on his farm in Cirencester. He's now resorted to feeding his cattle the food reserved for winter. ""This is fast approaching the worst we've seen,"" he explains. What he needs is rain, but he has no idea when it will come and waiting is an agony, he says. The Met Office says the weather is expected to become cooler next week but there's no guarantee that it will rain across the country. July was thedriest in England since 1935, with many areas seeing far less rainfall than average. After a ""fairly dry winter"", there was some rain in March but not enough for the spring crops, David explains. It was June when it began to get desperate. Holding a withered turnip seedling, he explains: ""It can't sustain itself. There's just not enough moisture, so this crop will probably fail now."" His priority is to keep the livestock shaded and happy, but soon the financial costs will start to ""mount dramatically"". Smaller harvests from the UK's farms will push up the price of food, particularly meat, says Kyle Holland, an analyst at market research company Mintec. Wildlife under stress as dry spell shrinks rivers Global warming increases 'food shocks' threat A really simple guide to climate change Extreme weather globally is affecting agriculture, meaning essential crops are in shorter supply and are more expensive on world markets, too. The war in Ukraine, which is normallythe world's fourth-largest grain exporter, has also caused shortages, pushing prices up yet further. ""It's almost a perfect storm,"" he says. And there's little sign of the pressure lifting soon, he explains, adding that rain in September will be too late for the corn crop that's used to feed farm animals. Climate scientists warn that heatwaves are likely to become more common and more extreme globally. They say that theUK's extreme heat in July would have been ""almost impossible""without human-induced climate change.
